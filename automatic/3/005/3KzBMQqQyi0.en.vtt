right now all I have is a heat
protectant<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.420> last<00:01:36.780> night<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:36.990> washed<00:01:37.350> my

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
protectant and last night I washed my

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.830 
protectant and last night I washed my
hair<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.189> slept<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.600> a

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
hair and I slept on it so I have a

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.510 
hair and I slept on it so I have a
pretty<00:01:40.049> natural<00:01:40.500> wave<00:01:40.740> if<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.040> look<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.369> there

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
pretty natural wave if you look in there

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.030 
pretty natural wave if you look in there
but<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.329> Hot<00:01:42.930> Tools<00:01:43.200> camera<00:01:43.590> really

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
but this Hot Tools camera really

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.219 
but this Hot Tools camera really
enhances<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.000> natural<00:01:45.210> wave<00:01:45.570> which<00:01:46.079> is

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
enhances the natural wave which is

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.469 
enhances the natural wave which is
awesome<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.490> split<00:01:47.759> my<00:01:47.790> hair<00:01:48.000> down<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.299> back

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
awesome so I split my hair down the back

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.960 
awesome so I split my hair down the back
just<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.320> even<00:01:49.560> pieces<00:01:49.920> doesn't<00:01:50.490> matter<00:01:50.610> I

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
just to even pieces doesn't matter I

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.410 
just to even pieces doesn't matter I
grab<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.899> medium<00:01:52.170> piece<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.890> hair<00:01:53.240> not<00:01:54.240> too

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
grab a medium piece of hair not too

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.080 
grab a medium piece of hair not too
thick<00:01:54.720> not<00:01:55.020> too<00:01:55.079> thin<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.399> grab<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.880> taper

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
thick not too thin and I grab the taper

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.179 
thick not too thin and I grab the taper
and<00:01:57.270> iron<00:01:57.390> I'm<00:01:58.079> gonna<00:01:58.320> hold<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.710> taper<00:01:58.950> and

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
and iron I'm gonna hold the taper and

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.030 
and iron I'm gonna hold the taper and
iron<00:01:59.780> parallel<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.960> my<00:02:01.079> face<00:02:01.740> or

iron parallel to my face or
perpendicular<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.090> floor<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:04.170> RAC

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
perpendicular to the floor and I RAC

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.219 
perpendicular to the floor and I RAC
away<00:02:04.829> from<00:02:05.070> my<00:02:05.189> face<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.700> I'm<00:02:05.820> wrapping

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
away from my face so I'm wrapping

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.499 
away from my face so I'm wrapping
towards<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.380> back<00:02:07.530> wall<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:08.069> touch<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.300> hold

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
towards the back wall I touch it I hold

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.880 
towards the back wall I touch it I hold
it<00:02:09.660> on<00:02:09.750> there<00:02:09.899> for<00:02:09.989> about<00:02:10.170> 10<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.530> 20

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
it on there for about 10 to 20

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.470 
it on there for about 10 to 20
seconds<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.580> great<00:02:11.730> thing<00:02:11.880> about<00:02:11.940> all<00:02:12.240> hot

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
seconds the great thing about all hot

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.130 
seconds the great thing about all hot
tools<00:02:12.780> products<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:14.600> really<00:02:15.600> heats<00:02:15.930> up

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
tools products is it really heats up

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.930 
tools products is it really heats up
nicely<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.800> keeps<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.130> consistent<00:02:17.730> heat

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
nicely and keeps a consistent heat

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.580 
nicely and keeps a consistent heat
across<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.540> barrel<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.170> don't<00:02:19.319> have<00:02:19.410> to

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
across the barrel so you don't have to

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.630 
across the barrel so you don't have to
worry<00:02:19.770> about<00:02:19.860> your<00:02:20.069> curl

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
worry about your curl

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.699 
worry about your curl
I'm<00:02:20.700> not<00:02:21.240> curling<00:02:21.630> at<00:02:21.780> each<00:02:21.930> end<00:02:22.230> perfectly

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
I'm not curling at each end perfectly

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.559 
I'm not curling at each end perfectly
and<00:02:23.580> if<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.850> hold<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.120> on<00:02:24.209> there<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.510> just

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
and if you hold it on there and just

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.090 
and if you hold it on there and just
longer<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.230> just<00:02:25.260> get<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.500> more<00:02:25.709> concentrated

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
longer and just get a more concentrated

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.760 
longer and just get a more concentrated
curl<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.450> drop<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.750> curl<00:02:27.959> into<00:02:28.140> my<00:02:28.320> hand

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
curl so you drop the curl into my hand

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.550 
curl so you drop the curl into my hand
you<00:02:29.190> can<00:02:29.370> see<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.670> or<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.000> wave<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:31.410> can

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
you can see that or the wave and you can

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.320 
you can see that or the wave and you can
see<00:02:31.770> what<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.070> perfect<00:02:32.310> wave<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.760> got<00:02:32.910> throw

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
see what a perfect wave you got throw

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.600 
see what a perfect wave you got throw
that<00:02:33.540> two<00:02:33.720> back<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.709> I'm<00:02:35.040> going<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.220> just<00:02:35.370> grab

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
that two back and I'm going to just grab

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.400 
that two back and I'm going to just grab
the<00:02:35.640> next<00:02:35.970> piece<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.630> sometimes<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:37.320> you

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
the next piece and sometimes have you

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.990 
the next piece and sometimes have you
bigger<00:02:37.620> thicker<00:02:37.980> pieces<00:02:38.310> because<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:38.730> really

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
bigger thicker pieces because I really

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.570 
bigger thicker pieces because I really
want<00:02:39.209> this<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.660> be<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.780> natural<00:02:40.560> look<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.100> this

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
want this to be a natural look so this

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.660 
want this to be a natural look so this
piece<00:02:41.819> is<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.000> little<00:02:42.060> bit<00:02:42.270> thicker<00:02:42.480> again

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
piece is a little bit thicker again

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.520 
piece is a little bit thicker again
parallel<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.820> my<00:02:44.940> face<00:02:45.270> but<00:02:45.630> perpendicular<00:02:46.500> to

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
parallel to my face but perpendicular to

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.910 
parallel to my face but perpendicular to
the<00:02:46.709> floor<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.390> touch<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.600> hair<00:02:48.840> just<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.769> see

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
the floor I touch the hair just to see

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.940 
the floor I touch the hair just to see
when<00:02:50.130> it's<00:02:50.280> thoroughly<00:02:50.550> heated<00:02:51.000> up<00:02:51.769> you<00:02:52.769> can

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
when it's thoroughly heated up you can

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.199 
when it's thoroughly heated up you can
see<00:02:54.380> heats<00:02:55.380> up<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:55.890> quickly<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.880> really<00:02:57.120> nice

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
see heats up so quickly the really nice

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.850 
see heats up so quickly the really nice
thing<00:02:57.450> about<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.780> heating<00:02:58.200> so<00:02:58.410> cool<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.709> it

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
thing about it heating so cool is it

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.610 
thing about it heating so cool is it
really<00:02:59.130> sets<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.790> wave<00:03:00.030> really<00:03:00.900> nicely<00:03:01.200> and

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
really sets the wave really nicely and

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.390 
really sets the wave really nicely and
really<00:03:01.950> quickly<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:03.090> find<00:03:03.780> with<00:03:04.050> this<00:03:04.400> one

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
really quickly I find with this one

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.780 
really quickly I find with this one
especially<00:03:05.760> on<00:03:06.480> my<00:03:06.810> waves<00:03:07.250> there<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.370> there's

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
especially on my waves there you there's

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.330 
especially on my waves there you there's
another<00:03:09.120> throw<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.170> back<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:10.590> kind<00:03:11.160> with

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
another throw to the back I kind with

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.880 
another throw to the back I kind with
this<00:03:11.489> wand<00:03:11.790> on<00:03:12.030> my<00:03:12.209> doing<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.110> waves<00:03:13.320> everyday

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
this wand on my doing the waves everyday

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.140 
this wand on my doing the waves everyday
I've<00:03:14.010> been<00:03:14.160> using<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:14.489> every<00:03:14.760> day<00:03:14.790> since<00:03:14.940> I

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
I've been using this every day since I

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.560 
I've been using this every day since I
got<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.650> for<00:03:16.650> perfect<00:03:17.070> waves<00:03:17.579> to<00:03:18.150> go<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.329> work

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
got it for perfect waves to go to work

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.660 
got it for perfect waves to go to work
and<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:19.290> find<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:19.769> can<00:03:19.829> actually<00:03:20.400> get<00:03:20.549> away

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
and I find that I can actually get away

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.660 
and I find that I can actually get away
with<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.209> for<00:03:21.500> two<00:03:22.500> more<00:03:22.739> days<00:03:22.980> after<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.370> curl

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
with it for two more days after I curl

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.420 
with it for two more days after I curl
it<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:23.970> today<00:03:24.660> it'll<00:03:24.810> be<00:03:24.900> really<00:03:25.290> tight<00:03:25.680> not

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
it so today it'll be really tight not

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.100 
it so today it'll be really tight not
really<00:03:26.730> tight<00:03:26.940> but<00:03:27.150> kind<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.540> tight<00:03:27.690> tomorrow

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
really tight but kind of tight tomorrow

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.390 
really tight but kind of tight tomorrow
it'll<00:03:28.380> be<00:03:28.440> looser<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:28.920> by<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.040> third<00:03:29.370> day

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
it'll be looser and by the third day

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.390 
it'll be looser and by the third day
some<00:03:30.299> really<00:03:30.840> nice<00:03:31.079> beachy<00:03:31.470> waves<00:03:31.829> produced

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
some really nice beachy waves produced

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.300 
some really nice beachy waves produced
so<00:03:33.090> actually<00:03:33.900> by<00:03:34.019> using<00:03:34.079> this<00:03:34.590> I'm<00:03:35.100> putting

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
so actually by using this I'm putting

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.699 
so actually by using this I'm putting
less<00:03:35.489> heat<00:03:35.700> on<00:03:35.850> my<00:03:35.970> hair<00:03:36.000> overall<00:03:36.959> so<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:37.530> saw

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
less heat on my hair overall so you saw

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.229 
less heat on my hair overall so you saw
just<00:03:38.010> drop<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.220> into<00:03:38.549> my<00:03:38.640> hand<00:03:38.880> just<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.120> give

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
just drop that into my hand just to give

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.479 
just drop that into my hand just to give
a<00:03:39.299> little<00:03:39.329> bit<00:03:39.570> of<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:39.720> cooling<00:03:40.140> sensation

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
a little bit of a cooling sensation

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.039 
a little bit of a cooling sensation
split<00:03:41.489> this<00:03:41.670> piece<00:03:42.030> into<00:03:42.299> two<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:43.730> again<00:03:45.049> so

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
split this piece into two and again so

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.780 
split this piece into two and again so
wrapping<00:03:46.829> away<00:03:47.489> from<00:03:47.760> my<00:03:47.910> face<00:03:48.239> and

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
wrapping away from my face and

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.280 
wrapping away from my face and
perpendicular<00:03:50.790> to<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.299> floor<00:03:51.480> parallel<00:03:52.019> to

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
perpendicular to the floor parallel to

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
perpendicular to the floor parallel to
my<00:03:53.160> head<00:03:53.750> holding<00:03:54.750> it<00:03:54.840> parallel<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.620> my<00:03:56.130> head

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
my head holding it parallel to my head

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.000 
my head holding it parallel to my head
really<00:03:56.640> gives<00:03:56.850> it<00:03:57.030> that<00:03:57.060> natural<00:03:57.780> wave<00:03:58.019> this

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
really gives it that natural wave this

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.340 
really gives it that natural wave this
is<00:03:59.280> clipless<00:03:59.670> as<00:04:00.060> you've<00:04:00.269> seen<00:04:00.570> so<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:00.870> really

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
stays on the barrel perfectly like I

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.570 
stays on the barrel perfectly like I
said<00:04:33.430> it<00:04:33.520> heats<00:04:33.670> up<00:04:33.820> so<00:04:34.030> fast<00:04:34.270> it's<00:04:35.140> amazing

naturally right in iron off so

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.120 
naturally right in iron off so
everything<00:07:14.750> looks<00:07:14.870> a<00:07:15.080> little<00:07:15.350> bit<00:07:15.620> too<00:07:15.770> tight
