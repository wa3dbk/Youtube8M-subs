00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.019
 hi guys finally here we are with the 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.380
 video I promised 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.990
 it's a kind of tutorial 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.480
 it is a tutorial that you could a 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.949
 my opinion is useful to those who do 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.609
 is approaching the world of cosplay is 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.859
 mainly women for those who 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.510
 they have long hair and so much 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.760
 I think you have seen it even since 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.289
 title to see how to put or not vi 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.829
 let me show you how I put myself 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.170
 wigs at the beginning crazy because 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.110
 how co is not easy when there is hair 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.120
 long and then come back maybe they come to 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.300
 half fair I had the wig here 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.420
 bald seemed a good scene 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.789
 obviously not the only method everyone 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.590
 maybe they find themselves with other myths than me 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:58.250
 I'll show you complement then 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:08.700
 let's see how to become from this to 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:10.049
 so but they start sexy well we see that 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.430
 what we need 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.930
 obviously we need one 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.240
 wig 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.840
 we need a queen for 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:23.030
 Chinese hair 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.740
 hair net I use there are also 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.850
 black I use this but I prefer the 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.160
 color brown the brown color because yes 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.010
 camouflages a little more and then I saw them 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.590
 novelty of pigs like so many bubbles 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.160
 hairpins the first thing I do is ok 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.790
 are already divided we divide the hair into 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.060
 two locks then know if you want 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.840
 you can also use small springs like this 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:54.320
 take a lock this one that is a 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.200
 right and try to make a kind of 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:02.540
 crown going from the opposite side then to 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.399
 left was block with me 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.140
 at the beginning I put one of these 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.140
 hair clips because they have more grip 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:18.530
 and then we go to hairpins because 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.530
 they must stand still 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.380
 after which we press the other lock and 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.560
 it is on the left and we turn it over 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.560
 on the other side 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.599
 she 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.319
 we also affirm here we turn on of 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.319
 run away 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.040
 we specify, however, there is no fear of 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.620
 overdo it you feel like long and ribery 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.890
 he continues, I like, I think even minutes 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.890
 of andrea 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.900
 Hello 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.650
 Hello 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:26.720
 let's do it down to show a species 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:29.840
 of crown so all the hair will do 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.970
 volume on the sides and not in the middle so not 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:37.370
 we will have the bump here and not 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.340
 appesantiranno behind and so did we 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:45.990
 given the wig we now move on to the 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:52.040
 rhythm we will all turn into a trance 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:52.040
 or stop by the front behind it 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.329
 and there are networks in it that have a hole in it 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.180
 high to pass c to pass i 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.700
 hair and then place it behind does not know 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.189
 I prefer these to be closed 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.549
 because they hold by the hair 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:15.109
 then we go to the wig then 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:19.400
 to put it strong that we are in 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:22.820
 drawers to understand what was the front 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.620
 I have to see these two 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.720
 ledges are those that will then go to 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.910
 end up here 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:35.380
 therefore it is the put from behind from which 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:39.040
 go forward so I take these 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:43.470
 two sides that I know will be the front 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.470
 of the parish outside 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:53.120
 I put the wig on but then there's the wig 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:56.810
 my neck and then I pull forward yes 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:01.360
 bears forward and the right latir behind 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:07.659
 Latin front I try to make it stable 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.659
 which remained a project has undergone 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:24.850
 and when it seems to me that it is stable it has 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.850
 forgot my brush 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.550
 when it seems to me to be stable 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.610
 maybe then it will start 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:45.449
 oh my god ok i don't remember how and ha 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.449
 put this word then milk 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.520
 and now non stop jam 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:03.210
 Yup 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:06.840
 then if we want to be even more confident 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:09.180
 we put some of the hairpin here 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.050
 side that takes both the wig and i 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.050
 your hair 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.030
 never 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.150
 ok thank goodness 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:34.450
 and if we also have the tones that 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:40.390
 help to fix the wig because 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:44.770
 when you put them in their place you pizza 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:47.950
 both the wig and your hair and 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.700
 so it is perhaps from it on the other conceals 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:53.710
 I don't remember the side 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.710
 however this is the final result 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:08.600
 I do not see myself well behind combed 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.600
 so maybe still a little disheveled 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:16.110
 so you saw how to put on 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:18.720
 wig with hope you can 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:21.300
 be useful this video story that 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.210
 but I didn't want to zoom in 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.620
 michette I wanted to do my face then it is 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.660
 I almost leave the video 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.120
 of the actual pro I will see to those 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:32.430
 statistics with a peak of 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.320
 visualizations at that point not even 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:37.910
 we also need to come but the mind there 

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:41.160
 I want to say goodbye to the minutes by car and 

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.810
 I hope to make more videos 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.580
 I care about it drove me crazy to 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.890

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.300
