your video capture settings to 90 frames
per<00:00:28.949> second<00:00:29.369> you'll<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.119> click<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
per second you'll have to click the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.030 
per second you'll have to click the
custom<00:00:30.900> one<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:32.450> change<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.780> full<00:00:34.350> size<00:00:34.649> to

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
custom one and change the full size to

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.549 
custom one and change the full size to
half<00:00:35.250> size<00:00:35.690> basically<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.050> does<00:00:37.290> is

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
half size basically what that does is

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.030 
half size basically what that does is
instead<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.489> making<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.940> 1920<00:00:39.719> by<00:00:39.840> 1080<00:00:40.350> it

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
instead of making it 1920 by 1080 it

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.360 
instead of making it 1920 by 1080 it
puts<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:42.000> cuts<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.540> half<00:00:42.750> but<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.950> 90

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
puts it cuts that in half but the 90

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.760 
puts it cuts that in half but the 90
frames<00:00:44.789> per<00:00:45.120> second<00:00:45.510> will<00:00:46.020> bring<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.500> back

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
frames per second will bring that back

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.600 
frames per second will bring that back
up<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.370> its<00:00:47.550> original<00:00:48.110> 1080p<00:00:49.110> quality<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.579> you

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
up to its original 1080p quality so you

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.750 
up to its original 1080p quality so you
do<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:52.160> basically<00:00:53.160> what<00:00:53.640> these

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
do that and basically what these

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.060 
do that and basically what these
settings<00:00:54.030> will<00:00:54.329> do<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.719> allow<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.739> record

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
settings will do is allow you to record

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.180 
settings will do is allow you to record

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
gigabyte file size rather than getting

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.880 
gigabyte file size rather than getting
about<00:01:05.549> 1<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.570> 2<00:01:06.810> minutes<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.290> footage<00:01:07.560> and

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
having a whole 4 gigabytes taken up

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.580 
having a whole 4 gigabytes taken up
doesn't<00:01:12.180> seem<00:01:12.330> like<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.750> big<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.350> difference

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
doesn't seem like that big a difference

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.460 
doesn't seem like that big a difference
but<00:01:14.040> trust<00:01:14.340> me<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.790> also<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.810> don't<00:01:16.140> want

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
but trust me it is also you don't want

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.950 
but trust me it is also you don't want
to<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.369> these<00:01:17.640> three<00:01:18.030> checkboxes<00:01:18.900> here

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
to have these three checkboxes here

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.920 
to have these three checkboxes here
checked<00:01:19.740> because<00:01:20.729> it'll<00:01:21.090> increase<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.720> file

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
checked because it'll increase the file

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.249 
checked because it'll increase the file
size<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.530> even<00:01:22.799> make<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.310> lag<00:01:23.640> here<00:01:24.259> depending

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
size and even make it lag here depending

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.100 
size and even make it lag here depending
