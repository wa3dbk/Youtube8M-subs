00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:17.740
 in the hand we have the sea and the clouds and 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.920
 the clouds and seagulls 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.349
 good to start we paint all the 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.650
 union of our hands except that of the 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.650
 left hand 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:34.300
 to do with light blue glaze 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:37.180
 colors like nails like those of the sea 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.920
 we paint them with a kind of scope 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.629
 as well as the sea do not have to be 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.250
 perfect do not worry about the 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:47.450
 excesses that I remove 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.450
 we paint very well 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.770
 perfect then with a yellow glaze 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.960
 half golden we put a point like that 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.660
 hid with much enamel and with a 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.060
 world environment or brave scar and 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.660
 we started to pull on all sides 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.290
 as if it were a ray of sun then with 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.290
 white enamel 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.110
 and a toothpick a year or two ago 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.360
 It would be good 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.050
 we touch many points many times in the 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.760
 medium and we throw with the sides 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.140
 forming a cloud does not have to be 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.020
 perfect in the numbers are so 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.890
 perfect ready with a blue uncheck 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.250
 this is optional that we can draw the 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.830
 waves of the sea ​​like this 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.110
 with wavy lines and we draw as 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.110
 that current that is in the sea 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.170
 then the other hand the same ring finger 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:50.189
 but that everything is painted and we draw 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.710
 the clouds and they can put two or three 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.240
 as they said when long or deep 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.500
 I have in the nail 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.500
 I'll put three little ones 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.010
 so we play in the middle with stitches and 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.010
 point of form 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.709
 Exactly after we miss the sky 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:16.500

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.870

 As they ask you in the rai and with a 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:35.570
 system so 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.250
 they are very easy do not forget to spend it on 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.100
 a layer of brightness so they have to 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.560
