00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.590

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.610

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.730
 Vietnamese we spent 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.340

 longest river in the world is born in Tibet 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.830
 and pours its waters into the sea of china 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.400
 after crossing six countries it 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.660
 branches into seven arms that form the 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.340
 3,200 kilometers of navigable canals 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.380
 from the mekong delta 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.479
 we are going in Strasbourg to be in what 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.200
 which is our first stop in the 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.620
 visit to what is the one that concentrates the 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.360
 best 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.340
 although there are many tours 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.230
 available we decided to go for our 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.360
 account and contract all 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:36.080
 accommodation in home stage houses 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.540
 individuals via internet 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.640
 upon arrival we cross the river by local ferry 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.660
 to go to the island opposite 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.660
 have been 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.880
 there we negotiated with two motorists who 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.259
 for one euro they take us to our 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.259
 accommodation 3 km 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.880
 It is a beautiful house in the countryside next door 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.880
 of the river car 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.540
 in this river there are crocodiles that do not 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.890
 they were precisely in the river but yes 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.890
 in a libero in the area 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.030
 after settling down we went to give 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.980
 a walk on the island narrow roads and 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.350
 bridges communicate the four communities 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.650
 who live here surrounded by channels 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.390
 Fruit trees and small shops 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.250
 we had rented the bikes for 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.680
 go around the island and the 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.689
 kilometer to go advancing oiled one 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.010
 of the bikes that we do not know what it was 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:06.510
 we passed by here at this gas station 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.700
 that before calling by phone 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.560
 supposedly it's time to change and 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.340
 we make some people's seats 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.340
 you are happy 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.960
 back home we helped a little with 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.780
 the rolls and dinner promptly at 7 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.350
 life in the Mekong is governed by the 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.350
 hours of light 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.920
 the next morning we went in 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.420
 boat to know the area of caiber good 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.930
 We are finally navigating the 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.930
 picture window 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.900
 we cross with large boats 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.970
 loaded with rice and pampering that is used 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.950
 to build pavements and how 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.280
 fertilizer in the fields 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.370
 of the precious cereal for something to the delta what 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.800
 they call the barn of asia here 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.990
 produces 50 percent of all the 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.180
 rice of the country must be taken into account 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.840
 that vietnam is the second exporter 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.060
 world of this food we discover 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.310
 how they make the pancakes that wrap 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.480
 the spring rolls and how it 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:20.049
 handcrafted with rice the 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.049
 candies 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.930
 and some popcorn 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.840
 to me as 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.310
 to pomegranate popcorn 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.770
 do not 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.400
 as of the 1st 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.170
 at noon we take a heavy van 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.330
 of Vietnamese that took us to the 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.370
 province of canton bus to song and 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.230
 this time if we arrived in a transport 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.570
 purely Vietnamese here there is not even a 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.960
 just tourist and everything is full of 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.970
 local is a kind of collective and goes 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.740
 stopping each time one gets 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.110
 wants to go down because he wants 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.080
 this time we stayed in some bungalows 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.900
 on the banks of the mekong in the business 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.540
 family of mister hyde 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.750
 the floating singing market is a 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.280
 wholesale market for fruits and vegetables 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.949
 the reason that the sale is made on 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.590
 the river is that in the delta area the 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.240
 freeways are fluvial there are no roads 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.060
 prepared for transport with 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.400
 big trucks also buy a boat 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.190
 it is much more affordable than a 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.320
 truck to know what kind of merchandise 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.759
 take each boat you have to look at the fruit 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.070
 or vegetable that is shown as a 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:44.039
 banner on top of a stick 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.560
 bamboo after enjoying life 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.870
 from the market we navigate through the channels 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.650
 until you reach a processing factory 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.690
 of rice takes advantage of all the shell 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.600
 as fuel the ashes as 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:00.600
 fertilizer the flour for feed and the 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.910
 White rice is taken out and distributed to 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:06.060
 its human consumption 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:08.460

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.740

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.410
 We did a little tour of the 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.390
 sales channels after we went to a 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.940
 small amusement park 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:26.930
 to enjoy matteo and cande we must 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.460
 come to a little gimmick here 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.610

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:14.219
 surprise 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.850
