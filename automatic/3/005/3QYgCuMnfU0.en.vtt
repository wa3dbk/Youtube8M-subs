 we already have facilities 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.939
 franchisees where our 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.189
 concept is very simple we take care 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.989

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.239
 vegetables we provide them the 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.910
 greenhouse installation and finally 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.299
 everything that comes out of the production of 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.290
 these greenhouses we commercialize 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.870
 through different channels of 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.140
 marketing that we have the first 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.569
 is the central of supplies we already have 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.989
 a warehouse in the supply center in 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.099
 the 117 kilo street here in the city of 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.040
 Mexico 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.470
 the second place is to carry wii and 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.269
 Mexican commercial we are right now 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.849
 opening other self-service stores and 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.220
 We are already a company in the USA in 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.349
 santiago where we are sending and 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.810
 commercializing everything that comes out of 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.900
 these greenhouses 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.920
 a few months ago we went with 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.780
 proméxico to shanghai to china to be able 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.569
 market everything that comes out of these 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.540
 greenhouses to be able to look for a value 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.870
 added to these products then for 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.870
 we have two types of franchise the 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.930
 of production that is that they can 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.360
 become urban peasants or 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.160
 campers or peasants much more 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.090
 professionals through hydroponics 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.610
 or in the distribution franchise 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.799
 for this we generate another type of 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.959
 non- perishable products derived from 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.510
 all the vegetables that come out of these 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:38.590
 greenhouses because the reality is that 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.209
 one of the biggest problems in the field 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.090
 at present it is the lack of 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:46.269
 professionalization and intermediaries 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.489
 what is really damaging and killing the 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.680
 field that's why we look 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.870
 The best price for our 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.700
 producers that in this case have been 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.400
 become franchisees 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.269
 generating this new concept of a 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.790
 very innovative ecological franchise in the 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.849
 market but that is going to allow that 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.550
 can receive the know-how that we have gone 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:12.370
 generating over 13 years and of 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.080
 this way generate added value to 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.440
 the products like can be sauce 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.130
 chile habanero chile habanero implies my 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.360
 pineapple 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:28.240
 habanero with olive oil 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.240
 in escabeche chile chile habanero 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:36.300
 tamarind and ginger mango jams 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:40.800
 as well as some powders that we have made of 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:44.700
 chile habanero that are both with 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.640
 lemon dehydrated as with sugar as 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.860
 as a sweet guy to wear it add to 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.580
 the fruit that is a delight and also 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:57.930
 we generate mayonnaise with habanero chili 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:00.660
 which is really very rich and this is what 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:05.030
 that can help us generate a change 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:08.250
 not only in our food 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:12.390
 but apart it helps us to generate employment 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.650
 in the country in the areas probably 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.220
 more marginalized areas 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.770
 tropical who have the ones who have one 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.570
 of the best places to be able 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.860
 produce because we have labor 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:28.380
 we have climate we have water and the only thing 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.170
 that we have is organ is to organize ourselves 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.930
 well for this project and for that 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.590
 you can be successful and train
