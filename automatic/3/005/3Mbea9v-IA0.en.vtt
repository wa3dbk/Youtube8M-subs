00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello girls here comes a new video 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.089
 of in the art in this video you will see the 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.760
 realization of this very nail art 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.639
 particular where you have precisely the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.090
 contrast of black and white and waters the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.309
 cal 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.619
 follow the tutorial if you want to live 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.570
 first let's take a base myself 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.100
 use to change an ultra base 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.500
 smoothing which is used to smooth the surface 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.590
 surface and to apply more easily 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.390
 the glaze we take our glaze 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.550
 white of the exits pass it if we go 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.260
 in one color on all nails doing 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.719
 always be careful to cover the well 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.309
 tip and side especially the tip 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.120
 because we don't want to see the double 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.040
 color 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.840
 also in this case we can pass 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.790
 very well to give two passes we wait 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.469
 so much that you dry the enamel for 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.960
 then proceed to the next step 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.910
 I will show you two variants the first with 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.559
 the lunettes always of the past exits 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.239
 where we do not detach just one 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.770
 cloud we apply it at the bottom 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.730
 to the nail because it was precisely that 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.579
 blank space 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.770
 we take our black enamel stand 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.940
 we give to single color also covering the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.559
 lunette and spread thin summers 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.450
 in this case we can choose if 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.280
 take a single pass or make two 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.340
 your choice to cover well the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.080
 tip we wait a moment if there are 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.820
 we can correct any errors 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.560
 with the pen correct polish or with a 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.600
 Photoshop agreed to solvents 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.189
 then without waiting for the polish 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.860
 dry we remove the bezel 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.290
 if instead you are a little more experienced 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.850
 take your black without the bezel 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.250
 and we create a double pass 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.159
 leaving this white profile that yes 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.380
 see also in this case cover well 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.270
 the tip you decide whether to do one or two 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.939
 pass me in this case I'm doing 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.040
 in any case, we expect the past two well 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.930
 that all dry and we take 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.189
 the equipment we need in the nail 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.920
 art what you have to do 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.229
 you have to take waters the call that they are 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.970
 exactly these stickers we cut 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.259
 obviously the strip of sticker that a 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.969
 we are interested in it and then we take a 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.280
 full glass of water 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.549
 we remove the film of the sticks and and the 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.340
 we reposition inside as by effect 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.739
 with water this these fantasies yes 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.390
 they will come off their film 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.629
 very comfortable compared to the stickers 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.159
 classics why 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.200
 they are really very very thin 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:21.049
 when you go to stick to the nail 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.569
 you will not even see the profile not you 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:26.090
 will see absolutely nothing and will unite 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.590
 skilled in nail art made 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.170
 let's apply this I say obviously 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.189
 on all nails the obligation inside 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.079
 right side of the nail tapping 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:38.239
 slightly to make it stick well 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.680
 sticker on the surface once 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.659
 we have applied it all we don't have to 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.519
 do nothing but pass the top coat for 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.739
 seal the nail art and make it last longer 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.180
 long and above all will also make it last 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.799
 the stickers without them getting ruined 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.540
 I really hope this video is there 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.120
 like the others now I will make you 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.030
 still see an image of the nail art 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.739
 finished at his complete as I told you if 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.170
 so that you enjoyed the next 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.170
 a big kiss to everyone but cabbage
