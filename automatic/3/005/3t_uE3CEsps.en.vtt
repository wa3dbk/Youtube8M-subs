00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.509 
blu-rays and this one as you can see is
godzilla<00:00:08.580> 1984<00:00:09.420> now<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:10.099> they<00:00:11.099> have<00:00:11.370> these

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
godzilla 1984 now this they have these

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.759 
godzilla 1984 now this they have these
on<00:00:11.700> all<00:00:11.880> their<00:00:12.059> blu-rays<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.469> just<00:00:13.650> like

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
on all their blu-rays this is just like

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.970 
on all their blu-rays this is just like
a<00:00:13.799> still<00:00:14.490> menu<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.030> beginning<00:00:15.500> but<00:00:16.500> if<00:00:16.680> you

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
a still menu in the beginning but if you

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.680 
a still menu in the beginning but if you
choose<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.279> second<00:00:17.609> option<00:00:17.699> down<00:00:18.150> here<00:00:18.180> I

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
choose the second option down here I

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.840 
choose the second option down here I
guess<00:00:18.930> that's<00:00:19.109> just<00:00:19.199> like<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.439> motion<00:00:19.920> menu<00:00:20.250> and

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
guess that's just like a motion menu and

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.130 
guess that's just like a motion menu and
then<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.210> goes<00:00:21.330> into<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.689> motion<00:00:22.080> menu<00:00:24.140> you

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
then it goes into the motion menu you

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.890 
then it goes into the motion menu you
can<00:00:25.880> see<00:00:26.880> everything<00:00:27.300> moving<00:00:27.480> which<00:00:27.779> is

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
can see everything moving which is

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.540 
can see everything moving which is
pretty<00:00:28.050> cool

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
pretty cool

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.270 
pretty cool
turn<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.670> up<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.820> little<00:00:29.970> bit

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.010 

we'll<00:00:33.820> just<00:00:33.940> let<00:00:34.090> it<00:00:34.210> play<00:00:34.390> through<00:00:34.480> so<00:00:34.930> you

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
we'll just let it play through so you

00:00:35.020 --> 00:01:52.060 
we'll just let it play through so you
can<00:00:35.170> see<00:00:35.350> all<00:00:35.470> the<00:00:35.560> little<00:00:35.680> animations

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.010 

and<00:01:53.070> that's<00:01:53.400> like<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.850> end<00:01:54.030> loop<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.780> blur

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and that's like the end loop of the blur

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.190 
and that's like the end loop of the blur
so<00:01:55.230> I<00:01:55.260> didn't<00:01:55.590> turn<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.890> down<00:01:56.870> for<00:01:57.870> everybody
