you're<00:00:30.240> going<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.420> spawn<00:00:30.689> here<00:00:31.170> at<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.590> red

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
you're going to spawn here at the red

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.900 
you're going to spawn here at the red
base<00:00:32.660> if<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.989> are<00:00:34.260> another<00:00:34.980> faction<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.760> may
