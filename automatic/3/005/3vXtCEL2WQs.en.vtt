00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
want a much steeper approach for example

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.270 
want a much steeper approach for example
if<00:00:51.180> there<00:00:51.420> are<00:00:51.539> trees<00:00:51.870> or<00:00:52.350> wires<00:00:52.649> or<00:00:53.070> other

strip or very rarely on occasions when

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.069 
strip or very rarely on occasions when
you're<00:00:59.430> making<00:00:59.760> an<00:01:00.000> emergency<00:01:00.239> approach

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
you're making an emergency approach

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.750 
you're making an emergency approach
because<00:01:01.530> you've<00:01:01.680> had<00:01:01.800> an<00:01:01.980> engine<00:01:02.340> out<00:01:02.489> or

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
because you've had an engine out or

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.660 
because you've had an engine out or
something<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:04.250> where<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.430> probably

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
something like that where it's probably

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.429 
something like that where it's probably
a<00:01:05.850> good<00:01:06.000> idea<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.450> come<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.810> little<00:01:07.080> bit<00:01:07.200> high

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
a good idea to come in a little bit high

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.460 
a good idea to come in a little bit high
and<00:01:07.830> then<00:01:08.070> bleed<00:01:08.430> off<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.200> additional<00:01:10.200> height

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
and then bleed off the additional height

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.520 
and then bleed off the additional height
as<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.430> get<00:01:11.610> close<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> strip<00:01:12.510> it's<00:01:13.350> much

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
as you get close to the strip it's much

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.469 
as you get close to the strip it's much
easier<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:13.979> get<00:01:14.220> rid<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.430> height<00:01:14.729> than<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.270> gain

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
easier to get rid of height than to gain

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.320 
easier to get rid of height than to gain
it<00:01:15.750> if<00:01:15.930> you've<00:01:16.049> got<00:01:16.080> no<00:01:16.439> engine<00:01:17.150> so<00:01:18.150> this

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
it if you've got no engine so this

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.820 
it if you've got no engine so this
afternoon<00:01:18.509> we're<00:01:19.080> going<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> look<00:01:19.650> at

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
afternoon we're going to have a look at

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.219 
afternoon we're going to have a look at
a<00:01:20.070> couple<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.640> different<00:01:21.090> types<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.840> approach

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
a couple of different types of approach

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.770 
a couple of different types of approach
in<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.619> Fox<00:01:22.830> bet<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.610> first<00:01:23.790> one<00:01:24.090> will<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.360> a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
in the Fox bet the first one will be a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.530 
in the Fox bet the first one will be a
standard<00:01:25.619> approach<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:26.280> flap<00:01:26.640> which<00:01:27.210> is

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
standard approach with flap which is

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.160 
standard approach with flap which is
fairly<00:01:28.350> steep<00:01:28.799> but<00:01:29.189> not<00:01:30.180> as<00:01:30.329> steep<00:01:30.540> as<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.840> can

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
fairly steep but not as steep as it can

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.740 
fairly steep but not as steep as it can
be<00:01:31.409> with<00:01:31.680> side<00:01:31.950> slipping<00:01:32.490> which<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
be with side slipping which is the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.149 
be with side slipping which is the
second<00:01:34.110> type<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.470> approach<00:01:34.710> we're<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.070> to

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
second type of approach we're going to

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.210 
second type of approach we're going to
use<00:01:35.390> to<00:01:36.390> demonstrate<00:01:36.570> how<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.409> aircraft<00:01:37.710> will

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
use to demonstrate how the aircraft will

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.539 
use to demonstrate how the aircraft will
come<00:01:38.490> down<00:01:38.729> very<00:01:38.759> steeply<00:01:39.740> if<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.920> side<00:01:41.189> slip

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
come down very steeply if you side slip

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.960 
come down very steeply if you side slip
the<00:01:41.700> aircraft<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:43.460> particular<00:01:44.460> point<00:01:44.729> when

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the aircraft a particular point when

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.410 
side slipping is in the Fox Pat is to
stay<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:48.960> ideal<00:01:49.829> side<00:01:50.430> slip<00:01:50.790> range<00:01:51.090> with

a little bit of engine but it will give

put<00:03:35.400> away<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.760> flap<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.209> stop<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.230> aircraft

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
put away the flap and stop the aircraft

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.339 
put away the flap and stop the aircraft
pretty<00:03:37.950> quickly<00:03:38.420> as<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.599> can<00:03:39.720> see<00:03:39.959> that's<00:03:40.140> a

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
pretty quickly as you can see that's a

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.870 
pretty quickly as you can see that's a
nice<00:03:40.470> short<00:03:40.830> field<00:03:41.069> landing<00:03:41.489> now<00:03:41.610> we<00:03:41.670> should

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
nice short field landing now we should

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.430 
nice short field landing now we should
be<00:03:41.910> able<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.209> accomplish<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.810> same<00:03:42.840> with<00:03:43.410> a

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
be able to accomplish the same with a

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.650 
be able to accomplish the same with a
much<00:03:44.280> steeper<00:03:44.760> approach<00:03:45.060> with<00:03:45.269> some<00:03:45.420> side

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
much steeper approach with some side

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.090 
much steeper approach with some side
slips<00:03:45.989> so<00:03:46.170> that's<00:03:46.350> we're<00:03:46.590> going<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.769> go<00:03:46.890> for

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
slips so that's we're going to go for

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.809 
slips so that's we're going to go for
now<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.600> so<00:03:48.600> in<00:03:49.140> this<00:03:49.380> short<00:03:50.190> video<00:03:50.400> we're

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
now and so in this short video we're

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.229 
now and so in this short video we're
going<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:50.970> show<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.560> landing<00:03:52.560> with<00:03:52.799> a<00:03:53.239> side

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
going to show you a landing with a side

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.360 
going to show you a landing with a side
slip<00:03:54.569> at<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.780> end<00:03:54.989> just<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.380> show<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.620> how<00:03:55.890> you

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
slip at the end just to show you how you

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.220 
slip at the end just to show you how you
can<00:03:56.549> steep<00:03:56.910> enough<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.390> angle<00:03:57.720> of<00:03:57.870> approach

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
can steep enough the angle of approach

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.680 
can steep enough the angle of approach
and<00:03:58.650> coming<00:03:59.280> over<00:03:59.400> trees<00:03:59.819> and<00:04:00.060> wires<00:04:00.239> if<00:04:00.540> you

and coming over trees and wires if you

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.110 
and coming over trees and wires if you
need<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:01.080> there<00:04:01.890> won't<00:04:02.100> be<00:04:02.190> any<00:04:02.519> trees<00:04:02.880> and

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
need to there won't be any trees and

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.640 
need to there won't be any trees and
