00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello how about youtube friends like 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.210
 you are welcome to my channel is again 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.179
 and I'm going to teach you how to draw today 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.910
 this kawaii pizza what are we going to 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:16.470
 need will be the following 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:20.410
 what we are going to visit will be a marker 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:25.830
 a pen or what you have for 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.830
 highlight but be black 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.510
 we will remove pencil sharpener 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.810
 take out tip for an emergency case 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:43.580
 the toe breakage is the result 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.580
 and we have a pencil 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.789
 we will not need rubber too 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.789
 draft 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:01.570
 and colors we will need 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:04.239
 yellow red red wine and a brown 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.140
 clarito now let's start drawing 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.140
 the pizza 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:16.390
 let's take our the victim and we 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:18.540
 let's draw the look as a 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.550
 triangle 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.500
 on the scale like this 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:28.520
 but that you are rounded by this part 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.800
 and then we're going to finish it up 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.800
 we'll even do like a spiral 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.220
 in this way 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.210
 now with our how are we going to achieve a 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.210
 little here 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:56.210
 here we are going to do this as a curvita 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:00.729
 and this curve we are going to stay until here 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:04.880
 in this way if this curve is 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:08.810
 we are going to hit it here because the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.649
 affection has like stuffed like this in the 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.649
 sides and good 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.400
 we'll even get a second base 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:25.049
 down the earth 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.640
 let's throw it up to us and now what 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.100
 will 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.090
 I will 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:36.530
 move my bed so that 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:40.180
 can see them and here we will see their eyes 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.819
 so I want to do them like that 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.300
 of the circuit 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.120
 and here your closing date 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.650
 and come here we're going to do everything 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.450
 We want you to have this I am going to do 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.989
 that we are what is the chopped shock 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.989
 but not 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.739
 good 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.719
 and that's how we end up thinking now 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.469
 what we are going to do with our 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.180
 marker 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:15.830
 we call to highlight 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:20.000
 so that they fit better 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:22.100
 but a very important thing before 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.160
 highlight the footprints we are working 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:29.160
 on a sheet if we have to put something 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.410
 down a cardboard can we have 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.060
 so that the other sheet is not stained 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.080
 then you can put these sponges 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.260
 we are already sure that it is not going to 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.860
 stain the other cartoons we have 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.860
 on the other sheet 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.920
 if we finish an extra strips with a lot 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.920
 watch out 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:01.540
 so very carefully so that we do not get 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.540
 damage our drawing 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.710
 with the marker we can perfect 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.840
 everything in what we are wrong as 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.030
 can see is to perfect 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.920
 in the little one that some liquidated 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.880
 many types 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:39.450
 and well I finished to emphasize in the 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.220
 sixth low very well demarcated so that 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:46.400
 I do not know I do not know what and where what would be left 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.400
 would illuminate them with our colors 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:58.110
 well here I finished lighting it and 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.240
 here you can see how my pizza was and 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.130
 good 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.699
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:09.430
 it has been difficult to do and not 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:13.830
 forget to comment and rate subscribe 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.830
 we'll see each other in the next video bye bye 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.820
