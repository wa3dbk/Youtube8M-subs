00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:09.630
 Hi, folks over now, I'm going to teach you 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.300
 cornmeal cake 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.549
 this recipe is a family recipe 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.650
 is my mother who in my opinion 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.380
 best goalkeeper in the world then this cake 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.949
 do not come too easy infection 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.650
 the ingredients are well 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.010
 basic everyone at home 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.380
 just do a coffee audit 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.380
 everybody will love it so let's go to the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.300
 all ingredients and temperature 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.280
 environment as you have seen one side of here 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.930
 my page does not face 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.930
 I always talk for eggs. 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.010
 I like to intercalate ingredients and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.469
 dry wet get out of here have I told of 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.449
 training 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:01:00.420
 Look how much I canola oil 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.399
 I always use same at home smoking milk 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.060
 they will put a little sick I should put 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.090
 sugar and put an instant and sugar 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.090
 refined 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.250
 until homogeneous 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:24.810
 begins with the pulsar in the blender 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:28.820
 hence to make a move with the woman 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.820
 always stay court 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.830
 We did not throw the towel here. 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.450
 realized that I put the yeast is the 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.390
 tool is always the last thing you 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.010
 you lay is never low 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:53.650
 along with the other ingredients to 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:02:06.380
 People only put it in the end I already hit well 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:17.210
 the additional yeast to achieve some 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:19.430
 Sometimes just throwing already gave it so I go 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.570
 doing is that cake 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.940
 both ways will make families 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:28.370
 disposable for you to gift 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.940
 I'm going to make a presentation is yours. 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.340
 using geleca made another video and a 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.800
 cap and wrapped the way it will stay 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.080
 very cute to give as a gift 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.140
 won make a new normal with a hole 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:47.150
 in the middle of a hole form in the middle with 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:50.959
 a piece of hardware or mine 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:55.840
 family I'm using ball shape in 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.840
 English is already assembled and flushed 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.340
 I'm going to fill half the launches that 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:10.440
 now I will take the preheated oven to 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.300
 200 degrees and the goal is you have that 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.470
 toothpick test you do to know 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.500
 if it's ready 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.570
 never open formed of 15 minutes always 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.370
 if you sell for 15 minutes 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:27.060
 google will sink will be added the 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.950
 oven wait 15 minutes 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.930
 You started to smell the cake. 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.930
 Our house will make you play and 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:46.890
 now to end our present in the 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:50.400
 album released the label 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.510
 my suggestion is cool or never our 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.080
 cheetah 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.610
 I bought a meter of calico and I cut 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.130
 talk about it 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.270
 I know the squares equal to him about 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:24.290
 a little bit then to do so the site 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:31.370
 where in the middle so 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:34.100
 here is the biggest lift I'm going 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.220
 make a little piece of guava in the middle 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.920
 here I cut water is basic of the passwords 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.830
 and I spent the wave wheat flour 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.780
 This is a trick so anything 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.100
 that you want to put in the middle of a 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.710
 banana fruit cake batter 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.780
 candied dried fruit any 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.870
 Anything you want to do is stay at 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.680
 middle of good for not in deep mass 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:05.750
 You pass on wheat, which makes you look good in the 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:14.030
 half now just put the stuffing 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:17.000
 little bits now more expected than it was 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:20.830
 crazy instrumental I will inform 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.830
 death of quentin 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.070
 and with a piece of leftover guava 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.940
 I bought it, I made an eye drop. 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:38.730
 guava with guava syrup has to 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:42.780
 guava put water and took the forrÃ³ 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:44.460
 fire to melt and stayed like this I know 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.520
 that there is the first because the 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.370
 bits still carried the inter must 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:06:25.580
 get thinner in yourself are you see together 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:06:25.580
 with a nor with 100
