00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
because if you do the challenges you're

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.840 
because if you do the challenges you're
going<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.470> get<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.799> know<00:01:43.920> some<00:01:44.040> empty<00:01:44.549> for

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
certain challenges but you know in my

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.069 
certain challenges but you know in my
honest<00:01:47.820> opinion<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.329> think<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.869> probably

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
honest opinion I think this is probably
