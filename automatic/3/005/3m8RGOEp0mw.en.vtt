 as the most intense day beautiful and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.529
 production happened in Spain by 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.920
 example today we are talking about several 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.130
 issues one has to see 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.019
 with the workers 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.390
 workers and workers who have 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.489
 had the good executed the promise of 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.110
 wait for me here for 5 hours they told me 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:47.030
 I should help you with a medal each 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.030
 recognition but I give my heart 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.420
 I'm going 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.730
 it is urgent 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:01.040
 it is necessary that we do not leave 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.950
 run over by the dynamics of the days 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.000
 and that on the same yellow we are 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:11.030
 able to go giving it a way to go 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.570
 structuring a new thought 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.500
 liberator 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.330
 a new thought that is appropriate to 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.460
 the new era that we are beginning to 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.189
 live 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:29.310
 and that is going to mean good a transit 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:34.490
 existential do not forget that there is no 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.490
 revolution without revolutionary ideology 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.990
 how is it that you have to go thinking 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.030
 and doing true we feed 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.909
 revolutionary thinking in america 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.920
 latina and in the Caribbean especially with the 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.140
 original thinking of Simon Bolivar 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.140
 great revolutionary anti-imperialist 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.049
 even though it was not the know we 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.640
 that individual men do not do the 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.439
 history 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.510
 Bolivar became a town and behind him and 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.620
 with him a town 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.620
 entire villages 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.610
 at the same time that bolivar was 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.440
 calling the panama congress not for 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.200
 unite the South American republics and 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.900
 Central American and Caribbean were 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.890
 from washington saying america for 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.000
 the markets 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.140
 bolivar said no 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.140
 let's send the surf 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.360
 1828 this seems incredible but it's 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.740
 true is written in a letter from 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:43.060
 bolivar a phrase 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:45.360
 the us of north america 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.090
 they seem destined by the providence 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.020
 to plague the America of miseries to 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.020
 name of freedom 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.990
 now in South America we are raising 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.480
 the idea we are already working on a 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.860
 Confederation of workers 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.860

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.420
 atahualpa pieces 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.720
 and when he felt that he was already dying 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.240
 arms in that villa 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.300
 they were itched into pieces they are a prophecy 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:39.300

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.680
 the sites of the most profound reality 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.270
 that not American 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.900
