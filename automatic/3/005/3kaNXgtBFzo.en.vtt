are<00:00:22.460> bringing<00:00:23.320> millions<00:00:24.320> of<00:00:24.470> gallons<00:00:24.769> a<00:00:24.949> day

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
are bringing millions of gallons a day

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.070 
are bringing millions of gallons a day
of<00:00:25.429> fresh<00:00:26.119> water<00:00:27.109> so<00:00:27.800> where<00:00:28.130> you<00:00:28.580> have

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
of fresh water so where you have

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.540 
of fresh water so where you have
freshwater<00:00:30.080> and<00:00:30.439> saltwater<00:00:30.769> coming<00:00:31.429> together

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
freshwater and saltwater coming together

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.940 
freshwater and saltwater coming together
and<00:00:31.999> mixing<00:00:32.899> around<00:00:33.020> to<00:00:33.260> get<00:00:33.379> this<00:00:33.530> great

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
and mixing around to get this great

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
mud and they dig these holes they can be

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:52.350 
mud and they dig these holes they can be
about<00:01:35.180> this<00:01:35.509> big

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
look you don't really see a lot of

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.389 
look you don't really see a lot of
things<00:01:59.500> great<00:02:00.500> that<00:02:00.710> should<00:02:00.860> be<00:02:00.950> enough<00:02:01.189> mud

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
things great that should be enough mud

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.279 
things great that should be enough mud
right<00:02:01.670> there<00:02:01.909> so<00:02:02.299> now<00:02:02.479> what<00:02:02.750> you're<00:02:02.869> gonna<00:02:02.960> do

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
right there so now what you're gonna do

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.310 
right there so now what you're gonna do
you're<00:02:03.799> gonna<00:02:03.890> take<00:02:04.189> water<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:05.179> pour<00:02:06.110> it<00:02:06.229> on

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
you're gonna take water and pour it on

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.040 
you're gonna take water and pour it on
top<00:02:06.619> of<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.950> mud<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.460> slowly<00:02:07.970> delete<00:02:08.660> them<00:02:08.899> on

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
top of the mud to slowly delete them on

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.130 
top of the mud to slowly delete them on
so<00:02:09.709> that<00:02:09.950> it'll<00:02:10.330> spit<00:02:11.330> through<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.780> screens

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
so that it'll spit through the screens

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.800 
so that it'll spit through the screens
and<00:02:12.650> leave<00:02:12.860> behind<00:02:13.099> any<00:02:13.610> creatures<00:02:14.330> I<00:02:14.540> see<00:02:14.780> a

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
and leave behind any creatures I see a

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.750 
and leave behind any creatures I see a
creature<00:02:15.080> right<00:02:15.500> there<00:02:15.800> I<00:02:15.830> think<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.610> you

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
creature right there I think that you

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.949 
creature right there I think that you
can<00:02:16.940> pull<00:02:17.150> out<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.569> put<00:02:17.750> in<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.290> petri<00:02:18.950> dish

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
can pull out and put in the petri dish

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:31.479 
can pull out and put in the petri dish
that's<00:02:20.959> a<00:02:21.110> couple<00:02:21.350> of<00:02:21.500> nice<00:02:21.709> worms<00:02:30.310> finish<00:02:31.310> up

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
that's a couple of nice worms finish up
