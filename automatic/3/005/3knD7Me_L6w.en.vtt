now today I'm just going to talk you
through<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:05.250> Shimano<00:00:06.120> di2

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
through the Shimano di2

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.240 
through the Shimano di2
electronic<00:00:08.040> gear<00:00:08.490> system<00:00:09.559> so<00:00:10.559> here<00:00:11.040> are<00:00:11.160> the

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
electronic gear system so here are the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.140 
electronic gear system so here are the
shifters<00:00:11.719> they<00:00:12.719> look<00:00:13.080> very<00:00:13.469> much<00:00:13.559> like

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
shifters they look very much like

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.599 
shifters they look very much like
conventional<00:00:15.150> shifters<00:00:16.130> but<00:00:17.130> they<00:00:17.310> don't

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
conventional shifters but they don't

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.810 
conventional shifters but they don't
click<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.539> like<00:00:19.260> normal<00:00:19.590> ones<00:00:19.740> they<00:00:20.279> instead

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
click in like normal ones they instead

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.210 
click in like normal ones they instead
they<00:00:21.000> use<00:00:21.300> these<00:00:21.480> little<00:00:21.840> buttons<00:00:22.529> here<00:00:23.010> on

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
they use these little buttons here on

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.500 
they use these little buttons here on
the<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.750> shifter<00:00:25.430> which<00:00:26.510> actually

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the on the on the shifter which actually

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.540 
the on the on the shifter which actually
act<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.960> little<00:00:28.260> bit<00:00:28.349> more<00:00:28.529> like<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> mouse<00:00:29.099> click

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
act a little bit more like a mouse click

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.450 
act a little bit more like a mouse click
so<00:00:29.820> it's<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> mechanical<00:00:31.170> wire<00:00:32.160> that's

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
so it's not a mechanical wire that's

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.490 
so it's not a mechanical wire that's
being<00:00:32.700> pulled<00:00:33.030> it's<00:00:33.750> actually<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> signal

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
being pulled it's actually a signal

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.040 
being pulled it's actually a signal
being<00:00:34.800> sent<00:00:35.160> from<00:00:35.309> here<00:00:35.700> down<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.630> motors

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
being sent from here down to the motors

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.220 
being sent from here down to the motors
on<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:38.370> front<00:00:38.850> Dre<00:00:39.059> Lea<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:40.050> rear

derailleur these shifters can be
completely<00:00:43.800> customized<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.239> can

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
completely customized and you can

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.319 
completely customized and you can
control<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.280> amount<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.700> gears<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.090> it

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
control the the amount of gears that it

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.900 
control the the amount of gears that it
shifts<00:00:48.809> I've<00:00:49.649> personally<00:00:50.010> got<00:00:50.280> these<00:00:50.430> set<00:00:50.700> up

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
shifts I've personally got these set up

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.750 
shifts I've personally got these set up
so<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.300> when<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.449> hold<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:52.410> buttons<00:00:52.800> down<00:00:53.039> it

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
so that when I hold the buttons down it

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.760 
so that when I hold the buttons down it
just<00:00:53.969> continues<00:00:54.510> cycling<00:00:55.170> through<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> gears

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
just continues cycling through the gears

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.340 
just continues cycling through the gears
and<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.760> goes<00:00:56.940> up<00:00:57.120> or<00:00:57.300> down<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.660> block<00:00:57.870> as<00:00:58.079> I

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
and just goes up or down the block as I

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.270 
and just goes up or down the block as I
need<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.620> to<00:01:00.020> next<00:01:01.020> thing<00:01:01.140> we<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
need it to next thing we have is the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.539 
need it to next thing we have is the
control<00:01:03.030> box<00:01:03.270> now<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.409> control<00:01:04.799> box<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.189> used

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
control box now this control box is used

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.740 
control box now this control box is used
to<00:01:05.909> enter<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:07.070> adjust<00:01:08.070> mode<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:09.479> check

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
to enter the adjust mode and to check

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.320 
to enter the adjust mode and to check
the<00:01:09.930> battery<00:01:10.380> status<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.150> we've

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the battery status and with that we've

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.350 
the battery status and with that we've
also<00:01:12.450> got<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> battery<00:01:13.380> just<00:01:13.560> here<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:15.090> nice

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
also got the battery just here it's nice

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.390 
also got the battery just here it's nice
and<00:01:15.600> lightweight<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.920> wouldn't<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.070> really

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
and lightweight so you wouldn't a really

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.850 
and lightweight so you wouldn't a really
affect<00:01:20.700> your<00:01:20.850> ride<00:01:21.140> comes<00:01:22.140> away<00:01:22.350> nice<00:01:22.590> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
affect your ride comes away nice and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.140 
affect your ride comes away nice and
easily<00:01:23.150> it<00:01:24.150> comes<00:01:24.390> with<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> charger<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:26.340> from

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
easily it comes with a charger and from

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.330 
easily it comes with a charger and from
when<00:01:27.720> it's<00:01:27.840> fully<00:01:28.020> charged<00:01:28.530> it'll<00:01:28.890> last<00:01:29.070> about

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
when it's fully charged it'll last about

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.480 
when it's fully charged it'll last about
a<00:01:29.490> thousand<00:01:30.240> miles<00:01:32.299> we<00:01:33.299> also<00:01:33.479> have<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.490> front

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
a thousand miles we also have the front

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.569 
a thousand miles we also have the front
raelia<00:01:36.170> basically<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> motor<00:01:37.770> that

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
raelia basically this is a motor that

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.999 
raelia basically this is a motor that
moves<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.990> mechanism<00:01:40.470> forward<00:01:40.860> and

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
moves the the mechanism forward and

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.980 
moves the the mechanism forward and
backwards<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.610> go<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> big<00:01:42.659> ring<00:01:42.840> or

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
backwards to go on to the big ring or

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.440 
backwards to go on to the big ring or
the<00:01:43.020> small<00:01:43.320> ring<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.740> similarly<00:01:44.729> we<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the small ring and similarly we have the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.050 
the small ring and similarly we have the
rear<00:01:45.630> Dre<00:01:45.869> Lea<00:01:46.020> which<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.409> another<00:01:46.710> motor

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
rear Dre Lea which is another motor

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.730 
rear Dre Lea which is another motor
which<00:01:48.060> moves<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.869> chain<00:01:49.079> up<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.409> down<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
which moves the chain up and down the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.270 
which moves the chain up and down the
block<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.189> conventional<00:01:51.090> gears<00:01:51.329> do<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
block as conventional gears do the the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.840 
block as conventional gears do the the
big<00:01:53.460> difference<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:55.200> uses<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.860> wire<00:01:56.189> it

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
big difference is that it uses a wire it

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.810 
big difference is that it uses a wire it
doesn't<00:01:57.090> use<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> cable<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:58.439> there's<00:01:58.619> no<00:01:58.860> cable

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820

it's<00:02:20.489> set<00:02:20.670> up<00:02:20.910> if<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.720> don't<00:02:21.870> damage<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.470> or

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
it's set up if you don't damage it or

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.790 
it's set up if you don't damage it or
the<00:02:22.860> battery<00:02:23.130> doesn't<00:02:23.310> go<00:02:23.489> flat<00:02:24.050> it<00:02:25.050> will<00:02:25.230> give

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
the battery doesn't go flat it will give

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.790 
the battery doesn't go flat it will give
you<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.280> exact<00:02:26.670> gear<00:02:27.180> changes<00:02:27.750> from<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.650> day

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
you the exact gear changes from the day

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.440 
you the exact gear changes from the day
you<00:02:28.860> bought<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.730> day<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:29.940> get<00:02:30.180> rid<00:02:30.360> of

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
you bought it to the day you get rid of

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.309 
you bought it to the day you get rid of
it<00:02:30.569> it's<00:02:31.230> super<00:02:32.069> super<00:02:32.310> reliable<00:02:33.319> another

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
it it's super super reliable another

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.930 
it it's super super reliable another
good<00:02:34.560> thing<00:02:34.800> is<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:37.380> front<00:02:37.709> raelia<00:02:38.220> will

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
good thing is the front raelia will

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.520 
good thing is the front raelia will
automatically<00:02:39.600> trim<00:02:43.580> so<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:45.480> doesn't<00:02:45.810> rub<00:02:46.110> on

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
automatically trim so it doesn't rub on

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.900 
automatically trim so it doesn't rub on
the<00:02:47.340> on<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.450> actual<00:02:48.720> derailleur<00:02:49.140> itself<00:02:49.910> very

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
the on the actual derailleur itself very

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:58.460 
the on the actual derailleur itself very
very<00:02:50.970> reliable<00:02:56.330> so<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.480> big<00:02:57.600> question<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:58.110> is

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
very reliable so the big question is is

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.350 
very reliable so the big question is is
it<00:02:58.739> any<00:02:58.920> better<00:02:59.160> or<00:02:59.580> any<00:02:59.610> worse<00:02:59.819> than<00:03:00.239> a

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
it any better or any worse than a

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.350 
it any better or any worse than a
conventional<00:03:00.540> cable<00:03:01.470> system<00:03:02.100> well<00:03:03.000> I've<00:03:03.209> been

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
conventional cable system well I've been

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.180 
conventional cable system well I've been
riding<00:03:03.569> this<00:03:03.870> for<00:03:04.110> about<00:03:04.200> two<00:03:04.650> weeks<00:03:04.890> now

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
riding this for about two weeks now

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.840 
riding this for about two weeks now
and<00:03:05.569> as<00:03:06.569> you<00:03:06.780> would<00:03:06.870> expect<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.560> brand<00:03:08.519> new<00:03:08.670> bike

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
and as you would expect a brand new bike

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.759 
and as you would expect a brand new bike
all<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.299> gear<00:03:09.600> changes<00:03:10.019> are<00:03:10.200> super<00:03:10.500> smooth

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
all the gear changes are super smooth

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.940 
all the gear changes are super smooth
and<00:03:11.040> I'm<00:03:11.970> really<00:03:12.239> happy<00:03:12.510> with<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.810> but<00:03:13.799> then

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
and I'm really happy with it but then

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.830 
and I'm really happy with it but then
you'd<00:03:14.640> have<00:03:14.700> exactly<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.360> same<00:03:15.390> with<00:03:15.810> a

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.030 
you'd have exactly the same with a
conventional<00:03:16.410> gear<00:03:16.860> bike<00:03:17.160> as<00:03:17.370> well<00:03:18.799> yes<00:03:19.799> a<00:03:19.829> lot

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
with conventional gear systems as well

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.599
