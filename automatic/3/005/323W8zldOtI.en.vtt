00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.640 
from LA Colors and there are six pallets
six<00:00:21.180> completely<00:00:21.930> different<00:00:22.320> palettes

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
six completely different palettes

because it what I've noticed with these

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.210 
because it what I've noticed with these
palettes<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.870> where<00:03:01.410> they<00:03:01.560> have<00:03:01.590> la<00:03:02.160> see

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
palettes is that where they have la see

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.610 
palettes is that where they have la see
which<00:03:02.580> as<00:03:02.730> for<00:03:02.880> LA<00:03:03.090> colors<00:03:03.480> is<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.930> color<00:03:04.200> of

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.950 
which as for LA colors is the color of
the<00:03:05.310> palette<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.970> hair<00:03:06.240> it's<00:03:06.450> written<00:03:06.810> in

green<00:03:07.320> so<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:07.980> would<00:03:08.220> think<00:03:08.370> they'll<00:03:08.610> call<00:03:08.850> this

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030

green so I would think they'll call this
a<00:03:09.270> green<00:03:09.660> palette<00:03:10.170> but<00:03:10.470> they<00:03:11.010> call<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.460> brown

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330
