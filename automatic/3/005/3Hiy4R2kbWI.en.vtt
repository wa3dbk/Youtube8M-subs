00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.369
 is the beauty guys but a quick tutorial 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.550
 here on how to create a system of 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.750
 realistic direction here that best serves 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.870
 that 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.900
 everybody is already used to seeing 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.550
 I created a car written here. 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.150
 Simple for you, I'll be 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.989
 downloading the link from the 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.180
 video 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.570
 There you go, there you will be. 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:50.110
 normal script like any other logic 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.050
 drive the bg we will create one here 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:57.489
 Sisteminha we create you come here 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:00.040
 on line 125 puts a comment here and 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.070
 then on line 128 has a variable 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.500
 called the limit that will be the limit 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.630
 of the direction and speed of return 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.220
 direction the speed you are going to make 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.380
 returning to the center will create 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.490
 here as we wanted 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.380
 First we'll make him come here. 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.000
 with limit now that I've put 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.110
 comments are unlimited 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:34.020
 Let's vote with the limit , let's do it. 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:38.200
 so and pretending point car is direction 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.869
 greater than zero is greater than zero g point 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.659
 car is our car is all variable 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.850
 that you think you have today 's gp point in 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.679
 front means that it is a variable 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.859
 that you can use it in 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:57.179
 any code anywhere 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:02:01.060
 It has called the imported our logic 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:04.450
 which is represented by g then explain 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.859
 more about this then we got 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.569
 our way car point that our 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:12.400
 car and we took the vaa property 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.460
 his direction is this from here that is 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.650
 responsible for the obvious direction this era 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.020
 If you want to do something, then 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.110
 People are going to do what it is to do and period. 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.230
 car steering 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:33.080
 equal to the limit of not forming 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:36.470
 they wanted to take they did not mark 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.110
 limit ' of stating that the limit of 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.970
 be equal to the withdrawal limit and copy 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.030
 this particle below will make the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.190
 reverse selection is less than less 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.150
 its emission will be equal to less limit 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.490
 from there only she does not come back to have 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.680
 Come back now she's already going soft. 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.390
 only to have to return back to us 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.360
 will create if you put this part 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:06.860
 part of the age points direction will create 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.750
 logic and already points in a direction 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.550
 greater than zero 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.770
 mark if it is 0 make a 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:20.890
 with one thing we will do so the 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:29.720
 direction will be equal to direction - 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:34.310
 speed return to the direction that this 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:36.140
 Here you can copy these two 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.860
 lines and glue down here let's do the 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.140
 reverse direction and get to less than 0 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.180
 she's going to be the direction is going to be the same 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.570
 that direction instead of less here 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:51.230
 one more test the 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.510
 Okay, it's getting normal, he's coming back. 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.520
 normal 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.860
 his speed of return 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.740
 variable here it is 20 I put 10 she 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.590
 goes back very slowly O're seeing 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.800
 which I put 0.5 will vote for more 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.860
 Slow is still coming back so I'm going 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:14.480
 put 20 and to the limit if I put 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:19.090
 7 will spin more just put one goes 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.090
 generate much more for sale 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:29.840
 I 'm going to put 0.5 here, that 's it 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.970
 I hope it will have helped you and it's just 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.810
 So you just need to do this. 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:38.350
 part alone here in the code 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.169
 in the car controller and ready 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.919
 beauty was good, sign up sign up 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:47.080
 on the channel and help our channel grow 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:50.100
 here will soon have more turialy 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.100
 beauty spoke
