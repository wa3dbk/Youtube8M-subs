right now for season pass holders so I
was<00:01:46.380> able<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.680> get<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.950> yesterday<00:01:47.340> what<00:01:47.790> I

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
was able to get it yesterday what I

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.090 
was able to get it yesterday what I
think<00:01:48.210> about<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.619> really<00:01:49.979> good

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
think about it is it's a really good

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.090 
think about it is it's a really good
idea<00:01:50.430> it's<00:01:50.939> really<00:01:51.270> cool<00:01:51.659> it's<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.590> interesting

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
idea it's really cool it's a interesting

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.800 
idea it's really cool it's a interesting
weapon<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.759> use<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.390> once<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.630> get<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.780> hang

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
weapon to use and once you get the hang

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.539 
weapon to use and once you get the hang
of<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.439> do<00:01:55.590> good<00:01:55.770> with<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.369> cannot

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
of it you can do good with it you cannot

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.249 
of it you can do good with it you cannot
switch<00:01:56.850> between<00:01:57.030> modes<00:01:57.479> if<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.930> don't<00:01:58.110> know

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
switch between modes if you don't know

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.380 
switch between modes if you don't know
it's<00:01:58.469> an<00:01:58.649> assault<00:01:59.040> rifle<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.850> submachine

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
it's an assault rifle and a submachine

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.389 
it's an assault rifle and a submachine
gun<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:01.110> not<00:02:01.290> like<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.649> Peacekeeper<00:02:02.219> where

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
gun it's not like the Peacekeeper where

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.969 
gun it's not like the Peacekeeper where
it's<00:02:02.520> supposedly<00:02:02.909> both<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.689> one<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.560> yeah<00:02:04.770> it's

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
it's supposedly both in one so yeah it's

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.100 
it's supposedly both in one so yeah it's
a<00:02:05.040> really<00:02:05.219> good<00:02:05.310> idea<00:02:05.689> it<00:02:06.689> wouldn't<00:02:06.990> be

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
a really good idea it wouldn't be

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.839 
a really good idea it wouldn't be
surprising<00:02:07.560> if<00:02:07.770> they<00:02:07.920> nerfed<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.399> at<00:02:08.580> least

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
surprising if they nerfed it at least

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.400 
surprising if they nerfed it at least
once<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.750> don't<00:02:09.929> think<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.200> gonna<00:02:10.289> be

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
once I don't think it's gonna be

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
once I don't think it's gonna be
something<00:02:10.619> where<00:02:10.860> they're<00:02:10.979> constantly

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
something where they're constantly

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.200 
something where they're constantly
nerfing<00:02:11.970> it

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
nerfing it

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.450 
nerfing it
trying<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.600> get<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.810> right<00:02:13.130> but<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.220> probably

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
trying to get it right but it probably

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.830 
trying to get it right but it probably
is<00:02:14.700> going<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.060> be<00:02:15.120> something<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.570> makes

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
is going to be something that makes

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.920 
is going to be something that makes
someone<00:02:16.200> angry<00:02:16.740> when<00:02:16.890> they<00:02:17.040> die<00:02:17.190> by<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.490> I

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
someone angry when they die by it I

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.150 
someone angry when they die by it I
don't<00:02:18.930> really<00:02:19.140> have<00:02:19.260> any<00:02:19.440> other<00:02:19.650> thoughts<00:02:19.740> on

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
don't really have any other thoughts on

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.340 
don't really have any other thoughts on
