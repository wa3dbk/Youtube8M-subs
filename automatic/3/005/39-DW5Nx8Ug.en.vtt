I've<00:00:32.940> found<00:00:33.600> myself<00:00:33.780> some<00:00:34.230> mesh<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.860> I've<00:00:35.460> cut

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
I've found myself some mesh and I've cut

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.080 
I've found myself some mesh and I've cut
it<00:00:37.079> was<00:00:37.170> about<00:00:37.320> two<00:00:37.829> inches<00:00:38.100> long<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.820> an<00:00:38.940> inch

it was about two inches long to an inch
and<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.329> half<00:00:39.360> wide<00:00:41.059> and<00:00:42.059> I'm<00:00:42.239> bending<00:00:42.690> them

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
and a half wide and I'm bending them

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.060 
and a half wide and I'm bending them
over<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.789> want<00:00:44.789> some<00:00:45.149> small<00:00:45.420> ones<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:49.350> what<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.950> do

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
over I want some small ones so what I do

over I want some small ones so what I do
is<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.520> see<00:00:51.320> one<00:00:52.320> end<00:00:52.530> I've<00:00:52.710> left<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
is you see one end I've left the the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.209 
is you see one end I've left the the
wire<00:00:53.969> sticking<00:00:54.360> out<00:00:54.629> right<00:00:54.690> there<00:00:55.190> can<00:00:56.190> you

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
wire sticking out right there can you

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.370 
wire sticking out right there can you
see<00:00:56.430> that

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.460 

there's<00:01:01.950> a<00:01:02.070> good<00:01:02.310> angle<00:01:02.930> see<00:01:03.930> I've<00:01:04.110> done<00:01:04.290> that

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
there's a good angle see I've done that

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.270 
there's a good angle see I've done that
and<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.890> other<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:06.740> they're<00:01:07.740> not<00:01:07.920> sticking

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
and the other and they're not sticking

and the other and they're not sticking
out<00:01:08.550> so<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.479> bend<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.810> over<00:01:11.630> go<00:01:12.630> about<00:01:13.220> one

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
out so I bend it over go about one

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.380 
out so I bend it over go about one
square<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:18.630> see<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.940> when<00:01:20.940> I<00:01:21.000> take<00:01:21.180> my

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
square in you see that when I take my

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.730 
square in you see that when I take my
needle<00:01:21.660> nose<00:01:23.360> and<00:01:24.650> I<00:01:27.050> Bend<00:01:28.050> these<00:01:28.170> wires<00:01:28.440> down

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
needle nose and I Bend these wires down

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.210 
needle nose and I Bend these wires down
and<00:01:29.070> close<00:01:29.280> them

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
and close them

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.109 
and close them
over<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:34.280> that's<00:01:35.280> square<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.759> just

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
over this that's square I just

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.850 
over this that's square I just
overlapped<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.220> do<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.550> to<00:01:38.700> everyone<00:01:42.860> and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
overlapped and I do that to everyone and

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.859 
overlapped and I do that to everyone and
then<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.130> uh<00:01:44.840> for<00:01:45.840> my<00:01:45.990> uh<00:01:46.070> my<00:01:47.070> guide<00:01:47.780> it's<00:01:48.780> a

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
then I uh for my uh my guide it's a

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.810 
then I uh for my uh my guide it's a
little<00:01:49.140> plastic<00:01:49.560> piece<00:01:49.800> right<00:01:50.009> there<00:01:50.070> it's

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
little plastic piece right there it's

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.440 
little plastic piece right there it's
actually<00:01:51.090> one<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.509> these<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:52.050> is<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.259> float

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
actually one of these this is a float
