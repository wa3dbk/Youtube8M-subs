00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
discard the other cards this is actually

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.129 
discard the other cards this is actually
very<00:00:54.579> good<00:00:54.819> in<00:00:54.879> my<00:00:55.089> opinion<00:00:55.210> you<00:00:55.870> can<00:00:56.019> use

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:56.139 
very good in my opinion you can use

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:58.139 
very good in my opinion you can use
scars<00:00:56.440> like<00:00:56.559> research<00:00:56.979> record<00:00:57.399> and<00:00:57.579> revived

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
scars like research record and revived

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.329 
scars like research record and revived
to<00:00:58.479> use<00:00:58.600> this<00:00:58.780> power<00:00:58.989> and<00:00:59.289> its<00:00:59.589> full<00:00:59.769> potential

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
to use this power and its full potential

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.309 
to use this power and its full potential
so<00:01:00.729> first<00:01:00.999> use<00:01:01.239> research<00:01:01.629> record<00:01:02.050> to

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:02.319 
so first use research record to

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:03.779 
so first use research record to
rearrange<00:01:02.620> some<00:01:02.920> cards<00:01:03.249> from<00:01:03.339> the<00:01:03.460> top<00:01:03.639> of

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
rearrange some cards from the top of

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.399 
rearrange some cards from the top of
your<00:01:03.819> deck<00:01:04.120> then<00:01:04.690> you're<00:01:04.839> sure<00:01:05.049> you're<00:01:05.199> about

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
your deck then you're sure you're about

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.440 
your deck then you're sure you're about
to<00:01:05.470> draw<00:01:05.770> some<00:01:06.010> energy<00:01:06.400> cards<00:01:06.700> and<00:01:06.970> after<00:01:07.299> that

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
to draw some energy cards and after that

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.480 
to draw some energy cards and after that
you<00:01:07.630> use<00:01:07.780> electrode<00:01:08.290> primes<00:01:08.560> poker<00:01:08.830> power<00:01:09.100> to

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
you use electrode primes poker power to

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.130 
you use electrode primes poker power to
get<00:01:09.670> some<00:01:09.850> nice<00:01:10.030> energy<00:01:10.450> cards<00:01:10.720> for<00:01:11.050> your

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
get some nice energy cards for your

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.050 
get some nice energy cards for your
Pokemon<00:01:11.620> and<00:01:12.070> if<00:01:12.190> you<00:01:12.310> might<00:01:12.520> have<00:01:12.640> discard<00:01:12.940> a

really important Basic Pokemon

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.080 
really important Basic Pokemon
you<00:01:14.890> could<00:01:15.040> always<00:01:15.160> bring<00:01:15.460> him<00:01:15.580> back<00:01:15.760> with

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
you could always bring him back with

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.510 
you could always bring him back with
revive<00:01:16.450> and<00:01:16.720> on<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.110> same<00:01:17.320> turn<00:01:17.590> as<00:01:17.860> well<00:01:18.130> so

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
revive and on the same turn as well so

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.280 
revive and on the same turn as well so
that's<00:01:18.700> pretty<00:01:18.940> good<00:01:19.240> now<00:01:19.720> forgiving<00:01:20.200> the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
that's pretty good now forgiving the

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.110 
that's pretty good now forgiving the
energy<00:01:20.650> shoot<00:01:20.830> drew<00:01:21.040> I<00:01:21.250> suggest<00:01:21.730> putting<00:01:21.910> in

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
energy shoot drew I suggest putting in

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.610 
energy shoot drew I suggest putting in
Pokemon<00:01:22.570> like<00:01:22.750> laughter<00:01:23.110> Prime<00:01:23.380> and

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
Pokemon like laughter Prime and

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.470 
Pokemon like laughter Prime and
Magnezone<00:01:24.280> Prime<00:01:24.550> just<00:01:25.030> because<00:01:25.330> those

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
Magnezone Prime just because those

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.540 
Magnezone Prime just because those
Pokemon<00:01:25.960> work<00:01:26.170> on<00:01:26.380> how<00:01:26.680> many<00:01:26.740> energies<00:01:27.340> your

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
Pokemon work on how many energies your

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.370 
Pokemon work on how many energies your
Pokemon<00:01:28.000> have<00:01:28.210> and<00:01:28.450> they're<00:01:28.750> also<00:01:28.900> lightning

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
Pokemon have and they're also lightning

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.990 
Pokemon have and they're also lightning
Pokemon<00:01:29.800> so<00:01:30.160> it's<00:01:30.280> simple<00:01:30.550> to<00:01:30.700> have<00:01:30.880> the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
Pokemon so it's simple to have the

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.090 
Pokemon so it's simple to have the
necessary<00:01:31.120> energies<00:01:31.870> let's<00:01:32.380> look<00:01:32.560> at<00:01:32.710> lantern

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
necessary energies let's look at lantern

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.070 
necessary energies let's look at lantern
friend<00:01:33.370> Lantern<00:01:34.120> prime<00:01:34.360> as<00:01:34.540> a<00:01:34.600> great<00:01:34.810> prime
