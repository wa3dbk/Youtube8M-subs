00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:07.649
 Hi, I'm older and I'll teach you in 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.820
 this video taking advantage of that a while 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.820
 more I'm going to touch up my 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.850
 make this dye 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:22.410
 snow white the man and panic 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.289
 I put myself 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.850
 I do not have the white as if I never 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.189
 I put it on nothing then I'm going to 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.000
 teach how to make one similar to the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.000
 cool brand 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.370
 It is quite easy and much more 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.710
 economic since this brand 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.960
 that's true is very good but we 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.790
 we have so much money in our pocket to 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.070
 be retouching and retouching in 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.360
 special those light colors papers to 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.500
 every time you have them to be 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.890
 putting up 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.180
 every time the before 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.180
 here you have data 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.100
 I already have my shampoo 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.290
 the shampoo that you want to be white 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.760
 without wanting to regueiro I put one that 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.650
 It was transparent but I already put it with the 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.650
 white nothing else is like to sample 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.579
 let's open our 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.869
 our cool pot and we're going to put you 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.680
 just a min 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.680
 Dominican appointment of nothing 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.610
 and let's mix the truth do it 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.730
 because he paints a lot 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.730
 this color is something that does not give me anything 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.420
 the thing tell you I understand 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.910
 with panic 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.620
 a little bit 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.280
 I 'm sorry, it will burn me 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.280
 he died 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.580
 this is the color that manic panic brings to 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.110
 see if you can open them 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.110
 good 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.110
 sorry 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.400
 manic panic action 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.840
 this is much clearer why I feel 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.680
 me that has not given me everything and that 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.680
 I left it a good time 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.810
 Well, I recommend doing it with the 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.700
 cool comes out cheaper you can do it 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.050
 more times and just buy yourself shampoo 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.620
 special for that 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.090
 since then lately I want me to 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.820
 last longer then I do not care that I 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.730
 left me slightly violet 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:27.080
 I did what I did was put it in a 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.130
 13m comb cream 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.130
 which is white 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.780
 and I put it a little darker I did not 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.170
 grab dark or I put it on and I do not know 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.270
 he sees me so violet moves slightly 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.870
 slightly pastel very pastel but if 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.870
 I see white 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.260
 good 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.740
 for those who want to put their hair 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:09.760
 clearly you are mistreated clear that it is a 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.709
 half east 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.269
 I'm getting a treatment that is 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.269
 go chocolate 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.840
 this is very good and it is very economical 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:31.520
 I quite like like 40 pesos something like that 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.560
 Well this one you put it in your hair 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.020
 It makes you slightly Cafecito the 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.590
 hair nothing more when 3d you wash it and 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.800
 already removed 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.460
 equalization by your dog 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.080
 more chocolate 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.000
 for that I'm getting it 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.590
 I recommend how the hair feels 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.090
 then use it after I spoke to you 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.150
 of course I leave it for about 6 hours 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.810
 says it does not rinse 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.630
 but I got it after 6 hours 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:02.030
 but let it act clear good 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.030
 this gives thanks for having
