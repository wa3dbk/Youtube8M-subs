barbarians<00:04:29.910> I<00:04:30.210> think<00:04:30.540> it<00:04:31.470> buffed<00:04:31.920> charge<00:04:32.370> in

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
barbarians I think it buffed charge in

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.550 
barbarians I think it buffed charge in
my<00:04:32.790> opinion<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.360> mean<00:04:33.600> it<00:04:33.720> buffed<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.230> single

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
my opinion I mean it buffed the single

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.030 
my opinion I mean it buffed the single
target<00:04:34.980> and<00:04:36.260> that<00:04:37.260> was<00:04:37.500> one<00:04:37.650> of<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.770> things

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
target and that was one of the things

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.800 
target and that was one of the things
you<00:04:38.160> would<00:04:38.340> struggle<00:04:38.610> with<00:04:38.910> in<00:04:39.210> my<00:04:39.510> opinion

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
you would struggle with in my opinion

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.870 
you would struggle with in my opinion
with<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.050> charge<00:04:40.320> build<00:04:40.590> so<00:04:41.490> that's<00:04:41.700> nice

chance is gonna be somehow
mathematically<00:05:09.000> add<00:05:09.210> it<00:05:09.750> into<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.700> damage<00:05:11.700> it

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
mathematically add it into the damage it

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.860 
mathematically add it into the damage it
deals<00:05:12.740> not<00:05:13.740> sure<00:05:14.040> how<00:05:14.220> that<00:05:14.400> works<00:05:14.580> but<00:05:14.880> that's

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
deals not sure how that works but that's

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.090 
deals not sure how that works but that's
what<00:05:16.140> I<00:05:16.170> read<00:05:16.880> so<00:05:18.170> the<00:05:19.170> changes<00:05:19.650> have<00:05:19.860> been
