00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.910 

as<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.380> say<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.829> should<00:01:32.310> turn<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.829> before<00:01:34.829> you

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
as I say you should turn it before you

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:43.370 
as I say you should turn it before you
start<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:39.200> nice<00:01:40.700> mask<00:01:41.700> area<00:01:42.030> nice<00:01:42.899> pocket

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
start it in a nice mask area nice pocket

00:01:43.380 --> 00:02:05.250 
start it in a nice mask area nice pocket
here

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:29.520 

okay<00:02:06.260> I<00:02:13.540> think<00:02:14.540> it's<00:02:14.660> not<00:02:14.840> as<00:02:15.610> spicy

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.230 

as<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:30.740> should<00:02:30.770> be<00:02:31.100> here<00:02:31.310> somehow<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:31.880> was<00:02:32.120> a

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
as it should be here somehow it was a

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:40.660 
as it should be here somehow it was a
very<00:02:32.420> liquid<00:02:32.750> I<00:02:35.380> think<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:39.830> should<00:02:40.160> do<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.550> in

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
very liquid I think you should do it in

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.380 
very liquid I think you should do it in
the<00:02:40.730> pan<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.180> nothing<00:02:41.960> a<00:02:42.020> microwave<00:02:43.390> yeah

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
the pan and nothing a microwave yeah

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.930 
the pan and nothing a microwave yeah
it's<00:02:45.080> not<00:02:45.170> like<00:02:45.230> taste<00:02:45.770> bad<00:02:46.070> but<00:02:46.130> like<00:02:46.700> it's

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
it's not like taste bad but like it's

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.850 
it's not like taste bad but like it's
has<00:02:47.090> not<00:02:47.420> got<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.020> feeling<00:02:48.380> of<00:02:48.530> goulash<00:02:50.860> I

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860
