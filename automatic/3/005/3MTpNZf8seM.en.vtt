00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
about the light and fluffy creamy eggs

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.649 
about the light and fluffy creamy eggs
instead<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.689> dense<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.950> ear<00:01:26.130> forms<00:01:26.659> okay

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
instead of the dense to ear forms okay

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.300 
instead of the dense to ear forms okay
so<00:01:27.900> when<00:01:28.259> you're<00:01:28.409> whipping<00:01:28.740> these<00:01:28.829> eggs<00:01:29.100> up

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
so when you're whipping these eggs up

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.160 
so when you're whipping these eggs up
you<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> couple<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.090> choices<00:01:30.270> some<00:01:30.900> people

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
you have a couple of choices some people

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.219 
you have a couple of choices some people
like<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.380> have<00:01:31.640> sort<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.750> quick<00:01:33.930> whip

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
like to have sort of a just a quick whip

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.319 
like to have sort of a just a quick whip
where<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.130> still<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.549> some<00:01:35.759> visible<00:01:36.119> whites

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
where you still have some visible whites

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.200 
where you still have some visible whites
and<00:01:36.630> visible<00:01:37.020> egg<00:01:37.200> yolk<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:38.610> that's<00:01:39.000> really

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
and visible egg yolk and that's really

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.600 
and visible egg yolk and that's really
good<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.530> my<00:01:40.860> favorite<00:01:41.220> way<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.369> have

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
good but the my favorite way to have

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.340 
good but the my favorite way to have
them<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.329> whip<00:01:42.509> them<00:01:42.720> within<00:01:43.049> an<00:01:43.170> inch

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
them is just to whip them within an inch

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.410 
them is just to whip them within an inch
of<00:01:43.439> their<00:01:43.799> lives

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
of their lives

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.389 
of their lives
everything's<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.540> modulus<00:01:46.020> yellow<00:01:46.740> color<00:01:46.979> and

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
everything's a modulus yellow color and

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.010 
everything's a modulus yellow color and
I<00:01:48.270> think<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.630> makes<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.049> much<00:01:49.320> lighter<00:01:49.759> egg

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
I think that makes it a much lighter egg

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.539 
I think that makes it a much lighter egg
all<00:01:52.020> right<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.290> we're<00:01:52.409> going<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.619> preheat<00:01:53.280> our

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
all right so we're going to preheat our

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.830 
all right so we're going to preheat our
pan<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.820> little<00:01:53.939> bit<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.270> probably<00:01:54.540> should<00:01:54.810> have

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
pan a little bit I probably should have

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.600 
pan a little bit I probably should have
done<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.200> before<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.890> I'm<00:01:56.070> doing<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.460> now

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
done this before but I'm doing it now

mine medium is more like medium to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.430 
mine medium is more like medium to
medium-high<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.270> usually<00:02:09.840> go<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> little<00:02:10.229> bit

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
medium-high so I usually go a little bit

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.260 
medium-high so I usually go a little bit
lower<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.739> this<00:02:11.069> case<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> little<00:02:11.730> bit<00:02:11.819> lower<00:02:12.030> is

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
lower in this case a little bit lower is

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.580 
lower in this case a little bit lower is
going<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.480> be<00:02:12.569> better<00:02:12.750> for<00:02:13.050> that

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:09.199 
intentionally because it's just going to

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:13.509 
intentionally because it's just going to
depend<00:03:09.379> on<00:03:09.769> your<00:03:10.010> stove<00:03:10.430> so<00:03:11.209> just<00:03:11.540> wash<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:11.840> um

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519

spatula<00:03:16.969> and<00:03:17.030> I<00:03:17.150> think<00:03:17.389> these<00:03:17.540> work<00:03:17.780> out

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
spatula and I think these work out

spatula and I think these work out
really<00:03:18.169> well<00:03:18.439> because<00:03:18.799> it<00:03:19.099> just<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.519> helps

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
just a little bit so we're going to test

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.349 
just a little bit so we're going to test
it<00:03:33.530> here<00:03:33.739> nope<00:03:34.129> it's<00:03:34.519> not<00:03:34.609> ready<00:03:34.939> yet<00:03:35.030> and

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
really sometimes it's really hard to see

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.030 
really sometimes it's really hard to see
so<00:03:38.000> you<00:03:38.030> just<00:03:38.239> have<00:03:38.389> to<00:03:38.419> test<00:03:38.750> it<00:03:38.989> so<00:03:39.919> we're

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
so you just have to test it so we're

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.619 
so you just have to test it so we're
going<00:03:40.129> to<00:03:40.189> flip<00:03:40.790> ahead<00:03:40.939> and<00:03:41.359> we're<00:03:41.479> going<00:03:41.569> to

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
going to flip ahead and we're going to

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.629 
going to flip ahead and we're going to
test<00:03:41.870> it<00:03:42.079> again<00:03:42.319> this<00:03:42.799> is<00:03:42.949> not<00:03:43.129> real<00:03:43.400> time

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
test it again this is not real time

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.939 
test it again this is not real time
folks<00:03:43.970> it<00:03:44.540> did<00:03:44.810> take<00:03:45.019> longer<00:03:45.290> to<00:03:45.590> make<00:03:45.709> these

together a little bit so we're going to

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.349 
together a little bit so we're going to
scrape<00:03:56.209> all<00:03:56.449> of<00:03:56.629> those<00:03:56.750> off<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.199> bottom<00:03:57.620> so

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
scrape all of those off the bottom so

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.659 
scrape all of those off the bottom so
that<00:03:59.359> the<00:03:59.540> liquid<00:03:59.989> can<00:04:00.680> move<00:04:00.919> around<00:04:01.250> them<00:04:01.489> and

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:01.669 
that the liquid can move around them and

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:03.610 
that the liquid can move around them and
it<00:04:01.819> has<00:04:02.000> a<00:04:02.030> chance<00:04:02.329> to<00:04:02.659> touch<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:03.409> pan

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
it has a chance to touch the pan

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.789 
it has a chance to touch the pan
directly<00:04:04.299> okay<00:04:05.349> so<00:04:06.349> we're<00:04:06.500> just<00:04:06.530> going<00:04:06.739> to

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
directly okay so we're just going to

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.849 
directly okay so we're just going to
kind<00:04:07.219> of<00:04:07.310> keep<00:04:07.489> stirring<00:04:07.969> a<00:04:08.090> little<00:04:08.389> bit<00:04:08.859> until

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
kind of keep stirring a little bit until

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:14.050 
kind of keep stirring a little bit until
we<00:04:10.009> get<00:04:10.189> to<00:04:12.009> the<00:04:13.009> point<00:04:13.250> where<00:04:13.489> we<00:04:13.609> want<00:04:13.759> to<00:04:13.879> let

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
we get to the point where we want to let

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.360 
we get to the point where we want to let
it<00:04:14.180> sit<00:04:14.449> and<00:04:14.599> that's<00:04:15.139> the<00:04:15.379> process<00:04:15.620> everybody

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
it sit and that's the process everybody

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.420 
it sit and that's the process everybody
you<00:04:16.880> just<00:04:16.909> stir<00:04:17.630> it<00:04:17.810> let<00:04:18.380> it<00:04:18.409> sit<00:04:18.739> stir<00:04:19.250> it<00:04:19.370> a

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
you just stir it let it sit stir it a

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.060 
you just stir it let it sit stir it a
little<00:04:19.579> more<00:04:19.759> let<00:04:20.150> it<00:04:20.269> sit<00:04:20.509> until<00:04:20.799> you<00:04:21.799> get<00:04:21.949> it

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
little more let it sit until you get it

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.050 
little more let it sit until you get it
the<00:04:22.190> way<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.370> like<00:04:22.580> it

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060

00:04:25.269 --> 00:04:25.279 
and that's where you have to have some

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:27.060 
and that's where you have to have some
personal<00:04:25.669> preference

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
personal preference

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.300 
personal preference

if you like a really fine curd creamy

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
almost bootable egg just keep stirring

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.340 
almost bootable egg just keep stirring
it<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:33.010> whole<00:04:33.190> time<00:04:33.460> just<00:04:34.180> start<00:04:34.450> slowly<00:04:34.930> and

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.440 
it the whole time just start slowly and
then<00:04:35.560> eventually<00:04:35.890> it'll<00:04:36.280> set<00:04:37.000> up<00:04:37.150> and<00:04:37.360> it'll

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
then eventually it'll set up and it'll

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.930 
then eventually it'll set up and it'll
have<00:04:37.690> that<00:04:37.810> really<00:04:38.050> nice<00:04:38.290> silky<00:04:38.860> texture<00:04:39.370> but

that<00:04:45.880> you<00:04:46.840> want<00:04:47.050> to<00:04:47.170> let<00:04:47.320> stir<00:04:47.770> it<00:04:47.830> a<00:04:47.950> little

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
that you want to let stir it a little

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.220 
that you want to let stir it a little
bit<00:04:48.280> and<00:04:48.490> let<00:04:48.700> it<00:04:48.850> sit<00:04:49.210> for<00:04:49.240> several<00:04:49.600> seconds

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
bit and let it sit for several seconds

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.560 
bit and let it sit for several seconds
and<00:04:50.470> just<00:04:50.770> kind<00:04:51.040> of<00:04:51.160> fold<00:04:51.610> it<00:04:51.850> a<00:04:52.030> little<00:04:52.330> bit

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
and just kind of fold it a little bit

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.540 
and just kind of fold it a little bit
and<00:04:52.780> then<00:04:52.930> let<00:04:52.960> it<00:04:53.140> sit<00:04:53.500> and<00:04:53.710> then<00:04:53.950> fold<00:04:54.190> it<00:04:54.370> and

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
and then let it sit and then fold it and

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.230 
and then let it sit and then fold it and
let<00:04:54.670> it<00:04:54.700> sit

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
let it sit

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.680 
let it sit
now<00:04:55.960> this<00:04:56.170> at<00:04:56.410> this<00:04:56.680> point<00:04:57.040> it's<00:04:57.390> a<00:04:58.390> really

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
now this at this point it's a really

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.900 
now this at this point it's a really
good<00:04:58.840> time<00:04:59.080> to<00:04:59.470> add<00:04:59.620> some<00:04:59.650> vegetables<00:05:00.070> even<00:05:00.700> a

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
good time to add some vegetables even a

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.480 
good time to add some vegetables even a
little<00:05:01.210> bit<00:05:01.330> earlier<00:05:01.750> if<00:05:02.710> you<00:05:03.010> want<00:05:03.220> to<00:05:03.400> have

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
little bit earlier if you want to have

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.210 
little bit earlier if you want to have
something<00:05:04.080> cook<00:05:05.080> up<00:05:05.260> a<00:05:05.380> little<00:05:05.560> bit<00:05:05.740> more<00:05:05.980> at

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
something cook up a little bit more at

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.920 
something cook up a little bit more at
this<00:05:06.670> point<00:05:06.790> they'll<00:05:07.150> probably<00:05:07.330> just<00:05:07.570> heat

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
this point they'll probably just heat

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.170 
this point they'll probably just heat
through<00:05:08.250> and<00:05:09.250> don't<00:05:09.490> overcrowd<00:05:09.790> your<00:05:09.970> pan

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
through and don't overcrowd your pan

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.210 
through and don't overcrowd your pan
either<00:05:10.570> but<00:05:11.140> this<00:05:11.320> would<00:05:11.470> be<00:05:11.560> a<00:05:11.590> good<00:05:11.770> time<00:05:12.040> to

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
either but this would be a good time to

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.310 
either but this would be a good time to
add<00:05:12.340> some<00:05:12.640> things<00:05:12.850> but<00:05:13.840> today<00:05:14.080> we're<00:05:14.290> just

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
add some things but today we're just

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.370 
add some things but today we're just
making<00:05:14.770> plain<00:05:14.980> eggs<00:05:15.930> so<00:05:16.930> we're<00:05:17.080> just<00:05:17.110> going<00:05:17.350> to

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
making plain eggs so we're just going to

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.800 
making plain eggs so we're just going to
let<00:05:17.590> it<00:05:17.620> set<00:05:18.070> for<00:05:18.400> a<00:05:18.430> few<00:05:18.610> minutes<00:05:18.670> and<00:05:19.180> if

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
let it set for a few minutes and if

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.020 
let it set for a few minutes and if
you're<00:05:20.380> like<00:05:20.560> me<00:05:21.480> gelatinous<00:05:22.480> goo<00:05:22.630> is<00:05:23.140> gross

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
you're like me gelatinous goo is gross

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.820 
you're like me gelatinous goo is gross
so<00:05:25.030> we're<00:05:25.240> not<00:05:25.390> going<00:05:25.600> to<00:05:25.660> stop<00:05:25.960> here<00:05:26.230> you<00:05:26.710> know

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
so we're not going to stop here you know

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.740 
so we're not going to stop here you know
if<00:05:26.950> you<00:05:27.070> if<00:05:27.250> gelatinous<00:05:28.000> goo<00:05:28.060> is<00:05:28.390> your<00:05:28.540> thing

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
if you if gelatinous goo is your thing

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.900 
if you if gelatinous goo is your thing
this<00:05:29.590> might<00:05:29.830> be<00:05:29.980> a<00:05:30.010> good<00:05:30.250> point<00:05:30.430> to<00:05:30.550> take<00:05:30.730> them

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
this might be a good point to take them

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.360 
this might be a good point to take them
off<00:05:31.060> the<00:05:31.180> heat<00:05:31.530> but<00:05:32.530> for<00:05:32.890> me<00:05:33.010> what<00:05:33.220> I'm<00:05:33.340> looking

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
off the heat but for me what I'm looking

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.880 
off the heat but for me what I'm looking
for<00:05:33.910> is<00:05:34.120> for<00:05:34.480> that<00:05:34.600> moisture<00:05:34.810> on<00:05:35.320> the<00:05:35.500> top<00:05:35.710> of

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
for is for that moisture on the top of

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.380 
for is for that moisture on the top of
the<00:05:35.980> eggs<00:05:36.190> when<00:05:36.760> they're<00:05:36.970> sitting<00:05:37.360> there

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
the eggs when they're sitting there

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.030 
the eggs when they're sitting there
after<00:05:38.110> they've<00:05:38.260> been<00:05:38.410> sitting<00:05:38.620> in<00:05:38.770> the<00:05:38.860> pan

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
after they've been sitting in the pan

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.760 
after they've been sitting in the pan
for<00:05:39.280> a<00:05:39.340> couple<00:05:39.610> seconds<00:05:40.200> it's<00:05:41.200> starting<00:05:41.650> to

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
for a couple seconds it's starting to

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
and gooey once I hit that point it's

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.440 
and gooey once I hit that point it's
time<00:05:47.530> to<00:05:47.680> take<00:05:47.860> it<00:05:48.010> out<00:05:48.100> of<00:05:48.310> the<00:05:48.760> pan<00:05:48.970> and<00:05:49.180> I'll

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
pan before they look done to you because

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.400
