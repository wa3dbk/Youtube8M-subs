00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 ay drank joked and exceeded and now 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.730
 how to deal with so-called moral rebecca 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.950
 Who will try to help us psychologist? 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.960
 specialist in cognitive therapy renata 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.620
 borges finished the event well 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.660
 Raquel 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.440
 nothing better is to avoid 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.359
 constraint or how the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.520
 posture of those who never 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.500
 parties just like the carnival is 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.900
 to be before leaving the carnival that the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.570
 People should already have in mind, right? 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.400
 I liked the month actually like me 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.710
 I'm a cognitive therapist. 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.110
 we understand that our problems 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.840
 they come from the way we think 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.200
 then we think we feel and we 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.760
 We behave in that order so then 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.219
 We left for the carnival already in 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.680
 programming in a mental way with 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.469
 positive mental programming than 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.989
 we want us probably 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.390
 Let's not forget to try, shall we? 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.609
 we are usually people get 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.879
 that they have thoughts that I call 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.769
 automatic thoughts of permission are 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.810
 a beauty is that everyone 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.970
 You think you can do everything you did not 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.939
 whole year that you can exaggerate in several 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.100
 areas behave even went no no no 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.710
 it's because in reality when you have 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.320
 this thought of permission we are 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.080
 going against our internal values 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.869
 So, let's go to the right, let's go. 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.570
 to say that you have a more immediate and 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.329
 to have to do things that people 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.700
 normally I would not do it and then 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.590
 we have a moral hangover and sometimes 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.450
 even a hangover is because the newspaper 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.479
 has not been tackling the issue of 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.400
 safe sex and will avoid alcohol and 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.990
 steering wheel so sometimes we 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.280
 realizes that beyond the moral hangover 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.619
 that shame 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.990
 sometimes it can migrate to a worse thing 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.970
 it's not Nazi all these all ours 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.280
 permission thoughts they have a lot of 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.500
 relation to these excesses then the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.350
 chubby for example will have thought 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.960
 permission 18 alcoholism also goes 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.370
 being a drug user will also have 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.230
 they want a pleasure 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.480
 immediate moment they have with a 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.660
 little thought is just a little just not 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.960
 Are you going to hurt me? 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.250
 You will have no problem and then after more 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.920
 later that 111 is good for him because 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.980
 he is going against himself and against 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.640
 the more internal goals of it the values 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.710
 his 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.320
 so this does not even mean 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.870
 even causing traffic accidents and 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.290
 other problems more serious problems 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.720
 familiar with the people that she of the user 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.120
 and drug and so on but what 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.250
 People either do not police to prevent 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.920
 No one, and have fun, have fun. 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.230
 without being so permissive insertion generated 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.470
 in and you can be happy then this way 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.440
 In fact, happiness is in moderation, right? 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.930
 everything that is overdone she is so poor 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.830
 to one side as well as the other if you 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.900
 if excess is allowed of the drink and 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.120
 everything else or if you also allow 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.220
 I do not leave the house, it 's the same 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.920
 So you mean you can leave without 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.050
 need to commit excess for this you 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.470
 need to promote this program 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:16.380
 mentally in a positive way that 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.959
 goes from one in a certain way towards 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.209
 their goals and their goals because 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.600
 people understand that having these 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.850
 Thoughts of permission they are 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.950
 collaborating with themselves not them 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.870
 going against themselves is the 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.570
 and saying this against them 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.970
 and against someone you love 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.489
 enough because well we already at the end 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.709
 of carnival if someone already gave a bad note 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.390
 as they say, and now how does one 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.610
 because sometimes you take a goal 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.430
 a person today his behavior 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.470
 permissive or excessive and to remedy 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.750
 how does the approach of those who finally 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.100
 sat in his chair and said hey I 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.530
 I did it was not cool how the person 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.910
 will from now the question is 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.980
 to try is to get back what she 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.709
 somehow lost to us 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.870
 we also have several possibilities if 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.640
 You can apologize for who you hurt in 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.739
 first to recognize this self 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.590
 wait a little bit I think we can 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.840
 to recognize 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.519
 The mistake is not bad for anyone, right? 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.859
 this is positive because the person 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.110
 at the time that she puts the other one too 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.960
 wait a minute then he said maybe he is 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.880
 realizing that it was cool he was not 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.520
 cool, who knows, from now on 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.979
 he will change his attitude so be generates 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.750
 a positive expectation in the other with 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.360
 relation to their attitudes from there 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.910
 now also have to commit themselves to 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.760
 different is not just carnival in the 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.100
 whole year do not reborn in perfect is 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.780
 thanks for the recording and a good ending 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.960
 without waiting for you arrival for you 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.960
 also
