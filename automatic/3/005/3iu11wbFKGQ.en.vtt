those very often around here so that was
kind<00:05:00.960> of<00:05:01.020> a<00:05:01.520> nice<00:05:02.520> fine<00:05:02.819> for<00:05:03.090> him<00:05:03.620> if<00:05:04.620> I<00:05:04.710> get

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
kind of a nice fine for him if I get

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.649 
kind of a nice fine for him if I get
this<00:05:05.039> way<00:05:05.250> you<00:05:05.310> can<00:05:05.610> really<00:05:05.759> see<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.030> bands<00:05:06.389> in

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:06.659 
this way you can really see the bands in

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:15.529 
this way you can really see the bands in
the<00:05:06.690> slight<00:05:07.259> there<00:05:12.229> and<00:05:14.180> really<00:05:15.180> kind<00:05:15.330> of<00:05:15.419> a

the slight there and really kind of a
mystery<00:05:16.280> piece<00:05:17.280> here<00:05:17.610> this<00:05:17.909> is<00:05:18.090> all<00:05:18.330> pecked

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
mystery piece here this is all pecked

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:26.250 
mystery piece here this is all pecked
off

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:32.990 

and<00:05:26.740> then<00:05:26.890> it's<00:05:27.010> got<00:05:27.160> this<00:05:28.650> groove<00:05:29.650> born<00:05:30.010> in<00:05:30.220> it

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.950 

doesn't<00:05:34.000> continue<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.570> whole<00:05:34.690> way<00:05:34.840> around

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
doesn't continue the whole way around

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.900 
doesn't continue the whole way around
although<00:05:35.410> there<00:05:35.680> are<00:05:35.830> some<00:05:36.870> indications<00:05:37.870> I

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
although there are some indications I

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.800 
although there are some indications I
don't<00:05:39.910> know<00:05:40.140> just<00:05:41.140> kind<00:05:41.470> of<00:05:41.530> a<00:05:42.810> strange

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
don't know just kind of a strange

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.980 
don't know just kind of a strange
looking<00:05:44.230> piece<00:05:44.560> but<00:05:44.920> I<00:05:45.600> know<00:05:46.600> what<00:05:46.720> they<00:05:46.840> used

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
looking piece but I know what they used

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:55.550 
looking piece but I know what they used
it<00:05:47.170> for<00:05:47.350> I'm<00:05:47.560> sure<00:05:47.590> they<00:05:47.860> used<00:05:47.980> for<00:05:48.220> something

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:05.600 

well<00:05:56.560> what<00:05:56.950> can<00:05:56.980> you<00:05:57.250> say<00:05:57.430> about<00:05:57.460> this<00:05:57.880> piece

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.080 

again<00:06:06.610> don't<00:06:08.130> don't<00:06:09.130> see<00:06:09.340> pieces<00:06:09.580> like<00:06:09.760> this

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
again don't don't see pieces like this

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.720 
again don't don't see pieces like this
very<00:06:10.300> often<00:06:10.570> from<00:06:10.930> around<00:06:11.170> here<00:06:11.730> measures

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:12.730 
very often from around here measures

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:18.510 
very often from around here measures
exactly<00:06:12.910> three<00:06:13.480> inches<00:06:17.190> guess<00:06:18.190> I'm<00:06:18.340> going<00:06:18.430> to

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
exactly three inches guess I'm going to

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.970 
exactly three inches guess I'm going to
call<00:06:18.700> it<00:06:18.730> a<00:06:18.880> big<00:06:19.090> sandy<00:06:19.540> but<00:06:19.750> every<00:06:20.320> big<00:06:20.530> sandy

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:20.980 
call it a big sandy but every big sandy

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.800 
call it a big sandy but every big sandy
that<00:06:21.130> I<00:06:21.160> have<00:06:21.460> has<00:06:21.760> a<00:06:21.790> ground<00:06:22.120> base<00:06:22.360> in<00:06:22.630> this

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
that I have has a ground base in this

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:31.230 
that I have has a ground base in this
base<00:06:23.080> is<00:06:23.110> not<00:06:23.560> ground<00:06:29.670> so<00:06:30.670> as<00:06:30.760> far<00:06:30.880> as<00:06:31.060> the

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
base is not ground so as far as the

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.680 
base is not ground so as far as the
break<00:06:31.480> goes<00:06:31.810> you<00:06:32.710> can<00:06:32.920> see<00:06:33.190> that<00:06:33.520> it's<00:06:33.910> it's<00:06:34.510> a

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
break goes you can see that it's it's a

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:41.180 
break goes you can see that it's it's a
fresh<00:06:34.960> break<00:06:36.180> I<00:06:37.180> did<00:06:37.630> go<00:06:37.810> talk<00:06:38.110> to<00:06:38.290> the<00:06:38.380> farmer

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.500 

because<00:06:42.190> I<00:06:42.400> wanted<00:06:42.700> to<00:06:42.760> see<00:06:42.940> how<00:06:43.150> he<00:06:43.180> would

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
because I wanted to see how he would

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.210 
because I wanted to see how he would
feel<00:06:43.540> about<00:06:43.840> me<00:06:44.080> going<00:06:44.350> out<00:06:44.470> there<00:06:44.800> with<00:06:44.830> my

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
feel about me going out there with my

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.660 
feel about me going out there with my
sifter<00:06:45.700> and<00:06:46.980> trying<00:06:47.980> to<00:06:48.070> see<00:06:48.160> if<00:06:48.280> I<00:06:48.370> could<00:06:48.430> come

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:48.670 
sifter and trying to see if I could come

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:49.950 
sifter and trying to see if I could come
up<00:06:48.850> with<00:06:48.940> that<00:06:49.090> piece<00:06:49.300> might<00:06:49.540> be<00:06:49.690> a<00:06:49.720> long<00:06:49.900> shot

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
up with that piece might be a long shot

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.390 
up with that piece might be a long shot
but<00:06:51.210> he<00:06:52.210> was<00:06:52.420> on<00:06:52.780> board<00:06:53.140> with<00:06:53.290> that<00:06:53.400> he's

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 
but he was on board with that he's

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.790 
but he was on board with that he's
pretty<00:06:54.580> impressed<00:06:54.970> with<00:06:55.180> the<00:06:55.300> find<00:06:55.570> and<00:06:55.930> even

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
pretty impressed with the find and even

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.020 
pretty impressed with the find and even
though<00:06:56.890> he's<00:06:57.040> got<00:06:57.100> a<00:06:57.250> little<00:06:57.490> bit<00:06:57.700> of<00:06:57.730> corn

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.030 
though he's got a little bit of corn

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.580 
though he's got a little bit of corn
coming<00:06:58.090> up<00:06:59.850> he<00:07:00.850> said<00:07:01.090> I<00:07:01.120> wouldn't<00:07:01.480> really<00:07:01.600> hurt

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:02.590 
coming up he said I wouldn't really hurt

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.280 
coming up he said I wouldn't really hurt
anything<00:07:02.920> by<00:07:03.250> taking<00:07:03.610> out<00:07:03.730> a<00:07:03.930> you<00:07:04.930> know<00:07:05.080> maybe

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:05.290 
anything by taking out a you know maybe

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.310 
anything by taking out a you know maybe
a<00:07:05.380> five<00:07:05.590> foot<00:07:05.910> rub<00:07:06.910> or<00:07:07.180> one<00:07:07.480> row<00:07:07.690> of<00:07:07.810> corn<00:07:08.080> about

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:08.320 
a five foot rub or one row of corn about

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.880 
a five foot rub or one row of corn about
five<00:07:08.530> feet<00:07:08.680> long<00:07:08.740> so<00:07:09.370> that's<00:07:10.360> what<00:07:10.600> we'll<00:07:10.890> try

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:11.890 
five feet long so that's what we'll try

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.810 
five feet long so that's what we'll try
to<00:07:11.980> do<00:07:12.250> and<00:07:12.610> if<00:07:13.570> not<00:07:14.170> maybe<00:07:14.530> I'll<00:07:14.860> and<00:07:15.580> I'm

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:15.820 
to do and if not maybe I'll and I'm

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.790 
to do and if not maybe I'll and I'm
considering<00:07:16.270> maybe<00:07:16.630> restoring<00:07:17.260> that<00:07:17.290> you

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 
considering maybe restoring that you

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.650 
considering maybe restoring that you
know<00:07:17.920> you<00:07:17.980> can<00:07:18.190> always<00:07:18.310> remove<00:07:18.730> a<00:07:18.880> restoration

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:19.660 
know you can always remove a restoration

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.690 
know you can always remove a restoration
if<00:07:20.620> you<00:07:20.740> come<00:07:20.950> up<00:07:20.980> with<00:07:21.190> a<00:07:21.220> piece<00:07:21.430> in<00:07:21.610> the

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:21.700 
if you come up with a piece in the

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:30.290 
if you come up with a piece in the
future<00:07:26.040> okay<00:07:27.040> well<00:07:27.550> thanks<00:07:28.030> for<00:07:28.150> tuning<00:07:28.450> in<00:07:28.920> I
