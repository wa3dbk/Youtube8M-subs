Johnson<00:00:24.450> seemed<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.050> wear<00:00:25.200> out<00:00:25.380> he<00:00:25.980> had<00:00:26.070> no

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
idea why he went getting to start

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.220 
idea why he went getting to start
falling<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.330> thought<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.750> was<00:00:30.840> like<00:00:31.020> just

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
falling so I thought it was like just

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.930 
falling so I thought it was like just
like<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.500> drought<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.369> everyone<00:00:32.759> goes

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
like a drought like that everyone goes

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.630 
like a drought like that everyone goes
through<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.720> so<00:00:34.470> he<00:00:34.680> worked<00:00:34.860> harder<00:00:35.280> which<00:00:35.520> as

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
through and so he worked harder which as

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.189 
through and so he worked harder which as
it<00:00:35.760> turns<00:00:35.970> out<00:00:36.180> was<00:00:36.390> probably<00:00:36.629> the<00:00:37.050> worst

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
it turns out was probably the worst

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.140 
it turns out was probably the worst
thing<00:00:37.500> he<00:00:37.650> could<00:00:37.770> do<00:00:37.980> what<00:00:38.580> Johnson<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
thing he could do what Johnson and

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.280 
thing he could do what Johnson and
everyone<00:00:39.480> else<00:00:39.629> didn't<00:00:39.900> know<00:00:40.020> at<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.170> time

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
everyone else didn't know at the time

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.290 
everyone else didn't know at the time
was<00:00:40.949> that<00:00:40.980> he<00:00:41.160> had<00:00:41.280> developed<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.760> blood<00:00:42.030> clot

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
was that he had developed a blood clot

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.390 
was that he had developed a blood clot
in<00:00:42.330> each<00:00:42.750> lung<00:00:43.080> a<00:00:43.379> potentially<00:00:44.100> fatal

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
in each lung a potentially fatal

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.580 
in each lung a potentially fatal
condition<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.570> fatigue<00:00:45.900> got<00:00:46.050> worse<00:00:46.290> and<00:00:46.559> so

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
condition the fatigue got worse and so

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.830 
condition the fatigue got worse and so
did<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.920> pain<00:00:47.190> never<00:00:47.970> more<00:00:48.269> evident<00:00:48.420> than<00:00:48.720> in

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
