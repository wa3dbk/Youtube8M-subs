some cases let's check out the Hawaiian

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.470 
some cases let's check out the Hawaiian
island<00:00:08.010> chain<00:00:08.280> right<00:00:08.490> here<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:08.970> again<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.389> was

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
island chain right here and again it was

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.509 
island chain right here and again it was
the<00:00:09.599> island<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.080> Kauai<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.920> definitely<00:00:11.370> took

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
the island of Kauai that definitely took

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.450 
the island of Kauai that definitely took
a<00:00:11.580> direct<00:00:12.150> hit<00:00:12.330> from<00:00:12.809> Nikki<00:00:13.530> last<00:00:14.190> night

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
a direct hit from Nikki last night

a direct hit from Nikki last night
here's<00:00:14.790> Kauai<00:00:15.179> here's<00:00:15.750> Oahu<00:00:16.139> with<00:00:16.590> honolulu

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
here's Kauai here's Oahu with honolulu

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.700 
here's Kauai here's Oahu with honolulu
honolulu<00:00:18.090> was<00:00:18.720> just<00:00:18.990> basically<00:00:19.140> on<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
honolulu was just basically on the

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.040 
honolulu was just basically on the
fringes<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.640> hurricane<00:00:20.910> with<00:00:21.359> some<00:00:21.600> heavy

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
fringes of the hurricane with some heavy

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.830 
fringes of the hurricane with some heavy
rains<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.769> some<00:00:22.949> high<00:00:23.220> surf<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.630> some

rains and some high surf and some

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.720 
rains and some high surf and some
gusting<00:00:25.260> winds<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.710> think<00:00:25.859> Honolulu<00:00:26.519> had<00:00:26.699> a

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
gusting winds I think Honolulu had a

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.540 
gusting winds I think Honolulu had a
wind<00:00:26.970> gusts<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.420> about<00:00:27.750> 55<00:00:28.140> miles<00:00:28.560> per<00:00:28.769> hour<00:00:29.039> so

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
wind gusts to about 55 miles per hour so

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.330 
wind gusts to about 55 miles per hour so
and<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:30.660> bit<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.960> storm<00:00:31.230> surge<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.830> with<00:00:32.309> a

we have no no official estimates of

we have no no official estimates of
damage<00:00:48.329> at<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:49.020> information<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.620> very

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
damage at the the information is very

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.680 
damage at the the information is very
very<00:00:49.950> sketchy<00:00:50.370> out<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.879> region<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:51.449> it

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
very sketchy out of that region but it

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.889 
very sketchy out of that region but it
is<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.559> pretty<00:00:52.800> good<00:00:52.980> bet<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.219> Kawhi<00:00:53.730> was<00:00:54.090> very

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
is a pretty good bet that Kawhi was very

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.740 
is a pretty good bet that Kawhi was very
severely<00:00:55.500> damaged<00:00:56.010> by<00:00:56.520> Hurricane<00:00:57.210> Iniki<00:00:57.329> the

and lihue before the report stopped had

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.969 
wind gusts to about 70 to 75 miles an
hour<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:09.000> before<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:10.080> hurricane<00:01:10.229> came

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
hour just before the hurricane came

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.399 
hour just before the hurricane came
ashore<00:01:11.310> about<00:01:11.880> two<00:01:12.060> hours<00:01:12.210> before<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.350> it

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
ashore about two hours before that so it

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.870 
ashore about two hours before that so it
looks<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:13.619> top<00:01:13.979> winds<00:01:14.250> were<00:01:14.460> probably<00:01:14.670> in

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
looks like top winds were probably in

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.730 
looks like top winds were probably in
the<00:01:14.970> neighborhood<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.330> 140<00:01:16.110> miles<00:01:16.320> per<00:01:16.619> hour

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the neighborhood of 140 miles per hour
