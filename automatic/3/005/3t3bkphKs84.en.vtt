00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.910

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.790
 and so on, I'll show you again 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.350
 short as I felt that and with 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.830
 an airbrush gun and the video 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.110

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.309
 I just do not cover you here 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.019
 that's a normal one 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.790
 You can get an airbrush pistol at Baumarkt 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.449
 buy the cost does not cost much 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.860
 about 30 euro yes if you have the on 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.930
 The next level lift is then 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.140
 that was my success then 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.629
 continue and files is just important loud 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.460
 then you are usually nothing for it 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.530
 keep painting or anything else 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.450
 to do it and I use that stop 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.090
 remains to this matt effect offline 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.230
 on it to make popular culture on it 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.230
 now this is going to be loud 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.960
 if you do that then it's got 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.910
 very important that their layer for 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.650
 layer on it because then yes you are 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.030
 what's in here and would you mind that 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.000
 everything to make right then he will 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.190
 under pain like that about 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.300
 very little knew 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.369
 then it's not that math anymore 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.690
 effect but hold as well as when he 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.030
 you would be covered in chocolate 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.780

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.940

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.729
