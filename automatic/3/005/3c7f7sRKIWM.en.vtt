00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
fire rate mode and you know I try to get

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.770 
fire rate mode and you know I try to get
some<00:00:47.129> kills<00:00:47.340> with<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.059> pretty<00:00:48.329> hard<00:00:48.600> i

some kills with it it is pretty hard i

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.209 
some kills with it it is pretty hard i
actually<00:00:49.079> did<00:00:49.289> end<00:00:49.500> up<00:00:49.739> getting<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:50.070> nice

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
actually did end up getting a nice

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
amount of kills with the triple fiery

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.529 
amount of kills with the triple fiery
although<00:00:52.739> i<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:52.980> not<00:00:53.340> recommend<00:00:53.760> using<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
although i do not recommend using the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.400 
although i do not recommend using the
triple<00:00:54.960> fiery<00:00:55.760> because<00:00:56.760> he<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.780> think<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.140> shoot

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
triple fiery because he I think I shoot

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.990 
triple fiery because he I think I shoot
the<00:00:58.440> Wallace<00:00:58.949> sometimes<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.670> while<00:00:59.820> you're

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the Wallace sometimes and while you're

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.510 
the Wallace sometimes and while you're
moving<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:01.020> shots<00:01:01.410> are<00:01:01.680> really<00:01:01.739> not<00:01:02.250> close

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
moving the shots are really not close

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.270 
moving the shots are really not close
together<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.989> all<00:01:04.170> over<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.710> recoil

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
together the it's all over the recoil

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.539 
together the it's all over the recoil
forward<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.710> but<00:01:07.710> let's<00:01:07.890> get<00:01:08.010> into<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> stats

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
forward and but let's get into the stats

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.670 
forward and but let's get into the stats
now<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.659> first<00:01:09.840> thing<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.229> stats<00:01:10.530> are

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
now the first thing is the stats are

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.160 
now the first thing is the stats are
exactly<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.280> same<00:01:11.310> as<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.820> regular<00:01:11.970> qz<00:01:12.689> 95

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
exactly the same as the regular qz 95

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.830 
exactly the same as the regular qz 95
except<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> reload<00:01:14.250> rate<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:15.360> damage

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
except for the reload rate but damage

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.640 
except for the reload rate but damage
wise<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:17.580> exact<00:01:18.090> same<00:01:18.330> thing<00:01:18.750> it's

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
wise it's the exact same thing it's

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.770 
wise it's the exact same thing it's
going<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.830> be<00:01:19.920> four<00:01:20.130> shots<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.119> handed

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
going to be four shots to the handed

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.100 
going to be four shots to the handed
chest<00:01:22.110> doing<00:01:23.009> 33<00:01:23.460> damage<00:01:23.790> each<00:01:23.939> five<00:01:24.570> shots<00:01:24.869> to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
chest doing 33 damage each five shots to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.490 
chest doing 33 damage each five shots to
the<00:01:25.140> leg<00:01:25.380> doing<00:01:25.619> 23<00:01:26.280> damage<00:01:26.640> each<00:01:27.259> three<00:01:28.259> shots

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
the leg doing 23 damage each three shots

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.330 
the leg doing 23 damage each three shots
that<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.799> tumbling<00:01:29.070> doing<00:01:29.310> 36<00:01:29.880> damage<00:01:30.240> each<00:01:30.420> so

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
that is tumbling doing 36 damage each so

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.340 
that is tumbling doing 36 damage each so
sadly<00:01:32.340> those<00:01:32.790> 33<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.659> hand<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.110> chest

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
sadly those 33 to the hand and the chest

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.630 
sadly those 33 to the hand and the chest
which<00:01:34.500> means<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.890> will<00:01:34.979> be<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> fourth<00:01:35.400> shot

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
which means it will be a fourth shot

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.760 
which means it will be a fourth shot
kill<00:01:36.110> they<00:01:37.110> didn't<00:01:37.380> give<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.740> extra

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
kill they didn't give you that extra

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.330 
kill they didn't give you that extra
point<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.430> damage<00:01:38.549> for<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> three<00:01:39.420> shot<00:01:39.689> kill

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
point of damage for the three shot kill

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.130 
point of damage for the three shot kill
so<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.490> will<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:41.820> forth<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> hand<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
so it will be forth to the hand in the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.649 
so it will be forth to the hand in the
chest<00:01:43.409> at<00:01:44.070> long<00:01:44.369> range<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:45.000> still<00:01:45.329> four

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
chest at long range it's still four

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.080 
chest at long range it's still four
shots<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.229> hand<00:01:46.590> or<00:01:46.740> channel<00:01:47.189> 31<00:01:47.520> damage

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
shots to the hand or channel 31 damage

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.600 
shots to the hand or channel 31 damage
five<00:01:48.840> shots<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.290> leg<00:01:49.439> doing<00:01:49.680> 22<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.369> three

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
five shots that leg doing 22 and three

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.539 
five shots that leg doing 22 and three
to<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.880> stomach<00:01:51.149> doing<00:01:51.450> 35<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.290> same<00:01:53.220> amount

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
to the stomach doing 35 so same amount

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.999 
to the stomach doing 35 so same amount
of<00:01:53.610> shots<00:01:53.790> ago<00:01:54.060> epic<00:01:54.750> headshot<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> win

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.280 

so<00:01:59.180> the<00:02:00.180> reload<00:02:00.479> rate<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.810> actually<00:02:00.960> about

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
so the reload rate is actually about

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.410 
so the reload rate is actually about
half<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.770> second<00:02:02.159> faster<00:02:02.280> at<00:02:03.170> 2.1<00:02:04.759> this<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.939> GP

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
half a second faster at 2.1 this is a GP

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.750 
half a second faster at 2.1 this is a GP
grade<00:02:06.689> item<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.459> get<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.730> through

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.670 
grade item so you have to get it through
crates<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
crates and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.440 
crates and

that's always a pain and he has to do

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.240 
that's always a pain and he has to do
