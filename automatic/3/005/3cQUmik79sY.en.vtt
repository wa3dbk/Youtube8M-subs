fa-18<00:00:02.340> Hornet<00:00:03.110> that<00:00:04.110> I<00:00:04.230> fixed<00:00:04.500> for<00:00:04.650> night

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
fa-18 Hornet that I fixed for night

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.249 
fa-18 Hornet that I fixed for night
flying<00:00:05.640> I<00:00:05.970> put<00:00:06.150> some<00:00:06.299> night<00:00:06.509> lights<00:00:06.750> on<00:00:07.020> that

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
flying I put some night lights on that

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.860 
flying I put some night lights on that
came<00:00:07.740> out<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.179> three-channel<00:00:09.179> helicopter

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
came out of a three-channel helicopter

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.509 
came out of a three-channel helicopter
they<00:00:09.960> quit<00:00:10.170> working<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.920> light<00:00:11.099> still<00:00:11.370> work

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
they quit working the light still work

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.450 
they quit working the light still work
so<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.759> double<00:00:12.090> taped<00:00:12.530> the<00:00:13.530> battery<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.219> the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
so I double taped the battery to the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.269 
so I double taped the battery to the
circuit<00:00:15.030> board<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.450> then<00:00:16.139> put<00:00:16.800> double<00:00:17.130> tape

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
circuit board and then put double tape

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.650 
circuit board and then put double tape
underneath<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.789> bottom<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.390> then

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
underneath the bottom of it and then

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.769 
underneath the bottom of it and then
tape<00:00:18.869> over<00:00:19.140> top<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.560> again<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:20.160> it's<00:00:20.850> real

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
tape over top of it again and it's real

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.450 
tape over top of it again and it's real
secure<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.320> not<00:00:22.439> gonna<00:00:22.529> go<00:00:22.769> nowhere<00:00:22.980> as<00:00:23.340> you

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
secure it's not gonna go nowhere as you

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.820 
secure it's not gonna go nowhere as you
can<00:00:23.609> see<00:00:23.789> there<00:00:24.109> and<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.230> thought<00:00:25.380> I'd<00:00:25.529> bring<00:00:25.650> it

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
can see there and I thought I'd bring it

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.130 
can see there and I thought I'd bring it
over<00:00:26.010> here<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.220> try<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.699> flight<00:00:27.449> with<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.900> it's

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
over here and try a flight with it it's

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.080 
over here and try a flight with it it's
not<00:00:28.349> dark<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.189> it's<00:00:29.340> not<00:00:29.460> really<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.789> night

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
not dark so it's not really a night

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.060 
not dark so it's not really a night
flight<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:30.689> we're<00:00:31.260> gonna<00:00:31.380> try<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.679> anyways

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
flight but we're gonna try it anyways

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:43.340 
flight but we're gonna try it anyways
maybe<00:00:32.309> we<00:00:32.520> can<00:00:32.640> see<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> lights<00:00:42.079> get<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.230> to

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
maybe we can see the lights get it to

00:00:43.350 --> 00:01:08.430 
maybe we can see the lights get it to
where<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.739> see<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.040> lights

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:20.100 

you<00:01:08.740> see<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.070> lights<00:01:09.250> or<00:01:09.460> not

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110

my landing gear on here tonight with the
landing<00:01:25.510> gear<00:01:25.570> it<00:01:25.810> stops<00:01:26.050> a<00:01:26.260> most<00:01:26.830> of<00:01:26.980> that

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
landing gear it stops a most of that

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.150 
landing gear it stops a most of that
tail<00:01:27.430> up<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.960> down<00:01:29.170> stuff<00:01:29.500> whenever<00:01:29.950> there's

to fly my plane most of time listen here

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.960 
to fly my plane most of time listen here
I<00:02:41.010> fly<00:02:41.280> my<00:02:41.310> backyard<00:02:43.400> fly<00:02:44.400> pretty<00:02:44.700> good

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
I can't really judge those trees like I

00:02:51.620 --> 00:03:15.070 
I can't really judge those trees like I
wind<00:02:52.620> up<00:02:52.799> there<00:02:53.040> now

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.770 

maybe<00:03:15.650> like<00:03:15.920> this<00:03:16.100> you<00:03:16.370> absolutely<00:03:16.730> I<00:03:17.540> just

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
maybe like this you absolutely I just

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.090 
maybe like this you absolutely I just
say<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:17.900> should<00:03:18.230> have<00:03:18.320> left<00:03:18.470> my<00:03:18.710> landing<00:03:19.070> gear

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
say I should have left my landing gear

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.120 
say I should have left my landing gear
on<00:03:19.400> there<00:03:19.640> because<00:03:20.170> you<00:03:21.170> don't<00:03:21.320> really<00:03:21.560> fly<00:03:21.830> as

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
on there because you don't really fly as

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.820 
on there because you don't really fly as
good<00:03:22.430> as<00:03:22.520> it<00:03:22.640> would<00:03:22.880> good<00:03:23.660> landing<00:03:24.140> gear<00:03:24.440> seems

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
good as it would good landing gear seems

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.120 
good as it would good landing gear seems
like<00:03:24.980> kind<00:03:25.280> of<00:03:25.310> help<00:03:25.520> stabilize<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.150> little<00:03:26.570> bit

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
like kind of help stabilize a little bit

00:03:27.130 --> 00:04:06.199 
like kind of help stabilize a little bit
when<00:03:28.130> it's<00:03:28.280> a<00:03:28.460> little<00:03:29.060> windy

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:12.339 

if<00:04:06.689> a<00:04:06.930> teen<00:04:07.590> Hornet<00:04:08.040> flies<00:04:08.340> pretty<00:04:08.609> good

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.709 

it's<00:04:12.799> up<00:04:12.950> there<00:04:13.219> catching<00:04:13.790> a<00:04:13.849> lot<00:04:13.999> of<00:04:14.060> wind<00:04:14.359> you

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:14.719 
it's up there catching a lot of wind you

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:16.090 
it's up there catching a lot of wind you
know<00:04:14.780> there's<00:04:15.079> not<00:04:15.230> much<00:04:15.469> wind<00:04:15.739> out<00:04:15.920> here

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
know there's not much wind out here

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.080 
know there's not much wind out here
today<00:04:16.220> it's<00:04:16.549> doing<00:04:16.850> fairly<00:04:17.620> very<00:04:18.620> good

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
today it's doing fairly very good

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.699 
today it's doing fairly very good
centered<00:04:20.090> that<00:04:20.239> light<00:04:20.479> so<00:04:20.840> that<00:04:20.870> it<00:04:21.440> would

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
centered that light so that it would

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.200 
centered that light so that it would
keep<00:04:21.979> the<00:04:22.160> natural<00:04:23.740> flight<00:04:24.740> of<00:04:24.919> the<00:04:25.130> plane<00:04:25.789> so

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
keep the natural flight of the plane so

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.200 
keep the natural flight of the plane so
that<00:04:26.360> it<00:04:26.419> wouldn't<00:04:26.690> be<00:04:26.780> to<00:04:27.139> nose<00:04:27.380> heavy<00:04:27.680> or<00:04:28.210> to

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
that it wouldn't be to nose heavy or to

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.050 
that it wouldn't be to nose heavy or to
tell<00:04:29.479> area<00:04:29.900> pretty<00:04:30.590> much<00:04:30.710> found<00:04:31.699> the<00:04:31.849> place

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
tell area pretty much found the place

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.029 
tell area pretty much found the place
that<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:32.360> needs<00:04:32.509> to<00:04:32.660> be<00:04:32.810> that's<00:04:33.470> what<00:04:33.740> you<00:04:33.860> have

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
that it needs to be that's what you have

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:42.020 
that it needs to be that's what you have
to<00:04:34.130> do<00:04:34.310> if<00:04:34.400> we<00:04:34.430> did<00:04:34.759> it
