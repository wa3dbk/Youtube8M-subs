00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:05.710
 It is a part of the viewport menu that offers almost common menus 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:11.650

 We will be part of providing methods to extract curves 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:26.230
 On the Surface menu 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:33.150
 You can create or transform surfaces based on curves 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.150
 Here are some ways to edit the interior of the surface 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:45.340
