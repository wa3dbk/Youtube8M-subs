single red bar and then the true
connections<00:00:21.840> kind<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.109> filtering<00:00:22.439> later

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
connections kind of filtering later

people<00:00:24.420> often<00:00:24.689> ask<00:00:24.810> me<00:00:25.019> how<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.260> can<00:00:25.410> tell<00:00:25.710> who's

people often ask me how I can tell who's
host<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.699> I've<00:00:26.820> made<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> habit<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.630> checking

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
host and I've made a habit of checking

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.720 
host and I've made a habit of checking
the<00:00:28.349> scoreboard<00:00:28.920> as<00:00:29.130> soon<00:00:29.340> as<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.580> game

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the scoreboard as soon as the game

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.229 
the scoreboard as soon as the game
starts<00:00:30.090> immediately<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.720> with<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:32.239> it

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
starts immediately and with that it

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.819 
starts immediately and with that it
gives<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> hint<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.200> doesn't<00:00:34.500> always<00:00:34.590> tell

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
gives you a hint it doesn't always tell

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.380 
gives you a hint it doesn't always tell
you<00:00:34.950> exactly<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.489> one<00:00:35.640> was<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> really<00:00:36.180> clear

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
you exactly that one was a really clear

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.940 
you exactly that one was a really clear
example<00:00:36.899> where<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.440> guy<00:00:37.559> with<00:00:37.770> four

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
example where that that guy with four

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.830 
example where that that guy with four
bars<00:00:38.190> was<00:00:38.399> obviously<00:00:38.820> host<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.690> what<00:00:39.780> was

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
bars was obviously host and what was

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.510 
bars was obviously host and what was
happening<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.379> all<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> other<00:00:40.770> xboxes<00:00:41.340> were

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
happening is all the other xboxes were

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.360 
happening is all the other xboxes were
sort<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.730> checking<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.950> pinging<00:00:43.950> back<00:00:44.160> and

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
sort of checking in and pinging back and

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.740 
sort of checking in and pinging back and
forth<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.789> see<00:00:44.940> how<00:00:45.059> their<00:00:45.210> connection<00:00:45.600> really

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
forth to see how their connection really

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.670 
forth to see how their connection really
was<00:00:46.700> if<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.000> are<00:00:48.210> host<00:00:48.480> usually<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.500> have<00:00:49.620> a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
was if you are host usually you have a

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.350 
was if you are host usually you have a
little<00:00:50.219> longer<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.640> join<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.969> game<00:00:51.149> because

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
little longer to join the game because

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.729 
little longer to join the game because
everyone<00:00:51.629> else<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.870> still<00:00:51.960> connecting<00:00:52.590> and

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
everyone else is still connecting and

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.560 
everyone else is still connecting and
your<00:00:52.949> countdown<00:00:53.250> might<00:00:53.579> go<00:00:53.730> from<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.120> 17

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
your countdown might go from like 17

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.930 
your countdown might go from like 17
seconds<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.110> instead<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.500> five<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.100> when<00:00:56.850> you

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
seconds and instead of five and when you

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.150 
seconds and instead of five and when you
check<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.149> scoreboard<00:00:57.570> right<00:00:57.870> away<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.890> or

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
away from the controller I think I was

my KD even went up during this batch of
team<00:01:57.149> deathmatch<00:01:57.540> because<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.350> team

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
team deathmatch because in team

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
maximizing my kill death spread it's not

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.330 
maximizing my kill death spread it's not
about<00:02:02.820> getting<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.180> most<00:02:03.299> kills<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.649> it's

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
your kill death spread and of course is

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.990 
your kill death spread and of course is
two<00:02:37.590> sides<00:02:37.829> of<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.010> right<00:02:38.250> one<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.760> want<00:02:38.940> to

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
so so I was trying to get a good score

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.780 
so so I was trying to get a good score
and<00:05:09.440> I<00:05:09.650> hopped<00:05:09.830> in<00:05:10.010> this<00:05:10.100> mercenary<00:05:10.460> team

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
and I hopped in this mercenary team

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.930 
and I hopped in this mercenary team
deathmatch<00:05:10.820> and<00:05:12.010> and<00:05:13.010> I<00:05:13.130> find<00:05:13.640> some<00:05:13.820> bad

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
deathmatch and and I find some bad

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.340 
deathmatch and and I find some bad
players<00:05:14.210> and<00:05:14.480> I<00:05:14.630> rack<00:05:14.780> up<00:05:14.960> a<00:05:15.050> couple<00:05:15.230> good

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
players and I rack up a couple good

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.810 
players and I rack up a couple good
games<00:05:15.470> I<00:05:15.740> have<00:05:15.770> another<00:05:16.100> one<00:05:16.190> that's<00:05:16.610> far

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
games I have another one that's far

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.130 
games I have another one that's far
better<00:05:16.970> than<00:05:17.090> this<00:05:17.710> so<00:05:19.120> the<00:05:20.120> strategy<00:05:20.360> in<00:05:20.810> this

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
better than this so the strategy in this

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.320 
better than this so the strategy in this
it<00:05:21.470> is<00:05:21.800> not<00:05:22.010> so<00:05:22.190> much<00:05:22.370> controlling<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.120> map

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
it is not so much controlling the map

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.540 
it is not so much controlling the map
it's<00:05:24.230> not<00:05:24.470> you<00:05:24.890> know<00:05:24.950> rushing<00:05:25.430> around

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
it's not you know rushing around

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.040 
it's not you know rushing around
although<00:05:26.000> you<00:05:26.300> know<00:05:26.390> some<00:05:26.540> people<00:05:26.780> do<00:05:26.900> that

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
although you know some people do that

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.110 
although you know some people do that
and<00:05:27.200> have<00:05:27.290> a<00:05:27.350> lot<00:05:27.590> of<00:05:27.650> success<00:05:28.070> I<00:05:28.280> like<00:05:28.850> to<00:05:28.970> own
