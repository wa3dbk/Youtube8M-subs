00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello, today I want to show 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.589
 the result of such a small work on 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.920
 customizing was my first such 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.240
 trial actually since I moved 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.130
 I'm not here at the moment 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.940
 masterful all the time want something 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:22.050
 do with your hands today like this 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.330
 slightly upgraded Chinese knife 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.019
 replica 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.060
 Emerson secu se 7 tanto but if you see 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.750
 what's on the ends though we all have 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.760
 and worldly on ordinary screws and 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.980
 actually today was painted g10 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.160
 I went into one of the shops came across 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.320
 what kind of beach paint is so matt 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.320
 pleasant quick-drying in the army 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.420
 but decided to try one 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.840
 green and decided to paint it 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.840
 the timer itself in the so-called camouflage 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.550
 cryptic especially if the same 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.800
 make multiple colors 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.980
 Looks pretty good, let's say 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.180
 so immediately like that so well the knife did not 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:10.200
 more pleasant well, respectively, were cleaned 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:14.869
 Washers were a little polished here 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:19.770
 but actually the knife was sharpened see on 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.900
 the knife was sharpened before 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.850
 I decided to hide it to sharpen 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.790
 tin can to understand 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.210
 what is here with a piece of iron what else 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.490
 as therefore on the blade already appeared 1 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.000
 scratches you see yes on the descent in 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.880
 the middle here is the same here as so 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.920
 I do not know, but nevertheless quite 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.189
 such a nice little feet and now he will 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.350
 play the role of my new ritual 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.500
 knife that such a ritual knife aconite 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.930
 repairing something for a knife 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.060
 opening promise which is because but 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.619
 let's say you need heavy enough on 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.799
 carry with me every day 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:03.049
 especially as I have two on my way now 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:05.670
 knife emerson his let's say more 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.399
 presentable both zero tolerance but 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.850
 I have this knife for you to run into 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.140
 at home so 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.560
 so that you can just 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.210
 open the parcel everything else is ours 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.880
 because inexpensive is 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.010
 mission we are quite fit their 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.030
 money again that the knife is made well 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.330
 and 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.560
 worth the money considering now what 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:33.760
 there is not here is such a 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:36.260
 camouflage I liked this thing 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.180
 connection with this by the way I have to you 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.280
 question dear subscribers and just 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:47.660
 my channel's guests he has such our 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.760
 here we have titan how do you think how 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.020
 will look like if this titan 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:58.370
 about the same pattern cover 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:01.640
 anodized permissible but how would it 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.610
 and it looked valid if done 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.220
 some background of the same color here as 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.860
 here is black and then another color 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.770
 make and nad it enough 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.410
 strong and resistant even many times with him 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.270
 experimented and done in my 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.480
 conditions it is quite realistic not even 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:24.130
 parsing the knife I 'll want to ask you 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.990
 what do you think about this project 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.190
 the principle is that ours is good but you can 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.540
 add him a little zest so in 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.130
 comments below are waiting for your 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.650
 recommendations may be someone has 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.690
 5 more ideas on how to customize zero 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.110
 tolerance given that I do nâ€™t have any 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.050
 power drill or anything 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.030
 put on paint 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:53.750
 sandpaper files and stuff etc. 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:57.140
 so waiting for your recommendation ideas and 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.930
 plus how did you get this knife 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.370
 Whether and delivered but also look better 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.110
 or still remained so 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.540
 nondescript piece of Chinese metal 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.680
 By the way, the piece of iron is quite more here. 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.420
 Menchinskaya not quite plastic 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.590
 the wedge turn out to be thick enough 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.180
 jar suffered a knife well local that 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.530
 such a classic form of emerson 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.490
 I like to open like this 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.710
 our here so below so here to 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.500
 Unfortunately this is not what's there 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.509
 blank wall only opportunity 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.789
 where does it crawl from then you 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:36.050
 see that the Kalinka move leaves 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:38.780
 want something better 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.389
 that let's say so much like the real world 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.759
 but it itself very cheerfully opens with you 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.940
 its given that the clip is very tight 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:49.430
 sits on a pocket very cheerfully cheeks 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.740
 open and quite important not to cut 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.669
 court and this is probably all thanks to all 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.669
 until
