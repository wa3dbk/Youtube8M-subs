were<00:02:00.439> down<00:02:00.470> because<00:02:01.399> I<00:02:01.670> am<00:02:01.850> lucky<00:02:02.240> like<00:02:02.420> that

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
were down because I am lucky like that

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.630 
were down because I am lucky like that
so<00:02:04.610> what<00:02:05.509> you<00:02:05.600> need<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.869> do<00:02:06.079> in<00:02:06.470> order<00:02:06.979> to<00:02:07.130> get<00:02:07.430> a

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
so what you need to do in order to get a

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.490 
so what you need to do in order to get a
lot<00:02:08.000> of<00:02:08.149> water<00:02:08.360> in<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.929> short<00:02:08.959> amount<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.440> time

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
lot of water in a short amount of time

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.280 
lot of water in a short amount of time
is<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.489> place<00:02:10.910> your<00:02:11.180> facilities<00:02:11.780> correctly

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
is to place your facilities correctly

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.160 
is to place your facilities correctly
what<00:02:12.470> facilities<00:02:12.860> do<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.130> need<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.959> get<00:02:14.959> an

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
what facilities do you need to get an

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.530 
what facilities do you need to get an
unlimited<00:02:15.560> amount<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:16.190> water<00:02:16.430> basically<00:02:16.940> you

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
unlimited amount of water basically you

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.610 
unlimited amount of water basically you
need<00:02:17.720> a<00:02:17.959> water<00:02:18.349> pumping<00:02:18.890> station<00:02:18.950> with<00:02:19.819> a

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
need a water pumping station with a

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.479 
need a water pumping station with a
filtration<00:02:21.620> tank<00:02:23.650> Ventrella<00:02:24.650> filtration

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
filtration tank Ventrella filtration

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.539 
filtration tank Ventrella filtration
pump<00:02:25.700> I'm<00:02:25.970> sorry<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:27.560> either<00:02:27.950> need<00:02:28.340> a

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
pump I'm sorry and you either need a

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.440 
pump I'm sorry and you either need a
sewage<00:02:29.120> outflow<00:02:29.540> pipe<00:02:29.989> or<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:31.450> sewage

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
sewage outflow pipe or a sewage

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.990 
sewage outflow pipe or a sewage
treatment<00:02:32.480> plant<00:02:33.140> as<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:34.250> can<00:02:34.400> see<00:02:34.640> right<00:02:34.940> now

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
treatment plant as you can see right now

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.750 
treatment plant as you can see right now
my<00:02:35.120> sewage<00:02:35.720> outflow<00:02:36.110> pipe<00:02:36.410> is<00:02:36.680> at<00:02:37.160> maximum

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
my sewage outflow pipe is at maximum

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.270 
my sewage outflow pipe is at maximum
limit<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:38.720> that's<00:02:38.959> one<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.650> limitations

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
limit so that's one of the limitations

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.240 
limit so that's one of the limitations
to<00:02:40.700> using<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.780> sewage<00:02:42.080> outflow<00:02:42.410> pipe<00:02:42.830> rather

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
to using a sewage outflow pipe rather

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.300 
to using a sewage outflow pipe rather
than<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.970> sewage<00:02:44.360> treatment<00:02:44.390> plant<00:02:45.310> but

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
than a sewage treatment plant but

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.309 
than a sewage treatment plant but
basically<00:02:46.700> these<00:02:46.880> sewage<00:02:47.360> facilities<00:02:47.599> they

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
basically these sewage facilities they

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.800 
basically these sewage facilities they
basically<00:02:48.890> throw<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.880> water<00:02:50.090> back<00:02:50.360> into<00:02:50.660> the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
basically throw the water back into the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.720 
basically throw the water back into the
ground<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.440> sewage<00:02:51.709> outflow<00:02:52.010> pipe<00:02:52.280> throws

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
ground the sewage outflow pipe throws

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.910 
ground the sewage outflow pipe throws
dirty<00:02:53.420> water<00:02:53.750> back<00:02:54.019> into<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.349> plant<00:02:54.560> hence

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
dirty water back into the plant hence

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.490 
dirty water back into the plant hence
the<00:02:55.579> use<00:02:55.609> of<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:56.299> filtration<00:02:56.720> pump<00:02:57.400> while<00:02:58.400> the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
the use of the filtration pump while the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.990 
the use of the filtration pump while the
sewage<00:03:00.500> treatment<00:03:00.530> plant<00:03:01.190> cleans<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.820> water

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
sewage treatment plant cleans the water

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.940 
sewage treatment plant cleans the water
before<00:03:02.209> throwing<00:03:02.570> it<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.019> ground<00:03:03.320> so<00:03:03.890> you

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
before throwing it to the ground so you

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.300 
before throwing it to the ground so you
might<00:03:04.519> not<00:03:04.700> necessarily<00:03:04.910> need<00:03:05.540> the

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
might not necessarily need the

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.039 
might not necessarily need the
filtration<00:03:07.310> pump<00:03:07.489> but<00:03:07.819> then<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.390> like<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:09.019> be

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
filtration pump but then I like to be

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.410 
filtration pump but then I like to be
safe<00:03:09.410> so<00:03:09.680> I<00:03:09.709> usually<00:03:10.069> use<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:11.000> filtration

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
safe so I usually use the filtration

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.990 
safe so I usually use the filtration
pump<00:03:11.660> anyway<00:03:12.140> right<00:03:12.680> so<00:03:13.010> it's<00:03:13.370> just<00:03:13.430> twenty

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
pump anyway right so it's just twenty

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.259 
pump anyway right so it's just twenty
thousand<00:03:14.600> simoleons<00:03:15.470> difference<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:16.640> I

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
thousand simoleons difference and I

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.150 
thousand simoleons difference and I
think<00:03:17.510> it's<00:03:17.630> pretty<00:03:17.840> much<00:03:17.900> worth<00:03:18.230> it

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
think it's pretty much worth it

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.390 
think it's pretty much worth it
I'll<00:03:19.700> demonstrate<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:20.840> the<00:03:20.980> increase<00:03:21.980> of

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
I'll demonstrate to you the increase of

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.479 
I'll demonstrate to you the increase of
the<00:03:22.720> supply<00:03:23.720> well<00:03:24.260> let's<00:03:24.530> see<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:25.040> increased

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
the supply well let's see it increased

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.430 
the supply well let's see it increased
did<00:03:25.670> you<00:03:25.760> see<00:03:25.880> that<00:03:26.000> yeah<00:03:26.299> I'll<00:03:26.989> demonstrate

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
did you see that yeah I'll demonstrate

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.830 
did you see that yeah I'll demonstrate
to<00:03:27.829> you<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:27.980> increase<00:03:28.370> of<00:03:28.400> supply<00:03:28.819> using<00:03:29.329> the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
to you the increase of supply using the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.479 
to you the increase of supply using the
sewage<00:03:30.319> treatment<00:03:30.500> plant<00:03:30.889> you<00:03:31.040> don't<00:03:31.069> have<00:03:31.340> to

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
sewage treatment plant you don't have to

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.629 
sewage treatment plant you don't have to
necessarily<00:03:31.609> put<00:03:32.389> it<00:03:32.510> next<00:03:33.350> to<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:34.250> water

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
necessarily put it next to the water

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.430 
necessarily put it next to the water
Romek<00:03:35.150> station<00:03:35.420> you<00:03:35.510> can<00:03:35.630> put<00:03:35.780> it<00:03:35.870> in<00:03:35.989> front<00:03:36.350> of

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
Romek station you can put it in front of

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.770 
Romek station you can put it in front of
it<00:03:36.560> or<00:03:36.739> behind<00:03:37.280> it<00:03:37.819> just<00:03:38.299> as<00:03:38.389> long<00:03:38.510> as<00:03:38.630> it's

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
it or behind it just as long as it's

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.260 
it or behind it just as long as it's
close<00:03:39.049> by<00:03:39.350> and<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:40.130> water

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
close by and the water

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.980 
close by and the water
to<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.630> pump<00:03:42.320> so<00:03:43.000> let's<00:03:44.000> go<00:03:44.150> ahead<00:03:44.270> and<00:03:44.510> put<00:03:44.810> a

are back and as you can see here the

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.880 
are back and as you can see here the
sewage<00:04:29.870> is<00:04:29.990> being<00:04:30.200> processed<00:04:30.440> right<00:04:30.770> now

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
sewage is being processed right now

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.070 
sewage is being processed right now
let's<00:04:31.100> delete<00:04:31.640> these<00:04:31.940> so<00:04:32.240> that<00:04:32.390> the<00:04:32.510> sewage

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
let's delete these so that the sewage

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.660 
let's delete these so that the sewage
goes<00:04:33.410> into<00:04:34.160> the<00:04:34.460> right<00:04:34.700> to<00:04:34.970> build<00:04:35.270> in<00:04:36.670> okay

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
goes into the right to build in okay

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.080 
goes into the right to build in okay
let's<00:04:38.300> see<00:04:38.630> how<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.020> sewage<00:04:39.770> is<00:04:39.980> going<00:04:40.430> okay

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
let's see how the sewage is going okay

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.380 
let's see how the sewage is going okay
then<00:04:42.190> see<00:04:43.190> now<00:04:43.430> you<00:04:43.490> can<00:04:43.700> see<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:44.060> supply<00:04:44.240> is

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
then see now you can see the supply is

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.270 
then see now you can see the supply is
going<00:04:44.480> up<00:04:44.780> and<00:04:44.960> down<00:04:45.140> up<00:04:45.410> and<00:04:45.590> down<00:04:45.710> up<00:04:46.070> and

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
going up and down up and down up and

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.150 
going up and down up and down up and
down<00:04:46.400> suddenly<00:04:47.030> up<00:04:47.600> suddenly<00:04:48.260> down<00:04:48.530> that's

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
down suddenly up suddenly down that's

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.560 
down suddenly up suddenly down that's
because<00:04:49.780> this<00:04:50.780> is<00:04:51.700> pumping<00:04:52.700> water<00:04:52.910> into<00:04:53.420> the

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
because this is pumping water into the

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.510 
because this is pumping water into the
ground<00:04:53.720> and<00:04:54.140> you<00:04:54.260> can<00:04:54.290> see<00:04:54.650> where<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.250> sewage

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
ground and you can see where the sewage

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.970 
ground and you can see where the sewage
outflow<00:04:55.820> pipe<00:04:56.060> was<00:04:56.270> dirty<00:04:56.660> water<00:04:57.230> is<00:04:57.650> right

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
outflow pipe was dirty water is right

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.430 
outflow pipe was dirty water is right
there<00:04:58.430> and<00:04:59.000> that's<00:04:59.270> why<00:04:59.600> we<00:04:59.900> needed<00:05:00.200> a

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
there and that's why we needed a

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.660 
there and that's why we needed a
filtration<00:05:01.250> and<00:05:02.080> yeah<00:05:03.080> that's<00:05:03.590> how<00:05:04.010> you<00:05:04.070> get

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
filtration and yeah that's how you get

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.590 
filtration and yeah that's how you get
an<00:05:04.910> unlimited<00:05:05.450> supply<00:05:05.960> of<00:05:06.320> water<00:05:07.000> it's<00:05:08.000> a

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
an unlimited supply of water it's a

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.890 
an unlimited supply of water it's a
water<00:05:08.900> cycle<00:05:09.560> people<00:05:09.980> isn't<00:05:10.820> that<00:05:11.030> amazing<00:05:11.420> I

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
water cycle people isn't that amazing I

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.430 
water cycle people isn't that amazing I
found<00:05:12.440> the<00:05:12.590> solution<00:05:12.740> online<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:13.910> I<00:05:14.570> just

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
found the solution online and I just

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.570 
found the solution online and I just
thought<00:05:15.620> that<00:05:15.860> it'd<00:05:15.980> be<00:05:16.130> nice<00:05:16.310> to<00:05:16.430> have<00:05:16.520> a

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
thought that it'd be nice to have a

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.600 
thought that it'd be nice to have a
video<00:05:16.760> of<00:05:16.970> it<00:05:17.030> on<00:05:17.210> YouTube<00:05:17.780> so<00:05:18.140> I<00:05:19.100> hope<00:05:19.460> you

remember<00:05:23.060> you<00:05:23.450> need<00:05:23.930> a<00:05:24.110> water<00:05:24.830> pumping

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
remember you need a water pumping

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.909 
remember you need a water pumping
station<00:05:25.310> and<00:05:25.880> a<00:05:26.210> sewage<00:05:26.630> treatment<00:05:26.710> plant<00:05:27.710> or

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
station and a sewage treatment plant or

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.270 
station and a sewage treatment plant or
an<00:05:28.360> outflow<00:05:29.360> pipe<00:05:29.690> but<00:05:30.260> you<00:05:30.440> know<00:05:30.560> that's<00:05:31.070> not

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
an outflow pipe but you know that's not

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.180 
an outflow pipe but you know that's not
really<00:05:31.490> as<00:05:32.410> efficient<00:05:33.410> and<00:05:33.560> effective<00:05:33.710> as

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
really as efficient and effective as

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.250 
really as efficient and effective as
having<00:05:35.060> a<00:05:35.120> sewage<00:05:35.450> treatment<00:05:35.480> plant<00:05:35.900> in<00:05:36.169> a

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
having a sewage treatment plant in a

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.680 
having a sewage treatment plant in a
water<00:05:36.560> pumping<00:05:36.919> station<00:05:36.980> so<00:05:37.419> be<00:05:38.419> sure<00:05:38.450> that

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
water pumping station so be sure that

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.750 
water pumping station so be sure that
you<00:05:38.990> have<00:05:39.020> enough<00:05:39.380> money<00:05:39.590> to<00:05:39.770> have<00:05:40.280> these<00:05:40.550> two

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
you have enough money to have these two

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.710 
you have enough money to have these two
facilities<00:05:41.240> and<00:05:42.100> fully<00:05:43.100> upgrade<00:05:43.490> them<00:05:43.720> in

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
facilities and fully upgrade them in

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.830 
facilities and fully upgrade them in
larger<00:05:45.320> cities<00:05:45.470> you'll<00:05:45.830> need<00:05:46.360> maybe<00:05:47.360> two<00:05:47.690> of

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
larger cities you'll need maybe two of

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.899 
larger cities you'll need maybe two of
each

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909
