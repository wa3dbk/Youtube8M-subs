raking hay for 2015 the other day we

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.460 
raking hay for 2015 the other day we
came<00:00:06.150> through<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:06.569> we<00:00:06.690> cut<00:00:06.990> all<00:00:07.109> this<00:00:07.290> hay

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
came through and we cut all this hay

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.790 
came through and we cut all this hay
down<00:00:07.649> with<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.040> 82<00:00:08.550> 35<00:00:09.000> r<00:00:09.290> and<00:00:10.290> we<00:00:10.469> got<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.679> we

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
down with the 82 35 r and we got the we

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.910 
down with the 82 35 r and we got the we
lag<00:00:11.070> behind<00:00:11.099> us

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
lag behind us

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.709 
lag behind us
now<00:00:13.920> this<00:00:14.309> rake<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.670> hooked<00:00:15.179> up<00:00:15.330> with<00:00:15.509> two

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
now this rake is hooked up with two

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.790 
now this rake is hooked up with two
SCV's<00:00:16.289> over<00:00:17.070> here<00:00:17.300> so<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:19.260> middle<00:00:19.439> one<00:00:19.529> we

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
SCV's over here so the middle one we

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.859 
SCV's over here so the middle one we
have<00:00:19.949> hooked<00:00:20.279> up<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.730> control<00:00:21.260> in<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.590> out

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
have hooked up to control in and out

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.910 
have hooked up to control in and out
kind<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.960> see<00:00:25.109> them<00:00:25.199> going<00:00:25.350> back<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.710> forth

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
kind of see them going back and forth

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.560 
kind of see them going back and forth
there<00:00:27.080> so<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.170> can<00:00:28.260> control<00:00:28.619> your<00:00:28.830> wing<00:00:29.310> width

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
there so you can control your wing width

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.359 
there so you can control your wing width
and<00:00:30.570> then<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.080> first<00:00:31.289> one<00:00:31.500> controls<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
and then the first one controls the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.430 
and then the first one controls the
actual<00:00:32.910> wheels<00:00:33.270> moving<00:00:33.630> up<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.930> down<00:00:33.989> whether

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
actual wheels moving up and down whether

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.200 
actual wheels moving up and down whether
they're<00:00:34.649> hitting<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.950> ground<00:00:35.100> or<00:00:35.250> not<00:00:35.280> push

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
they're hitting the ground or not push

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.180 
they're hitting the ground or not push
forward<00:00:36.600> they<00:00:36.870> should<00:00:37.079> drop<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.010> down

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
forward they should drop just it down

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.840 
forward they should drop just it down
right<00:00:38.430> now

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
right now

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.619 
right now
if<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.570> pull<00:00:39.809> back<00:00:41.000> you'll<00:00:42.000> see<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.360> they<00:00:42.510> are

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
if I pull back you'll see that they are

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.080 
if I pull back you'll see that they are
going<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.809> move<00:00:43.010> so<00:00:44.010> what<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.160> got<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.399> do<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.969> I

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
going to move so what I got to do is I

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.720 
going to move so what I got to do is I
gotta<00:00:45.300> adjust<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.910> pressure

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.000 

back<00:00:51.330> here<00:00:52.640> look<00:00:53.640> right<00:00:53.670> there

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
back here look right there

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.180 
back here look right there
see<00:00:55.430> number<00:00:55.730> one<00:00:56.739> they're<00:00:57.739> hooked<00:00:57.920> up<00:00:58.070> to

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
see number one they're hooked up to

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.440 
see number one they're hooked up to
number<00:00:58.460> one<00:00:58.489> which<00:00:58.820> is<00:00:58.880> this<00:00:59.059> lever<00:00:59.360> right

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
number one which is this lever right

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.780 
number one which is this lever right
here<00:01:00.460> so<00:01:01.460> if<00:01:01.610> I<00:01:02.260> turn<00:01:03.260> this

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:14.330 

now<00:01:07.540> it<00:01:07.720> should<00:01:07.930> do<00:01:08.080> something

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.980 

there<00:01:15.340> we<00:01:15.430> go

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.950 

that's<00:01:21.560> how<00:01:21.680> I<00:01:21.710> want<00:01:25.119> cookie<00:01:26.119> here<00:01:26.390> this<00:01:26.750> is

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
that's how I want cookie here this is

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.080 
that's how I want cookie here this is
shift<00:01:27.229> up<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:27.740> slow<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.670> engine<00:01:28.820> down

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
shift up and slow the engine down

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.609 
shift up and slow the engine down
because<00:01:29.510> there's<00:01:29.750> really<00:01:29.869> no<00:01:30.080> point<00:01:30.290> using

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
because there's really no point using

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.490 
because there's really no point using
more<00:01:30.950> fuel<00:01:31.159> than<00:01:31.250> you<00:01:31.460> have<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.850> so<00:01:32.409> might<00:01:33.409> as

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
more fuel than you have to so might as

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.090 
more fuel than you have to so might as
well<00:01:33.650> slow<00:01:33.950> it<00:01:34.070> down<00:01:34.100> as<00:01:34.460> much<00:01:34.580> as<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:34.820> can

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
well slow it down as much as you can

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.940 
well slow it down as much as you can
save<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.250> feel<00:01:37.400> that<00:01:37.550> way<00:01:37.700> for<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:39.680> sake<00:01:39.920> of

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
save and feel that way for the sake of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.920 
save and feel that way for the sake of
keeping<00:01:40.430> everything<00:01:40.640> tidy<00:01:41.090> I<00:01:41.180> usually<00:01:41.630> start

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
keeping everything tidy I usually start

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.710 
keeping everything tidy I usually start
raking<00:01:42.170> in<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.560> middle<00:01:42.800> of<00:01:42.950> scrip<00:01:43.220> I<00:01:43.570> set<00:01:44.570> the

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
raking in the middle of scrip I set the

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.010 
raking in the middle of scrip I set the
wing<00:01:44.869> width<00:01:45.110> for<00:01:45.409> about<00:01:45.590> two<00:01:45.860> rows<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:47.000> then<00:01:47.990> I

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
wing width for about two rows and then I

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.040 
wing width for about two rows and then I
work<00:01:48.320> out<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:48.860> do<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.490> first<00:01:50.119> two<00:01:50.450> inside

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
work out I do the first two inside

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.660 
work out I do the first two inside
passes<00:01:51.440> first<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:51.860> then<00:01:51.950> I<00:01:52.009> do<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.280> outside

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
passes first and then I do the outside

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.590 
passes first and then I do the outside
the<00:01:53.570> reason<00:01:53.899> I<00:01:53.960> do<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.200> outside<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:54.920> that<00:01:55.600> so

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
the reason I do the outside is that so

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.240 
the reason I do the outside is that so
that<00:01:56.750> when<00:01:56.869> you're<00:01:56.960> going<00:01:56.990> around<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:58.009> last

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
that when you're going around the last

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.850 
that when you're going around the last
time<00:01:58.580> you're<00:01:59.000> not<00:01:59.149> messing<00:01:59.420> up<00:01:59.690> the<00:02:00.649> hay

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
time you're not messing up the hay

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.370 
time you're not messing up the hay
because<00:02:01.580> if<00:02:01.910> you<00:02:02.420> can<00:02:02.570> make<00:02:02.720> it<00:02:02.840> look<00:02:02.990> really

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
because if you can make it look really

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.650 
because if you can make it look really
ugly<00:02:03.530> in<00:02:03.830> a<00:02:03.890> hurry<00:02:03.920> if<00:02:04.910> you<00:02:05.000> start<00:02:05.479> on<00:02:05.570> the

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
ugly in a hurry if you start on the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.779 
ugly in a hurry if you start on the
outside<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:06.110> work<00:02:06.380> in<00:02:06.560> because<00:02:06.979> you<00:02:07.520> got<00:02:07.670> to

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
outside and work in because you got to

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:08.830 
outside and work in because you got to
enter<00:02:07.970> somewhere<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:08.420> you<00:02:08.479> got<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.690> leave

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
over any hey it's what hasn't been

over any hey it's what hasn't been
raised<00:02:17.630> yet<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:18.440> still<00:02:18.800> maintains<00:02:19.250> that

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
raised yet it still maintains that

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.650 
raised yet it still maintains that
fluffiness<00:02:19.900> off<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.140> ground

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:40.800 

it's<00:02:23.960> raking<00:02:24.350> up<00:02:24.440> beautifully<00:02:24.950> right<00:02:25.100> now

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.140 

some<00:02:41.380> people<00:02:41.680> tend<00:02:41.950> their<00:02:42.190> hay<00:02:42.340> which<00:02:42.850> means

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
some people tend their hay which means

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.059 
some people tend their hay which means
that<00:02:43.510> they<00:02:44.140> come<00:02:44.350> through<00:02:44.560> with<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.740> machine

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
that they come through with the machine

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.260 
that they come through with the machine

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
speed up the drying process which is

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.890 
speed up the drying process which is
good<00:02:51.370> because<00:02:51.880> after<00:02:52.209> you<00:02:52.450> cut<00:02:52.630> down<00:02:52.780> the

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
good because after you cut down the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.570 
good because after you cut down the
plant<00:02:53.170> it<00:02:53.680> immediately<00:02:54.010> it<00:02:54.250> immediately

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
plant it immediately it immediately

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.140 
plant it immediately it immediately
starts<00:02:55.000> losing<00:02:55.240> moisture<00:02:55.950> but<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.580> also<00:02:57.760> has

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
starts losing moisture but it also has

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.030 
starts losing moisture but it also has
openings<00:02:58.930> on<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.319> underside<00:02:59.680> of<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.860> leaves

openings on the underside of the leaves

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.820 
openings on the underside of the leaves
called<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.819> Manor<00:03:01.090> stomata<00:03:01.900> depending<00:03:02.739> on

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
called the Manor stomata depending on

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.309 
called the Manor stomata depending on
how<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:02.980> want<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.250> pronounce<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:04.319> with

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
how you want to pronounce it and with

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.210 
how you want to pronounce it and with
those<00:03:06.090> basically<00:03:07.090> they're<00:03:07.360> just<00:03:07.390> small<00:03:07.750> holes

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
those basically they're just small holes

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.059 
those basically they're just small holes
what<00:03:09.220> those<00:03:09.489> allow<00:03:09.850> is<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.950> moisture<00:03:11.950> to

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
what those allow is the moisture to

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.820 
what those allow is the moisture to
escape<00:03:12.190> out<00:03:12.580> of<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.760> plant<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:14.620> want<00:03:14.769> to

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
escape out of the plant and you want to

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.860 
escape out of the plant and you want to
have<00:03:14.950> you<00:03:15.670> want<00:03:15.820> to<00:03:15.850> cut<00:03:16.060> hay<00:03:16.209> and<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.450> optimum

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
have you want to cut hay and the optimum

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.720 
have you want to cut hay and the optimum
conditions<00:03:17.019> for<00:03:17.380> drying<00:03:17.739> because<00:03:18.160> the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
conditions for drying because the

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.810 
conditions for drying because the
conditions<00:03:19.180> are<00:03:19.300> not<00:03:19.360> optimum<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:21.250> tomato

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
conditions are not optimum the tomato

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.570 
conditions are not optimum the tomato
will<00:03:22.000> close<00:03:22.239> up<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:23.950> will<00:03:25.260> increase

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
will close up and it will increase

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.720 
will close up and it will increase
Penfield<00:03:27.600> fermentation<00:03:28.600> for<00:03:28.810> one<00:03:29.019> and

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.490 

it<00:03:33.300> will<00:03:33.450> also<00:03:33.720> increase<00:03:33.930> your<00:03:34.140> drying<00:03:34.379> time

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
it will also increase your drying time

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.649 
it will also increase your drying time
because<00:03:35.069> the<00:03:35.400> air<00:03:35.550> is<00:03:36.390> not<00:03:36.629> able<00:03:37.080> to<00:03:37.200> escape

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
because the air is not able to escape

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.300 
because the air is not able to escape
the<00:03:39.659> moisture<00:03:39.989> is<00:03:40.110> not<00:03:40.290> able<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.620> escape<00:03:40.799> this

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
the moisture is not able to escape this

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.370 
the moisture is not able to escape this
quickly<00:03:42.140> so

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
quickly so

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.870 
quickly so
that's<00:03:45.010> why<00:03:45.160> you<00:03:45.220> want<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.460> cuddle<00:03:45.640> and

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
that's why you want to cuddle and

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.670 
that's why you want to cuddle and
conditions<00:03:46.450> are<00:03:46.570> optimal

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
conditions are optimal

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.150 
conditions are optimal
you<00:03:48.580> know<00:03:48.810> humidity<00:03:49.810> they<00:03:49.990> say<00:03:50.200> is<00:03:50.260> can<00:03:50.980> be

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
you know humidity they say is can be

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.150 
you know humidity they say is can be
pretty<00:03:51.370> good<00:03:51.580> but<00:03:52.570> what<00:03:53.350> I<00:03:53.380> like<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:53.770> have<00:03:53.920> is

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
pretty good but what I like to have is

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.420 
pretty good but what I like to have is
more<00:03:54.580> humidity<00:03:55.170> but<00:03:56.170> a<00:03:56.500> lot<00:03:56.830> of<00:03:56.980> wind<00:03:57.130> moving

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
more humidity but a lot of wind moving

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.550 
more humidity but a lot of wind moving
over<00:03:57.610> the<00:03:57.730> hay<00:03:57.820> because<00:03:58.210> that<00:03:58.810> keeps<00:03:59.020> there

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
over the hay because that keeps there

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.420 
over the hay because that keeps there
moving<00:04:00.100> and<00:04:00.310> tends<00:04:00.790> to<00:04:01.380> make<00:04:02.380> that<00:04:02.590> moisture

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
moving and tends to make that moisture

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.190 
moving and tends to make that moisture
inside<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:03.910> hay<00:04:04.210> evaporate<00:04:04.870> away

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.820 

it's<00:04:08.680> also<00:04:08.860> best<00:04:09.220> to<00:04:09.700> kind<00:04:10.240> of<00:04:10.470> try<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.500> keep

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
it's also best to kind of try to keep

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.100 
it's also best to kind of try to keep
from<00:04:12.099> handling<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:12.610> hay<00:04:12.730> too<00:04:12.790> much<00:04:13.180> out<00:04:13.810> in

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
from handling the hay too much out in

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.900 
from handling the hay too much out in
the<00:04:14.140> field<00:04:14.500> because<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:15.160> more<00:04:15.370> you<00:04:15.489> handle<00:04:15.819> it

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
the field because the more you handle it

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.569 
the field because the more you handle it
say<00:04:16.690> you<00:04:16.750> can't<00:04:17.079> edit<00:04:17.230> that's<00:04:18.190> just

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
say you can't edit that's just

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.340 
say you can't edit that's just
increasing<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.480> amount<00:04:19.660> of<00:04:19.750> leaf<00:04:19.959> loss<00:04:20.200> that

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
increasing the amount of leaf loss that

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.950 
increasing the amount of leaf loss that
you'll<00:04:20.500> have<00:04:20.650> and<00:04:21.030> what<00:04:22.030> you<00:04:22.150> want<00:04:22.419> in<00:04:22.780> the

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
you'll have and what you want in the

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.900 
you'll have and what you want in the
alfalfa<00:04:23.260> is<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.889> leaves<00:04:24.160> because<00:04:24.490> that's<00:04:24.730> the

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
alfalfa is the leaves because that's the

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.379 
alfalfa is the leaves because that's the
highest<00:04:25.470> nutrition<00:04:27.060> please<00:04:28.060> have<00:04:28.240> the

highest nutritional value so you want to

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.920 
highest nutritional value so you want to
keep<00:04:33.490> your<00:04:33.639> leaves<00:04:33.850> from<00:04:34.030> falling<00:04:34.330> off<00:04:34.450> and<00:04:34.750> if

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
keep your leaves from falling off and if

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.840 
keep your leaves from falling off and if
it's<00:04:35.110> extremely<00:04:35.680> dry<00:04:35.950> the<00:04:36.310> leaves<00:04:36.550> will<00:04:36.760> have

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
it's extremely dry the leaves will have

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.260 
it's extremely dry the leaves will have
more<00:04:37.389> of<00:04:37.510> a<00:04:37.540> tendency<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:38.020> fall<00:04:38.200> off<00:04:39.150> so<00:04:40.150> in

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
more of a tendency to fall off so in

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.240 
more of a tendency to fall off so in
