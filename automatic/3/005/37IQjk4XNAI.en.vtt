00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
a little bit dated in some ways first

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.980 
a little bit dated in some ways first
and<00:01:47.070> foremost<00:01:47.340> what<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> like<00:01:48.360> they<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:48.960> a

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
and foremost what I like they have a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.560 
and foremost what I like they have a
wonderful<00:01:49.290> controller<00:01:50.040> here<00:01:50.520> between<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
wonderful controller here between the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.240 
wonderful controller here between the
driver<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.439> passenger<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.890> really<00:01:53.100> for

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
driver and the passenger is really for

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.520 
driver and the passenger is really for
the<00:01:53.340> driver<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.390> acts<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.960> mouse<00:01:55.350> that

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the driver and it acts like a mouse that

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.679 
the driver and it acts like a mouse that
you<00:01:55.590> would<00:01:55.770> use<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.219> your<00:01:56.399> home<00:01:57.000> computer<00:01:57.210> your

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
you would use on your home computer your

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.810 
you would use on your home computer your
desktop<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.500> click<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.280> screen<00:01:59.610> and

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
desktop and you click on the screen and

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.899 
desktop and you click on the screen and
the<00:02:00.540> reality<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.110> after<00:02:01.799> about<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.310> minute<00:02:02.670> of

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
the reality is after about a minute of

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.030 
the reality is after about a minute of
this<00:02:03.090> especially<00:02:03.689> when<00:02:04.020> you're<00:02:04.200> driving<00:02:04.680> it's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
this especially when you're driving it's

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.459 
this especially when you're driving it's
so<00:02:05.340> second<00:02:05.880> nature<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.290> actually

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
so second nature to you and it actually

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.320 
so second nature to you and it actually
feels<00:02:07.860> exactly<00:02:08.429> how<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.640> would<00:02:08.879> use<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.090> at

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
feels exactly how you would use it at

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.390 
feels exactly how you would use it at
home<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:10.050> really<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> wonderful<00:02:10.950> system

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
home and it really is a wonderful system

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.900 
home and it really is a wonderful system
you<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.670> list<00:02:11.940> just<00:02:12.150> glance<00:02:12.450> out

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
you can list just glance out

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.270 
you can list just glance out
and<00:02:13.000> then<00:02:13.300> look<00:02:13.510> back<00:02:13.780> up<00:02:14.020> on<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.440> street

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
and then look back up on to the street

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.130 
and then look back up on to the street
so<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.700> really<00:02:16.270> is<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.420> very<00:02:16.750> intuitive

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
so that really is a very intuitive

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.680 
so that really is a very intuitive
system<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.710> they<00:02:17.770> spent<00:02:18.040> years<00:02:18.610> figuring<00:02:19.240> out

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
system and they spent years figuring out

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.570 
system and they spent years figuring out
how<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:20.050> should<00:02:20.260> feel<00:02:20.530> in<00:02:20.680> your<00:02:20.800> hands<00:02:21.220> when

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
how this should feel in your hands when

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.090 
how this should feel in your hands when
they<00:02:21.700> designed<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.240> initially<00:02:22.810> also<00:02:23.680> the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
they designed it initially also the

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.560 
they designed it initially also the
seats<00:02:24.400> are<00:02:24.640> leather<00:02:24.670> covered<00:02:25.360> they're

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
seats are leather covered they're

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.600 
seats are leather covered they're
perforated<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.320> get<00:02:26.470> heated<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.040> cooled

seats on this model but one thing is I
got<00:02:30.850> in<00:02:31.030> this<00:02:31.210> and<00:02:31.390> it's<00:02:31.480> been<00:02:31.600> a<00:02:31.630> while<00:02:31.840> since

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
got in this and it's been a while since

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.960 
got in this and it's been a while since
I've<00:02:32.230> driven<00:02:32.440> on<00:02:32.590> rx350<00:02:33.220> I<00:02:33.400> couldn't<00:02:33.730> figure

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
I've driven on rx350 I couldn't figure

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.910 
I've driven on rx350 I couldn't figure
out<00:02:34.120> where<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.570> seed<00:02:34.780> eaters<00:02:34.960> were<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.500> then

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
out where the seed eaters were and then

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.830 
out where the seed eaters were and then
I<00:02:35.950> finally<00:02:36.490> found<00:02:36.670> them<00:02:36.940> they're<00:02:37.270> inside<00:02:37.810> the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
I finally found them they're inside the

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.720 
I finally found them they're inside the
glove<00:02:38.200> box<00:02:38.410> which<00:02:38.710> seems<00:02:39.070> like<00:02:39.190> an<00:02:39.310> odd<00:02:39.490> place

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
glove box which seems like an odd place

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.990 
glove box which seems like an odd place
for<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:41.170> dashboard<00:02:41.490> even<00:02:42.490> though<00:02:42.700> it

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
for it and the dashboard even though it

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.900 
for it and the dashboard even though it
is<00:02:43.210> it<00:02:44.170> is<00:02:44.380> functional<00:02:45.130> it's<00:02:45.400> looking<00:02:45.820> a

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
is it is functional it's looking a

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.490 
is it is functional it's looking a
little<00:02:46.030> bit<00:02:46.180> tired<00:02:46.510> they<00:02:46.690> could<00:02:46.930> freshen<00:02:47.410> this

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
little bit tired they could freshen this

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.620 
little bit tired they could freshen this
up<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:47.920> bring<00:02:48.310> it<00:02:48.460> to<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:49.000> standards<00:02:49.510> that

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
up and bring it to the standards that

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.870 
up and bring it to the standards that
you're<00:02:49.720> seeing<00:02:50.020> even<00:02:50.410> cars<00:02:51.010> like<00:02:51.250> Cadillac

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
with their Q system look much more

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.140 
with their Q system look much more
polished<00:02:54.310> than<00:02:54.730> this

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
polished than this

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.030 
polished than this
some<00:02:55.750> things<00:02:56.050> that<00:02:56.200> they<00:02:56.290> could<00:02:56.440> also<00:02:56.590> improve

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
some things that they could also improve

the tuner it's way over on this side to

the tuner it's way over on this side to
change<00:02:59.710> the<00:02:59.830> radio<00:03:00.340> if<00:03:00.460> you<00:03:00.550> want<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.820> do<00:03:00.940> that

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
change the radio if you want to do that

manually

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
manually

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.590 
manually
now<00:03:02.260> I'm<00:03:03.040> 6<00:03:03.430> feet<00:03:03.610> tall<00:03:03.880> but<00:03:03.940> have<00:03:04.210> a<00:03:04.240> fairly

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
now I'm 6 feet tall but have a fairly

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.420 
now I'm 6 feet tall but have a fairly
long<00:03:04.750> body<00:03:05.020> so<00:03:05.200> it's<00:03:05.320> probably<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.680> torso<00:03:06.340> of

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
long body so it's probably the torso of

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.060 
long body so it's probably the torso of
somebody<00:03:06.700> like<00:03:06.820> 6<00:03:07.090> 2<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:08.350> find<00:03:08.770> that<00:03:08.890> the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
somebody like 6 2 and I find that the

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.070 
somebody like 6 2 and I find that the
seats<00:03:09.340> don't<00:03:09.670> go<00:03:09.970> low<00:03:10.330> enough<00:03:10.360> it<00:03:10.720> feels<00:03:10.930> like

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
seats don't go low enough it feels like

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.410 
seats don't go low enough it feels like
I'm<00:03:11.260> sitting<00:03:11.560> way<00:03:11.890> up<00:03:12.160> in<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.430> cabin<00:03:12.850> here<00:03:13.090> now

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
but it doesn't go low enough for where I

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.490 
but it doesn't go low enough for where I
would<00:03:28.240> like<00:03:28.390> it<00:03:28.540> it's<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:28.720> common<00:03:29.080> complaint<00:03:29.320> I

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
would like it it's a common complaint I

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.470 
would like it it's a common complaint I
have<00:03:29.650> not<00:03:30.070> just<00:03:30.340> with<00:03:30.490> Lexus<00:03:30.790> but<00:03:30.940> many<00:03:31.240> many

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
have not just with Lexus but many many

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.660 
have not just with Lexus but many many
brands<00:03:31.930> make<00:03:32.110> the<00:03:32.260> seat<00:03:32.470> go<00:03:32.680> low<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.160> also

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
brands make the seat go low and also

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.190 
brands make the seat go low and also
make<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.240> go<00:03:34.360> high<00:03:34.510> I<00:03:34.540> don't<00:03:34.750> see<00:03:34.900> why<00:03:35.050> they

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
make it go high I don't see why they

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.140 
make it go high I don't see why they
can't<00:03:35.260> do<00:03:35.650> that<00:03:35.830> so<00:03:36.280> overall<00:03:36.640> it's<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.120> very

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
can't do that so overall it's a very

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.360 
can't do that so overall it's a very
functional<00:03:37.750> interior<00:03:38.110> nice<00:03:38.709> materials<00:03:39.280> I

improve<00:03:47.020> things<00:03:47.560> just<00:03:47.860> a<00:03:47.950> little<00:03:47.980> bit<00:03:48.280> and

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
improve things just a little bit and

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.940 
improve things just a little bit and
make<00:03:48.640> it<00:03:48.670> a<00:03:48.790> little<00:03:48.880> bit<00:03:49.090> more<00:03:49.300> user<00:03:49.480> friendly

the<00:04:37.810> thing<00:04:38.110> is<00:04:38.140> that<00:04:38.590> I<00:04:38.830> feel<00:04:39.460> like<00:04:39.670> I'm

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
the thing is that I feel like I'm

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.820 
the thing is that I feel like I'm
sitting<00:04:40.210> up<00:04:40.330> higher<00:04:40.810> in<00:04:41.140> this<00:04:41.290> vehicle<00:04:41.470> than<00:04:41.800> I

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
sitting up higher in this vehicle than I

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.430 
sitting up higher in this vehicle than I
would<00:04:42.130> saying<00:04:42.520> some<00:04:43.390> of<00:04:43.510> the<00:04:43.570> competition<00:04:44.350> it

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
would saying some of the competition it

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.830 
would saying some of the competition it
feels<00:04:44.650> like<00:04:45.430> you're<00:04:45.610> getting<00:04:45.730> the<00:04:46.330> feedback

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
feels like you're getting the feedback

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.990 
feels like you're getting the feedback
from<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.200> road<00:04:47.380> that<00:04:47.620> you<00:04:47.740> want<00:04:48.010> but<00:04:48.700> the

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
from the road that you want but the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.760 
from the road that you want but the
center<00:04:49.360> of<00:04:49.450> gravity<00:04:49.900> is<00:04:49.990> a<00:04:50.020> little<00:04:50.380> bit<00:04:50.530> higher

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
center of gravity is a little bit higher

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.070 
center of gravity is a little bit higher
so<00:04:51.370> I<00:04:51.400> would<00:04:51.730> say<00:04:51.940> that<00:04:52.210> somebody<00:04:52.900> that's

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
so I would say that somebody that's

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.250 
so I would say that somebody that's
looking<00:04:53.590> at<00:04:53.890> a<00:04:54.160> typical<00:04:54.520> rx<00:04:55.180> 350<00:04:55.570> if<00:04:55.900> you<00:04:55.990> want

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
looking at a typical rx 350 if you want
