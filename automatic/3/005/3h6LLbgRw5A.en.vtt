00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
hey guys so I did this whole spoiler in

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.610 
hey guys so I did this whole spoiler in
matte<00:00:08.410> black<00:00:08.440> classy<00:00:09.040> tip<00:00:09.370> and<00:00:10.139> this<00:00:11.139> side<00:00:11.380> I'm

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:11.620 
matte black classy tip and this side I'm

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.360 
matte black classy tip and this side I'm
gonna<00:00:11.800> do<00:00:11.950> the<00:00:12.100> 3m<00:00:12.460> clear<00:00:13.330> or<00:00:13.800> the<00:00:14.800> 3m<00:00:15.130> paint

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
gonna do the 3m clear or the 3m paint

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.210 
gonna do the 3m clear or the 3m paint
defender<00:00:15.790> and<00:00:15.940> on<00:00:16.840> this<00:00:17.199> side<00:00:17.470> I'm<00:00:17.740> gonna<00:00:18.010> do

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
defender and on this side I'm gonna do

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.339 
defender and on this side I'm gonna do
the<00:00:18.369> glossy<00:00:18.910> fire<00:00:19.210> which<00:00:19.689> is<00:00:19.720> provided<00:00:20.230> by

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
the glossy fire which is provided by

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.560 
the glossy fire which is provided by
positive<00:00:20.890> it's<00:00:21.400> been<00:00:21.490> about<00:00:21.759> 15<00:00:22.210> minutes

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
positive it's been about 15 minutes

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.009 
positive it's been about 15 minutes
since<00:00:23.230> plastidip<00:00:23.859> dries<00:00:24.099> quickly<00:00:24.460> I<00:00:24.839> got<00:00:25.839> to

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:26.019 
since plastidip dries quickly I got to

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.800 
since plastidip dries quickly I got to
do<00:00:26.140> three<00:00:26.409> coats<00:00:26.650> of<00:00:26.949> classifier<00:00:27.669> which<00:00:28.659> is

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
do three coats of classifier which is

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.760 
do three coats of classifier which is
equivalent<00:00:29.140> to<00:00:29.560> this<00:00:29.919> I<00:00:30.509> did<00:00:31.509> one<00:00:32.140> coat<00:00:32.410> but<00:00:32.739> I

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
equivalent to this I did one coat but I

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.750 
equivalent to this I did one coat but I
with<00:00:33.070> three<00:00:33.700> passes<00:00:34.149> on<00:00:34.270> there<00:00:34.480> so<00:00:35.609> I'm<00:00:36.609> gonna

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
with three passes on there so I'm gonna

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.700 
with three passes on there so I'm gonna
compare<00:00:37.210> them<00:00:37.390> wait<00:00:37.780> for<00:00:37.809> another<00:00:38.230> 30<00:00:38.620> minutes

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
compare them wait for another 30 minutes

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.509 
compare them wait for another 30 minutes
and<00:00:39.539> see<00:00:40.539> how<00:00:40.570> they<00:00:40.960> dry<00:00:41.170> out<00:00:41.199> hey<00:00:42.129> guys<00:00:42.309> so<00:00:42.489> I

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:42.519 
and see how they dry out hey guys so I

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.240 
and see how they dry out hey guys so I
let<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:42.940> thing<00:00:43.570> dry<00:00:43.780> for<00:00:44.199> about<00:00:44.350> two<00:00:45.219> hours

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
let the thing dry for about two hours

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.610 
let the thing dry for about two hours
it's<00:00:46.090> been<00:00:46.239> a<00:00:46.269> little<00:00:46.570> bit<00:00:46.780> more<00:00:46.960> than<00:00:47.440> two

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
it's been a little bit more than two

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.270 
it's been a little bit more than two
hours<00:00:47.890> and<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:49.660> far<00:00:49.870> as<00:00:49.929> I<00:00:50.109> can<00:00:50.170> tell<00:00:51.390> both<00:00:52.390> look

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
hours and as far as I can tell both look

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.569 
hours and as far as I can tell both look
same<00:00:54.280> in<00:00:54.609> the<00:00:55.679> finish<00:00:56.679> and<00:00:56.949> the<00:00:57.910> shininess<00:00:59.579> the

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
same in the finish and the shininess the

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.680 
same in the finish and the shininess the
3m<00:01:00.999> is<00:01:01.239> a<00:01:01.480> bit<00:01:01.809> more<00:01:02.140> shiny<00:01:02.589> but<00:01:03.579> it<00:01:03.699> took<00:01:03.850> it

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
3m is a bit more shiny but it took it

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.050 
3m is a bit more shiny but it took it
took<00:01:04.720> it<00:01:05.019> two<00:01:05.290> hours<00:01:05.470> more<00:01:05.860> to<00:01:06.130> dry<00:01:06.640> than<00:01:06.940> the

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
took it two hours more to dry than the

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.520 
took it two hours more to dry than the
classifier<00:01:07.600> but<00:01:07.960> I<00:01:08.020> think<00:01:08.230> you<00:01:08.290> can<00:01:08.410> achieve

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
classifier but I think you can achieve

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.350 
classifier but I think you can achieve
the<00:01:08.950> same<00:01:09.160> results<00:01:09.580> with<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.790> glossa<00:01:10.000> fire<00:01:10.270> if

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
the same results with the glossa fire if

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.750 
the same results with the glossa fire if
you<00:01:10.420> just<00:01:10.600> put<00:01:10.810> more<00:01:10.990> coats<00:01:11.260> on<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:11.710> when<00:01:12.670> it

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
you just put more coats on and when it

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.389 
you just put more coats on and when it
comes<00:01:12.970> to<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.420> touch

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
comes to the touch

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.520 
comes to the touch
the<00:01:15.850> 3m<00:01:16.299> feels<00:01:16.689> thick<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:20.170> that's<00:01:20.409> the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
the 3m feels thick and so that's the

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.590 
the 3m feels thick and so that's the
classifier<00:01:21.189> but<00:01:21.399> I<00:01:21.609> like<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:22.030> touch<00:01:22.329> of<00:01:22.479> the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
classifier but I like the touch of the

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.050 
classifier but I like the touch of the
glossy<00:01:22.840> fire<00:01:23.170> better<00:01:23.380> because<00:01:24.310> it<00:01:24.579> feels<00:01:24.789> very

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
glossy fire better because it feels very

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.539 
glossy fire better because it feels very
smooth<00:01:25.539> the<00:01:25.750> 3m<00:01:26.079> you<00:01:26.289> can<00:01:26.439> feel<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.950> bumps<00:01:27.250> a

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
smooth the 3m you can feel the bumps a

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.330 
smooth the 3m you can feel the bumps a
little<00:01:27.909> bit<00:01:28.060> so<00:01:28.899> in<00:01:29.020> my<00:01:29.170> opinion<00:01:29.319> both<00:01:30.039> of<00:01:30.219> them

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
little bit so in my opinion both of them

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.630 
little bit so in my opinion both of them
feel<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.670> same<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.149> to<00:01:31.929> the<00:01:32.049> touch<00:01:32.259> and<00:01:32.640> you

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
feel the same and to the touch and you

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.719 
feel the same and to the touch and you
can<00:01:33.819> see<00:01:34.209> the<00:01:35.020> same<00:01:35.649> finish<00:01:36.069> as<00:01:36.189> well<00:01:36.369> and<00:01:37.439> I

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
can see the same finish as well and I

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.330 
can see the same finish as well and I
would<00:01:39.729> go<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.299> plastic<00:01:40.840> vilasa<00:01:41.409> fire<00:01:41.740> because

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
would go the plastic vilasa fire because

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.929 
would go the plastic vilasa fire because
it's<00:01:42.909> a<00:01:43.209> lot<00:01:43.509> more<00:01:43.539> cheaper<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.609> you<00:01:45.609> can<00:01:45.759> add

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
it's a lot more cheaper and you can add

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.179 
it's a lot more cheaper and you can add
more<00:01:46.240> coats<00:01:46.600> if<00:01:46.899> you<00:01:47.170> want<00:01:47.409> so<00:01:47.799> if<00:01:47.890> I'm<00:01:48.039> gonna

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
more coats if you want so if I'm gonna

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.910 
more coats if you want so if I'm gonna
use<00:01:48.459> it<00:01:48.610> on<00:01:48.789> top<00:01:48.849> of<00:01:49.239> the<00:01:49.390> plastidip<00:01:49.959> I<00:01:50.200> think

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
use it on top of the plastidip I think

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.630 
use it on top of the plastidip I think
I'll<00:01:51.520> just<00:01:51.819> go<00:01:52.060> with<00:01:52.209> the<00:01:52.360> philosopher<00:01:52.899> but<00:01:53.679> if

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
I'll just go with the philosopher but if

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.219 
I'll just go with the philosopher but if
I<00:01:54.789> want<00:01:54.969> to<00:01:55.060> use<00:01:55.149> it<00:01:55.299> without<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.659> plastidip

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
I want to use it without the plastidip

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.130 
I want to use it without the plastidip
underneath<00:01:56.739> it<00:01:56.890> I<00:01:57.039> would<00:01:57.280> go<00:01:57.659> with<00:01:58.659> the<00:01:58.780> 3m

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
underneath it I would go with the 3m

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.100 
underneath it I would go with the 3m
because<00:01:59.619> as<00:01:59.860> you<00:02:00.489> can<00:02:00.610> see<00:02:00.789> it's<00:02:00.939> so<00:02:01.390> shiny<00:02:01.750> and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
because as you can see it's so shiny and

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.430 
because as you can see it's so shiny and
you<00:02:03.009> can't<00:02:03.280> even<00:02:03.459> tell<00:02:03.700> it's<00:02:04.360> on<00:02:04.599> there<00:02:04.929> I

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.300 

started<00:02:08.440> removing<00:02:08.799> these<00:02:09.280> on<00:02:09.549> both<00:02:10.479> sides<00:02:10.810> and

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
started removing these on both sides and

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.640 
started removing these on both sides and
what<00:02:12.310> I've<00:02:12.459> noticed<00:02:12.670> is<00:02:13.060> even<00:02:13.870> with<00:02:14.049> less<00:02:14.290> coat

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
what I've noticed is even with less coat

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.390 
what I've noticed is even with less coat
the<00:02:15.190> side<00:02:15.519> of<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:15.970> 3m<00:02:16.329> it<00:02:17.319> comes<00:02:17.709> out<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:18.160> lot

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
the side of the 3m it comes out a lot

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.210 
the side of the 3m it comes out a lot
thicker<00:02:19.019> maybe<00:02:20.019> because<00:02:20.350> of<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.620> material<00:02:21.160> on

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
thicker maybe because of the material on
