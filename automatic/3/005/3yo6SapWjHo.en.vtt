00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:08.219

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:15.150
 thoughts that I have not only mine 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:16.740
 own are talking about the people 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.360
 only about the things you do 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.750
 get drummed by the media 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:25.290
 to have 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.130
 totally others are interested in that 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.840

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.540
 Student and I have a personal opinion 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:44.400
 which direction I go because I am 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:48.800

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.090

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.010
 nobody is interested in one 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.630

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.630

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.119
 Newsreader is enough for me 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.390
 It is always possible to forget everything 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.830
 only for money 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:21.660
 I feel too small for fat 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.200
 too unpopular as if I forget who I am 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.040
 am 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:32.120
 as if I let you do that 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:37.760
 I have to go shopping 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.760
 I do not need anything else 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.979
 why do not I actually buy one 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:50.680
 Beef more was not a lie 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.869
 that milk the body sting vitamins 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.880
 destroys and even the cancer risk 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.880
 nobody says anything about it 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:06.240
 too much money is made as if 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.369
 the shelves speak to me 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:15.100
 I'll buy it anyway 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:17.850
 and not only the only advertising mindless 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.730
 entertainment and political idiocy 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:26.470
 flood the screens 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:29.890
 one lies more than the other and if 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.990
 The world only lies then lies 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.100
 truth will be the only thing 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.100
 we take faith 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:47.430
 Close my eyes 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:48.030
 look away no i have my own 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.370
 opinion 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.019
 I do not trust the beautiful pictures and 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.819
 the words that forbid me even 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.959
 think 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.750
 I will search and I will 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.939
 find truth even if it is not me 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:05.069
 I was aware that I was being manipulated 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:08.209
 or you notice it I hope you 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:13.560
 you are not just my opinion 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:16.159
 and now inform yourself about the 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.159
