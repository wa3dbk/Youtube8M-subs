00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.640
 sure when we finish the note I 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.930
 I'm going to remember to say one but there's the 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.780
 another must or recommended 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.910
 and it will happen but 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.730
 as what I like to read to me is 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.170
 fiction 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.890
 I will recommend 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.890
 fiction 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:28.210
 of the Argentine Julio cut a book of 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.210
 tales that is called bestiary 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.730
 great 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.690
 by garcía marquez 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.690
 chronicle of a death announced 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:54.500
 by arturo pérez reverte Spanish 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.500
 the queen of the south 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.929
 what is a novel a great novel 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.690
 of vargas llosa which I mentioned before 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.390
 there is a lot that I like the most to me is 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.180
 conversation in the cathedral 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.580
 but it's difficult and why do I do this 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.510
 clarification because sometimes there are moments 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.880
 to read certain books and I think that one 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.530
 as a reader it also requires certain 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.410
 training to enjoy certain 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.240
 things then if you have not read anything of 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.770
 vargas llosa I would not start by 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.530
 Conversation in the Cathedral also 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:38.150
 I would start with the city of dogs 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:41.500
 for example and then I would dare to 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.500
 something like conversation in the cathedral 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:50.000
 well I think I named a few 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:50.000
 when for five I repeated vargas llosa 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.579
 have to recommend some of some 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.579
 woman because recommended all men 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.460
 the Colombian laura restrepo 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.930
 has a beautiful novel called 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.930
 delirium 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.030
 I also recommend them over 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.040
 the most violent Colombia of the narco and 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.810
 and the ordinary people involved in that 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.670
 world or confronted with that world 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.209
 restrepo delirium is another model 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.209
 but I recommend
