00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.139
 our iphone ipod touch devices 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.700

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.980
 and well, what does this 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.220
 new tweet that I want to present you that 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.460
 it's called scrolling bar siman opening and 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.750
 what belgium scoring board sorry and good 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.149
 what he's going to do is the next thing 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.270
 We will control everything from our 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:37.109
 dock is to say that here I can control 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.289
 me the music and the rotation and here the 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:43.559
 volume and also appeared they were 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:45.239
 would appear the option to send the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.780
 sound via 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.399
 airplay in the same order we have all been 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.589
 infinite is to say put all the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.620
 pages of applications that we want in 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:59.159
 the doc and it's the same I like it a lot and another 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.649
 What this tweet brings is that 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.129
 move our screen pages 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.100
 normal 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.920
 how is left to move when they arrive is 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.200
 say for speed and how they tremble 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.370
 a little bit and another thing to do is that 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.990
 our folders 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.910
 folders and we will put the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.520
 applications that we want to say is to do 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.710
 the infinities and we could put all 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.330
 those that we want to our folders like this 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.130
 that is another option so let's 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.650
 see how we get it first of all 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:31.610
 we go to ideas 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.550
 we wait for him to make his insidy after 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.810
 we go and call sisters we are going to 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.380
 select surface 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:46.020
 then edit here we're going to put it almost 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:49.350
 we always occupy that is apt exodus point 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.170
 exodus dotcom here I show them 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.149
 in case they did not reach to listen and such 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.030
 which time is only click here 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.869
 search I do not do it because I already have 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.909
 added that little network you and add in 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.720
 a corner have it we're going from here 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.350
 search 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.520
 let's find scrolling board 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.780
 scrolling 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.500
 but an error 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.500
 scrolling 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.790
 screening word that I'm here 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.860
 scoring or power that says only 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.780
 we cover it here it disappeared 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.420
 he urged me seems to modify because I already 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.520
 I have but they tighten installed relies on 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.190
 once they have done all that and they 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.990
 it's going to look like one and with a settings for 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.270
 modify everything that I am here is for a 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.330
 amount 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.040
 is calling board and here good for 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.700
 example we can activate the ipad 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.520
 controls that would be these are ready 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.040
 come on ipod controls replay volume that is 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.150
 this for the volume if not 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.319
 we would like one of the two 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.469
 deactivate 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.599
 and they're not going to show up anymore 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:03.060
 we want it is calling doc here what 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.219
 can activate or deactivate what 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.409
 page want you to start the first the 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:10.560
 page that stays on the page 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.480
 ipod controls or in the volume and 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.319
 that there is a page indicator that 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.010
 Now I show you what that is 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.840
 bones that is the September in the 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.360
 icons when you switch between sheets 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.480
 how many icons per page 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.330
 of the doc is to say that it has 54 that is 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.480
 normal or 7 and you can put the 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:37.069
 that they want and then those of landscape that 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.200
 they would be like this in case of ipad 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.109
 and I think I'm not so sure about this 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.569
 and I'm going to check it, I do not remember well 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.579
 what are those and then in the same folder 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:50.349
 that are infinite that have that effect 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:53.389
 of beijing like this if they have the 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.219
 effect between browsing of pages for the 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.920
 springboard is the same here and here 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:59.689
 they handle the one that is so noticeable then 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.540
 this is what it does is what in word a 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.889
 an interesting click and what else 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.370
 like is that you can control everything from 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.300
 good here and told them what the 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:14.240
 beijing 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:16.549
 and good the indicator buttons 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.530
 pages are these when you're in the doc 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.930
 and it shows you this there is a 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.880
 little screen and a play button here already 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.430
 are two paintings and when you're in these 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.860
 leaves we will appear circles that are 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.840
 those from there and at the home of search that 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:35.300
 this is already here, this is how we 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.820
 would appear those help buttons or 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.900
 well the name that is 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.100
