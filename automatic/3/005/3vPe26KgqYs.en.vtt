 change of microsoft policies that 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.430
 let's say that from the beginning they did not 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.500
 they were going to let us borrow our games 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.660
 second hand those who wanted to do 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.330
 pay more money for selling even 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.840
 to our own games was not going to 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.760
 allow 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.250
 ultimately the free market 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.770
 second hand in xbox video games 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.990
 one they had to rectify 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.480
 even ozone and he used all this for 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.450
 make fun of microsoft groups accents 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.340

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.470

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.690
 the sonic clauses that well 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.300
 induces it to be are and it pleases 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.280
 now basically we run out 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.840
 second hand market in playstation 4 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.270
 I do not tell you more let's pay attention 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.400
 to this 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.620
 the one that has been mounted this week with the 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.050
 issue of second-hand policy in 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.850
 playstation 4 remember that news 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.040
 where they are and updated their 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.290
 playstation network clauses about 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.750
 the monitoring of our activity 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.489
 come on, this what it comes to be is that 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.860
 everything we do in playstation 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.900
 network can see any good 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.060
 anybody not organisms 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.100
 competent in security issues such as 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.960
 for example the police a lot of attention 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.050
 because many users started 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.420
 worry and think that with this what 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.490
 that they also wanted to do 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.280
 we could sell and lend securities 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.960
 physical playstation 4 to our 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.479
 friends the truth is that it was all a 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.910
 scandal since in the e3 itself they are and 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.470
 confirmed that we could do it good 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.170
 Attentive because they are and have wanted 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.300
 dispel different concerns has 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.190
 wanted to clarify doubts and through 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.410
 representatives of the company and 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.810
 own shuhei yoshida president of sony 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.330
 worldwide studios have confirmed that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.550
 these changes do not involve a blockage of 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.770
 the second hand since they are and they assure that 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.300
 we will have complete freedom to follow 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.620
 buying by lending 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.460
 our physical playstation 4 games 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.070
 regardless of the last 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.530
 update that he suffered on the subject of 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.780
 law station network clauses but 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.700
 attentive because this does not end here yes 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.770
 that it is true that if we look closely 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.990
 the clauses that have changed there is a 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.720
 of them in which they are and reserves the 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.520
 right to be able to remove this option in 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.710
 a future therefore the problem is that 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.750
 here the users did not say a single 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.610
 sonny hair and is that you have to put on 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.860
 in the worst situation because imagine 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.140
 that in the morning they are and suddenly 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.000
 tells us that we can not sell our 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.100
 second- hand games that we have to 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.250
 pay for it with that strategy so 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.320
 ridiculous that Xbox one proposed to us in his 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.660
 beginnings and that by the way they had to 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.880
 remove it running because if not your console 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.890
 they were going to buy them and well what 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.110
 you think about everyone 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.110
 these issues you think they are and plot something
