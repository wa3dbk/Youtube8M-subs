whatever but you know I guess there's a
fine<00:03:11.239> line<00:03:11.269> between<00:03:11.480> being<00:03:11.840> critical<00:03:12.620> and

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
fine line between being critical and

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.470 
fine line between being critical and
hate<00:03:13.700> but<00:03:15.400> you<00:03:16.400> know<00:03:16.549> there's<00:03:16.790> also<00:03:17.000> what<00:03:17.450> I
