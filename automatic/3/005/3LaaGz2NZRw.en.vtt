00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
windy and the seas are rough but 95% the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.800 
windy and the seas are rough but 95% the
time<00:01:28.789> is<00:01:28.939> good<00:01:29.149> and<00:01:29.299> it's<00:01:29.869> 95<00:01:30.560> percent<00:01:30.890> right

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810

and<00:01:32.810> what<00:01:33.380> put<00:01:33.530> you<00:01:33.649> guys<00:01:33.770> apart<00:01:34.100> from<00:01:34.249> other

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
and what put you guys apart from other

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.029 
and what put you guys apart from other
door<00:01:34.609> closes<00:01:35.530> probably<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.590> biggest<00:01:36.770> thing

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
door closes probably the biggest thing

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:38.679 
door closes probably the biggest thing
is<00:01:37.189> that<00:01:37.219> we<00:01:37.429> do<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.640> course<00:01:37.850> in<00:01:38.000> two<00:01:38.149> days<00:01:38.390> I

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
is that we do the course in two days I

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.779 
is that we do the course in two days I
think<00:01:39.649> well<00:01:39.799> two<00:01:39.979> days<00:01:40.009> that's<00:01:40.310> pretty<00:01:40.549> quick

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
think well two days that's pretty quick

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.969 
think well two days that's pretty quick
but<00:01:41.060> by<00:01:41.659> doing<00:01:41.929> the<00:01:41.990> e-learning<00:01:42.349> certainly

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
but by doing the e-learning certainly

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.469 
but by doing the e-learning certainly
makes<00:01:43.159> them<00:01:43.369> able<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.880> do<00:01:44.060> it<00:01:44.149> that<00:01:44.240> quickly

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
makes them able to do it that quickly

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.029 
makes them able to do it that quickly
and<00:01:44.630> having<00:01:44.959> small<00:01:45.200> groups<00:01:45.409> within<00:01:45.740> three

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
and having small groups within three

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.219 
and having small groups within three
people<00:01:46.429> you<00:01:46.670> saw<00:01:46.849> today<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.299> all<00:01:47.569> that's

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
people you saw today and all that's

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.929 
people you saw today and all that's
ahead<00:01:48.380> in<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.649> ocean<00:01:48.979> that<00:01:49.219> with<00:01:49.640> a<00:01:49.670> small

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
ahead in the ocean that with a small

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.369 
ahead in the ocean that with a small
group<00:01:50.149> it's<00:01:50.299> a<00:01:50.390> lot<00:01:50.509> easier<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.929> do<00:01:51.049> so<00:01:51.079> you<00:01:51.319> can

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:51.379 
group it's a lot easier to do so you can

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:52.600 
group it's a lot easier to do so you can
get<00:01:51.649> it<00:01:51.770> done<00:01:51.890> in<00:01:51.950> two<00:01:52.219> days

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
get it done in two days

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.029 
get it done in two days
