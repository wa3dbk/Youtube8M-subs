now<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:57.879> best<00:00:58.120> way<00:00:58.300> to<00:00:58.330> measure<00:00:58.540> this<00:00:58.839> is<00:00:58.900> with

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
now the best way to measure this is with

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.960 
now the best way to measure this is with
a<00:00:59.229> candy<00:00:59.589> thermometer<00:00:59.710> and<00:01:00.220> you<00:01:00.699> need<00:01:00.850> to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
a candy thermometer and you need to

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.759 
a candy thermometer and you need to
reach<00:01:01.150> what's<00:01:01.720> called<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.199> hard<00:01:02.440> crack<00:01:02.710> a

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
reach what's called the hard crack a

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.070 
reach what's called the hard crack a
candy<00:01:03.220> stage<00:01:03.489> this<00:01:04.150> can<00:01:04.420> be<00:01:04.540> determined<00:01:04.809> by

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
candy stage this can be determined by

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.719 
candy stage this can be determined by
using<00:01:05.260> a<00:01:05.470> glass<00:01:05.680> of<00:01:05.860> cold<00:01:06.100> water<00:01:06.159> I'll<00:01:06.520> put<00:01:06.700> a

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
using a glass of cold water I'll put a

foam<00:01:13.090> up<00:01:13.299> quite<00:01:13.600> a<00:01:13.630> bit<00:01:13.840> that's<00:01:14.080> why<00:01:14.260> we<00:01:14.380> need

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
foam up quite a bit that's why we need

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.830 
foam up quite a bit that's why we need
the<00:01:14.650> large<00:01:14.860> saucepan<00:01:15.299> keep<00:01:16.299> an<00:01:16.450> eye<00:01:16.570> on<00:01:16.600> it

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
the heat now you don't have to take it

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.870 
the heat now you don't have to take it
out<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.410> pot<00:01:41.650> I'm<00:01:41.860> pouring<00:01:42.220> in<00:01:42.340> mine<00:01:42.490> into

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
out of the pot I'm pouring in mine into

out of the pot I'm pouring in mine into
a<00:01:42.910> glass<00:01:43.210> container<00:01:43.420> because<00:01:43.870> it<00:01:43.990> has<00:01:44.110> a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
a glass container because it has a

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.720 
a glass container because it has a
little<00:01:44.350> spout<00:01:44.710> that's<00:01:44.980> gonna<00:01:45.130> make<00:01:45.310> it<00:01:45.430> easier

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
little spout that's gonna make it easier

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.910 
little spout that's gonna make it easier
to<00:01:45.760> pour<00:01:46.090> but<00:01:46.630> you<00:01:46.720> can<00:01:46.840> also<00:01:46.960> use<00:01:47.290> a<00:01:47.320> spoon<00:01:47.710> to

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
to pour but you can also use a spoon to

by<00:02:45.460> it'll<00:02:46.090> see<00:02:46.420> your<00:02:46.630> mixture<00:02:46.900> will<00:02:46.990> start<00:02:47.320> to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
by it'll see your mixture will start to

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.050 
by it'll see your mixture will start to
harden<00:02:47.650> on<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.070> if<00:02:48.340> this<00:02:48.520> happens<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:48.970> you

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
harden on you if this happens and you

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.040 
harden on you if this happens and you
can't<00:02:49.120> pour<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:49.690> anymore

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
can't pour it anymore

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.230 
can't pour it anymore
you<00:02:50.650> can<00:02:50.830> pop<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.220> glass<00:02:51.490> container<00:02:51.880> back<00:02:52.090> in

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
you can pop that glass container back in

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.060 
you can pop that glass container back in
the<00:02:52.330> microwave<00:02:52.480> and<00:02:53.020> heat<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:53.770> for<00:02:54.010> about

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
the microwave and heat it for about

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.200 
the microwave and heat it for about
10-15<00:02:54.820> seconds<00:02:55.540> until<00:02:55.990> the<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:57.700> maple<00:02:58.030> syrup

10-15 seconds until the the maple syrup

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.880 
10-15 seconds until the the maple syrup

starts to soften up and gets liquid

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.100 
starts to soften up and gets liquid
again<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.370> it's<00:03:00.490> pourable<00:03:00.910> once<00:03:01.120> more<00:03:01.570> when

again and it's pourable once more when

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.600 
again and it's pourable once more when
you<00:03:02.260> are<00:03:02.290> done<00:03:02.650> let<00:03:03.040> them<00:03:03.220> sit<00:03:03.460> at<00:03:03.580> room
