00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
version you know there's going to be a

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.880 
version you know there's going to be a
lot<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:18.930> people<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.259> are<00:01:19.380> higher<00:01:19.530> level<00:01:19.860> than

the<00:01:39.060> stuff<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.270> saw<00:01:39.479> before<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:40.200> know

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
the stuff you saw before you know

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.160 
the stuff you saw before you know
jugular<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.159> light<00:01:41.670> switch<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.079> be

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
jugular a light switch so you have to be

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.480 
jugular a light switch so you have to be
careful<00:01:43.320> depending<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.009> round<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.340> make

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
careful depending on the round to make

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.090 
careful depending on the round to make
sure<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.820> know<00:01:44.909> hey<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.630> jugular<00:01:46.170> don't<00:01:46.710> you

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
sure you know hey it's jugular don't you

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.170 
sure you know hey it's jugular don't you
know<00:01:47.220> make<00:01:47.399> sure<00:01:47.430> you're<00:01:47.700> watching<00:01:48.090> an

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
know make sure you're watching an

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.789 
know make sure you're watching an
ammunition<00:01:48.360> or<00:01:48.810> there's<00:01:49.170> good<00:01:49.320> ones<00:01:49.500> like

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
ammunition or there's good ones like

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.950 
ammunition or there's good ones like
brawler<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:50.759> okay<00:01:51.090> my<00:01:51.240> mail<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.570> super

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
brawler it's like okay my mail a super

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.960 
brawler it's like okay my mail a super
beefed<00:01:52.439> up<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.950> can<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:53.549> shot<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> lot

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
beefed up and I can like one shot a lot

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.249 
beefed up and I can like one shot a lot
of<00:01:54.090> stuff<00:01:54.270> because<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:54.720> three<00:01:55.140> hundred

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
of stuff because it's like three hundred

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.539 
of stuff because it's like three hundred
percent<00:01:55.680> more<00:01:55.799> damage<00:01:56.130> or<00:01:56.250> something<00:01:56.490> like

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
percent more damage or something like

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.789 
percent more damage or something like
that<00:01:56.640> or<00:01:56.880> catapult<00:01:57.360> which<00:01:57.990> recharges<00:01:58.710> your

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
that or catapult which recharges your

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.980 
that or catapult which recharges your
grenades<00:01:59.100> faster<00:01:59.610> so<00:02:00.479> essentially<00:02:00.899> you're

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
grenades faster so essentially you're

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.630 
grenades faster so essentially you're
going<00:02:01.229> into<00:02:01.409> these<00:02:01.530> rooms<00:02:01.590> they're<00:02:02.399> always

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
going into these rooms they're always

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.330 
going into these rooms they're always
race<00:02:03.360> specific<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.680> you're<00:02:05.070> going<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.250> have

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
race specific so you're going to have

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.670 
race specific so you're going to have
like<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.579> hive<00:02:05.850> kind<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.479> room<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.990> fallen<00:02:07.409> kind

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
like a hive kind of room a fallen kind

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.999 
like a hive kind of room a fallen kind
of<00:02:07.740> room<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:08.069> X<00:02:08.250> kinda<00:02:08.550> rooms

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
of room of X kinda rooms

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.859 
of room of X kinda rooms
and<00:02:09.129> each<00:02:09.729> of<00:02:09.879> those<00:02:09.970> rooms<00:02:10.239> you're<00:02:10.689> going<00:02:10.810> to

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
and each of those rooms you're going to

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.530 
and each of those rooms you're going to
get<00:02:11.049> three<00:02:11.769> different<00:02:11.860> waves<00:02:12.220> of<00:02:12.580> monsters

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
get three different waves of monsters

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.880 
get three different waves of monsters
that<00:02:13.689> are<00:02:13.750> going<00:02:14.049> to<00:02:14.110> attack<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.500> depending

that are going to attack you depending

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.289 
that are going to attack you depending
on<00:02:14.980> of<00:02:15.159> course<00:02:15.189> the<00:02:15.489> math<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:15.909> have<00:02:16.060> and

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
on of course the math that you have and

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.899 
on of course the math that you have and
as<00:02:17.200> you're<00:02:17.590> doing<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.829> you<00:02:18.549> might<00:02:18.730> run<00:02:18.849> into

as you're doing that you might run into

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.819 
as you're doing that you might run into
something<00:02:19.569> cool<00:02:20.110> called<00:02:20.379> a<00:02:20.470> critical

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
something cool called a critical

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.699 
something cool called a critical
objective<00:02:21.250> now<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:22.390> comes<00:02:23.200> in<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.379> form<00:02:23.409> of

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
objective now that comes in the form of

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.890 
objective now that comes in the form of
you<00:02:24.129> know<00:02:24.250> you<00:02:24.310> have<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.760> not<00:02:25.450> only<00:02:25.480> kill<00:02:25.780> the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
you know you have to not only kill the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.990 
you know you have to not only kill the
monsters<00:02:26.260> on<00:02:26.409> a<00:02:26.440> map<00:02:26.680> but<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.430> also<00:02:27.579> have<00:02:27.970> to

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
monsters on a map but you also have to

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.420 
monsters on a map but you also have to
like<00:02:28.480> defuse<00:02:29.230> mines<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:30.010> like<00:02:30.220> three

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
like defuse mines in like three

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.800 
like defuse mines in like three
different<00:02:30.579> locations<00:02:30.760> or<00:02:31.269> you<00:02:31.390> might<00:02:31.540> have<00:02:31.690> to

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
different locations or you might have to

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.449 
different locations or you might have to
destroy<00:02:32.440> some<00:02:32.680> lines<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:33.099> are<00:02:33.190> in<00:02:33.280> three

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
destroy some lines that are in three

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.759 
destroy some lines that are in three
different<00:02:33.610> locations<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.959> you're<00:02:35.620> going<00:02:35.709> to

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
different locations so you're going to

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.099 
different locations so you're going to
go<00:02:35.829> from<00:02:36.129> room<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.579> room<00:02:36.609> to<00:02:36.940> room<00:02:36.970> until<00:02:37.900> you

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
go from room to room to room until you

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.869 
go from room to room to room until you
get<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:38.680> think<00:02:39.099> the<00:02:39.189> fourth<00:02:39.400> room<00:02:39.609> which<00:02:39.760> is

fight another boss and the cool thing
for<00:02:55.030> me<00:02:55.120> i<00:02:55.150> did<00:02:55.450> i<00:02:55.480> did<00:02:55.569> a<00:02:55.690> 32<00:02:56.139> version<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:57.299> the

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
for me i did i did a 32 version and the

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.020 
for me i did i did a 32 version and the
boss<00:02:58.480> actually<00:02:58.750> had<00:02:59.019> a<00:02:59.049> modifier<00:02:59.500> that<00:03:00.030> hasn't

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
boss actually had a modifier that hasn't

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.910 
boss actually had a modifier that hasn't
been<00:03:01.060> in<00:03:01.209> destiny<00:03:01.540> before<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.049> it's<00:03:02.200> i<00:03:02.560> guess

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
been in destiny before and it's i guess

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
been in destiny before and it's i guess
the<00:03:03.010> easiest<00:03:03.129> way<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.430> explain<00:03:03.519> is<00:03:03.819> like<00:03:03.909> a

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
the easiest way to explain is like a

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.599 
the easiest way to explain is like a
rainbow<00:03:04.180> shield<00:03:04.569> because<00:03:05.200> he<00:03:05.920> recalibrates

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
rainbow shield because he recalibrates

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.210 
rainbow shield because he recalibrates
his<00:03:06.760> armor<00:03:07.180> dependent<00:03:08.170> like<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:08.530> it's<00:03:09.010> either

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
his armor dependent like it it's either

always very random and it sounds like

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
on there I think it's it's just trying

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.830 
on there I think it's it's just trying
to<00:04:27.370> reward<00:04:27.729> the<00:04:27.849> player<00:04:28.060> for<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.389> time<00:04:28.660> that

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
to reward the player for the time that

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.740 
to reward the player for the time that
they<00:04:28.960> spent<00:04:29.319> right<00:04:29.530> and<00:04:30.180> taking<00:04:31.180> away<00:04:31.300> some<00:04:31.720> of

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
they spent right and taking away some of

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.930 
they spent right and taking away some of
the<00:04:31.840> randomness<00:04:32.289> is<00:04:32.680> a<00:04:33.160> really<00:04:33.729> good<00:04:33.880> thing

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
the randomness is a really good thing

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.490 
the randomness is a really good thing
right<00:04:34.120> it's<00:04:34.449> something<00:04:34.690> that<00:04:34.810> even<00:04:34.960> Diablo

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
right it's something that even Diablo

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.860 
right it's something that even Diablo
did<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:36.069> which<00:04:36.699> is<00:04:36.729> why<00:04:37.000> kind<00:04:37.479> of<00:04:37.539> had<00:04:37.780> this

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
to get over there you know like let's go

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.570 
to get over there you know like let's go
to<00:06:13.960> the<00:06:14.050> back<00:06:14.199> room<00:06:14.349> and<00:06:14.530> it's<00:06:14.740> not

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
to the back room and it's not

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.610 
to the back room and it's not
necessarily<00:06:16.000> to<00:06:16.599> the<00:06:16.690> depth<00:06:16.960> of<00:06:17.139> that<00:06:17.380> in

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
necessarily to the depth of that in

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.279 
necessarily to the depth of that in
terms<00:06:17.770> of<00:06:18.030> puzzle<00:06:19.030> solving<00:06:19.360> but<00:06:19.599> there<00:06:20.080> are

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.289 
terms of puzzle solving but there are

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:21.959 
terms of puzzle solving but there are
like<00:06:20.620> smaller<00:06:21.130> things<00:06:21.370> like<00:06:21.520> the<00:06:21.639> critical

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969 
like smaller things like the critical

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:23.249 
like smaller things like the critical
objectives<00:06:22.060> and<00:06:22.509> things<00:06:22.719> that<00:06:22.870> you<00:06:22.960> have<00:06:23.139> to

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:23.259 
objectives and things that you have to

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:25.830 
objectives and things that you have to
put<00:06:23.409> bill<00:06:23.590> and<00:06:23.949> I<00:06:24.250> think<00:06:24.490> this<00:06:25.090> is<00:06:25.270> good<00:06:25.630> for

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
put bill and I think this is good for

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.420 
put bill and I think this is good for
like<00:06:25.930> the<00:06:26.080> wider<00:06:26.289> audience<00:06:26.770> right<00:06:27.069> like<00:06:27.250> I

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
like the wider audience right like I

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.950 
like the wider audience right like I
think<00:06:27.819> it's<00:06:27.940> actually<00:06:28.330> a<00:06:28.389> pretty<00:06:28.569> good<00:06:28.659> time

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
think it's actually a pretty good time

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.589 
think it's actually a pretty good time
to<00:06:29.110> get<00:06:29.199> come<00:06:29.440> back<00:06:29.650> because<00:06:30.099> it's<00:06:31.029> easier<00:06:31.479> to

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 
to get come back because it's easier to

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.629 
to get come back because it's easier to
get<00:06:31.719> to<00:06:31.900> a<00:06:31.930> higher<00:06:32.110> light<00:06:32.349> level<00:06:32.680> there's<00:06:33.339> more

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:33.639 
get to a higher light level there's more

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:34.490 
get to a higher light level there's more
things<00:06:33.820> for<00:06:34.089> you<00:06:34.150> to<00:06:34.180> do

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
things for you to do

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.350 
things for you to do
you<00:06:34.560> that<00:06:35.010> you<00:06:35.130> couldn't<00:06:35.370> do<00:06:35.580> before<00:06:35.610> because

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
you that you couldn't do before because

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.570 
you that you couldn't do before because
in<00:06:36.600> the<00:06:37.020> past<00:06:37.140> is<00:06:37.380> like<00:06:37.410> you<00:06:37.680> meet<00:06:38.010> by<00:06:38.190> people

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 
in the past is like you meet by people

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.770 
in the past is like you meet by people
or<00:06:38.730> you're<00:06:38.820> kind<00:06:39.030> of<00:06:39.090> screwed<00:06:39.330> out<00:06:39.570> of<00:06:39.600> that

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
or you're kind of screwed out of that

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.420 
or you're kind of screwed out of that
last<00:06:39.990> light<00:06:40.290> level<00:06:40.620> you're<00:06:40.800> not<00:06:40.920> there's

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
last light level you're not there's

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.010 
last light level you're not there's
those<00:06:41.820> restrictions<00:06:42.120> are<00:06:42.390> kind<00:06:42.570> of<00:06:42.600> go<00:06:42.720> on<00:06:42.840> now

those restrictions are kind of go on now
right<00:06:43.230> the<00:06:43.740> accessibility<00:06:44.250> is<00:06:44.490> the<00:06:44.580> big<00:06:44.730> thing

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
right the accessibility is the big thing
