00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.820
 hello to all welcome to the forum he did not have his collection to have us 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.219
 to take today wrote my first card so for that he you 

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:10.219
 just go to the main game folder 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.169
 so if you want to create a map for the battle for middle ground 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.759
 200 gives it you will go to this folder 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:21.130
 if this is the case for the lady who understands the new leaves the 

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:22.340
 new faction in marble 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.039
 then you go here 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.869
 what you need to know that the new software understand them but not 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:27.869
 the former 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.869
 we are looking for standards that we double click on 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.949
 this window often so the cats do not and accepts 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.320
 now we are waiting for the loading 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.250
 So here is the fina opened 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.220
 we started playing cat and mouse right now and imanche 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.930
 with that wheel 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.500
 by marking by pressing the right button it can be seen the NATO 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.060
 bottom left to right 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.060
 pressing the net can rotate it 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.080
 so we will give everything for the first French sim card 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.460
 clicking on bankruptcy 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.190
 so we're going to give a frenette size breaking by cassan height width 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.760
 we will leave the initial height if the sale 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.220
 we will note the case she writes in the sky then the first thing to 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.390
 to do is to go into the ten 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.840
 edited to the test while actually charging the players who are at stake had 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.030
 initially 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.520
 in the software can always do it so conclusion that time and we 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.920
 saw that the euro 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.100
 they all appeared 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.659
 but then we have to give 100 points to start here are our 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.130
 different Basque players for a breakout players it takes no minimum of 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.260
 players 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.010
 so for that we go to the teeth onuci or and apples site 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.680
 so with tanguy appeared 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.220
 on the left and we see what has changed 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.390
 so we click on the map 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.609
 and we have to go far back and paul houde will be arbitrated by m 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:13.030
 so that's not the starting point of the player 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.579
 you have to scroll through the roms 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:16.930
 and it's no longer time 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.089
 service point 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.129
 so the major will start at the bottom right you can put where the 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.209
 relationship 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.529
 we will do them 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:28.349
 like that we explained hop we found once on the time 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:32.049
 the simple remedies players ohio we scroll again 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:36.379
 of course the space 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.139
 so we have two players who have started so far the date of the players 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.079
 sushi 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.079
 than that for this to be playable 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.119
 then if you have any questions 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:48.539
 edited to this one 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:51.979
 to change it all the info in fact of your card 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:52.959
 so the number 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.440
 we go to metz map gold 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.309
 for example 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:58.430
 then the time if you want it to be morning afternoon late afternoon 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:59.020
 or at night 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.169
 we will choose the night 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:04.200
 everything related to the camera global info this one so for now on 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.309
 will beat shower alas had actually the data that will appear in 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:10.669
 the game the top on your map so we are for example our new map 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:16.139
 was created 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.489
 so what you need to know is that for the nasdaq-100 laziness forgiveness 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.460
 on the classic map 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.690
 the multiplayer card listings he gave us alexandre use no 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.990
 that for the end of their tour a little bit face to avoid actions 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.299
 or else I'll write you like that without an accent 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.469
 here is then in Cairo 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:39.810
 we can already see that the night appeared then to save you have to go 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:41.139
 in fight 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.099
 seabass 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.260
 so you give back 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.010
 in this letter exactly the same name as in my seventh art 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.889
 that is, in the morning 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.149
 we click on the button 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:54.629
 we record about once again we give the name we learn 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:58.409
 for recorded injuries 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.409
 so now we can close the software directly 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.069
 and go see that on the desk in Rwanda 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.759
 files 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:09.759
 this one we know is that the point down his jacket this one is going 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.620
 for the moment nothing 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.719
 to open the uda tonight 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.340
 and that's going to be the mini-map that it appears in the game 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.079
 we will go from fission to 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:18.930
 two girlfriends 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.139
 so further 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.479
 a first copy in the main file 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.590
 so I had already created one 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.590
 of the same name comes to ask to replace them in the street 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:32.090
 to avoid any luggage 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.059
 e 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:36.059
 in the next version 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.610
 with the software 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.789
 eyi go 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.559
 go on the desktop to right click 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:45.559
 the file and we will give back actors themselves 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.159
 and we will go 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:53.159
 again it's files to make a second copy 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.259
 and finally this file 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.449
 we would have cut we're going to put them in a style note which is to start it 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.960
 for your computer 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.870
 after we go the big data surfaces so I pick up windows it's like 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.479
 what's called as well you work stressed the chew under vista if 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.330
 you work under xp it's called application data 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.650
 so if you do not see it then had to whether there is or not 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.559
 folder options 

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:20.099
 display 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.159
 you go down a little bit but actually to do in there files of his 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.460
 stamps these posters and hidden folders and files that needs to be 

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:27.809
 selected 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:29.969
 so then poker 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.419
 for once you see it you're going to denain 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.419
 then in our mines so always under vista 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.190
 but if this is the case for the Lord of the Rings the battle for the state 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.940
 decreased by 120 tons of water using examples we c with the deal so 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.270
 we go the social name 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.520
 then in my head 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.889
 and finally accepted 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.539
 you are going to anger 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.449
 your record the dance 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:53.180
 and all your cards that you download on the internet so if if he 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.529
 will have to put them 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:56.460
 so everything must be stored in the folder 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.039
 so it's a bit closed 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:59.999
 and in fact we can go check 

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:02.999
 what can open a charisma 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.550
 we restart the software 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.310
 so not the fault 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.639
 the latest maps that have been associated with his mister here 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.319
 if that was the case you go so you lose you can open the door of 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:28.949
 dull 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:33.069
 a b3 of the three games that you can save so we can go we can 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:36.419
 take that of the office 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.339
 and we see that the year comes to repair 

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:40.389
 as well as the trendy flocks 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:41.909
 konami 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:45.409
 so for now it's the end of the basics I tell you next time 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.830
 and good luck
