00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 And then, beauty guys, I'm just going to make one more. 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.850
 video for you 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.340
 and this time, I'll continue 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.370
 to that series d how to profit in the last 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.030
 stint and in this episode that is the second 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.340
 huh 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.340
 I'm talking about the best method 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.029
 so you can profit on your last 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.670
 this is a very saturated method since 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.949
 a lot of people use it but it's for good reason 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.220
 I would simply go the best method of 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.529
 all beauty 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.120
 basically this method is part of a 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.980
 phrase that I think you have already heard 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.790
 talk and so buy cheap sell more 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.010
 expensive then sure that's how you profit 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.110
 ultimate, of course, you 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.110
 You can play the matches and I won only 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.199
 this method to complement money is 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.530
 great lot of people used this before 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.629
 tournaments to become more famous with 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.359
 rewards best year fifa 13 and 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.120
 concision and everything else then what you 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.720
 will make you say will do so 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.270
 that you want to profit from a robot and 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.830
 say the average price of the robot is 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.409
 11 thousand 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.090
 so if you buy a robot 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.720
 for ten thousand 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.210
 You're going to profit a thousand right and wrong. 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.540
 because it is wrong because there it charges a fee 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.060
 of 5 percent on all sales of the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.400
 last stint because she does it is 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.680
 because otherwise the people would buy the player 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.659
 then selling 250 more is doing it 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.200
 that the market inflates many 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.119
 need to rise exponentially beauty 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.240
 so let's say you bought it 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.909
 Robinho for 10 thousand and you sold for 11 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.159
 thousand dollars as expensive as money 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.840
 you will win so you know if it fits 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.360
 the price you have sold and multiply by 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.840
 0.95 then you sold it for 11 thousand 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.380
 you will be earning approximately 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:05.070
 about 550 in this transaction that you bought 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.890
 for 10,000 then you sold for 11 thousand 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.950
 and see if we make a profit, we get 550 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.660
 more or less because of this rate of 5 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.260
 percent of that beauty then 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.470
 always has seed and only is not unique 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.100
 way you profit because you have other 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.070
 variables to increase your profit 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.190
 because if you are making profit from 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.290
 500 so it will not take long 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.900
 it's that easy 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.570
 do this method with a lot of 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.140
 players at once 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.060
 do it in bulk then you think then 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.540
 if I do it in bulk and if I stay 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.400
 Profiting 500 thousand employees I go 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.800
 earn a reasonable profit when you sell 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.750
 at least a 30 once these 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.480
 things then what you have to do 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.680
 For you, you could find the players. 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.640
 cheaper 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.500
 You have to study the market a lot. 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.480
 This is the part that a lot of people do not have 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.880
 patience to do you have to 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.410
 to study the market prices of each 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.810
 More or less, you are. 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.820
 looking and then you will know more or 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.590
 less what is the average price of them 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.930
 How much can you make? 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.620
 But there's something else for you to do. 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.400
 also 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.440
 you can change both training and 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.190
 to the position of the player you want 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.730
 to profit 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:31.209
 then for example robot in lw that 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:34.780
 would be more offensive wing 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.990
 it costs 11 thousand if you change the position 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.360
 from him to lm that would be a 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.989
 defensive his price will rise 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:47.560
 so you can see there that the robot 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.910
 lm must be more expensive than the robot lw 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.030
 so easy 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:56.500
 buy cheaper with robot and then 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:59.440
 change his position look for the price of 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.050
 position even though you 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.880
 maximize your profits you can also 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.920
 exchange information then 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.050
 You bought that robot in training. 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.350
 3 5 2 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.290
 try to change his training to 4 12 12 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.080
 that the most expensive fifa line there 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.930
 will get 422 cockroach 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.780
 you will get the profits of 3 thousand 4 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.460
 thousand is 2 thousand per player 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.840
 requires a lot of patience because it will have to 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.240
 find the player 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.419
 then the position and then the formation 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.760
 cheaper and this requires a lot of patience 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:42.020
 then the key to all the techniques that 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.389
 Told you, Nando is the beauty patience. 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.700
 Now it's no use for you. 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.880
 buy the balotelli which is a 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.490
 centered and change the position 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.180
 No one will want to drive you. 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.370
 purchase 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.350
 it will cost more expensive yes only 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.120
 No one wants a steering wheel. You'll be late. 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.669
 a lot to sell 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.390
 so who can you switch to 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:08.510
 wheel midfield that has status 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.790
 defensive good examples and hernanes 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.960
 many people will want it in the position of 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.840
 steering wheel 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.450
 xavi as well and other players 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.340
 then only without changing there to the steering wheel 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.650
 a lot of people will want it and you will 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.510
 Maximize your profit do this en masse and 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.990
 Do you have enough money in your account? 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:30.350
 Yes, beauty will require a lot of patience. 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:33.320
 and also requires a prior study of the 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:36.290
 market and do not try to do this with 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:39.290
 very expensive players, for example you 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.810
 wants to buy messi and exchange information 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.450
 because he thinks he's going to make a profit you do not 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.300
 because the rate of 5% is going to be 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:50.450
 very high I already did it on fifa 12 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.820
 start and I lost a lot of money do not 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.160
 I buy the same cheap and players 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.620
 often do this with players 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.660
 less than 20 thousand for you do not have a 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.840
 very large loss in that rate and hence 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.430
 Full beauty and just wanted to talk, just have 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.479
 that going to you is a good technique 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:10.789
 basic and well-publicized here in fifa 11 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:12.800
 ultimate team but then beauty is not gonna 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:16.690
 getting everything good here I do not know if by 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.690
 there, and he said
