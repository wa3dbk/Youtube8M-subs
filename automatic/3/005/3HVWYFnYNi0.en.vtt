 video description hello to all my 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.220
 subscribers and viewers of my channel 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.710
 Today, finally, the long-awaited video about 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.279
 how to run pour water into our 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.439
 aquarium 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.930
 pouring water into the aquarium and of course we take 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.240
 ordinary tap water should be such 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.520
 volumes it will be impossible for me 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.350
 defend at home so i will flood 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.980
 in the aquarium and its own 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:36.500
 i.e. bucket water of some 30 buckets 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.449
 first pour into the aquarium 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.550
 is that I am going to put it in an aquarium 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:45.559
 the technical side and the first will be this 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.790
 pump filter here is a company if 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:54.260
 I fully collect then she will 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:56.739
 look something like this in this 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.769
 there is no filter in this filter bay 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:04.070
 some kind of obscure stuff like washcloths 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:06.979
 tough we remove and wrap it 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.010
 on top of our plastic grilles 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.010
 lattice 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.630
 close the ring dreamed 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:26.420
 and inside and straighten it to be 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.140
 the entire surface of this grid as well as 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.380
 this filter 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:35.840
 coward and you plastic balls and 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:38.000
 floors and filtering occurs due to 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.100
 the bacteria that he live in these 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.960
 balls and connectable 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.960
 get a deep enough filter 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.080
 where there will be water not only from the surface 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.450
 climb but from 1 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.450
 this is much more convenient our filter will be 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.929
 a little like a customer and he is one 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.350
 this one fits the size 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.350
 of our aquarium 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:13.400
 also i will take the usual acting 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:15.620
 50 watt thermostat I take 50 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.110
 watt thermostat on your 300 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.100
 l because I no longer need to have 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.630
 I will not have my heating in the apartment 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.840
 no interruption in heating 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.030
 I can just turn it on 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.320
 reducing the temperature it will gradually 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.269
 heat my will also be me 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.970
 the usual thermometer which I will measure 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.019
 temperature further that i will contribute to 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:46.510
 an aquarium is a squirrel 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:50.690
 from the company tetra in it 12 capsules 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.910
 yellow-green bergen cleaves 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.079
 everything from the measure of the plant 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.209
 food fish excrement and everything else so 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.709
 that it contains microbes 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.780
 which will support my 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.269
 ecosystem of margins first time on this 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.819
 all for now for now i will pour water i 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.859
 turn off to pour water we take 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.010
 you can take a huge plate 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:19.280
 you can take the average put it on one 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:22.670
 of our aquarium so as not to blur our 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.970
 soil and gradually begin to fill it 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.970
 water 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.769
 it will probably take me 15 minutes 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.769
 filling water up the black strip it 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:43.819
 self adhesive black we have 2 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:46.720
 centimeters to the top now we have 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.610
 time to install the filter and 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.860
 near where water will be sucked 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.860
 insert 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.860
 thermostat 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.410
 the water is very cold 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.340
 install on thermometers and 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.340
 temperature controllers 25 degrees 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.580
 here is our thermometer we put it in 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.040
 another country of our karim where there is none 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.780
 filter is not a heater we set to 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.780
 monitor the temperature in this corner 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.180
 okay something in cold water it doesn't 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.330
 sticks 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.190
 abad circulates here the filter goes to this 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.900
 the side comes back and again this 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.240
 whirlpool in this state already 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.170
 speak fast for 5 days then i will put 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.060
 he already has live plants visible 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.770
 what's in this big aquarium from me 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.240
 will become an ordinary internal filter 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.820
 Some will say why you need him 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.830
 if you can put the outside world outside 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.080
 filter is not needed because I will 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.260
 herbalist I won't have huge either 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.150
 type of astronotus from the skin of gill for 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.550
 would be an ordinary herbalist where enough 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.480
 there will be a filter to 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.240
 mix water 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.980
 also have you wondering about 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.920
 notebooks around then i can tell 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.780
 next video write in the comments 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.830
 bay cold water but saw that 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.830
 condensation forms 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.480
 some aquarists buy aquarium 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.430
 they think that they have been prevented from talking because 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:51.120
 what is this condenser top down flows down 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.230
 and on what is some water formed 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.840
 it's condensate 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.180
 so no big deal if you have 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.580
 at home the boler can be adjusted 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.930
 our water is up to 25 degrees and just 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.090
 no condensate in the aquarium 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.320
 somewhere in Odessa you pour water over 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.030
 to someone else write as in 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.340
 comments and this video came up 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.950
 the end of how to pour water into the aquarium 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.500
 how to put all his technical 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.720
 side this is a filter thermostat and 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.800
 thermometer someone can something else be 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.430
 write but for now i don't need to 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.230
 join our VKontakte groups 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.530
