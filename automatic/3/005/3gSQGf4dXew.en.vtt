00:00:04.168 --> 00:00:07.175
 "Los tres musqueteros" is a film that I always wanted to do. 

00:00:08.697 --> 00:00:10.220
 There are fights with swords ... 

00:00:12.254 --> 00:00:14.508
 We show something that has never been seen. 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.207
 It is a fantastic action and adventure film. 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.065
 It is very elaborate. 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.873
 The great thing is that we use 21st century technology for a 400-year history. 

00:00:31.162 --> 00:00:32.957
 It's fresh and very fun. 

00:00:33.156 --> 00:00:34.727
 We were 4 against 40. 

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:38.040
 Were they 40 or 400? 

00:00:38.307 --> 00:00:41.007
 Only 40 ... It was a lazy day. 

00:00:41.952 --> 00:00:43.480
 They know me as an action director. 

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:48.530
 So you already know there will be action. And I want to improve myself ... 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.196
 Master the set and the fights. And it looks a lot like what he did with "Resident Evil". 

00:00:58.087 --> 00:01:01.144
 The musketeers were like seventeenth-century rock stars. 

00:01:01.608 --> 00:01:05.910
 The three musketeers are the king's guard, as well as elite soldiers. 

00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:08.603
 I wanted the sword fights to look real. 

00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:12.891
 Real swords and people fighting seriously. There are no doubles in the movie. 

00:01:13.293 --> 00:01:15.123
 We train for 4 months. 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.935
 There is nothing false. The sword does not pass 1 meter from the face of the other actor. 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.965
 If they hit you with the sword it hurts. You can see the spark when the swords hit 

00:01:26.783 --> 00:01:30.300
 My character fights against 8 or 10 guards. 

00:01:30.693 --> 00:01:36.422
 With the dress and the petticoat .... Fight with two swords and turn on the back of the others. 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.504
 It is the first action scene of a woman with a corset and a period dress. 

00:01:43.707 --> 00:01:45.647
 They have very elaborate devices. 

00:01:48.268 --> 00:01:48.879
 Swords... 

00:01:49.536 --> 00:01:50.000
 Daggers ... 

00:01:50.771 --> 00:01:51.463
 Musketry. 

00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:59.120
 We think a lot about armament: it's like when James Bond opens the secret panel and we see all those incredible guns. 

00:01:59.365 --> 00:02:03.420
 What they did was impressive and will give another dimension to what we do. 

00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:08.000
 Touch those incredible subjects that do not have time. 

00:02:08.638 --> 00:02:11.125
 Courage, honor ... All for one. 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:16.496
 It's the fantasy of a child when you have a stick and you play with swords. 

00:02:17.153 --> 00:02:18.973
 Everyone wants to be one of the musketeers. 

00:02:19.315 --> 00:02:24.012
 It could be loyalty or patriotism, but I think everyone believes in love. 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.708
 In short, it's what they fight for: love for each other, for France, for adventure. 

00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:31.805
 I have the best job in the world. 

00:02:33.076 --> 00:02:37.829
 This is definitely not the version of "The Three Musketeers" of their parents or grandparents. 

00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:41.998
 Each generation should have their version of "The Three Musketeers". 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:44.501
 It will be a true visual feast. 

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:53.364
 "LOS TRES MOSQUETEROS" IN 3D 

00:02:53.752 --> 00:02:57.623
