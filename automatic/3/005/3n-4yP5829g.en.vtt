night<00:00:06.150> vision<00:00:06.450> has<00:00:06.690> gone<00:00:06.870> up<00:00:06.960> as<00:00:07.200> well<00:00:07.770> as<00:00:07.950> some

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
night vision has gone up as well as some

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.100 
night vision has gone up as well as some
slight<00:00:08.610> GUI<00:00:08.970> changes<00:00:09.330> as<00:00:09.510> well<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.929> so<00:00:10.050> I

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
slight GUI changes as well and so I

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.330 
slight GUI changes as well and so I
thought<00:00:10.260> I'd<00:00:10.380> get<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.620> guys<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:10.950> girls<00:00:11.160> quick

thought I'd get you guys and girls quick
video<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.300> can<00:00:12.389> see<00:00:12.509> what's<00:00:12.690> going<00:00:12.960> on

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
video so you can see what's going on

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.200 
video so you can see what's going on
what's<00:00:13.620> heading<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:14.099> what<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.370> believe<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.880> next

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
what's heading in what I believe is next

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.060 
what's heading in what I believe is next
week's<00:00:15.389> patch<00:00:15.690> so<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.710> can<00:00:16.830> see<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
week's patch so you can see the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.130 
week's patch so you can see the
different<00:00:17.850> UI<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.150> above<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.539> terminals

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
different UI is above the terminals

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.779 
different UI is above the terminals
certainly<00:00:20.039> makes<00:00:20.220> things<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.400> lot<00:00:20.490> easier<00:00:20.550> to

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
certainly makes things a lot easier to

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.390 
certainly makes things a lot easier to
see<00:00:21.060> it's<00:00:21.330> less<00:00:21.510> cluttered<00:00:22.010> the<00:00:23.010> hazards<00:00:23.279> have

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
see it's less cluttered the hazards have

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.710 
see it's less cluttered the hazards have
been<00:00:23.519> changes<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.939> text<00:00:24.090> above<00:00:24.359> players

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
been changes to the text above players

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.990 
been changes to the text above players
as<00:00:24.960> well<00:00:25.070> Charlie<00:00:26.070> makes<00:00:26.250> them<00:00:26.400> difficult<00:00:26.640> to

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
as well Charlie makes them difficult to

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.120 
as well Charlie makes them difficult to
read<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:27.480> /<00:00:27.960> bug<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:28.680> hopefully<00:00:28.980> that

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
read but / bug that so hopefully that

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.849 
read but / bug that so hopefully that
destroyed<00:00:29.550> out<00:00:29.730> before<00:00:30.000> those<00:00:30.150> life<00:00:30.390> and

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
destroyed out before those life and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.549 
destroyed out before those life and
here's<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.040> new<00:00:32.219> night-vision<00:00:32.550> effect<00:00:33.559> it's

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
here's the new night-vision effect it's

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.740 
here's the new night-vision effect it's
quite<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.829> bit<00:00:34.950> more<00:00:35.100> realistic<00:00:35.399> i<00:00:35.670> think<00:00:35.850> for

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
quite a bit more realistic i think for

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.229 
quite a bit more realistic i think for
general<00:00:37.260> datum<00:00:37.530> conditions<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.969> no

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
general datum conditions really no

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.940 
general datum conditions really no
benefits<00:00:41.450> perhaps<00:00:42.450> even<00:00:42.600> argue<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.230> into

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
benefits perhaps even argue that into

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.130 
benefits perhaps even argue that into
the<00:00:44.550> sunlight<00:00:44.820> that's<00:00:45.239> actually<00:00:45.899> bit<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the sunlight that's actually bit of a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.279 
the sunlight that's actually bit of a
detriment<00:00:47.989> things<00:00:48.989> flare<00:00:49.289> even<00:00:49.500> more<00:00:51.230> but<00:00:52.230> as

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
detriment things flare even more but as

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.180 
detriment things flare even more but as
soon<00:00:52.410> as<00:00:52.469> things<00:00:52.739> start<00:00:53.309> getting<00:00:53.399> dark<00:00:55.070> as<00:00:56.070> you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
soon as things start getting dark as you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.860 
soon as things start getting dark as you
might<00:00:56.309> imagine<00:00:56.399> for<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.210> being<00:00:57.390> night<00:00:57.570> vision

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
might imagine for it being night vision

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.110 
might imagine for it being night vision
things<00:00:58.770> start<00:00:59.160> getting<00:00:59.250> quite<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> bit<00:00:59.910> more

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
things start getting quite a bit more

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.599 
things start getting quite a bit more
useful<00:01:00.930> there's<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> nice<00:01:01.949> noise<00:01:02.219> effect

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
useful there's like a nice noise effect

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.080 
useful there's like a nice noise effect
but<00:01:02.910> they've<00:01:03.120> added<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:04.760> that<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.850> tend<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
but they've added on that you tend to

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.429 
but they've added on that you tend to
get<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.799> low<00:01:07.799> light<00:01:08.010> cameras<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:09.439> there's

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
get in low light cameras and there's

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.560 
get in low light cameras and there's
some<00:01:10.650> fine<00:01:11.010> bars<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.700> actually<00:01:12.000> work<00:01:12.450> off

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
some fine bars that actually work off

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.090 
some fine bars that actually work off
the<00:01:12.659> screen<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:12.960> well<00:01:13.080> given<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.619> old<00:01:13.860> kind<00:01:14.010> of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
the screen as well given the old kind of

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.390 
the screen as well given the old kind of
video<00:01:14.400> feel<00:01:15.680> certainly<00:01:16.680> an<00:01:16.740> improvement<00:01:16.950> I

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
video feel certainly an improvement I

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.260 
video feel certainly an improvement I
would<00:01:17.610> say<00:01:18.140> and<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.610> really<00:01:20.610> like<00:01:20.759> how<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:20.970> blows

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
would say and I really like how it blows

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.460 
would say and I really like how it blows
out<00:01:21.420> these<00:01:21.659> instruments<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:22.680> well

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.810 

seems<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.400> moron<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.880> darker<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:28.580> so<00:01:29.580> on<00:01:29.700> to

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
seems that moron is darker and so on to

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.490 
seems that moron is darker and so on to
s<00:01:29.940> amir<00:01:30.270> where<00:01:30.870> it<00:01:30.930> doesn't<00:01:31.050> get<00:01:31.200> quite<00:01:31.380> as

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
s amir where it doesn't get quite as

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.640 
s amir where it doesn't get quite as
dark<00:01:31.680> as<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.890> know<00:01:33.080> but<00:01:34.080> you<00:01:34.170> can<00:01:34.290> see<00:01:34.440> that<00:01:34.470> a

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
dark as you know but you can see that a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.560 
dark as you know but you can see that a
Reaver<00:01:35.010> kinda<00:01:35.880> looks<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.090> same<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:39.390> there's

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
Reaver kinda looks the same and there's

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.670 
Reaver kinda looks the same and there's
a<00:01:39.600> bit<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.750> company<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> air<00:01:40.410> so<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:43.560> just

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
a bit of company in the air so I so just

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.350 
a bit of company in the air so I so just
wanted<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.950> see<00:01:44.160> you<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.090> make<00:01:45.210> much

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
wanted to see you can make much

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.100 
wanted to see you can make much
difference<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:46.080> answer<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.320> not<00:01:46.560> really

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
difference the answer is not really

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.230 
difference the answer is not really
especially<00:01:49.110> unless<00:01:49.260> amir<00:01:49.470> i<00:01:49.530> guess<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:49.890> well

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
especially unless amir i guess as well

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.240 
especially unless amir i guess as well
you<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.270> see<00:01:51.480> those<00:01:51.660> player<00:01:52.050> names<00:01:52.260> is<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
you can see those player names is a

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.359 
you can see those player names is a
little<00:01:53.430> bit<00:01:53.520> different<00:01:54.080> than<00:01:55.080> normal<00:01:58.369> things

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
little bit different than normal things

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.000 
little bit different than normal things
like<00:01:59.460> explosions<00:01:59.880> just<00:02:00.530> flare<00:02:01.530> out<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.830> white

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
like explosions just flare out to white

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:09.410 
like explosions just flare out to white
a<00:02:02.040> bit<00:02:02.369> easier<00:02:06.979> but<00:02:07.979> here<00:02:08.100> we<00:02:08.190> go<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.760> vr-zone

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
a bit easier but here we go in vr-zone

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.050 
a bit easier but here we go in vr-zone
and<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.080> can<00:02:10.170> see<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.350> quite<00:02:10.410> dark<00:02:11.060> the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
and you can see it's quite dark the
