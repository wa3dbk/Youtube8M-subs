00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
top of it it looks like there's nothing

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.560 
top of it it looks like there's nothing
that<00:00:21.750> i<00:00:21.779> right<00:00:21.960> when<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.439> flip<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.740> switch<00:00:22.949> um

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
that i right when you flip the switch um

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.460 
that i right when you flip the switch um
there's<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.630> ladder<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:24.869> takes<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.289> down<00:00:25.410> to

the<00:00:25.650> basement<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.300> then<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.390> can<00:00:27.510> flip<00:00:27.689> this

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
the basement and then you can flip this

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.250 
the basement and then you can flip this
so<00:00:28.109> no<00:00:28.260> one<00:00:28.380> else<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.619> get<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.330> right<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.570> then

here is where I do all my
experimentation<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:33.750> redstone<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:35.280> can

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
experimentation with redstone and I can

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.090 
experimentation with redstone and I can
even<00:00:35.760> set<00:00:36.510> off<00:00:36.600> TNT<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:37.079> here<00:00:37.290> won't<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:37.950> any

I built it all out of obsidian and let
me<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.140> flip<00:00:46.320> switch<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:46.739> i<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:46.950> go<00:00:47.010> back<00:00:47.039> up

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
me just flip switch so i can go back up

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.369 
me just flip switch so i can go back up
here<00:00:47.370> guys<00:00:48.500> hmm<00:00:49.500> okay<00:00:50.660> hop<00:00:51.660> up<00:00:51.809> through<00:00:52.170> here

for the demonstration purpose of this
video<00:01:38.130> my<00:01:38.430> passcode<00:01:38.820> would<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> second<00:01:39.630> one

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
video my passcode would be a second one

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.260 
video my passcode would be a second one
down<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.740> fifth<00:01:40.950> one<00:01:41.100> down<00:01:41.159> pressing<00:01:42.060> this

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
would happen if um I did the passcode

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.859 
would happen if um I did the passcode
wrong<00:01:49.549> close<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.670> door<00:01:50.820> there<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.149> got<00:01:51.750> the
