00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.179 

I<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:28.159> no<00:01:29.420> this<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.600> different<00:01:31.290> Irish

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.539 
whiskeys with there's not a whole lot it
is<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> good<00:01:35.220> selection<00:01:37.009> some<00:01:38.009> variation

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
is a good selection some variation

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.050 
is a good selection some variation
between<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:39.180> think<00:01:40.040> Jameson<00:01:41.040> being<00:01:41.280> really<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
between I think Jameson being really the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.789 
between I think Jameson being really the
standard<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.630> most<00:01:42.840> popular<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.590> world

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
standard the most popular in the world

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.980 
standard the most popular in the world
by<00:01:43.979> far<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.520> great<00:01:44.789> comparison<00:01:45.330> man<00:01:45.840> it's

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
by far it's a great comparison man it's

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.249 
by far it's a great comparison man it's
a<00:01:46.049> great<00:01:46.229> point<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.560> right<00:01:46.940> now<00:01:47.940> clontarf<00:01:48.570> is

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
a great point of right now clontarf is

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.760 
a great point of right now clontarf is
not<00:01:50.189> as<00:01:50.399> smooth<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.080> think<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.560> is

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
not as smooth and I think that is

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.020 
not as smooth and I think that is
because<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.580> nuttier<00:01:55.490> somewhat<00:01:56.490> buttery

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
because of the nuttier somewhat buttery

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.580 
because of the nuttier somewhat buttery
flavor<00:01:57.539> of<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:59.179> and<00:02:00.179> there's<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.840> small<00:02:01.170> spike

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
flavor of it and there's a small spike

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.350 
flavor of it and there's a small spike
of<00:02:01.830> that<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.310> think<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:03.060> pretty

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
of that that I think it's pretty

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.680 
of that that I think it's pretty
interesting<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:04.140> good<00:02:04.289> dynamic<00:02:04.530> taste

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
interesting it's a good dynamic taste

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.330 
interesting it's a good dynamic taste
it's<00:02:06.690> something<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.170> think<00:02:07.409> it's<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.649> step<00:02:07.950> up<00:02:08.160> in

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
it's something I think it's a step up in

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.020 
it's something I think it's a step up in
quality<00:02:09.019> from<00:02:10.019> Jameson<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:10.920> priced<00:02:11.190> you

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
quality from Jameson and it's priced you

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.320 
quality from Jameson and it's priced you
know<00:02:12.120> accordingly<00:02:13.250> see<00:02:14.250> when<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.790> say<00:02:14.880> nutty

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
know accordingly see when you say nutty

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.570 
know accordingly see when you say nutty
I'm<00:02:16.080> not<00:02:16.230> necessarily<00:02:16.709> getting<00:02:16.980> nutty<00:02:17.310> what

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
I'm not necessarily getting nutty what

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.770 
I'm not necessarily getting nutty what
I'm<00:02:17.670> getting<00:02:17.940> is<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.090> certain<00:02:18.450> type<00:02:18.569> of<00:02:18.600> body

when I tried this warm it reminded me

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.680 
when I tried this warm it reminded me
