00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 and then people here talking both 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.220
 video the opponent for you an effect 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:16.379
 very searched that the photo ripped 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:18.359
 I only have a vignette first we need to 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.800
 image that we want to take effect 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.080
 I already cared for my image here. 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.400
 for photoshop and now let's prepare 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.400
 the document for the clipping 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.990
 let's now unblock not be called 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.530
 to double-click on it 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:41.040
 Let's put the name of the photo of love. 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.560
 that your loved one has already unblocked right 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.110
 now we will see the image in size 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.940
 canvas 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.920
 this image again 200 fixed on the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.380
 width and 200 pixels in height 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.030
 depending on the size of your image you 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.640
 will have to increase more 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.180
 in my view an image that has more 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.660
 of one thousand pixels in any of the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.479
 two measures will say so you need to have 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.610
 one thousand pixels on top of it 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:14.009
 so here I made 200 fixed like myself 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:19.530
 I spoke then width 866 there will be 866 in 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:20.580
 height 500 put 700 click ok you 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.979
 Can you see now that you 're staying? 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.979
 transparent and on the back the image will 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.840
 staying in the middle is very important that 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.810
 you unlock this layer can not 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.340
 Forget why if you do not unlock 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.170
 will get the right black background 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.880
 well now that we've prepared our 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.880
 image let's make the cut 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.409
 after preparing us the image for the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.320
 cut out let's do it 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.720
 let's come here on the tool there soto 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.759
 A certain tool in Portuguese is 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.610
 let's select our right image and 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.310
 we begin to make the cut I will 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.429
 get the record is here do not do it 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.340
 straight cut makes a cut always one 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.480
 curves and some more abrupt cuts 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.260
 so sure to give the appearance of a 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.599
 clipping handmade even after 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.590
 to take all the risks on top of the 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.590
 Image 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.910
 let's go around outside 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.120
 sure and we will close our selection b 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:37.170
 we already have our selection closed here 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:40.950
 we will see in layer new layer by 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.810
 cut the shift against the jack 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.079
 cut now we have both layers 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.180
 and layers sorry left and right 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.250
 right layer I'll do exactly 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.310
 I said calmly from the left and 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:59.040
 one right is the shrimp down and I go 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:01.350
 What's her name on the left? 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.760
 decision and I'll put it right 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.739
 now I know exactly which side is that 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.310
 I'm going to select right then I will not 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.950
 need to be taking the view from 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.739
 an image to see which is simply 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.019
 I already know that from the left of the 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.109
 left to the right is very 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:25.940
 easier to work right then that there 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.940
 now we are going to apply effects 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.490
 now let's apply our effects 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.280
 Image 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.130
 effects are not required once 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.080
 that we already have a certain cut as already 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.000
 we have the image with the appearance of records 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.170
 They'll say yes, but I think it 's done. 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.900
 always leaves a little better right will 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.820
 until you select the right layer 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.880
 I'll get this layer from the left come 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.430
 right-click recycle options 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.640
 I'll come here in tracing. 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.290
 I'll put the size of a pixel one 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.470
 normal democracy for normal age 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.739
 type fill and place 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:13.000
 right white're giving to see the video 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.000
 drop shadow 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:21.470
 I'll take it out here using them global 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:24.740
 I'm going to put 90 180 at the angle 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:29.440
 I'll put 55 opacity in the distance 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:31.520
 I'm going to put 12 and the size put 10 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.520
 right 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.910
 of this multiplication merge mode 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.340
 I'm going to paint our background layer 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.550
 white we have a better 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.729
 I'm going to enable the 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.090
 right again fight with the button 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:52.190
 right above the left layer 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.810
 listening on copying the layer style to 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.320
 Right-click layer 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.930
 right too and I'll put it on 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.970
 style of layer rolamos style of 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.290
 Layer now, let's just see, I'll delete the 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.410
 bad left 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:09.860
 we come here the blending options 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:13.010
 Layer right designed to souza 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.740
 be 180 where to put 0 otherwise 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.430
 from the angle of the other image, I'm going to give 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.580
 a ok 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:24.200
 oblate two layers and now I do the 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:27.229
 that I'm going to give a rotated 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.060
 images here to stay a little better 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:32.060
 I'll get here gives one against the subject 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.520

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:38.100
 take this layer put a little bit 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:41.040
 busy forgot to take tool tie 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.040
 get over here and get the calm 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.550
 right against the badly parked you 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.940
 of light also put here 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.770
 right now it appears the photo was ripped and 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.790
 played one for each side let's say 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.950
 like this 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.790
 well now that the application of effects 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.310
 was made 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.770
 we do not have anything else to do that 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.450

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:18.950
 the channel give it an okay because it's a new 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.950
 layer here
