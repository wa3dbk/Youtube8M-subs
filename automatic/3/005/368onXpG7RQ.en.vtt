00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
all offered at the same thing when I

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.160 
all offered at the same thing when I
look<00:00:50.610> when<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.789> first<00:00:51.030> saw<00:00:51.239> Stephen<00:00:51.960> Amell<00:00:52.050> is

green<00:00:52.410> our<00:00:52.559> suit<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:52.949> thought<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.190> was<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.309> little

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
green our suit I thought it was a little

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.860 
green our suit I thought it was a little
bit<00:00:53.550> too<00:00:53.699> dark<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.120> worked<00:00:54.390> pretty<00:00:54.570> well

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
bit too dark but it worked pretty well

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.689 
bit too dark but it worked pretty well
with<00:00:55.079> him<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.739> think<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:56.340> gonna<00:00:56.489> look

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
with him so I do think it's gonna look

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.700 
with him so I do think it's gonna look
great<00:00:56.760> when<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.300> first<00:00:57.570> get<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.870> see<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> pilot
