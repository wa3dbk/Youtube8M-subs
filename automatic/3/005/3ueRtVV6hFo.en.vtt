00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.110
 hello friends of sbt who are welcome to 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.849
 One more video I'm Ricardo and I'm 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.800
 here today to present a new course 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.750
 that is being released on our blog. 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.210
 computer maintenance 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.590
 this course is composed of five classes 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.240
 I'll teach the whole process of 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.920
 assembly of a computer, we will 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.990
 pick up all the individual components 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.130
 will set up a computer leaving it 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.990
 ready to receive the system 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.489
 operational following 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.739
 only the procedures 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.629
 related to the assembly will not have anything 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.580
 configuration software 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.320
 application configuration here in this 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.989
 module of this course then only the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.699
 mounting the parts leaving the computer 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.220
 ready to go to the bench 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.440
 as I mentioned at the beginning of the 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.570
 video course is divided into five classes in 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.309
 first one is to show all the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.409
 components that will be used in the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.150
 mount our computer and you will 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.860
 understand what comes with each one 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.119
 of these components when you buy 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.850
 for example that comes with a processor 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:05.159
 in a processor box which comes with a 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.170
 motherboard what comes in the cabinet every 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.750
 accessories that are included with each 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.750
 one of the items in the second class I will show 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.720
 how do you mount the processor and the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.030
 memory in batches of this motherboard in the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.130
 I'll show you how to set the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.200
 motherboard into the cabinet by taking 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.060
 due care as you prepare the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.980
 cabinet to receive the motherboard as 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.140
 you put the mirror on the 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.500
 and details of relevance to the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.630
 Fixing plate inside the case in 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.970
 fourth class we will make the connections of the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.940
 Front USB connector of the cabinet 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.730
 front audio pauli reset buttons 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.860
 indication of linked activity 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.420
 or hd activity then on the fourth 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.130
 Classroom will be just connections, we'll go 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.840
 consult the license plate manual 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.720
 will understand how this link works 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.690
 and will connect these panels and 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.920
 office functions and fifth and fifth 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.320
 last class we will do the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.390
 installation of the dvd drive from the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.490
 power supply to the connection of all 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.710
 that we are missing and we are going to 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.229
 organized in internal wiring, leaving the 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.080
 computer to receive the flow of 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.940
 warm air and not more than usual 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.190
 simply because there is a mess there 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.200
 inside as you can realize despite 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.650
 This is a simple guide to this course. 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.819
 the 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.920
 steps of mounting a computer 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.959
 so it will certainly be helpful 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.819
 for those who want to work in this area 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.069
 for those who want to have a sense of 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.349
 computer assembly and you will 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.299
 learn how it works 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.239
 the disassembly also once you 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.280
 Do you know the procedure of riding? 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.959
 simply adapt to this to do the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.829
 reverse or disassemble your 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.480
 computer 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.609
 so it's very simple from here to 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.720
 front you mount and also disassemble 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.189
 computers 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.680
 I would just like to clarify a 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:49.230
 basic point about how this 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.450
 course was filmed as I did the whole 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.889
 alone by using only 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.200
 a camcorder 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.599
 maybe you will not always have the level 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.260
 detail you hoped for had a 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.329
 determined image a determined to 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.950
 procedure but if there is any missing image 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.109
 if it is not readable 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.359
 You have the full explanation because 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.459
 everything I did I did the narration 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.430
 complete of what is being performed 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.620
 with details well explained in the audio 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.569
 so if you happen to miss 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.060
 some image for sure the audio goes 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.220
 complete what is being shown you 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.199
 will not be able to mount 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.209
 computers based on what you are going to 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.989
 see what you will hear during this 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.849
 course 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.829
 I hope you who will accompany 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.199
 this course you make the most 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.599
 I took advantage of these classes that I 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:39.359
 I hope you can use this in 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.609
 your professional training and the more I 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.319
 I only have to wish good study at all 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.859
 who will follow this course from 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.859
 from now
