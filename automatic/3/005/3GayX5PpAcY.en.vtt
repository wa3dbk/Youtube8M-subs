purchase the rhino tech I think it cost

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.420 
purchase the rhino tech I think it cost
like<00:00:36.809> three<00:00:37.050> million<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.190> kind<00:00:38.370> of

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
like three million so it's kind of

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.040 
like three million so it's kind of
expensive<00:00:38.910> but<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.390> know<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.570> get<00:00:39.840> unlimited
