00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.160
 two friends i am back with the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.930
 teleportation basic course number five the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.150
 you can join other four parts 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.410
 look at me from the channel in which I 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.280
 ever the basic principles the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.990
 teleportation and through 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.429
 have shown videos 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:24.810
 prove that and show everything 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:27.119
 Frequency is and that we are in one 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.480
 move field that stands out of frequencies 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.480
 so to speak 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.230
 and for this reason is teleporter 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.950
 action as complicated as it is 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.960
 many may accept this as well as it 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.630
 I promised you I want you now 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.200
 in the teleportation basic course number 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.690
 five show the experimental setup how to 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.350
 can teleport a solid object 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.080
 So the basic principles of it 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:23.030
 for that you need nothing more one 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.030
 table of about three meters in length 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.920
 For this one needs a frequency measuring device 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.200
 and a speaker and a solid 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.940
 The easiest way to get things will be 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:43.039
 be one with a high one 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.119
 copper ball of about three centimeters 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.310
 diameter as I said 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.990
 illustrate this today for here 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.030
 so now we have the object that 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.080
 We want to teleport this though 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:03.930
 ball is in position 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:07.560
 this table to find out which 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.660
 natural oscillations this ball must have 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.549
 I make the ball swing and 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.440
 then the natural vibration of this ball 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:19.070
 measure with the help of the frequency 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:21.950
 MessgerÃ¤tes so now I will that time 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.930
 I simulate the ball hit 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:30.060
 now at the frequency vibrates with 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:36.720
 Measuring equipment is the frequency and this 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:39.890
 frequency notes so that only that 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.600
 micro so you understand me better 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.480
 Now I repeat the experiment in 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.690
 position b of the table 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.459
 that means I will be the frequency here 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:56.160
 measure the ball again at this place 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.400
 yes, it is important to understand that 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.110
 ball whose position was not located 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.239
 more the same ball is 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.870
 position occupied this ball has one 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.840
 other frequency because he is the place 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.459
 So now I will be here 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.260
 again that we in the experiment 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.349
 repeat and be at this point 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.349
 I'll swing the ball again 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.870
 bring and will measure the frequency like that 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:26.080
 if I did that then I will 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.910
 between position by position no 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:34.590
 difference in frequency readings 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:38.260
 Find out and the experiment 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.519
 complete I move the ball again 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.100
 in position 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:47.680
 b apologies position 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:51.099
 so now I have the two 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.640
 readings of compositions and position 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:57.700
 Now I was back in the ball 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.830
 have set in position I will 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.200
 me a speaker in addition to large 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:07.120
 speakers and will 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.820
 because next to these soon ask and will 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.910
 him with the same frequency that I am in 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:18.729
 position would have been measured 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:25.690
 and how strong it is with the 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:28.870
 give frequency from positions and then 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:34.270
 In the ideal case we will see how 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:37.810
 The ball just returns to position like 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:43.570
 shows up and that depends on it 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:47.860
 together that the place in which is a 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:50.350
 object is that the object 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.979
 not in a place but that 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:57.520
 the place is a property of frequency 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:05:00.250
 of an object is very important to 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.060
 understand and of course all this one 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.660
 is in far and we only with 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:09.290
 Create awareness of distance 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.669
 so to speak at this distance 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.970
 different kinds and ways 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.980
 to be able to experience 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:19.210
 if you have any questions if you have questions 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:22.210
 maybe you have some suggestions 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:27.380
 teachers or professors would be willing 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:29.210
 this experimental setup professional 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.200
 I'll do that to you very much 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:35.600
 Thankful for all your suggestions and tips 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.240
 and yes the end of this series 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.760
 his suggestions then write that 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.160
 please in the comments 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.520
 I thank you for listening and 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.790
 watch and as always love everything and 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.790
 bye for now
