00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
and winning games now under rated T is

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.310 
and winning games now under rated T is
something<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.119> introduced<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.900> tier<00:01:10.170> list

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
something I introduced this tier list

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.050 
something I introduced this tier list
because<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> lot<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.010> people<00:01:11.130> said<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:12.000> they

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
because a lot of people said that they

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.880 
because a lot of people said that they
wanted<00:01:12.270> something<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.110> bit<00:01:13.260> different<00:01:13.320> not

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
wanted something a bit different not

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.499 
wanted something a bit different not
just<00:01:13.950> what's<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> meta<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.299> these<00:01:15.450> are

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
just what's in the meta so these are

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.179 
just what's in the meta so these are
champions<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.320> think<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:17.009> make<00:01:17.159> a

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
champions that I think you make a

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.670 
champions that I think you make a
comeback<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.970> patch<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.630> still<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.259> really

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
comeback this patch and still be really

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.620 
comeback this patch and still be really
really<00:01:19.890> strong<00:01:20.340> I'll<00:01:20.729> be<00:01:20.880> champions<00:01:21.360> that

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
really strong I'll be champions that

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.929 
really strong I'll be champions that
probably<00:01:21.960> require<00:01:22.380> more<00:01:22.680> practice<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.460> skill

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
probably require more practice and skill

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.760 
probably require more practice and skill
to<00:01:23.970> actually<00:01:24.570> play<00:01:24.840> than<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> current<00:01:25.500> meta

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
to actually play than the current meta

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.740 
to actually play than the current meta
champions<00:01:26.430> but<00:01:26.670> once<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.090> unlock<00:01:27.509> their

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750

potential<00:01:28.080> they<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:28.680> easily<00:01:29.130> carry<00:01:29.369> just<00:01:29.759> as

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
potential they can easily carry just as

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.969 
potential they can easily carry just as
hard<00:01:30.150> as<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.450> others<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.439> for<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.650> mid<00:01:31.799> lane

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
hard as the others so for the mid lane

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.760 
hard as the others so for the mid lane

pickle ban tier champions and the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.359 
pickle ban tier champions and the
interesting<00:01:37.079> thing<00:01:37.409> here<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.040> all

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
interesting thing here is that all

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.830 
interesting thing here is that all
pickle<00:01:38.729> ban<00:01:38.909> for<00:01:39.240> completely<00:01:39.689> different

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
pickle ban for completely different

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.380 
pickle ban for completely different
reasons<00:01:40.590> now<00:01:41.009> cigs<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.579> really<00:01:42.150> strong

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
reasons now cigs is really strong

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.940 
reasons now cigs is really strong
because<00:01:42.810> it's<00:01:43.110> kind<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.470> league<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.680> late

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
because it's kind of a league of late

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.710 
because it's kind of a league of late
game<00:01:44.189> right<00:01:44.579> now<00:01:44.610> it's<00:01:45.030> kind<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.270> change<00:01:45.600> to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
game right now it's kind of change to

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.050 
game right now it's kind of change to
the<00:01:46.049> objective<00:01:46.619> site<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.159> towers<00:01:47.640> dragons

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
the objective site so towers dragons

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.999 
the objective site so towers dragons
things<00:01:48.329> like<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.720> now<00:01:49.049> cigs<00:01:49.320> brings<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.710> lot

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
things like that now cigs brings a lot

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.980 
things like that now cigs brings a lot
of<00:01:50.070> wave<00:01:50.430> player<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.000> team<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.810> means

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
of wave player to the team so it means

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.450 
of wave player to the team so it means
that<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.290> really<00:01:52.590> difficult<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.159> push

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
that it's really difficult to push

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.429 
that it's really difficult to push
towers<00:01:53.909> against<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.600> zigs<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.320> means

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
towers against the zigs and it means

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.200 
towers against the zigs and it means
that<00:01:55.530> zigs<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.979> stall<00:01:56.280> out<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> game<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.000> let

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
that zigs can stall out the game and let

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.580 
that zigs can stall out the game and let
the<00:01:57.299> rest<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.600> your<00:01:57.719> team<00:01:57.930> catch<00:01:58.200> up<00:01:58.409> with<00:01:58.560> that

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
the rest of your team catch up with that

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.620 
the rest of your team catch up with that
behind<00:01:59.040> now<00:01:59.640> when<00:01:59.850> fights<00:02:00.149> do<00:02:00.390> eventually

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
behind now when fights do eventually

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.289 
behind now when fights do eventually
break<00:02:01.020> out<00:02:01.259> he<00:02:01.560> has<00:02:01.770> his<00:02:02.040> AoE<00:02:02.399> nuke<00:02:02.729> AoE

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
break out he has his AoE nuke AoE

zone control with his minefield and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.680 
zone control with his minefield and
satchel<00:02:07.619> charge<00:02:07.890> now<00:02:08.369> yeah<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.209> always

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
satchel charge now yeah so it is always

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.210 
satchel charge now yeah so it is always
band<00:02:10.080> right<00:02:10.259> now<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:11.009> basically

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
band right now and it's basically

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.520 
band right now and it's basically
because<00:02:11.910> even<00:02:12.569> if<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.750> camp<00:02:12.989> in<00:02:13.230> when<00:02:13.379> you

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
because even if you camp in when you

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.290 
because even if you camp in when you
shut<00:02:13.740> him<00:02:13.860> down<00:02:13.890> he'll<00:02:14.430> still<00:02:14.760> do<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.940> ton<00:02:15.270> of

shut him down he'll still do a ton of

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.600 
shut him down he'll still do a ton of

to<00:02:37.980> pick<00:02:38.160> Lulu<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.880> biggest<00:02:39.209> thing<00:02:39.390> here<00:02:39.630> is

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
to pick Lulu the biggest thing here is

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.229 
to pick Lulu the biggest thing here is
that<00:02:39.930> her<00:02:40.440> base<00:02:40.650> damages<00:02:41.190> are<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.670> high<00:02:41.940> so

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
that her base damages are so high so

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.150 
that her base damages are so high so
she's<00:02:42.480> strong<00:02:42.720> early<00:02:43.140> but<00:02:43.440> her<00:02:43.620> abilities

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
she's strong early but her abilities

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.310 
she's strong early but her abilities
scale<00:02:44.459> with<00:02:44.610> ap<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:45.270> well<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.810> she<00:02:45.959> does<00:02:46.110> even

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
scale with ap so well that she does even

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.259 
scale with ap so well that she does even
more<00:02:46.560> damage<00:02:46.739> with<00:02:47.100> them<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:47.670> also<00:02:48.060> have

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
more damage with them and also have

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.850 
more damage with them and also have
shields<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:48.840> everything<00:02:49.140> like<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.290> their

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
shields and everything like that their

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.770 
shields and everything like that their
scale<00:02:50.130> with<00:02:50.250> ability<00:02:50.670> power<00:02:50.850> too<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:51.480> they<00:02:51.600> get

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
scale with ability power too so they get

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.110 
scale with ability power too so they get
stronger<00:02:52.110> as<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.500> game<00:02:52.650> goes<00:02:53.010> on<00:02:53.250> now<00:02:53.910> moving

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
stronger as the game goes on now moving

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.360

pickle<00:03:01.050> ban<00:03:01.230> is<00:03:01.500> basically<00:03:02.040> just<00:03:02.069> because<00:03:02.610> she

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
pickle ban is basically just because she

ways of ganking bot Lane and jinx having
no<00:03:12.239> escape<00:03:12.690> means<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.110> she's<00:03:13.290> really

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
no escape means that she's really

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.380 
no escape means that she's really

leucine<00:03:17.670> is<00:03:17.820> here<00:03:18.060> because<00:03:18.239> he<00:03:18.420> has<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.170> much

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
leucine is here because he has so much

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
lot of single target damage if a diver

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.610 
lot of single target damage if a diver
jumps<00:03:26.940> onto<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.600> see<00:03:28.140> if<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.290> isn't<00:03:28.500> really

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
here for her damage as such but more

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.780 
here for her damage as such but more
high<00:03:30.570> overall<00:03:31.049> utility<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:32.070> she<00:03:32.160> brings<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.610> lot

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
high overall utility so she brings a lot

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.580 
high overall utility so she brings a lot
to<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:33.000> team<00:03:33.269> she<00:03:33.540> can<00:03:33.660> help<00:03:33.840> you<00:03:33.959> engage<00:03:34.110> you

can<00:03:34.709> catch<00:03:34.920> people<00:03:35.310> out<00:03:35.489> which<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:35.730> great<00:03:36.120> but

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
can catch people out which is great but

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.630 
can catch people out which is great but
she's<00:03:36.570> also<00:03:36.810> probably<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.440> safest<00:03:37.680> ad<00:03:38.190> with

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
she's also probably the safest ad with

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.520 
she's also probably the safest ad with
that<00:03:38.760> ultimate<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.329> escape<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.930> her<00:03:40.170> spell

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
that ultimate to escape and her spell

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.110 
that ultimate to escape and her spell
shield<00:03:40.739> as<00:03:40.920> well<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.549> when<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:41.760> combine<00:03:42.090> that

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
shield as well and when you combine that

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.240 
shield as well and when you combine that
with<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.510> AoE<00:03:42.959> damage<00:03:43.049> that<00:03:43.560> she<00:03:43.709> brings<00:03:43.980> from

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
with the AoE damage that she brings from

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.940 
with the AoE damage that she brings from
her<00:03:44.430> W<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.120> Q<00:03:45.540> in<00:03:45.840> a<00:03:45.930> teamfight<00:03:46.260> she<00:03:46.739> actually

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
her W and Q in a teamfight she actually

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.949 
her W and Q in a teamfight she actually
is<00:03:47.340> really<00:03:47.820> really<00:03:48.060> strong<00:03:48.420> right<00:03:48.600> now<00:03:48.630> which

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
is really really strong right now which

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.690 
is really really strong right now which
is<00:03:49.079> why<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.320> think<00:03:49.650> she's<00:03:49.829> probably<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.310> best<00:03:50.519> a

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
is why I think she's probably the best a

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.819 
is why I think she's probably the best a
B<00:03:50.910> so<00:03:51.600> moving<00:03:51.870> on<00:03:51.959> to<00:03:52.079> junglers<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.590> first

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
B so moving on to junglers the first

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.470 
B so moving on to junglers the first
thing<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.070> want<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.310> say<00:03:53.370> is<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:54.060> there<00:03:54.239> are<00:03:54.450> a

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
thing I want to say is that there are a

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.509 
thing I want to say is that there are a
lot<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.959> different<00:03:55.049> strong<00:03:55.769> junglers<00:03:56.310> right

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
lot of different strong junglers right

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.180 
lot of different strong junglers right
now<00:03:56.730> that<00:03:56.970> we<00:03:57.180> Kong<00:03:57.450> Pantheon<00:03:58.079> leasing<00:03:58.560> Evelyn

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
now that we Kong Pantheon leasing Evelyn

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.310 
now that we Kong Pantheon leasing Evelyn
to<00:03:59.430> name<00:03:59.579> a<00:03:59.609> few<00:03:59.760> but<00:04:00.299> they<00:04:00.390> all<00:04:00.540> just<00:04:00.750> excel<00:04:01.170> in

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
to name a few but they all just excel in

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.110 
to name a few but they all just excel in
different<00:04:01.680> areas<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.370> many<00:04:02.730> of<00:04:02.880> them<00:04:03.030> are

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
different areas and many of them are

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.670 
different areas and many of them are
banned<00:04:03.359> in<00:04:03.510> games<00:04:03.780> because<00:04:04.230> they<00:04:04.350> can<00:04:04.500> have

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
banned in games because they can have

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.039 
banned in games because they can have
such<00:04:04.920> a<00:04:04.950> huge<00:04:05.340> impact<00:04:05.820> but<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.239> only<00:04:06.690> one<00:04:06.870> I

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
such a huge impact but the only one I

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.900 
such a huge impact but the only one I
think<00:04:07.109> is<00:04:07.530> above<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.070> rest<00:04:08.280> is<00:04:08.579> going<00:04:08.760> to<00:04:08.820> be

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
think is above the rest is going to be

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.729 
think is above the rest is going to be
Kazakhs<00:04:09.420> now<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.049> change<00:04:10.350> to<00:04:10.530> his<00:04:10.620> ultimate

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
Kazakhs now the change to his ultimate

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.610 
Kazakhs now the change to his ultimate
in<00:04:11.160> patch<00:04:11.400> 4.3<00:04:12.030> meant<00:04:12.660> that<00:04:12.900> when<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:13.170> evolve

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
in patch 4.3 meant that when you evolve

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.020 
in patch 4.3 meant that when you evolve
his<00:04:13.859> ultimate<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.459> now<00:04:14.609> increase<00:04:15.000> the

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
his ultimate you now increase the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.909 
his ultimate you now increase the
stealth<00:04:15.390> duration<00:04:15.810> for<00:04:16.019> two<00:04:16.229> seconds<00:04:16.709> which

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
stealth duration for two seconds which

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.560 
stealth duration for two seconds which
is<00:04:16.950> actually<00:04:17.489> really<00:04:17.669> pretty<00:04:17.910> big<00:04:18.209> but

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
is actually really pretty big but

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.240 
is actually really pretty big but
evolving<00:04:18.989> his<00:04:19.109> ultimate<00:04:19.530> does<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.739> couple<00:04:20.190> of

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
evolving his ultimate does a couple of

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.009 
evolving his ultimate does a couple of
other<00:04:20.370> things<00:04:20.489> so<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.060> scales<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.720> damage

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
other things so it scales the damage

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:22.800 
other things so it scales the damage
reduction

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
reduction

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.080 
reduction
two<00:04:22.870> percent<00:04:23.200> with<00:04:23.440> health<00:04:23.830> and<00:04:24.010> shields<00:04:24.760> so

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
two percent with health and shields so

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.340 
two percent with health and shields so
that<00:04:25.210> means<00:04:25.360> that<00:04:25.600> during<00:04:25.810> that<00:04:26.050> damage

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
that means that during that damage

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.140 
that means that during that damage
reduction<00:04:26.620> health<00:04:27.160> from<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.460> giant's<00:04:27.669> belt<00:04:27.970> is

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
reduction health from a giant's belt is

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.000 
reduction health from a giant's belt is
doubled<00:04:28.600> shield<00:04:28.990> from<00:04:29.200> a<00:04:29.320> hexdrinker<00:04:29.620> is

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
doubled shield from a hexdrinker is

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.650 
doubled shield from a hexdrinker is
doubled<00:04:30.400> as<00:04:30.520> well<00:04:30.730> and<00:04:31.000> that's<00:04:31.210> one<00:04:31.480> of<00:04:31.570> the

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
doubled as well and that's one of the

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.780 
doubled as well and that's one of the
reasons<00:04:32.020> why<00:04:32.260> now<00:04:32.650> he<00:04:32.710> does<00:04:33.070> a<00:04:33.280> ton<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.550> damage

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
reasons why now he does a ton of damage

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.550 
reasons why now he does a ton of damage
but<00:04:34.120> it's<00:04:34.270> very<00:04:34.510> difficult<00:04:34.780> to<00:04:35.050> kill<00:04:35.290> him<00:04:35.440> as

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
but it's very difficult to kill him as

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.290 
but it's very difficult to kill him as
well<00:04:35.770> when<00:04:36.310> you<00:04:36.370> combine<00:04:36.490> those<00:04:36.790> new<00:04:37.060> things

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
well when you combine those new things

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.270 
well when you combine those new things
with<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.660> old<00:04:37.930> things<00:04:38.260> of<00:04:38.410> his<00:04:38.530> resets<00:04:39.130> and

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
with the old things of his resets and

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.520 
with the old things of his resets and
his<00:04:39.580> damaged<00:04:40.000> isolated<00:04:40.570> targets<00:04:41.080> and<00:04:41.260> his

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
his damaged isolated targets and his

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.379 
his damaged isolated targets and his
snowball<00:04:41.950> potential<00:04:42.460> you<00:04:42.610> have<00:04:42.820> a<00:04:43.000> really

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
snowball potential you have a really

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.900 
snowball potential you have a really
really<00:04:43.960> good<00:04:44.290> well-rounded<00:04:44.770> jungler<00:04:45.580> who<00:04:45.760> is

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
really good well-rounded jungler who is

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.400 
really good well-rounded jungler who is
probably<00:04:46.210> going<00:04:46.419> to<00:04:46.480> dominate<00:04:46.690> so<00:04:47.110> lucky<00:04:47.380> for

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
probably going to dominate so lucky for

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.710 
probably going to dominate so lucky for
a<00:04:47.620> while<00:04:47.860> okay<00:04:48.610> so<00:04:48.669> moving<00:04:48.880> on<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.210> top<00:04:49.389> laners

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
a while okay so moving on to top laners

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.570 
a while okay so moving on to top laners
now<00:04:49.960> renekton<00:04:50.470> is<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:50.740> only<00:04:50.889> pic<00:04:51.190> or<00:04:51.370> band

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
now renekton is the only pic or band

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.879 
now renekton is the only pic or band
champion<00:04:52.120> that<00:04:52.300> I've<00:04:52.480> put<00:04:52.810> on<00:04:52.930> this<00:04:53.139> list<00:04:53.440> the

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
champion that I've put on this list the

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.800 
champion that I've put on this list the
reason<00:04:54.250> he's<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.610> only<00:04:54.820> one<00:04:55.210> whose<00:04:55.450> pickle

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
reason he's the only one whose pickle

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.840 
reason he's the only one whose pickle
ban<00:04:55.990> is<00:04:56.290> because<00:04:56.650> I<00:04:56.680> think<00:04:56.919> he<00:04:57.340> can<00:04:57.550> go<00:04:57.700> into

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
ban is because I think he can go into

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.940 
ban is because I think he can go into
any<00:04:57.970> matchup<00:04:58.419> and<00:04:58.840> he<00:04:59.080> can<00:04:59.200> come<00:04:59.410> out<00:04:59.530> on<00:04:59.710> top

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
any matchup and he can come out on top

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.740 
any matchup and he can come out on top
now<00:05:00.460> there<00:05:00.610> are<00:05:00.639> a<00:05:00.729> lot<00:05:00.850> of<00:05:00.880> strong<00:05:01.150> top<00:05:01.419> laners

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
now there are a lot of strong top laners

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.960 
now there are a lot of strong top laners
like<00:05:01.960> trundle<00:05:02.530> shavonna<00:05:03.040> Jack's<00:05:03.490> right<00:05:03.760> now

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
like trundle shavonna Jack's right now

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.909 
like trundle shavonna Jack's right now
but<00:05:04.360> renekton<00:05:04.840> is<00:05:05.020> just<00:05:05.229> a<00:05:05.320> cut<00:05:05.590> above<00:05:05.620> the

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
but renekton is just a cut above the

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.100 
but renekton is just a cut above the
rest<00:05:06.100> the<00:05:06.820> reason<00:05:07.090> he's<00:05:07.210> above<00:05:07.450> the<00:05:07.630> others<00:05:07.870> is

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
rest the reason he's above the others is

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.900 
rest the reason he's above the others is
basically<00:05:08.590> because<00:05:08.919> of<00:05:09.040> his<00:05:09.130> sustain<00:05:09.550> now<00:05:09.850> he

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
basically because of his sustain now he

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.850 
basically because of his sustain now he
doesn't<00:05:10.180> out<00:05:10.419> trade<00:05:10.780> everyone<00:05:11.410> in<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.650> game

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
doesn't out trade everyone in the game

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.650 
doesn't out trade everyone in the game
but<00:05:12.100> what<00:05:12.250> he<00:05:12.310> does<00:05:12.520> do<00:05:12.760> is<00:05:12.790> probably<00:05:13.270> lose<00:05:13.630> a

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
but what he does do is probably lose a

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.900 
but what he does do is probably lose a
trade<00:05:14.020> slightly<00:05:14.620> but<00:05:14.860> sustain<00:05:15.250> up<00:05:15.430> so<00:05:15.610> quickly

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
trade slightly but sustain up so quickly

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.940 
trade slightly but sustain up so quickly
that<00:05:16.120> he<00:05:16.330> gets<00:05:16.570> control<00:05:16.840> of<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.110> lane<00:05:17.290> if<00:05:17.650> you

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
that he gets control of the lane if you

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.770 
that he gets control of the lane if you
do<00:05:18.130> choose<00:05:18.400> to<00:05:18.460> stay<00:05:18.850> in<00:05:18.910> Lane<00:05:19.150> after<00:05:19.660> the

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
do choose to stay in Lane after the

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.659 
do choose to stay in Lane after the
trade<00:05:20.080> then<00:05:20.470> he'll<00:05:20.800> sustain<00:05:21.220> quicker<00:05:21.520> than

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
trade then he'll sustain quicker than

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.159 
trade then he'll sustain quicker than
you<00:05:21.820> and<00:05:22.000> you'll<00:05:22.090> trade<00:05:22.330> again<00:05:22.660> and<00:05:22.870> then

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
you and you'll trade again and then

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.930 
you and you'll trade again and then
he'll<00:05:23.350> sustain<00:05:23.919> again<00:05:24.220> and<00:05:24.460> trade<00:05:24.669> again

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
he'll sustain again and trade again

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.670 
he'll sustain again and trade again
until<00:05:25.240> he<00:05:25.300> wins<00:05:25.450> the<00:05:25.660> lane<00:05:25.870> and<00:05:26.050> if<00:05:26.380> you<00:05:26.500> do

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680
