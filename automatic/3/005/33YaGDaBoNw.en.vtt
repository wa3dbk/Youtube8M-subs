is where the power is and you just want
to<00:00:32.460> line<00:00:32.940> up<00:00:33.149> about<00:00:33.660> right<00:00:34.110> or<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.829> am<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:36.739> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
to line up about right or I am and the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.090 
to line up about right or I am and the
zombies<00:00:37.920> should<00:00:38.219> pile<00:00:38.430> up<00:00:38.640> right<00:00:39.000> there<00:00:40.100> so

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
zombies should pile up right there so

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
zombies should pile up right there so
I've<00:00:42.059> done<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.780> two<00:00:43.469> rounds<00:00:44.120> basically

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
I've done this for two rounds basically

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.290 
I've done this for two rounds basically
and<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.600> 108<00:00:46.260> kills<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.340> 65<00:00:47.910> headshots

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
and have 108 kills and in 65 headshots

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.920 
and have 108 kills and in 65 headshots
because<00:00:48.480> they<00:00:48.570> always<00:00:48.780> go<00:00:49.200> right<00:00:50.010> there<00:00:50.930> or

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
because they always go right there or

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.689 
because they always go right there or
there<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.440> guess<00:00:52.739> fail<00:00:53.340> um<00:00:54.230> well<00:00:55.370> just<00:00:56.370> move

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
there I guess fail um well just move

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.099 
there I guess fail um well just move
forward<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.149> little<00:00:57.360> bit<00:00:57.449> more<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.930> right

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
forward a little bit more to the right

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.139 
forward a little bit more to the right
so<00:00:58.320> they<00:00:58.440> don't<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.980> for<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.879> most<00:01:00.030> part

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
so they don't get you for the most part

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.860 
so they don't get you for the most part
you<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.660> never<00:01:00.960> ever<00:01:01.320> get<00:01:01.710> hit<00:01:01.949> there<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.789> that

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
you can never ever get hit there is that

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.560 
you can never ever get hit there is that
occasional<00:01:03.870> one<00:01:04.140> zombie<00:01:04.939> honestly<00:01:05.939> there
