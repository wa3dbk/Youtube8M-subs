the<00:00:19.619> problem<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.250> not<00:00:20.460> proving<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.150> UFOs

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
the problem is not proving that UFOs

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.140 
the problem is not proving that UFOs
exists<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.289> when<00:00:22.950> you<00:00:23.039> begin<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> expose<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
exists is when you begin to expose the

they're<00:00:27.539> getting<00:00:27.720> here<00:00:28.200> what<00:00:28.740> scientists

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
they're getting here what scientists

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.909 
they're getting here what scientists
need<00:00:29.669> to<00:00:29.820> do<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.239> they<00:00:30.480> need<00:00:30.719> to<00:00:31.079> look<00:00:31.410> at<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
need to do is they need to look at the

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.709 
need to do is they need to look at the
hardcore<00:00:32.669> evidence<00:00:32.989> decide<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.739> oh<00:00:34.950> my<00:00:35.280> gosh

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
hardcore evidence decide that oh my gosh

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.680

ETS<00:00:36.719> are<00:00:36.960> real<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.040> then<00:00:38.640> get<00:00:38.910> over<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.360> then

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
ETS are real and then get over that then

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.660 
ETS are real and then get over that then
you<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:39.870> start<00:00:40.230> extrapolating<00:00:41.070> these

that real phenomenon happens here and
this<00:01:44.210> is<00:01:44.420> probably<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:45.410> most<00:01:45.740> important

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
this is probably the most important

this is probably the most important
thing<00:01:46.729> going<00:01:47.660> on<00:01:47.780> in<00:01:47.930> this<00:01:48.020> planet<00:01:48.320> today<00:01:48.560> and

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
thing going on in this planet today and

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.040 
thing going on in this planet today and
yet<00:01:49.009> nobody<00:01:49.190> talks<00:01:49.520> about<00:01:49.640> it

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.140 

I<00:01:55.270> suppose<00:01:56.270> evolution

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
I suppose evolution

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.880 
I suppose evolution
you<00:01:58.570> do

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.950 

if<00:02:04.890> we<00:02:05.159> come<00:02:05.430> together<00:02:05.579> we<00:02:06.119> can<00:02:06.630> make<00:02:06.659> this

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
if we come together we can make this

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.960 
if we come together we can make this
happen<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.920> matter<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.280> months<00:02:08.700> not<00:02:09.599> decades

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
happen in a matter of months not decades

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
happen in a matter of months not decades
but<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:13.170> destiny<00:02:13.709> of<00:02:13.890> humanity
