feathers<00:00:36.879> on<00:00:37.030> their<00:00:37.210> back<00:00:37.390> so<00:00:37.690> we<00:00:37.780> knew<00:00:37.930> that

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
feathers on their back so we knew that

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.340 
feathers on their back so we knew that
one<00:00:38.320> of<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:38.500> birds<00:00:38.739> was<00:00:39.100> pulling<00:00:40.350> pulling

females had less feathers missing than

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:49.619 
females had less feathers missing than

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
don't think that I probably will

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.880 
don't think that I probably will
reintroduce<00:02:51.480> her<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.959> birds<00:02:53.170> up<00:02:53.350> there<00:02:53.380> I

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
reintroduce her to the birds up there I

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.699 
reintroduce her to the birds up there I
may<00:02:54.220> on<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.610> next<00:02:54.880> block

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
may on the next block

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.580 
may on the next block
I<00:02:58.680> may<00:03:00.720> see<00:03:01.720> if<00:03:01.810> I<00:03:01.870> can<00:03:01.990> introduce<00:03:02.140> her<00:03:02.440> with

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
I may see if I can introduce her with

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.150 
I may see if I can introduce her with
some<00:03:02.770> of<00:03:02.890> them<00:03:03.130> or<00:03:04.230> we'll<00:03:05.230> just<00:03:05.260> have<00:03:05.830> to<00:03:05.860> make

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
some of them or we'll just have to make

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.460 
some of them or we'll just have to make
her<00:03:06.400> be<00:03:06.610> lunch<00:03:06.850> she<00:03:07.270> is<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.420> really<00:03:07.870> really<00:03:08.200> good

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
her be lunch she is a really really good

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.980 
her be lunch she is a really really good
egg<00:03:08.680> producer<00:03:09.220> for<00:03:10.209> what<00:03:10.360> these<00:03:10.510> guys<00:03:10.660> produce

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
egg producer for what these guys produce

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.580 
egg producer for what these guys produce
for<00:03:11.200> eggs<00:03:11.290> she<00:03:12.040> produces<00:03:12.519> very<00:03:12.790> large<00:03:13.590> very

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
for eggs she produces very large very

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.009 
for eggs she produces very large very
large<00:03:14.650> jumbo<00:03:15.250> eggs<00:03:15.550> I<00:03:15.970> think<00:03:16.360> she<00:03:16.540> produces

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
large jumbo eggs I think she produces

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.330 
large jumbo eggs I think she produces
probably<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.590> biggest<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:19.120> eggs<00:03:19.300> but<00:03:20.340> if

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
probably the biggest of the eggs but if

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.520 
probably the biggest of the eggs but if
she<00:03:21.459> can't<00:03:21.670> live<00:03:21.880> with<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.150> other<00:03:22.269> quail<00:03:22.570> and

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
she can't live with the other quail and

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.699 
she can't live with the other quail and
that<00:03:23.830> kind<00:03:24.070> of<00:03:24.130> makes<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:25.410> kind<00:03:26.410> of<00:03:26.440> makes<00:03:26.620> it

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
that kind of makes it kind of makes it

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.580 
that kind of makes it kind of makes it
damper<00:03:27.100> over<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.310> whole<00:03:27.459> site<00:03:27.730> they<00:03:28.600> one
