because<00:05:35.189> this<00:05:35.879> could<00:05:36.060> set<00:05:36.330> go<00:05:36.629> telepath<00:05:37.349> which

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
because this could set go telepath which

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.689 
because this could set go telepath which
is<00:05:37.800> similar<00:05:38.039> to<00:05:38.779> go<00:05:39.779> on<00:05:40.050> then<00:05:40.400> Gohan<00:05:41.400> was<00:05:41.580> this

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
is similar to go on then Gohan was this

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.189 
is similar to go on then Gohan was this
really<00:05:41.939> strong<00:05:42.240> powerful<00:05:42.539> powerful

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
really strong powerful powerful

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.740 
really strong powerful powerful
character<00:05:43.830> with<00:05:44.430> untapped<00:05:44.759> potential<00:05:45.389> in<00:05:45.599> the

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
character with untapped potential in the

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.200 
character with untapped potential in the
beginning<00:05:46.250> and<00:05:47.250> now<00:05:47.370> it<00:05:47.550> seems<00:05:47.580> like<00:05:48.000> he's

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
beginning and now it seems like he's

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.360 
beginning and now it seems like he's
dazed<00:05:48.449> off<00:05:48.629> into<00:05:48.870> it<00:05:48.930> studies<00:05:49.289> and<00:05:49.469> such<00:05:49.649> so

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
dazed off into it studies and such so

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.459 
dazed off into it studies and such so
it's<00:05:50.789> interesting<00:05:51.360> how<00:05:51.899> this<00:05:52.050> could<00:05:52.289> take

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:52.469 
it's interesting how this could take

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:54.589 
it's interesting how this could take
