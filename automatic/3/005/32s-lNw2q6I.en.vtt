00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
this color right now but i think maybe a

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.610 
this color right now but i think maybe a
little<00:03:06.420> bit<00:03:06.570> later<00:03:06.720> in<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.930> year<00:03:07.140> once<00:03:07.410> it

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
little bit later in the year once it

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.790 
little bit later in the year once it
gets<00:03:07.800> more<00:03:08.040> fall<00:03:08.340> I'll<00:03:08.670> like<00:03:08.910> them<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:10.620> this<00:03:10.770> is

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
gets more fall I'll like them so this is

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.160 
gets more fall I'll like them so this is
very<00:03:11.640> kind<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.300> color<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:14.270> then<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:16.020> last

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
very kind of a color and then the last

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.630 
very kind of a color and then the last
color<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.739> have<00:03:17.010> which<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.430> wasn't
