our mix the other 20% comes from the GL
550<00:01:00.710> and<00:01:01.710> then<00:01:01.860> we'll<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.970> a<00:01:03.090> small

let's<00:01:06.630> take<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.869> 24/7<00:01:07.530> through<00:01:07.800> GL<00:01:08.100> 550<00:01:08.790> and

let's take that 24/7 through GL 550 and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.880 
let's take that 24/7 through GL 550 and
at<00:01:09.000> ultimate<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.600> would<00:01:09.720> be<00:01:09.780> 18%<00:01:10.560> something

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
at ultimate it would be 18% something

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.890 
at ultimate it would be 18% something
along<00:01:11.040> those<00:01:11.130> lines<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.600> changed

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340

pounds lighter and that's done primarily

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.109 
pounds lighter and that's done primarily
through<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> use<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.890> exotic<00:01:26.280> materials<00:01:26.970> like
