the<00:00:37.020> late<00:00:37.170> game<00:00:37.410> win<00:00:37.590> because<00:00:37.770> he<00:00:37.980> seems<00:00:38.640> to

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the late game win because he seems to

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.490 
the late game win because he seems to
feel<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.149> Savior<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.750> seem<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.230> feel<00:00:40.379> it

feel that Savior and I seem to feel it

too<00:00:40.620> let's<00:00:40.829> say<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:40.950> feel<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.430> two-bit<00:00:41.879> Savior

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
too let's say I feel a two-bit Savior

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.569 
too let's say I feel a two-bit Savior
isn't<00:00:43.230> really<00:00:43.410> playing<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.040> perfect<00:00:44.430> late

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
isn't really playing the perfect late

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.660 
isn't really playing the perfect late
game<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.270> he's<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:45.660> famous<00:00:45.899> for<00:00:46.670> Savior

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
game that that he's so famous for Savior

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.819 
game that that he's so famous for Savior
usually<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.360> was<00:00:48.690> always<00:00:48.930> at<00:00:49.530> his<00:00:49.649> most

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
usually I was always at his most

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.500 
usually I was always at his most
vulnerable<00:00:49.980> early<00:00:50.670> mid<00:00:50.820> game<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.120> once<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.420> got

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
vulnerable early mid game it once it got

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.029 
vulnerable early mid game it once it got
too<00:00:51.690> late<00:00:51.719> game<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.260> was<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.739> difficult

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
too late game it was just so difficult

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.010 
too late game it was just so difficult
to<00:00:53.399> beat<00:00:53.520> Savior<00:00:53.910> because<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.270> fought<00:00:54.510> fought

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
to beat Savior because in fought fought

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.630 
to beat Savior because in fought fought
and<00:00:55.230> fought<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.590> his<00:00:55.680> micra<00:00:56.070> was<00:00:56.190> impeccable

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
and fought in his micra was impeccable

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.490 
and fought in his micra was impeccable
and<00:00:56.760> he<00:00:56.850> made<00:00:57.030> every<00:00:57.719> single<00:00:58.050> do<00:00:58.170> not<00:00:58.289> count

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and he made every single do not count

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.439 
and he made every single do not count
and<00:00:58.739> vs.<00:00:59.370> flash<00:00:59.579> she<00:00:59.730> just<00:00:59.910> hasn't<00:01:00.090> been<00:01:00.270> doing

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
and vs. flash she just hasn't been doing

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.150 
and vs. flash she just hasn't been doing
that<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:01.140> think<00:01:01.170> had<00:01:01.590> he<00:01:01.680> been<00:01:01.829> playing

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
that and I think had he been playing

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.619 
that and I think had he been playing
against<00:01:02.460> other<00:01:02.520> Terran<00:01:02.940> player<00:01:03.059> who<00:01:03.270> wasn't

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
against other Terran player who wasn't

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.780 
against other Terran player who wasn't
as<00:01:03.809> much<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.350> his<00:01:04.470> prime<00:01:04.769> as<00:01:04.979> flashes<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.519> think

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
as much in his prime as flashes I think

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.890 
as much in his prime as flashes I think
Savior<00:01:06.030> might<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.299> been<00:01:06.390> able<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.600> come<00:01:06.750> away

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
Savior might have been able to come away

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.120 
Savior might have been able to come away
with<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.140> win<00:01:07.200> considering<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.860> he<00:01:07.979> has

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
with a win considering that he has

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.469 
with a win considering that he has
played<00:01:08.340> some<00:01:08.490> decent<00:01:08.729> starcraft<00:01:09.090> especially

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
played some decent starcraft especially

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.030 
played some decent starcraft especially
the<00:01:09.570> bursary<00:01:09.900> games<00:01:10.080> say<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:10.740> would<00:01:10.860> have<00:01:10.950> been

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the bursary games say we would have been

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.950 
the bursary games say we would have been
able<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.250> take<00:01:11.400> couple<00:01:11.670> more<00:01:11.820> victories<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.900> i

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
able to take couple more victories but i

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.390

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
think on oil tax account so watch out

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.420 
think on oil tax account so watch out
for<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.070> was<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> great<00:01:29.340> game

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
for that but that was a great game

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.670 
for that but that was a great game
between<00:01:29.759> two<00:01:30.090> great<00:01:30.240> players<00:01:30.509> Protoss<00:01:31.380> vs

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
between two great players Protoss vs

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
between two great players Protoss vs
terran<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:31.950> make<00:01:32.070> sure<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.220> guys<00:01:32.340> check<00:01:32.369> that

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
terran so make sure you guys check that

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.210 
terran so make sure you guys check that
out<00:01:32.729> when<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.090> up<00:01:33.710> but<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:34.890> flashes

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
out when it's up but you have flashes

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.469 
out when it's up but you have flashes
just<00:01:35.400> playing<00:01:35.579> some<00:01:35.640> great<00:01:35.880> starcraft<00:01:36.329> and

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
just playing some great starcraft and

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.719 
just playing some great starcraft and
and<00:01:37.079> he's<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> player<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.920> Pete<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.490> think

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and he's the player to Pete and I think

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.999 
and he's the player to Pete and I think
Savior<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.689> just<00:01:40.020> not<00:01:40.200> playing<00:01:40.500> starcraft<00:01:40.890> at

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
Savior is just not playing starcraft at

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.289 
Savior is just not playing starcraft at
the<00:01:41.100> level<00:01:41.369> he<00:01:41.400> needs<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.939> order<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.150> beat

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
the level he needs to in order to beat

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.429 
the level he needs to in order to beat
him<00:01:42.390> looks<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:42.630> she<00:01:42.720> was<00:01:42.840> gone<00:01:42.990> for<00:01:43.170> twelve

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
him looks like she was gone for twelve

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.690 
him looks like she was gone for twelve
how<00:01:43.590> she<00:01:43.649> looks<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.009> he's<00:01:44.100> gone<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.430> fast

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
how she looks like he's gone for a fast

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.429 
how she looks like he's gone for a fast
expand<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.149> for<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.630> first<00:01:45.840> time<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.110> think<00:01:46.350> in

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
expand so for the first time I think in

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.690 
expand so for the first time I think in
this<00:01:46.530> series<00:01:46.680> we've<00:01:46.890> seen<00:01:46.920> saber<00:01:47.280> put<00:01:47.549> down

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
this series we've seen saber put down

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.130 
this series we've seen saber put down
that<00:01:47.729> actually<00:01:48.210> before<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.540> spawning<00:01:48.840> pool

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
that actually before the spawning pool

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.960 
that actually before the spawning pool
and<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.070> think<00:01:50.250> this<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.369> indeed<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.700> first

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
and I think this is indeed the first

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.100 
and I think this is indeed the first
time<00:01:51.119> we've<00:01:51.240> seen<00:01:51.329> him<00:01:51.450> do<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.720> beer<00:01:51.930> see

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
time we've seen him do that a beer see

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.880 
time we've seen him do that a beer see
what<00:01:52.200> he<00:01:52.259> goes<00:01:52.380> what<00:01:52.530> she<00:01:52.619> had<00:01:52.710> no<00:01:52.770> he's

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
what he goes what she had no he's

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.469 
what he goes what she had no he's
putting<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.189> please<00:01:54.060> put<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.299> spawning

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
putting this please put the spawning

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.670 
putting this please put the spawning
pool<00:01:54.659> down<00:01:54.780> now<00:01:54.899> behind<00:01:55.110> his<00:01:55.259> mineral<00:01:55.530> line

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
pool down now behind his mineral line

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.380 
pool down now behind his mineral line
flashes<00:01:56.610> they<00:01:56.700> see<00:01:56.759> if<00:01:56.850> he<00:01:56.909> got<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.149> there<00:01:57.270> i'm

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
flashes they see if he got in there i'm

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.789 
flashes they see if he got in there i'm
not<00:01:57.509> sure<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.810> got<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.049> close<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.530> up<00:01:58.590> see<00:01:58.740> it

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
not sure if it got in close it up see it

00:01:58.799 --> 00:01:59.899 
not sure if it got in close it up see it
i<00:01:58.860> think<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.100> probably<00:01:59.130> did<00:01:59.700> but<00:01:59.790> I'm

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
i think it probably did but I'm

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.850 
i think it probably did but I'm
100-percent<00:02:00.299> sure<00:02:00.509> but<00:02:01.350> he<00:02:01.409> straightaway<00:02:01.680> put

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
100-percent sure but he straightaway put

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.889 
100-percent sure but he straightaway put
on<00:02:01.920> his<00:02:02.009> command<00:02:02.310> center<00:02:02.610> he<00:02:02.969> was<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.750> he's

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
on his command center he was so he's

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.840 
on his command center he was so he's
gone<00:02:04.020> 41<00:02:04.259> racks<00:02:04.560> into<00:02:04.799> command<00:02:05.040> center<00:02:05.369> which

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
gone 41 racks into command center which

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.190 
gone 41 racks into command center which
is<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> bill<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.180> has<00:02:06.420> has<00:02:06.840> been<00:02:06.990> fairly

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
is a bill that has has been fairly

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.630 
is a bill that has has been fairly
successful<00:02:07.320> it's<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> fairly<00:02:07.950> safe<00:02:08.250> build<00:02:08.489> for

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
successful it's a fairly safe build for

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.609 
successful it's a fairly safe build for
flash<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.970> go<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:09.360> because<00:02:10.110> it<00:02:10.200> protects

my<00:02:14.560> take<00:02:14.710> on<00:02:14.740> this<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.370> know<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.520> savouries

being slowed down in his own base trying
to<00:02:17.470> get<00:02:18.040> back<00:02:18.160> expansion<00:02:18.880> down<00:02:19.030> try<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:19.990> put

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
to get back expansion down try to put

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.870 
to get back expansion down try to put
that<00:02:20.170> toward<00:02:20.470> hatchery<00:02:20.830> down<00:02:20.980> or<00:02:21.610> maybe<00:02:21.790> he

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
that toward hatchery down or maybe he

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.190 
that toward hatchery down or maybe he
was<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.090> chasing<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.690> s<00:02:22.840> he<00:02:22.960> be<00:02:23.050> around

with the drone try and kill it off maybe
that<00:02:26.050> that's<00:02:26.350> what<00:02:26.470> he<00:02:26.560> was<00:02:26.680> doing<00:02:26.920> but<00:02:26.950> if<00:02:27.520> he

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
that that's what he was doing but if he

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
was try to get that expansion that looks

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.150 
was try to get that expansion that looks
like<00:02:29.080> flash<00:02:29.260> blocked<00:02:29.560> it<00:02:29.770> and<00:02:29.860> looks<00:02:30.070> like

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
like flash blocked it and looks like

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.530 
like flash blocked it and looks like

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
the spawning pool he would have probably

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.770 
the spawning pool he would have probably
had<00:02:45.460> a<00:02:45.700> slight<00:02:45.910> advantage<00:02:46.060> in<00:02:46.420> terms<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:46.690> the

hatchery then pool then I actually and

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.140 
hatchery then pool then I actually and
that<00:02:50.830> how<00:02:50.980> she<00:02:51.010> was<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.340> little<00:02:51.490> bit<00:02:51.640> slow<00:02:51.880> down

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
that how she was a little bit slow down

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.090 
that how she was a little bit slow down
as<00:02:52.900> well<00:02:53.170> cut<00:02:53.920> five<00:02:54.340> flashes<00:02:54.790> SCV<00:02:55.240> so<00:02:56.100> that's

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
as well cut five flashes SCV so that's

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.040 
as well cut five flashes SCV so that's
obviously<00:02:57.250> gonna<00:02:58.000> have<00:02:58.300> a<00:02:58.330> small<00:02:58.690> effect<00:02:58.930> on

seem to have much scouting going on

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.490

Joan that he sent up into flashes base

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.000 
Joan that he sent up into flashes base
so<00:03:49.270> I'm<00:03:49.870> sure<00:03:50.110> from<00:03:50.380> seeing<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.680> command<00:03:50.950> center

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.830 
so I'm sure from seeing a command center
he<00:03:51.340> had<00:03:51.460> an<00:03:51.550> idea<00:03:51.640> that<00:03:51.940> flash<00:03:52.270> had<00:03:52.420> gone<00:03:52.570> one

himself but I think if you look at

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.040 
himself but I think if you look at
saviors<00:04:45.060> past<00:04:45.330> games<00:04:45.570> you'll<00:04:45.720> find<00:04:45.960> that

saviors past games you'll find that
