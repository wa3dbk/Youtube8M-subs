to<00:05:05.240> assume<00:05:05.300> that<00:05:05.510> it's<00:05:05.810> paint<00:05:06.290> but<00:05:07.010> at<00:05:07.100> least

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
to assume that it's paint but at least

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.730 
to assume that it's paint but at least
his<00:05:07.430> windows<00:05:07.730> are<00:05:07.880> all<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.180> same<00:05:08.360> color<00:05:08.740> and

like<00:05:09.919> i<00:05:09.950> said<00:05:10.280> i<00:05:10.490> could<00:05:10.610> live<00:05:11.030> with<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:11.390> fact

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
like i said i could live with the fact

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.620 
like i said i could live with the fact
that<00:05:11.840> is<00:05:12.080> front<00:05:12.860> windows<00:05:13.190> are<00:05:13.400> clear<00:05:14.300> plastic

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
that is front windows are clear plastic

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.140 
that is front windows are clear plastic

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
and that is side windows are just paint

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.980 
and that is side windows are just paint
applique<00:05:17.600> are<00:05:18.290> just<00:05:18.530> paint<00:05:18.890> applications<00:05:19.990> you

it's<00:06:51.780> going<00:06:51.990> to<00:06:52.050> be<00:06:52.140> more<00:06:52.290> expensive<00:06:52.530> but<00:06:53.040> I

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:53.480 
it's going to be more expensive but I

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.690 
it's going to be more expensive but I
think<00:06:54.480> it'll<00:06:54.630> be<00:06:54.900> worth<00:06:55.140> it<00:06:55.380> at<00:06:56.370> least<00:06:56.430> he

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:56.700 
think it'll be worth it at least he
