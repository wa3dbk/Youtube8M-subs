um

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.970 

what<00:00:47.260> I<00:00:47.290> did<00:00:47.560> was<00:00:48.150> because<00:00:49.150> they<00:00:49.870> suck<00:00:50.200> the

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
what I did was because they suck the

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.790 
what I did was because they suck the
bass<00:00:51.190> pedals<00:00:51.990> they<00:00:52.990> snap<00:00:53.290> in<00:00:53.470> the<00:00:53.530> middle

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
bass pedals they snap in the middle

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.550 
bass pedals they snap in the middle
instead<00:00:54.520> of<00:00:54.820> sending<00:00:55.090> mine<00:00:55.300> in<00:00:55.510> I<00:00:55.810> took<00:00:56.140> it

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
instead of sending mine in I took it

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.060 
instead of sending mine in I took it
apart<00:00:56.830> and<00:00:58.170> instead<00:00:59.170> of<00:00:59.260> using<00:00:59.440> a<00:00:59.650> little<00:00:59.890> reed

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
apart and instead of using a little reed

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.020 
apart and instead of using a little reed
switch<00:01:00.400> the<00:01:01.440> little<00:01:02.440> last<00:01:03.130> tube<00:01:03.430> that<00:01:03.610> has<00:01:03.760> the

switch the little last tube that has the
two<00:01:04.480> connectors<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:14.110> using<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.790> last<00:01:15.790> year

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
two connectors so using the last year

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.520 
two connectors so using the last year
that<00:01:16.120> has<00:01:16.240> a<00:01:16.270> little<00:01:16.479> two<00:01:16.660> connectors<00:01:17.140> so<00:01:17.350> that

that<00:01:21.580> it<00:01:21.670> closes<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.360> connection<00:01:24.869> what<00:01:25.869> I<00:01:25.900> did

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
that it closes the connection what I did

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.880 
that it closes the connection what I did

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.560 

that<00:01:43.869> connection

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:02:11.240 

it's<00:01:47.110> to<00:01:47.260> this<00:01:47.409> contraption

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:35.340 

you

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:48.280 

scoot<00:02:36.280> away<00:02:36.520> here

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.080 

in<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.860> way<00:02:49.010> of<00:02:49.129> words<00:02:49.370> I'll<00:02:50.230> unplug<00:02:51.230> this

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
in the way of words I'll unplug this

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.059 
in the way of words I'll unplug this
scoop<00:02:53.090> this<00:02:53.239> back

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.199 

is<00:02:57.540> basically<00:02:59.430> the<00:03:00.430> way<00:03:00.579> the<00:03:00.760> foot<00:03:00.939> pedal

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
is basically the way the foot pedal

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.119 
is basically the way the foot pedal
works<00:03:01.389> this<00:03:02.109> this<00:03:02.499> is<00:03:02.680> like<00:03:02.829> a<00:03:02.859> real

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
works this this is like a real

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.849 
works this this is like a real
controller<00:03:03.609> and<00:03:06.299> so<00:03:07.299> the<00:03:07.480> green<00:03:07.719> equals<00:03:08.349> this

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
controller and so the green equals this

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.539 
controller and so the green equals this
the<00:03:09.249> blue<00:03:09.489> equals<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.930> little<00:03:11.230> button

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
the blue equals that little button

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.640 
the blue equals that little button
yellow<00:03:12.549> equals<00:03:12.909> a<00:03:13.060> button<00:03:13.420> but<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.139> orange

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
yellow equals a button but the orange

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.509 
yellow equals a button but the orange
which<00:03:14.980> was<00:03:15.189> the<00:03:15.340> bass<00:03:15.519> pedal<00:03:16.349> equals<00:03:17.349> the<00:03:17.709> lb

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
which was the bass pedal equals the lb

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.050 
which was the bass pedal equals the lb
button<00:03:18.909> left<00:03:19.750> bumper<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.579> this<00:03:21.579> plugs<00:03:21.879> in<00:03:22.030> the

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
button left bumper and this plugs in the

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:31.470 
button left bumper and this plugs in the
back<00:03:22.269> of<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:22.689> and<00:03:25.469> what<00:03:26.469> I've<00:03:26.590> done<00:03:29.969> does<00:03:30.969> cut

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
back of it and what I've done does cut

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.940 
back of it and what I've done does cut
this<00:03:31.629> wire<00:03:31.870> up

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.610 

and<00:03:36.540> i<00:03:37.540> have<00:03:38.700> attached<00:03:39.700> one<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:41.080> this<00:03:41.319> and

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
and i have attached one to this and

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.559 
and i have attached one to this and
soldered<00:03:42.489> it<00:03:42.640> to<00:03:42.849> this<00:03:43.510> metal<00:03:43.870> part<00:03:44.110> and<00:03:45.569> then

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
soldered it to this metal part and then

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.360 
soldered it to this metal part and then
i<00:03:46.690> took<00:03:46.750> it<00:03:46.959> up<00:03:47.170> here<00:03:47.440> and<00:03:47.560> then<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:47.709> wrapped<00:03:48.010> the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
i took it up here and then I wrapped the

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.729 
i took it up here and then I wrapped the
strip<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.360> cord<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:49.959> wrapped<00:03:49.989> it<00:03:50.410> all<00:03:50.590> the

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
strip the cord and wrapped it all the

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.830 
strip the cord and wrapped it all the
way<00:03:50.830> around<00:03:50.950> here<00:03:51.310> a<00:03:51.340> bunch<00:03:51.489> of<00:03:51.670> times<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:52.810> can

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
way around here a bunch of times you can

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.940 
way around here a bunch of times you can
kind<00:03:53.170> of<00:03:53.230> see<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.560> right<00:03:54.220> there<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:58.380> I<00:03:59.380> put

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
kind of see it right there and I put

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.470 
kind of see it right there and I put
aluminum<00:04:00.160> foil<00:04:00.640> but<00:04:00.819> it<00:04:00.880> seems<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.180> have<00:04:01.330> come

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
aluminum foil but it seems to have come

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.600 
aluminum foil but it seems to have come
off<00:04:01.690> still<00:04:02.530> makes<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:02.799> connection<00:04:02.980> just<00:04:03.430> as

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
off still makes the connection just as

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.280 
off still makes the connection just as
well<00:04:03.760> anyway<00:04:04.739> and<00:04:06.239> then<00:04:07.239> I<00:04:07.569> took<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:08.140> other

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
well anyway and then I took the other

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.059 
well anyway and then I took the other
cord<00:04:09.099> and<00:04:10.200> attached<00:04:11.200> it<00:04:11.410> to<00:04:11.470> this<00:04:11.680> when<00:04:12.040> I

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
cord and attached it to this when I

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.759 
cord and attached it to this when I
found<00:04:12.340> out<00:04:12.580> is<00:04:12.849> all<00:04:13.299> this<00:04:13.870> actually<00:04:14.140> conducts

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
found out is all this actually conducts

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.770 
found out is all this actually conducts
really<00:04:15.130> well<00:04:15.310> so<00:04:15.849> I<00:04:16.150> can<00:04:17.139> actually<00:04:18.299> attach<00:04:19.299> I

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
really well so I can actually attach I

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.810 
really well so I can actually attach I
could<00:04:20.470> I<00:04:20.500> could<00:04:20.680> have<00:04:20.919> attached<00:04:21.190> this<00:04:21.430> cord

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
could I could have attached this cord

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.659 
could I could have attached this cord
way<00:04:22.419> down<00:04:22.600> here<00:04:22.930> somewhere<00:04:23.380> what<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.280> did<00:04:24.460> was<00:04:24.639> I

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
way down here somewhere what I did was I

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.250 
way down here somewhere what I did was I
