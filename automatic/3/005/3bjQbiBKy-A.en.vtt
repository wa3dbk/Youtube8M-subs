00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
good comfort we'll start off with the

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.119 
good comfort we'll start off with the
soleplate<00:02:52.220> it's<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.879> plastic<00:02:53.329> soleplate<00:02:54.129> the

studs it's the same size pattern but the

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.610 
studs it's the same size pattern but the
studs<00:02:58.310> are<00:02:58.519> maybe<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.819> little<00:02:59.030> bit<00:02:59.209> shorter<00:02:59.620> and

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
studs are maybe a little bit shorter and

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.979 
studs are maybe a little bit shorter and
you<00:03:01.310> know<00:03:01.459> not<00:03:01.819> as<00:03:02.769> grass<00:03:03.769> all<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.159> me<00:03:04.310> anyway

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
you know not as grass all of me anyway

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.959 
you know not as grass all of me anyway
it<00:03:05.989> looks<00:03:06.439> like<00:03:06.530> this<00:03:06.859> fiberglass<00:03:07.340> I'm<00:03:07.819> not

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:07.969 
it looks like this fiberglass I'm not

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.030 
it looks like this fiberglass I'm not
sure<00:03:08.030> if<00:03:08.269> it<00:03:08.389> actually<00:03:08.569> is<00:03:08.959> but<00:03:09.590> most<00:03:09.859> likely

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
sure if it actually is but most likely

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.539 
sure if it actually is but most likely
it<00:03:10.370> is<00:03:10.519> it<00:03:11.060> looks<00:03:11.239> a<00:03:11.389> lot<00:03:11.540> like<00:03:11.750> fiberglass<00:03:12.549> as

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
those dimples like as you can see i can

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.879 
those dimples like as you can see i can
grass<00:03:29.449> anyway<00:03:30.290> as<00:03:30.560> those<00:03:30.859> dimples<00:03:32.650> yeah<00:03:33.650> it's

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:35.659 
the same sort of aggressiveness as the

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:37.750 
the same sort of aggressiveness as the
vapor<00:03:35.870> just<00:03:36.439> maybe<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.769> little<00:03:36.979> bit<00:03:37.220> less

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
vapor just maybe a little bit less

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.319 
vapor just maybe a little bit less
aggressive<00:03:38.299> not<00:03:38.750> as<00:03:38.870> dimply<00:03:39.680> if<00:03:39.889> you<00:03:40.010> honor<00:03:40.159> me

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
aggressive not as dimply if you honor me

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.390 
aggressive not as dimply if you honor me
as<00:03:41.329> you<00:03:41.540> can<00:03:41.689> see<00:03:41.870> it's<00:03:42.049> sort<00:03:42.349> of<00:03:42.500> shiny<00:03:42.949> here

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
as you can see it's sort of shiny here

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.069 
as you can see it's sort of shiny here

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
but when it comes here it's more like a

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.679 
but when it comes here it's more like a
matte<00:03:45.439> black<00:03:45.769> and<00:03:46.310> you're<00:03:46.459> like<00:03:46.689> transitions
