with a a 6
X<00:04:20.419> chip<00:04:21.069> which<00:04:22.069> I<00:04:22.340> guess<00:04:22.870> um<00:04:24.250> was<00:04:25.250> great<00:04:25.550> also

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
X chip which I guess um was great also

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.290 
X chip which I guess um was great also
twice<00:04:27.380> as<00:04:27.440> fast<00:04:27.740> i<00:04:28.039> mean<00:04:28.220> you<00:04:28.610> can<00:04:28.759> only<00:04:28.880> get<00:04:29.150> to

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
twice as fast i mean you can only get to

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.510 
twice as fast i mean you can only get to
a<00:04:29.330> certain<00:04:29.539> point<00:04:29.900> in<00:04:30.380> speed<00:04:30.889> and<00:04:30.919> added<00:04:31.400> you

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
a certain point in speed and added you

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.320 
a certain point in speed and added you
can't<00:04:31.759> really<00:04:31.910> notice<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.300> difference

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
can't really notice the difference

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.809 
can't really notice the difference
anymore<00:04:32.889> but<00:04:33.889> i<00:04:33.919> guess<00:04:34.190> it's<00:04:34.340> great<00:04:34.460> they<00:04:34.639> did

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:34.819
