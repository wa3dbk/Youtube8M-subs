00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.920
 I have never been very good at sewing. 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.320
 I was just looking for a sewing machine that was as simple as possible. 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.920
 All sewing machines have a needle with such a tiny eye. 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.960
 And then the thread splits again. 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.080
 I only sew when I have new curtains or a new tablecloth. 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.480
 And then I have to ask my neighbor for help. I think that's embarrassing. 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.800
 But even I know how to sew in a straight line. 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.160
 My mother and aunts were sewing and expanding everything. 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.280
 In fact, all women were very agile with their hands at the time. 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.880
 Few men were involved in it. 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:08.840
 I find it annoying if the thread gets entangled. 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.120
 I am very happy that it has numbers on it. 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:41.560
 I wrap around curtains or tablecloths, and sometimes even trousers. 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.880
 There are probably relatives who can do it much better. 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.280
 Let's see if I can do it. 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.040
 I think it worked. 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.320
 Let's see how it works. 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.920
 There is the lever, it must go down. 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.080
 The pedal must be on the floor. 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.600
 There he goes. 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.480
 I try to go as straight as possible for a good result. 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.480
 I use the presser foot as an aid to stay straight. 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.080
 As you move, the seam becomes very beautiful. 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.760
 It makes sewing much more fun. 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.800
 So make sailing. 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.280
 Now I have to tie the thread. 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.240
 Then up and down. 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.760
 That was easy. 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.680
 I think a beautiful tablecloth is really beautiful. 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.600
 Pride goes a bit far, but I am happy with my sewing result. 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.240
 I like it.
