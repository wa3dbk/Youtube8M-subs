00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
of new doors now at first it's actually

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.279 
of new doors now at first it's actually
kind<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.760> hard<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.030> tell<00:00:45.270> what<00:00:45.570> door<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:45.989> what

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
kind of hard to tell what door is what

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.810 
kind of hard to tell what door is what
because<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.010> can<00:00:47.190> tell<00:00:47.399> these<00:00:47.609> are

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
because as you can tell these are

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.939 
because as you can tell these are
clearly<00:00:48.239> using<00:00:48.719> different<00:00:49.320> texture<00:00:49.710> packs

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
clearly using different texture packs

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.069 
clearly using different texture packs
but<00:00:50.460> if<00:00:50.699> you<00:00:50.850> look<00:00:51.090> closely<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.719> can<00:00:51.750> tell

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
but if you look closely you can tell

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.229 
but if you look closely you can tell
that<00:00:52.109> these<00:00:52.289> doors<00:00:52.710> are<00:00:52.980> grouped<00:00:53.430> into<00:00:53.640> groups

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
that these doors are grouped into groups

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.049 
that these doors are grouped into groups
of<00:00:54.480> five<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:56.100> example<00:00:56.190> if<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.699> look<00:00:56.730> at

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
of five so for example if you look at

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.090 
of five so for example if you look at
the<00:00:57.090> holiday<00:00:57.899> doors<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.530> actually<00:00:58.859> see

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the holiday doors you can actually see

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.520 
the holiday doors you can actually see
that<00:00:59.399> there<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.579> five<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.210> them<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.870> row<00:01:01.199> and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
that there is five of them in a row and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.259 
that there is five of them in a row and
with<00:01:01.769> that<00:01:01.890> said<00:01:02.160> here<00:01:02.399> comes<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> icing<00:01:03.149> on

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
with that said here comes the icing on

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.090 
with that said here comes the icing on
the<00:01:03.359> cake<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.929> look<00:01:04.140> at<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.379> five<00:01:04.680> doors

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the cake if you look at the five doors

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.640 
the cake if you look at the five doors
next<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> holiday<00:01:06.540> doors<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.259> can<00:01:07.439> see

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
next to the holiday doors you can see

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.980 
next to the holiday doors you can see
that<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.159> clearly<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:09.000> version<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
that that is clearly a version of the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.429 
that that is clearly a version of the
acacia<00:01:10.500> door<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.159> well<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.180> dark<00:01:12.570> oak<00:01:12.869> door

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439

acacia door as well as the dark oak door
now<00:01:13.830> guys<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.610> absolutely<00:01:15.600> massive

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
now guys this is absolutely massive

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.950 
now guys this is absolutely massive
because<00:01:16.680> right<00:01:17.189> now<00:01:17.220> on<00:01:17.640> console<00:01:18.090> addition<00:01:18.540> we

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
because right now on console addition we

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.289 
because right now on console addition we
actually<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.560> not<00:01:19.799> have<00:01:20.250> dark<00:01:20.670> oak<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.210> we

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
actually do not have dark oak and we

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.380 
actually do not have dark oak and we
also<00:01:21.509> do<00:01:21.900> not<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.470> acacia<00:01:22.979> wood<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.119> only

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
also do not have acacia wood so the only

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.929 
also do not have acacia wood so the only
way<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.229> these<00:01:25.439> doors<00:01:25.890> will<00:01:26.100> actually<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.820> in

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
way that these doors will actually be in

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.469 
way that these doors will actually be in
the<00:01:27.090> game<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.810> if<00:01:28.079> also<00:01:28.799> 4j<00:01:29.369> Studios<00:01:29.850> made<00:01:30.240> a

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
the game is if also 4j Studios made a

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.990 
the game is if also 4j Studios made a
whole<00:01:30.930> bunch<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.470> new<00:01:31.740> biomes<00:01:32.399> now<00:01:32.850> we've

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
whole bunch of new biomes now we've

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.819 
whole bunch of new biomes now we've
already<00:01:33.270> speculated<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.200> before<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.680> it's

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
already speculated this before so it's

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.230 
already speculated this before so it's
not<00:01:35.009> gonna<00:01:35.220> actually<00:01:35.460> come<00:01:35.820> as<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> surprise

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
not gonna actually come as a surprise

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.889 
not gonna actually come as a surprise
however<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.770> was<00:01:38.250> left<00:01:38.729> out<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.299> changelog

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
however it was left out of the changelog

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.230 
however it was left out of the changelog
so<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.439> kind<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.920> poses<00:01:41.159> some<00:01:41.549> questions<00:01:42.060> is

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
so it kind of poses some questions is

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.300 
so it kind of poses some questions is
this<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.079> be<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> secret<00:01:43.890> feature

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
this going to be a secret feature

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.399 
this going to be a secret feature
meaning<00:01:45.030> whenever<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.420> hop<00:01:45.659> onto<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.079> update
