00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
look at a time so it's kind of like you

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:14.590 
look at a time so it's kind of like you
use<00:02:05.200> that<00:02:05.410> kind<00:02:05.680> of<00:02:05.770> thought

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.230 

I<00:02:15.370> developed<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.400> kind<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.730> technique<00:02:17.030> where

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
I developed that kind of technique where

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.900 
I developed that kind of technique where
you<00:02:17.330> you're<00:02:17.840> just<00:02:17.870> using<00:02:18.170> every<00:02:18.560> grip<00:02:18.770> to<00:02:18.920> do

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
you you're just using every grip to do

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.280 
you you're just using every grip to do
what<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.240> want<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.450> do<00:02:20.540> if<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:21.080> was<00:02:21.200> only

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
what you want to do if you was only

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.540 
what you want to do if you was only
using<00:02:21.530> one<00:02:21.770> grip<00:02:21.980> you'll<00:02:22.190> probably<00:02:22.310> get

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
using one grip you'll probably get

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.570 
using one grip you'll probably get
tendinitis<00:02:23.120> very<00:02:23.420> fast<00:02:23.720> so<00:02:24.620> that's<00:02:25.160> hot

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
tendinitis very fast so that's hot

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.250 
tendinitis very fast so that's hot
any<00:02:26.540> other<00:02:26.690> questions<00:02:26.990> real<00:02:27.410> fast<00:02:29.050> all<00:02:30.050> right

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260
