00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hello my name is Sergey today u 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.130
 there will be a little unusual review 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.040
 it will be a fornication pneumatics we 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.960
 consider the model 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.350
 throw a click means they go from 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.630
 such boxes in principle knives in fact 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:25.019
 things are exactly the same we will remove 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:28.650
 box covers neon covers house on 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:33.960
 Cheap looks so watery 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.210
 loop you can lose the knife such covers 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.270
 packed 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:44.610
 cheap Chinese knives that are littered 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:48.450
 all the markets we take are also interesting and here 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.820
 so here are our knives here this knife 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.449
 reminds something strictly knife of the times of the USSR 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.350
 whether 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:00.539
 food in the canteens means a little bit I 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:03.049
 the class of knives principle length weight width 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:08.070
 absolutely the same and the gums are not different 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:09.060
 that the blade of this type of knife a little bit 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.030
 having bent 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.860
 as if to the top of such a saber and that 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:21.720
 the more even arc goes only lower 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:25.229
 part of the blade means the thickness of their order 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.229
 five millimeters weight 140 grams due 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.189
 their weight does not actually have such 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:35.189
 kinetic energy and pierce bye 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.250
 very properties principle, here's a note 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.439
 go to have a little bit changed the color of it 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.710
 from the fact that she climbed the metal and then 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.659
 show you how it all happened 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.640
 pretty interesting thing i mean u 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.630
 when it is not damaged until you 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.930
 just a little bit of stubble everywhere 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.439
 left absolutely undamaged in general 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.390
 I threw the knife and I will postpone and not 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.979
 hit the wood hit the metal 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.390
 corner 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.090
 resulting in what can practically 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.280
 pierced a metal corner though 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.600
 throwing wrong in principle not much 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.790
 just due to its mass in 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:18.870
 see for yourself here and then mean 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.200
 threw not much this no less than the video 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.370
 nothing happened to the knife 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.370
 absolutely nothing he didn't even get blunt 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.840
 metal corner as we see 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.230
 practically socks and can't see 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.200
 from that side but the thickness of the corner is 5 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.870
 millimeters your there will be visible 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.310
 so little black this so on 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.610
 millimeter 4 probably millimeter not 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:53.170
 enough to pierce 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:55.990
 corner mask you mean they are knife 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.830
 all stainless steel has a fake 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.220
 blade what is this what is it that is why 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.740
 Falk because we are not sharpened 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.670
 flat surface from myself I said everything 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.130
 it means to throw it comfortably with any grip 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.630
 the knife is household household 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.630
 tool and does not apply to cold 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.020
 to arms 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:25.830
 has a metal handle and how 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:30.580
 see we come with a hole under the lanyard 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:34.350
 good balance on that knife well and 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.900
 good i would say old stuff 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:43.090
 mk422 hardness of material 54 typing 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:47.860
 Curve point and now the edges are smooth 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.460
 blade length 150 total length 256 thickness 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.310
 blade 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.960
 5 millimeters blade width 20 weight 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.880
 syllables 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.650
 Here is such an interesting thing right now I 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.450
 I will show you how I will throw him a couple of times 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:12.910
 Interestingly this is our 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:15.150
 I ask here so some 2 easy 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:20.320
 throw flashing it 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:22.720
 but for comparison the cast was carrying well 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.960
 as if by still called it still 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.970
 I prepared this model gun 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:33.310
 and look tomorrow or the day after tomorrow and see 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.760
 what is the difference cheap model gun 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.950
 that's expensive and so bad why 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.120
 Does it make sense to purchase 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.570
 dear device 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.090
 in front of cheap plastics which we 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.960
 we give preference to metal 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.150
 constructively alike 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.639
 even plastic is similar 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.610
 model she is already constructive 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.620
 Similar she and see how he on 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.740
 slaughter 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:06.750
 and dance and do the usual test 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.750
 Well, as if all of them good luck on the news
