 aulas with today's world you are 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.810
 premium it video tutorial for them 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.250
 understand to sell to m I put you 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.289
 two techniques and to work around the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.760
 wall the water to go over and not 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.230
 that you will like it so that's it 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.179
 party with sandy casar la dub 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.759
 arsenal in terms of free kicks with 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.680
 'good stats' 28 in power and 88 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.180
 indeed for the first technique 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.250
 is to circumvent the wall it takes 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.450
 to pass the pole better from the wall a little 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.649
 less than two bars of strength and 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.600
 go in and stick left to us and 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.539
 the left in order to revisit the post of 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.570
 middle of the wall a little less than two 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.430
 bars the ethics up and the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.980
 left was struggling to understand that 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.010
 I say pause metellus to see where for 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.609
 put the post and the number of doors 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:06.000
 really the pole well in the middle of the wall 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.540
 bar is wound cycle included 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.210
 top left 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.400
 and that makes everything in laces for the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.710
 second technique 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.259
 why to go over the wall 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.180
 will try to aim for the 2nd day 2 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.130
 of mood when leaving the outside we go 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.130
 well framing what they are good at 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.229
 middle of the ball and put some 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.540
 force bars and present the stick 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.460
 left towards the water and the left one argues 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.840
 to climb straight up until 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.439
 up and it comes back to all 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:41.159
 shots we'll see him again in the frame well 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.720
 second important day outside a 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.890
 little less than 2 beats the stick up 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:52.909
 and herring we see him one last time 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.909
 from bar the peak to the water 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.649
 now to go to the free kick at 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.670
 center a little the same technique the photo 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:09.280
 in the middle of the wall a little less than two 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.900
 bars are wrapped with the left stick in 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.890
 top left again once we have the 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.390
 technique is pretty much the same thing 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.700
 all the time all the time more well 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.470
 repeat well practiced and then after that 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.730
 return alone during matches 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.160
 for this technique that you see there 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.500
 you really have to have good players 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.849
 randstad of facts the action it is not 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.470
 too big of really 5 m 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.519
 closing the facts what are you going 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.660
 to put in the baltic it's important 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.430
 you learned your day and not very 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.480
 performing indeed to make our to 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.400
 nothing to shoot with him the second 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.500
 technique to go over like 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.069
 just now the second player 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.840
 important outside it fits well 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.879
 we will not really stick to the bottom 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:56.349
 up and it goes in the frame 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:57.280
 well get fixed up debart if you 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.049
 have questions sealed them in 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.049
 comment I will answer directly 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:09.790
 there we will go more to the left the 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.069
 technique is about a little bit for the 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.510
 first method to wind it changes 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.910
 a little bit there we will try to find 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.260
 a small alley for the balloon between the 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.569
 guardian and the wall we frame well after 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.609
 it's about the same thing 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.750
 the left stick goes the water and the left a 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.389
 little less than two bars before anything 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.340
 the time there is the hospital and 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.819
 down one wraps with the left stick on 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.579
 is on the left 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.389
 the return we will see the second 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:40.660
 technique now be two methods 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:45.000
 the second important day vector of 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.000
 bar the little up by amp 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.450
 we'll see him again I won 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:04:01.920
 outdoor low to the stick 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:04.020
 high hop such skylight that's for this 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.550
 little tutorial there are others who will
