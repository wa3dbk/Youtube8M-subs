00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.070
 on the other side of the sea of ​​polite 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.010
 in baja california de mexico 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.010
 is found in the austere cost of the Sonoran desert 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.810
 For centuries part of this coast has been home to a small tribe 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.530
 indigenous 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.210
 this is the complex 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.510
 mainly known in the world 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.060
 as not series 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.880
 they have never been numerous 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.250
 today there are more than a thousand of them and they live in what appears to be a desert 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.960
 inhospitable coastal 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.840
 until one observes how they ask for their part 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.370
 the green estuaries I have seen them in infamy among environmentalists as 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.430
 people who have conquered their desert 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.230
 you have to know in detail the small aspects of life 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.870
 preserving their few plants and animals and the sea creatures they are not 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.330
 farmers have learned to accept the desert just as they 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.600
 find loser and are known for their small sculptures of wood and stone 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.010
 his sixth name 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.930
 and about 10 for the coast and the coastal islands 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.930
 what else can they do here 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.280
 who in this modern world might need and value their expertise with 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.210
 plants and animals of the coastal desert 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.840
 just south of the wounded 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.400
 another extraordinary site is found 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.230
 but a very different one 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.410
 as a result of 40 years of research and development in the 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.560
 deserts of mexico arizona arabia 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.969
 india and africa 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.289
 you will find the watering meadows with uneven sea water fans bay kino 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.479
 nourished by shrimp culture lagoons 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.070
 installed during the last decades what began in the university of 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.720
 Arizona 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.689
 it became the American province 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.689
 Xinhua border division and the base of another entity 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.430
 as we have equaled in coahuila 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.620
 yesa 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.720
 the evolution with Mexican American investors is contemplated 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.529
 Europeans and the Middle East 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:33.699
 these integrated farms with seawater irrigation employ sewage 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:37.760
 of the shrimp farming lagoons and instead of a discharge to the sea like water 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:42.669
 waste and pollutant use it as a payment of March used to irrigate 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.209
 mangrove forests and salicornia grasslands 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.630
 Salicornia is a plant with oilseeds 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.840
 that thrive and salinity navolate that supply avocado biofuels 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.459
 quality 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.459
 for cars and aircraft 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.989
 to protect the front of this coastal region for environmental reasons 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.299
 As much as economic the seawater farms are located some 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.969
 kilometers inland in the bay of kino to move seawater 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:21.419
 from the coast has been denied a noise from the sea has been appointed to occur 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:25.219
 meningeal in honor of the developer of the aquaculture park 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:29.589
 it is here where the series is incorporated into these rivers of the sea are not narrow 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:30.319
 channels 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.950
 they are wide and deep channels that extends many kilometers land 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.650
 in the margins of these rivers with new Welsh revelations that will be 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.300
 for goals and plants that only require sea water to thrive where 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.769
 the desert wildlife will arrive and the coast reptilian birds 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.749
 fish in a leafy margin of the sea 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:53.829
 to achieve this who better than the wounded they will help in the plan of the 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.629
 design to grow plants and forests along the new riverbanks 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.309
 of the sea water river here in the gulf for agricultural fields more 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:05.269
 distant in Africa and the Middle East experts from these sites can travel 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.399
 so that the 0 and train them with their experience 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:12.379
 all this means employment for the series jobs that apply their knowledge 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.039
 where required 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:18.709
 still participates directly as owners of the seawater forests I 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.009
 having participation that iguanas sandwiches and there are more new ones 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.520
 forests on the edge of the desert and the sea will also get credits from 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.159
 World Bank carbon credits that are worth more than money each year for the 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:33.979
 tribe seri world 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.300
 so with so many others the founding director of the university group 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.080
 original and subsequently unequal condition on Saturday 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.320
 along with other council members including Kristen Saleh inter circuit 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.870
 some benefactors for a long time the injured margins 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.250
 start of this project 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.810
 a small ceremony in representation of gifts seeding 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.190
 symbolic there are a few small and old ones including one of the king of sweden 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.680
 I have finished by reducing atmospheric carbon in all places only 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.969
 some small trees now but soon yes no 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:08.069
 near kino bay 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.820
 the sevillistas and morazán of design in a type of association 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.960
 that has never existed before will be singing two tournaments conditions 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:22.569
 one 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:25.319
 one 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:25.809
 do not
