00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello people welcome once again the 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.470
 I come to bring another challenge another challenge 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.660
 so that they think and break 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.219
 the head in this case I'm going to do it 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.320
 with chips but these can be done 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.999
 with coins you also take eight 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.010
 one color coins eight coin other 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:19.260
 color or eight coin of a numbering 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.519
 eight coin other numbering or what can 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.410
 do with pieces of paper with what 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.259
 you want the idea is that they are eight 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.400
 of each color and the challenge is the 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:31.740
 next we are going to accommodate the chips of 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.220
 this way we are going to put one of 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.220
 each color 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:42.450
 thus 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.450
 I think I passed until now we alternate 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.169
 [Music] 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.390
 in this way facebook I talk to you a 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.030
 little bit 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.410
 then we would be staying 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.100
 interspersed what we have to achieve 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.590
 is the following we can only touch 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.060
 two chips and what we have to achieve 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:09.940
 is that we have two lines of color 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.900
 yellow and two red lines in 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:16.390
 vertical sense of this form if in 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.759
 this case we are having three lines 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.979
 of each one actually or six we're going 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.080
 to have to form four lines like that 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.830
 so they have an idea what they have 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.840
 What to achieve is to move to this position 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.179
 A) Yes 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.140
 and now it has to be this way and this 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:36.560
 without being like this and this way and this way and 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.560
 be like this 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.830
 the result that we have to find 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.540
 is this remember then that the 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.180
 slogan is that they can only touch 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.760
 two chips or two coins depending on what 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.800
 that they are using and try that all 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.410
 that line that are diagonal now it 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.200
 turn into four vertical lines 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.120
 one of a color another another color another of the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.400
 another color and another one of the other color as 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.290
 we saw in the drawing so if they want 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.110
 see the answer I'll be leaving 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.550
 in the description of the video and if they want 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.620
 see more videos of this we will be 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.680
 watching in another one video for everything 

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:15.390
 [Music] 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.400
 I will be leaving recommended too 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.989
 another video that we made in challenge you what 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.000
 I leave here on this side can happen 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.099
 visit either the two in this case 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.750
 I'm going to stop the escapist tapes that 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.400
 It's good and I'll leave you another one with coins 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.260
 what we did down here that is also 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.489
 very good to request and below 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.750
 we will always leave the list of 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.159
 reproduction to all games and 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.930
 challenges that we do in the channel 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.780
 remember that we are also working 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.280
 in our channels and we need your 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.870
 support in all those channels doing 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.849
 we neglect none we work at all 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.200
 equally and we do not have to focus 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.420
 in another because he is having less 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.000
 visits so on and so so 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.680
 it would be very good if it happens that he participates 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.419
 also participate in the channel is 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.770
 important because if not youtube is 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:56.050
 subscribe 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:59.550
 after two years 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.550
 see you next video
