00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hi chyvak and if you still have not played 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.319
 were born then less about than with you 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.780
 Reborn is a bunch of talk 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.570
 interesting stuff interesting for everyone 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.619
 and so on playing free reference for 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.170
 the game will be in the description hello my 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.020
 dear friends my name is sam and today 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.390
 you will see the rarest moments in the new 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.510
 fnaf parts in fnaf 4 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:32.579
 let shall find 3000 likes you as I 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.469
 such well done it is not rare though 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.890
 moment but still it is worth turning 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.770
 attention to the main menu we see a house with 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.230
 two floors although on the second floor we 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.579
 it seems never in a game not in 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.309
 mini-games have not been 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.129
 unless most likely it is sitting there 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.160
 plushdark as the room is very similar 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.760
 in the attic but why scott hides so 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.760
 this place 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.380
 It is very rare to hear sounds that 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:05.030
 very similar to those that were published 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.030
 sound box mongol 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.210
 but even more interesting is that if 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.760
 turn over 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.760
 Sound recording 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.270
 phone guy in the first part fnaf in 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.270
 first night 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:33.060
 and even more interesting is that it 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.520
 the only conversation in the whole game where 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.829
 mentioned about a bite 87 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.170
 it is that the child still survived very 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.750
 rarely appear near the bed 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.240
 medications like pills and 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.159
 droppers interesting what are they 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.500
 appear just as quickly 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.990
 suddenly disappears as that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.060
 pushes on the conclusion that these same 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.189
 items are part of reality 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.200
 which sometimes slips in mind 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.329
 boy who is in a coma 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.479
 which further hints that everything 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:10.190
 the events of the game are imagination but nevertheless 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.190
 this is not a dream and tacoma 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.740
 in the mini game after the third night 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.690
 If you click on the TV you can 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.540
 see advertising pizzerias framedbirs 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.760
 and friends in advertising can see pain not 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.000
 fuck foxy freddy who most likely 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.450
 at that time was still am Fredber 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 interesting date built pizzeria 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.950
 1983 besides in the same mini game we 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.350
 we meet children that one way or another 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.050
 in a way remind us animatronics 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.220
 for example, this girl plays with a collection 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.190
 that animatronics 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.560
 and this guy is very similar to the battle balloon 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.280
 does the same guy hold his hands 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.280
 plushtrap 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.490
 A package that has already become fnaf chips 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.670
 clicking on the nose of a teddy freesia we 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:03.700
 hear the clown whistle in the baby's room 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.790
 lots of pictures hanging and like i already 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.500
 suggested at the very beginning of the game they 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.480
 belong to scott cautona especially 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.310
 it is good to consider it only on 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.590
 the next two photos on 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.030
 photos he is with children and 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.520
 wife in a mini game after the first night 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.890
 can go into the room with the broken 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.350
 mangle that first hints at what 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.140
 the brazier most likely broke not children and 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.840
 brother of the bitten boy well and secondly 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.090
 in the room is unreal many pink 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.880
 that he is not a kaid on the fact that it was not 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.209
 brother's room as I thought earlier rather 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.940
 there lived a girl but girls 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.370
 was in the plot of the game but only if 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.770
 the girl was supposed to be a victim 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.970
 bite write in the comments what are you 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.970
 think about it 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.650
