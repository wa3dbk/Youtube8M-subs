controllers<00:00:20.970> on<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.090> market<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.480> work<00:00:21.660> with

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
controllers on the market that work with

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.640

we<00:00:25.650> didn't<00:00:25.859> try<00:00:26.010> mine<00:00:26.310> from<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> ground<00:00:26.789> up<00:00:26.970> so

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
we didn't try mine from the ground up so

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.490 
we didn't try mine from the ground up so
it's<00:00:27.300> not<00:00:27.449> kind<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.720> an<00:00:27.810> after<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.140> mash<00:00:28.289> mean

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
it's not kind of an after the mash mean

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.140 
it's not kind of an after the mash mean
it's<00:00:28.830> been<00:00:29.010> developed<00:00:29.340> around<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.699> software

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
it's been developed around the software

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.330 
it's been developed around the software
the<00:00:30.750> layout<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.289> very<00:00:31.320> sympathetic<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
the layout is very sympathetic to the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.860 
the layout is very sympathetic to the
software<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.820> color<00:00:33.030> scheme<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.540> buttons

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
software the color scheme of the buttons

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.470 
software the color scheme of the buttons
and<00:00:34.079> everything<00:00:34.170> else<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.829> designed<00:00:35.640> to

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
and everything else is designed to

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.360 
and everything else is designed to
really<00:00:36.840> work<00:00:36.989> one-on-one<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
really work one-on-one with the with the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.420 
really work one-on-one with the with the
software<00:00:39.410> typicals<00:00:40.410> down<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:40.739> construction

so<00:00:41.700> i<00:00:42.090> can<00:00:42.510> pick<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.750> up<00:00:42.930> you'll<00:00:43.110> see<00:00:43.170> that

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
so i can pick this up you'll see that

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.180 
so i can pick this up you'll see that
it's<00:00:43.559> got<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.770> solid<00:00:44.430> metals<00:00:45.230> sub<00:00:46.230> chassis<00:00:49.190> my

Beks<00:01:09.660> manual<00:01:10.660> and<00:01:10.780> also<00:01:11.080> looping<00:01:11.970> you've<00:01:12.970> got

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
Beks manual and also looping you've got

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.820 
Beks manual and also looping you've got
a<00:01:13.150> bank<00:01:13.330> here<00:01:13.570> of<00:01:13.750> four<00:01:13.990> hot<00:01:14.170> cues<00:01:14.440> which<00:01:14.650> will

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
a bank here of four hot cues which will

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.530 
a bank here of four hot cues which will
be<00:01:14.920> switched<00:01:15.160> over<00:01:15.340> to<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.730> tray<00:01:15.940> of<00:01:16.000> samplers

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
be switched over to the tray of samplers

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.960 
be switched over to the tray of samplers
as<00:01:16.690> well<00:01:17.010> so<00:01:18.010> we've<00:01:18.130> got<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.340> touch<00:01:18.520> sensitive

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
as well so we've got the touch sensitive

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.410 
as well so we've got the touch sensitive

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
jog wheels for vinyl life control we

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.180 
jog wheels for vinyl life control we
even<00:01:22.570> turn<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.870> vinyl<00:01:23.170> mode<00:01:23.320> off<00:01:23.470> here<00:01:23.770> I<00:01:23.950> mean

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
even turn the vinyl mode off here I mean

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.860 
even turn the vinyl mode off here I mean
this<00:01:24.280> just<00:01:24.400> becomes<00:01:24.730> a<00:01:24.850> big<00:01:24.880> pitch<00:01:25.450> rendering

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
this just becomes a big pitch rendering

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.520 
this just becomes a big pitch rendering
