getting stuff that you really like seems
to<00:03:25.280> be<00:03:25.400> low<00:03:25.700> instead<00:03:26.450> of<00:03:26.480> just<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.840> random

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
to be low instead of just the random

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.620 
to be low instead of just the random
stuff<00:03:27.740> so<00:03:27.950> for<00:03:28.130> like<00:03:28.220> if<00:03:28.370> this<00:03:28.520> was<00:03:28.580> all<00:03:28.910> Zelda
