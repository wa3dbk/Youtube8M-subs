00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.170
 I believe that in one day the being 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.170
 Luis Aranda 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.200
 good morning to all my friends from 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.780
 morning express welcome to chronicles 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.630
 I am Luis Aranda, we are going to 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.180
 make some very simple chiles today 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.850
 paris - stuffed shrimp and cheese are 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.760
 delicious the first thing we need 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.580
 they are chiles cuaresmeño we are going to 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.920
 open on one side and we will take them out 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.290
 the seeds and oats are going to 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.840
 put a couple of minutes on high heat in 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.430
 a pan with oil so they have a 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.370
 little cooking 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:54.370
 after this we will fill each 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.629
 one with a little cream cheese we're going to 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.080
 extend it a bit with this we are going to 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.080
 Fill 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.110
 remember that it is the chile that is used 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.660
 to make the jalapeño peppers and when 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.460
 are already pickled with cream cheese 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.770
 let's put some 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.100
 shrimp these are already ready to 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.210
 eat which are those used in the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.570
 cocktails are called shrimp 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.050
 We'll put a toothpick 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:26.750
 to fix it 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.750
 and we are going to fill in the following 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.549
 a little cream cheese 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.890
 Y 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.300
 a few shrimp 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:43.409
 now let's pass the stuffed peppers 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.409
 for beaten egg 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.400
 and then 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:56.640
 let's empathize with a mixture of 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:59.280
 chicharrón ground and of 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.790
 bread crumbs 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.080
 we tighten it very well so that it stays 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.080
 well glued the mixture 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.720
 let's put them 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.020
 in a pan 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.610
 with shallow oil we are going to put them 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.610
 first a little salt and pepper 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.050
 and now yes 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.050
 human oil 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.670
 they're ready, well done, we're going to 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.650
 put them a little on a plate with a 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.900
 paper towel to drain a 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.180
 little the oil they absorbed 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.250
 Now it is ready and as I would like 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.780
 to be able to say that with this we are going to 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.510
 enjoy the victory of the dolphins 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.700
 from Miami but they did not leave me out 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.500

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.379

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:19.079
 football saucer conscious at five 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.079
 senses we return to the study 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:26.610
 they look rich the truth after 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.610
 very finite mental 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.780
 decide you 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.900
 after sleeping but better than clear 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:41.830
 for 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:46.140
 and carbohydrates with pork rind instead of 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:56.430
 bread use the crackling to wash 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:57.870
 obviously they did not have a good face 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:04.370
 kilitos the truth 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.370
 if it is not so difficult preparing the 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.150
 demand the companies you put the 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.150
