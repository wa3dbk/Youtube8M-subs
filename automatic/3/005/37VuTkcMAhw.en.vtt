00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.879
 we should be on vacation I do not know about you 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.859
 but I'm having a great time of rock 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.420
 to the South American government 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.310
 the people have spoken alive the resistance 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.470
 push up the leader of the resistance 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.450
 a giant fan is a traitor 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.680
 scoundrel was trying to avoid 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.530
 that push more people to 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.119
 Giant fan ok is only a 10 such 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.920
 it seems that I bring a whole person 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.360
 this would be the hotel bartender that 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.430
 I would explain why my mojito was taking 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.350
 so much was your mouths horrifying with a 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.180
 deranged snake or I do that is a 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.949
 great I can no longer travel with you 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.050
 you are my feelings now both 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.370
 we're wrong they want a house in this 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.750
 case I think I should mention that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.370
 They have our suitcases with meat from 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.750
 orphans that I'm building a 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.670
 dragon of flesh and I will not settle for 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.290
 any meat you know forget it already 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.149
 it even surprises me to that is not 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.649
 fun this is like a rule for you 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.630
 card I will have to try harder 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.480
 next please I do not feel like you gave me 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.710
 a challenge is too late 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.690
 I have no idea what you call us 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.670
 we have known for three years 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.450
 and vice print you left me my name is 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.830
 because I said my name is Paul and 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.840
 I thought that woman why would you think 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.660
 that more than anything the hat is safe 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.950
 Of course I 'm good if you apologize 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.190
 I have to go to delete some pictures of me 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.190
 computer 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.580
 and those of the whole mud carpet that yes 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.320
 which is a well-finished disaster of 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.659
 clean yesterday I am not responsible 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.700
 I was playing the saxophone all day is 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.200
 Of course it's your carol prints then 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.600
 there is a loose impostor go directly 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.430
 towards you list number 1 the imposter is 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.430
 a ghost now stops vital 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.920
 happy birthday is not my tell me not 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.680
 you had nothing to do with this no 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:54.440
 too far from the city 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:56.150
 Melting with a mattress is funny 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.860
 and who laughs sure not the people 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.900
 that exploded I'm going I had enough 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.330
 but think of all the past faces 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.130
 that we can eat because we are 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.600
 friends and friendship is like two brothers 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.730
 eating a well-cooked face that's not 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.170
 friendship is sickly then maybe 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:14.290
 do not like your birthday decoration 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.290
 it's not even my for god surprise 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.350
 I'm sorry I think you liked the faces 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.210
 obviously a communication problem 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.100
 this is horrible 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.170
 you're right it seemed the best taste in 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.090
 my head but that I'm going to vomit hates is 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.250
 a goal I think it did not go very well you 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.080
 it seems expensive that I can say that there is 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.990
 it would be more cooked the raw faces give 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.700
 I disgust the problem because you thought this 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.080
 it would be a good idea maybe because I am 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.570
 a dangerous sociopath with a long 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.530
 history of violence or I do not understand 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.530
 as you always forget
