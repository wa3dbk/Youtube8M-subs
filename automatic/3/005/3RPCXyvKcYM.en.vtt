similar<00:00:19.070> but<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.189> just<00:00:20.340> think<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.699> our

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
similar but I just think that our

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.370 
similar but I just think that our
friends<00:00:21.210> he<00:00:21.300> just<00:00:21.510> got<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.779> bit<00:00:22.020> more<00:00:22.170> about

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
friends he just got a bit more about

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.340

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
Elysee is it was English and we couldn't

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.490 
Italian who doesn't speak that great
