skills<00:03:50.040> I've<00:03:50.250> gotta<00:03:50.430> do<00:03:50.610> that<00:03:50.820> and<00:03:51.360> learn<00:03:51.870> how

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
skills I've gotta do that and learn how

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.330 
skills I've gotta do that and learn how
to<00:03:52.080> work<00:03:52.320> with<00:03:52.500> my<00:03:52.650> hands<00:03:52.860> better<00:03:53.070> these<00:03:53.310> are

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
to work with my hands better these are

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.190 
to work with my hands better these are
my<00:03:53.610> hands<00:03:53.880> shouldn't<00:03:54.270> I<00:03:54.300> be<00:03:54.450> able<00:03:54.720> to<00:03:54.930> function

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
my hands shouldn't I be able to function

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.740 
my hands shouldn't I be able to function
with<00:03:55.530> them<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:55.920> any<00:03:56.700> little<00:03:57.120> workshop<00:03:57.510> could

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
with them so any little workshop could

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.690 
with them so any little workshop could
be<00:03:57.840> taught<00:03:58.020> here<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.260> believe<00:03:58.560> mm-hmm<00:03:59.220> well

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
be taught here I believe mm-hmm well

be taught here I believe mm-hmm well
from<00:04:00.120> how<00:04:00.990> to<00:04:01.050> grow<00:04:01.470> upon<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.430> how<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:02.910> build<00:04:03.240> a

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
from how to grow upon to how to build a

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.630 
from how to grow upon to how to build a
house<00:04:03.480> exactly

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
house exactly

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.570 
house exactly
so<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.820> overall<00:04:06.360> method<00:04:06.930> I'd<00:04:07.590> have<00:04:07.830> to<00:04:08.010> say<00:04:08.250> is

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
so the overall method I'd have to say is

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.280 
so the overall method I'd have to say is
that<00:04:09.000> it's<00:04:09.440> possible<00:04:10.910> you<00:04:11.910> can<00:04:12.090> do<00:04:12.209> it<00:04:12.360> anybody

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
that it's possible you can do it anybody

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.130 
that it's possible you can do it anybody
can<00:04:13.500> do<00:04:13.740> it<00:04:13.770> it's<00:04:14.400> great<00:04:14.670> it's<00:04:15.120> just<00:04:15.540> taking

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
can do it it's great it's just taking

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.990 
can do it it's great it's just taking
the<00:04:16.230> time<00:04:16.440> to<00:04:16.590> design<00:04:16.980> a<00:04:17.010> system<00:04:17.640> that's<00:04:17.850> going

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
the time to design a system that's going

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.800 
the time to design a system that's going
to<00:04:18.150> work<00:04:18.269> for<00:04:18.540> you

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.050 

what's<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.770> purpose<00:04:29.190> that<00:04:29.220> you<00:04:29.370> created<00:04:29.790> it

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
what's the purpose that you created it

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.430 
what's the purpose that you created it
just<00:04:30.810> decide<00:04:31.080> what's<00:04:31.410> possible<00:04:31.770> another<00:04:32.220> way
