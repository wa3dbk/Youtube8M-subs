00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.200 
do you have a choice scarf bite on it i
guess<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.760> element<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.149> surprise

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
guess it's the element of surprise

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.479 
guess it's the element of surprise
because<00:00:48.809> i<00:00:49.170> don't<00:00:49.590> think<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:49.860> anybody's

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
because i don't think like anybody's

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.819 
because i don't think like anybody's
expecting<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:52.079> i'm<00:00:52.469> gonna<00:00:52.590> go<00:00:52.710> my

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
expecting that but i'm gonna go my

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.470 
expecting that but i'm gonna go my
lectures<00:00:53.160> here<00:00:53.340> she<00:00:53.489> goes<00:00:53.640> into<00:00:53.879> banette<00:00:54.239> and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
lectures here she goes into banette and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.869 
lectures here she goes into banette and
she's<00:00:55.350> gonna<00:00:55.500> set<00:00:55.739> up<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.920> call<00:00:56.219> mine<00:00:56.430> now<00:00:56.610> I'm

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
she's gonna set up a call mine now I'm

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.700 
she's gonna set up a call mine now I'm
an<00:00:57.059> acid<00:00:57.449> spring<00:00:57.690> electro<00:00:58.079> switch<00:00:58.289> means<00:00:58.530> that

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
an acid spring electro switch means that

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.430 
an acid spring electro switch means that
on<00:00:58.890> as<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.760> go<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.030> an<00:01:00.090> acid<00:01:00.420> spray<00:01:00.660> she<00:01:01.140> gets<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
on as I go for an acid spray she gets a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.650 
on as I go for an acid spray she gets a
minus<00:01:01.770> 2<00:01:01.980> special<00:01:02.460> defense<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.090> that's

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
minus 2 special defense so that's

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.329 
minus 2 special defense so that's
perfect<00:01:03.930> because<00:01:04.260> now<00:01:04.500> she's<00:01:04.680> got<00:01:04.769> minus<00:01:05.010> 1

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
perfect because now she's got minus 1

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.340 
perfect because now she's got minus 1
i'm<00:01:06.090> thinking<00:01:06.479> she's<00:01:06.630> gonna<00:01:06.750> switch<00:01:07.020> out<00:01:07.140> for

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
i'm thinking she's gonna switch out for

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.380 
i'm thinking she's gonna switch out for
sure<00:01:07.530> because<00:01:07.740> electro<00:01:08.250> says<00:01:08.460> decent<00:01:09.060> bold<00:01:09.240> i

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
sure because electro says decent bold i

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.780 
sure because electro says decent bold i
mean<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.229> take<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.470> hit<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:10.860> sure<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.520> I

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
mean it can take a hit for sure but on I

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.320 
mean it can take a hit for sure but on I
guess<00:01:12.659> she<00:01:12.810> decides<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.470> stay<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.700> don't

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
guess she decides to stay in but I don't

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.620 
guess she decides to stay in but I don't
know<00:01:16.250> she<00:01:17.250> gets<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.490> critical<00:01:18.000> hit<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.509> that

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
know she gets a critical hit and that

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.300 
know she gets a critical hit and that
hurts<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.020> really<00:01:19.590> hurts<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:20.009> I'm<00:01:20.070> gonna<00:01:20.159> go

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
hurts that really hurts but I'm gonna go

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.830 
hurts that really hurts but I'm gonna go
for<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.520> assets<00:01:20.850> by<00:01:20.970> predicting<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> switch

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
for the assets by predicting the switch

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.990 
for the assets by predicting the switch
but<00:01:22.650> she<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:22.860> stays<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.430> she<00:01:23.610> wanted<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.880> kill

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
but she just stays in she wanted to kill

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.090 
but she just stays in she wanted to kill
off<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.270> guy<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.750> at<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.680> point<00:01:25.890> I'm<00:01:26.040> like

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
she's definitely go for another shadow

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.950 
she's definitely go for another shadow
ball<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.680> cannot<00:01:29.270> freely<00:01:30.270> bring<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.840> my

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.350 
ball and I cannot freely bring in my
miltank<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.460> that's<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.759> plan<00:01:32.970> right<00:01:33.000> here

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360

the<00:03:01.390> battle<00:03:01.690> sometimes<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.820> regardless<00:03:03.820> you

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
the battle sometimes and regardless you

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.560 
the battle sometimes and regardless you
know<00:03:04.810> even<00:03:05.350> if<00:03:05.470> I'm<00:03:05.740> like<00:03:05.800> +<00:03:06.190> 3<00:03:06.400> +<00:03:06.459> 4<00:03:06.640> no<00:03:07.240> tanks

know even if I'm like + 3 + 4 no tanks

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.880 
know even if I'm like + 3 + 4 no tanks
that<00:03:07.660> going<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:07.870> one<00:03:07.990> hit<00:03:08.140> KO<00:03:08.290> too<00:03:08.530> many<00:03:08.680> things

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
that going to one hit KO too many things

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.740 
that going to one hit KO too many things
unless<00:03:09.160> they're<00:03:09.430> like<00:03:09.580> really<00:03:09.730> frail<00:03:10.120> so<00:03:10.720> I

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
damage on it so absolute can hopefully

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.530 
damage on it so absolute can hopefully
come<00:03:32.410> in<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.680> kill<00:03:32.800> it<00:03:32.920> off<00:03:33.180> what<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.209> could

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
come in and kill it off what I could

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.910 
come in and kill it off what I could
have<00:03:34.570> done<00:03:34.660> is<00:03:34.870> gone<00:03:35.050> for<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.260> acid<00:03:35.530> spray<00:03:35.709> but

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
have done is gone for the acid spray but

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.979 
have done is gone for the acid spray but
at<00:03:35.980> this<00:03:36.100> point<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.489> didn't<00:03:36.640> see<00:03:36.880> I'll<00:03:37.540> at<00:03:37.780> this

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
at this point I didn't see I'll at this

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.810 
at this point I didn't see I'll at this
point<00:03:38.410> I<00:03:38.590> didn't<00:03:38.800> like<00:03:38.950> see<00:03:39.160> that<00:03:39.640> it<00:03:39.730> was

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
point I didn't like see that it was

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.370 
point I didn't like see that it was
helpful<00:03:40.060> because<00:03:40.360> she<00:03:40.630> still<00:03:40.900> would<00:03:40.989> be<00:03:41.019> +1

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
helpful because she still would be +1

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.530 
helpful because she still would be +1
which<00:03:42.130> would<00:03:42.340> still<00:03:42.580> hurt<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:42.910> I'd<00:03:43.150> rather<00:03:43.299> to

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
which would still hurt and I'd rather to

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.520 
which would still hurt and I'd rather to
get<00:03:43.660> some<00:03:43.810> damage<00:03:44.110> on<00:03:44.200> it<00:03:44.350> hopefully

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
get some damage on it hopefully

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.509 
get some damage on it hopefully
hopefully<00:03:45.400> absol<00:03:46.330> can<00:03:46.510> kill<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.380> off<00:03:47.519> but

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
hopefully absol can kill it off but

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.400 
hopefully absol can kill it off but
perhaps<00:03:49.330> what<00:03:49.630> kind<00:03:49.840> of<00:03:49.870> fails<00:03:50.080> at<00:03:50.170> that<00:03:50.290> I'm

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
perhaps what kind of fails at that I'm

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.650 
perhaps what kind of fails at that I'm
not<00:03:50.560> life<00:03:50.769> four<00:03:51.010> of<00:03:51.070> them<00:03:51.220> mom<00:03:51.940> Barry<00:03:52.209> that's

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
not life four of them mom Barry that's

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.080 
not life four of them mom Barry that's
probably<00:03:52.930> why<00:03:53.280> but<00:03:54.280> she<00:03:54.310> goes<00:03:54.580> to<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:54.730> energy

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
probably why but she goes to the energy

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.759 
probably why but she goes to the energy
ball<00:03:55.269> and<00:03:55.540> I'm<00:03:55.630> like<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:56.080> know<00:03:56.110> why<00:03:56.500> do<00:03:56.560> you

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
ball and I'm like you know why do you

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.440 
ball and I'm like you know why do you
have<00:03:56.920> energy<00:03:57.100> ball<00:03:57.430> like<00:03:57.610> hidden<00:03:58.299> power

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
have energy ball like hidden power

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.420 
have energy ball like hidden power
fighting<00:03:58.810> would<00:03:58.930> have<00:03:59.019> probably<00:03:59.560> done<00:03:59.769> work

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
fighting would have probably done work

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.070 
fighting would have probably done work
on<00:04:00.610> my<00:04:00.730> middle<00:04:00.940> tank<00:04:01.150> after<00:04:01.390> plus<00:04:01.690> three<00:04:01.959> or

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
on my middle tank after plus three or

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.990 
on my middle tank after plus three or
whatever<00:04:02.170> she<00:04:02.440> was<00:04:02.799> definitely<00:04:03.730> would<00:04:03.970> have

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
whatever she was definitely would have

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.820 
whatever she was definitely would have
one<00:04:04.209> shot<00:04:04.390> the<00:04:04.600> absol<00:04:05.019> you<00:04:05.320> know<00:04:05.410> you<00:04:05.500> should

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
one shot the absol you know you should

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.830 
one shot the absol you know you should
not<00:04:05.950> be<00:04:06.130> running<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.580> share<00:04:07.269> ball<00:04:07.510> him<00:04:07.660> power

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
not be running that share ball him power

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.500 
not be running that share ball him power
fighting<00:04:08.230> is<00:04:08.320> just<00:04:08.650> perfect<00:04:09.070> but<00:04:09.880> um<00:04:10.060> she

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
fighting is just perfect but um she

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.880 
fighting is just perfect but um she
brings<00:04:10.720> in<00:04:10.840> krookodile<00:04:11.230> now<00:04:11.410> after<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:11.680> kill

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
brings in krookodile now after I kill

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.160 
brings in krookodile now after I kill
off<00:04:12.040> that<00:04:12.310> fat<00:04:12.940> gorgeous<00:04:13.239> as<00:04:13.480> I<00:04:13.810> bring<00:04:14.019> in

off that fat gorgeous as I bring in
gligar<00:04:14.470> now<00:04:15.280> I'm<00:04:15.400> thinking<00:04:15.580> why<00:04:15.970> not<00:04:16.209> just

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
gligar now I'm thinking why not just

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.180 
gligar now I'm thinking why not just
staying<00:04:16.720> here<00:04:16.930> I<00:04:16.959> can<00:04:17.169> get<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.350> toxic<00:04:17.739> off<00:04:17.919> if

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
staying here I can get a toxic off if

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.740 
staying here I can get a toxic off if
she's<00:04:18.400> playing<00:04:18.640> to<00:04:18.760> saying<00:04:19.000> I'm<00:04:19.209> perfectly

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
she's playing to saying I'm perfectly

she's playing to saying I'm perfectly
okay<00:04:19.840> with<00:04:20.080> that<00:04:20.520> I<00:04:21.520> can<00:04:21.910> get<00:04:22.030> a<00:04:22.060> toxic<00:04:22.390> off<00:04:22.570> i

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
okay with that I can get a toxic off i

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.029 
okay with that I can get a toxic off i
can<00:04:22.780> i<00:04:22.870> can<00:04:22.930> just<00:04:23.169> roost<00:04:23.440> all<00:04:23.650> it<00:04:23.770> maybe<00:04:23.950> they

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
can i can just roost all it maybe they

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.879 
can i can just roost all it maybe they

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.200 
because most of the time I wouldn't
really<00:04:29.199> care<00:04:29.499> for<00:04:29.860> toxic<00:04:30.370> on<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.520> scarf<00:04:30.849> ER<00:04:31.030> but

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
really care for toxic on a scarf ER but

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.999 
really care for toxic on a scarf ER but
she's<00:04:32.050> just<00:04:32.199> gonna<00:04:32.379> stay<00:04:32.620> and<00:04:32.740> go<00:04:32.830> for<00:04:32.979> the

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
she's just gonna stay and go for the

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:34.200 
she's just gonna stay and go for the
crunches<00:04:33.400> I<00:04:33.490> guess<00:04:33.669> she's<00:04:33.879> trying<00:04:34.060> to<00:04:34.120> get

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
crunches I guess she's trying to get

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.149 
crunches I guess she's trying to get
defense<00:04:35.050> jobs<00:04:35.259> to<00:04:35.439> the<00:04:35.560> point<00:04:35.770> where<00:04:35.889> she<00:04:36.009> can

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159 
defense jobs to the point where she can

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.309 
defense jobs to the point where she can
two<00:04:36.490> two<00:04:36.639> three<00:04:36.669> hit<00:04:36.939> KO<00:04:37.120> me<00:04:37.330> but<00:04:37.930> I<00:04:37.960> believe

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
two two three hit KO me but I believe

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.869 
two two three hit KO me but I believe
she<00:04:38.469> only<00:04:38.560> has<00:04:38.710> one<00:04:38.740> defense<00:04:39.249> champ<00:04:39.520> here<00:04:39.669> so<00:04:39.849> I

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:39.879 
she only has one defense champ here so I

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:40.950 
she only has one defense champ here so I
mean<00:04:39.939> she'd<00:04:40.180> have<00:04:40.210> speed<00:04:40.509> this<00:04:40.599> product

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
mean she'd have speed this product

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.989 
mean she'd have speed this product
because<00:04:41.050> it<00:04:41.229> is<00:04:41.409> stalling<00:04:41.819> basically<00:04:42.819> what<00:04:42.969> I

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:42.999 
because it is stalling basically what I

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:44.670 
because it is stalling basically what I
do<00:04:43.090> here<00:04:43.419> is<00:04:43.479> get<00:04:43.659> on<00:04:43.779> my<00:04:43.870> stealth<00:04:44.139> rocks<00:04:44.379> as

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
do here is get on my stealth rocks as

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.739 
do here is get on my stealth rocks as
she<00:04:44.979> just<00:04:45.159> keeps<00:04:45.310> on<00:04:45.430> crunching<00:04:45.819> me<00:04:45.939> barely

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:46.749 
she just keeps on crunching me barely

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:49.409 
she just keeps on crunching me barely
