you<00:02:09.630> can't<00:02:09.869> do<00:02:10.080> anything<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.860> hurts<00:02:11.819> itself<00:02:12.120> in

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
you can't do anything so hurts itself in

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.770 
you can't do anything so hurts itself in
confusion<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.940> diana's<00:02:14.940> confused<00:02:15.390> use

omastar but doesn't matter if it's
almost<00:04:02.379> always<00:04:02.650> special<00:04:03.160> so<00:04:04.319> knocks<00:04:05.319> out

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
almost always special so knocks out

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.140 
almost always special so knocks out
Karen<00:04:05.980> but<00:04:06.160> he<00:04:06.250> survived<00:04:06.580> pretty<00:04:06.819> well<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.030> he

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
Karen but he survived pretty well and he

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.240 
Karen but he survived pretty well and he
is<00:04:07.180> definitely<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:07.720> MVP<00:04:08.160> wouldn't<00:04:09.160> have

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
is definitely the MVP wouldn't have

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.770 
is definitely the MVP wouldn't have
survived<00:04:09.519> without<00:04:09.670> him<00:04:10.000> because<00:04:10.180> then<00:04:10.330> de

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
survived without him because then de

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.979 
survived without him because then de
algun<00:04:11.140> and<00:04:11.549> regigigas<00:04:12.549> would<00:04:12.970> take<00:04:13.180> out<00:04:13.390> a

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
algun and regigigas would take out a

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.409 
algun and regigigas would take out a
bunch<00:04:14.739> of<00:04:14.829> my<00:04:14.950> guys<00:04:15.160> well<00:04:15.700> not<00:04:15.819> Reggie<00:04:16.060> gigas

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
bunch of my guys well not Reggie gigas

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.699 
bunch of my guys well not Reggie gigas
but<00:04:17.310> dialga<00:04:18.310> would<00:04:18.519> so<00:04:19.320> sand<00:04:20.320> storm<00:04:20.530> subsided

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
but dialga would so sand storm subsided

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.780 
but dialga would so sand storm subsided

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
and D August snaps out of confusion but

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.270 
and D August snaps out of confusion but
he's<00:04:36.820> his<00:04:36.970> flamethrower<00:04:37.210> and<00:04:38.039> doesn't<00:04:39.039> affect

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.610 
he's his flamethrower and doesn't affect
bronzong<00:04:39.729> protected<00:04:40.630> and<00:04:40.810> they<00:04:41.229> use<00:04:41.350> lava

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
bronzong protected and they use lava

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.590 
bronzong protected and they use lava
plume<00:04:41.949> and<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.639> ironic<00:04:43.120> thing<00:04:43.150> is<00:04:43.330> the<00:04:43.510> only

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
plume and the ironic thing is the only

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.890 
plume and the ironic thing is the only
one<00:04:43.750> who<00:04:43.840> actually<00:04:43.990> goes<00:04:44.260> down<00:04:44.560> is<00:04:45.210> dialga<00:04:46.210> but

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
one who actually goes down is dialga but

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.480 
one who actually goes down is dialga but
I<00:04:46.930> was<00:04:47.110> going<00:04:47.289> to<00:04:47.410> use<00:04:47.530> surf<00:04:47.770> on<00:04:48.010> it<00:04:48.160> anyway<00:04:48.460> so

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
I was going to use surf on it anyway so

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.330 
I was going to use surf on it anyway so
it<00:04:48.910> hardly<00:04:49.240> mattered<00:04:49.750> so<00:04:50.190> basically<00:04:51.190> just

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
it hardly mattered so basically just

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.950 
it hardly mattered so basically just
kills<00:04:51.760> his<00:04:51.970> own<00:04:52.090> teammate<00:04:52.600> smart<00:04:53.590> and<00:04:54.600> then<00:04:55.600> i

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
kills his own teammate smart and then i

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.010 
kills his own teammate smart and then i
use<00:04:56.380> surf<00:04:56.710> and<00:04:57.150> it's<00:04:58.150> really<00:04:58.389> powerful<00:04:58.840> from

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
use surf and it's really powerful from

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.560 
use surf and it's really powerful from
omastar<00:04:59.349> he<00:04:59.710> has<00:04:59.860> a<00:05:00.130> lot<00:05:00.669> of<00:05:00.700> attack<00:05:01.270> power

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
omastar he has a lot of attack power

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.690 
omastar he has a lot of attack power
behind<00:05:01.900> that<00:05:02.139> and<00:05:02.349> it<00:05:02.860> easily<00:05:03.280> knocks<00:05:03.490> out

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
behind that and it easily knocks out

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.719 
behind that and it easily knocks out
Heatran<00:05:04.150> because<00:05:04.419> it's<00:05:04.570> super<00:05:04.690> effective<00:05:04.930> and

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
Heatran because it's super effective and

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.339 
Heatran because it's super effective and
so<00:05:06.729> yeah<00:05:06.910> so<00:05:07.419> they<00:05:07.510> only<00:05:07.570> have<00:05:07.780> two<00:05:07.930> guys<00:05:08.050> left

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
so yeah so they only have two guys left

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.640 
so yeah so they only have two guys left
they<00:05:08.530> have<00:05:08.849> regigigas<00:05:09.849> who<00:05:10.440> since<00:05:11.440> slow

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
they have regigigas who since slow

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.320 
they have regigigas who since slow
starters<00:05:11.979> activated<00:05:12.460> won't<00:05:12.669> do<00:05:12.820> much<00:05:12.970> at<00:05:13.210> all

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
starters activated won't do much at all

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.379 
starters activated won't do much at all
and<00:05:13.630> then<00:05:14.229> a<00:05:14.620> mystery<00:05:15.310> Pokemon<00:05:15.820> I<00:05:15.849> wonder<00:05:16.270> who

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.560 
and then a mystery Pokemon I wonder who
it<00:05:16.510> could<00:05:16.539> be<00:05:17.940> actually<00:05:18.940> I<00:05:19.000> don't<00:05:19.090> but<00:05:19.389> I'm

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
it could be actually I don't but I'm

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.810 
it could be actually I don't but I'm
sure<00:05:19.630> you<00:05:19.930> guys<00:05:20.110> are<00:05:20.349> so<00:05:21.130> they<00:05:22.000> send<00:05:22.330> out<00:05:22.479> there

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
slow start is still in effect because he

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.909 
slow start is still in effect because he

array<00:05:46.949> which<00:05:47.190> means<00:05:47.460> you<00:05:47.580> probably<00:05:47.610> just

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
array which means you probably just

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.339 
array which means you probably just
caught<00:05:48.300> it<00:05:48.509> or<00:05:48.690> it<00:05:48.810> just<00:05:48.840> doesn't<00:05:49.020> know<00:05:49.319> how

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
caught it or it just doesn't know how

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.100 
caught it or it just doesn't know how
it's<00:05:49.680> supposed<00:05:49.889> to<00:05:49.979> work<00:05:50.060> so<00:05:51.060> yeah<00:05:51.720> doesn't

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
it's supposed to work so yeah doesn't

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.620 
it's supposed to work so yeah doesn't
matter<00:05:52.199> cuz<00:05:52.860> omastar<00:05:53.370> broke<00:05:53.970> through<00:05:54.330> and

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630 
matter cuz omastar broke through and

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.659 
matter cuz omastar broke through and
uses<00:05:55.169> sir<00:05:55.490> so<00:05:56.490> basically<00:05:57.330> regigigas<00:05:58.490> has<00:05:59.490> no

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
uses sir so basically regigigas has no

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.879 
uses sir so basically regigigas has no
HP<00:05:59.849> and<00:06:00.419> Blaziken<00:06:00.900> easily<00:06:01.289> gets<00:06:01.470> knocked<00:06:01.650> out

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
HP and Blaziken easily gets knocked out

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.219 
HP and Blaziken easily gets knocked out
by<00:06:02.099> it<00:06:02.160> because<00:06:02.400> surf<00:06:03.300> does<00:06:03.569> is<00:06:03.900> super

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 
by it because surf does is super

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:07.580 
by it because surf does is super
