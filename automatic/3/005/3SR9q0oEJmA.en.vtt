going to leave with the durand arose who
since<00:00:24.570> it's<00:00:24.750> probably<00:00:25.019> scarf<00:00:25.380> judging<00:00:25.740> by<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
since it's probably scarf judging by the

since it's probably scarf judging by the
skirt<00:00:26.220> was<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.789> rest<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.119> his<00:00:27.210> team<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.750> um<00:00:28.050> it

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
skirt was the rest of his team and um it

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.470 
skirt was the rest of his team and um it
could<00:00:29.130> do<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> lot<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.550> damage<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.939> everything

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
could do a lot of damage to everything

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.330 
could do a lot of damage to everything
except<00:00:30.929> not<00:00:31.080> re<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.619> I'm<00:00:31.800> gonna<00:00:31.949> leave<00:00:32.189> would

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
except not re so I'm gonna leave would

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.979 
except not re so I'm gonna leave would
not<00:00:32.520> tolerate<00:00:32.669> knowing<00:00:33.510> he's<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.899> go

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
not tolerate knowing he's going to go

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.450 
not tolerate knowing he's going to go
for<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.200> u-turn<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.800> could<00:00:34.980> get<00:00:35.130> off<00:00:35.219> some

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
for the u-turn so I could get off some

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.580 
for the u-turn so I could get off some
quick<00:00:35.700> steel<00:00:35.940> doors<00:00:36.210> damage<00:00:36.660> which<00:00:37.320> may<00:00:37.559> not

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
quick steel doors damage which may not

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.410 
quick steel doors damage which may not
seem<00:00:37.980> like<00:00:38.010> too<00:00:38.309> much<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.879> need<00:00:39.059> all<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
seem like too much but I need all the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.150 
seem like too much but I need all the
all<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.750> damage<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.469> thing<00:00:40.770> as<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.980> can

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
all the damage on that thing as I can

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.639 
all the damage on that thing as I can
get<00:00:41.370> since<00:00:41.760> um<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.960> could<00:00:43.079> take<00:00:43.260> some<00:00:43.440> hints

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
get since um it could take some hints

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.619 
get since um it could take some hints
from<00:00:43.739> door<00:00:43.980> use<00:00:44.190> which<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.579> pretty<00:00:44.760> bad<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.360> I

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
from door use which is pretty bad so I

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.139 
from door use which is pretty bad so I
predicted<00:00:46.620> tyranitar<00:00:47.219> switchin<00:00:47.640> go<00:00:47.850> for<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
predicted tyranitar switchin go for the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.700 
predicted tyranitar switchin go for the
power<00:00:48.390> wave<00:00:48.539> but<00:00:48.719> he<00:00:48.780> goes<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> chomp<00:00:49.469> which

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
power wave but he goes to a chomp which

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.069 
power wave but he goes to a chomp which
is<00:00:49.829> like<00:00:49.980> whatever<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:50.969> saw<00:00:51.239> leftover<00:00:51.809> sleep

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
is like whatever so I saw leftover sleep

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.720 
is like whatever so I saw leftover sleep
and<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.500> thought<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.949> might<00:00:52.980> want<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.430> go<00:00:53.520> for

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
and I thought you might want to go for

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.340 
and I thought you might want to go for
his<00:00:53.820> old<00:00:53.969> stuff<00:00:54.300> rock<00:00:54.570> but<00:00:54.780> he<00:00:54.960> actually<00:00:55.110> goes

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
his old stuff rock but he actually goes

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.740 
his old stuff rock but he actually goes
for<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> sub<00:00:55.980> which<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.940> bad<00:00:57.149> cuz<00:00:57.420> now<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> know

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
for the sub which is bad cuz now I know

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.750 
for the sub which is bad cuz now I know
he's<00:00:58.020> going<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.530> swords<00:00:58.949> dance<00:00:59.129> for<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> fact

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
he's going to swords dance for a fact

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.090 
he's going to swords dance for a fact
but<00:01:00.239> um<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:01.260> really<00:01:01.320> nothing<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.859> could<00:01:02.010> do

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
but um it's really nothing I could do

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.460 
but um it's really nothing I could do
except<00:01:02.430> for<00:01:02.609> break<00:01:02.760> his<00:01:02.940> sub<00:01:03.210> let<00:01:04.019> him<00:01:04.140> kill<00:01:04.350> my

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
except for break his sub let him kill my

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.240 
except for break his sub let him kill my
not<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.799> Ray<00:01:04.949> maybe<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:06.060> um<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.710> don't<00:01:07.710> think<00:01:08.040> he

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
not to Ray maybe but um I don't think he

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.920 
not to Ray maybe but um I don't think he
has<00:01:08.400> fire<00:01:08.670> thing<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.240> might<00:01:09.479> be<00:01:09.689> able<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
has fire thing so I might be able to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.050 
has fire thing so I might be able to
take<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> hit<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.619> kill<00:01:11.010> him<00:01:11.130> off<00:01:11.250> eventually

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
take a hit and kill him off eventually

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.570 
take a hit and kill him off eventually
so<00:01:12.600> um<00:01:12.840> there's<00:01:13.409> no<00:01:13.650> sense<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.159> I'm<00:01:14.310> probably

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
so um there's no sense so I'm probably

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.730 
so um there's no sense so I'm probably
not<00:01:14.880> gonna<00:01:15.000> miss<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.390> gyro<00:01:15.630> ball<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.590> he

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
not gonna miss with gyro ball and he

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.170 
not gonna miss with gyro ball and he
might<00:01:16.950> know<00:01:17.340> he's<00:01:17.549> not<00:01:17.700> reading<00:01:17.850> bright

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
might know he's not reading bright

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.999 
might know he's not reading bright
Patrick<00:01:18.509> since<00:01:18.659> he<00:01:18.750> got<00:01:18.869> leftovers<00:01:19.500> obviously

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
Patrick since he got leftovers obviously

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.370 
Patrick since he got leftovers obviously
but<00:01:20.310> yeah<00:01:21.210> his<00:01:21.509> other<00:01:21.659> moves<00:01:21.930> probably<00:01:22.259> gonna

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
but yeah his other moves probably gonna

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.050 
but yeah his other moves probably gonna
be<00:01:22.530> Dragon<00:01:22.920> Claw<00:01:23.130> or<00:01:23.340> outraged<00:01:23.790> and

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
be Dragon Claw or outraged and

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.050 
be Dragon Claw or outraged and
earthquake<00:01:24.570> four<00:01:24.990> steps<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.560> I'm<00:01:26.220> safe<00:01:26.549> here<00:01:26.580> I

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
earthquake four steps so I'm safe here I

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.670 
earthquake four steps so I'm safe here I
don't<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.780> worry<00:01:27.930> about<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.200> fire<00:01:28.409> Fang

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680

it's<00:01:31.350> pretty<00:01:31.380> good<00:01:31.710> cuz<00:01:32.280> now<00:01:32.460> Garchomp<00:01:32.759> is

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
it's pretty good cuz now Garchomp is

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.810 
it's pretty good cuz now Garchomp is
dead<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:34.110> he<00:01:34.590> goes<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.740> tyranitar<00:01:35.549> I'm

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
dead so he goes to tyranitar I'm

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.030 
dead so he goes to tyranitar I'm
predicting<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.780> fire<00:01:37.049> move<00:01:37.350> probably<00:01:37.770> Fire

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
predicting the fire move probably Fire

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.490 
predicting the fire move probably Fire
Blast<00:01:38.250> since<00:01:38.610> pretty<00:01:39.360> much<00:01:39.479> every<00:01:39.930> tyranitar

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
Blast since pretty much every tyranitar

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.499 
Blast since pretty much every tyranitar
you<00:01:40.619> see<00:01:40.799> now<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.130> mixed<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.150> I'm<00:01:42.210> gonna<00:01:42.329> go

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
you see now is mixed so I'm gonna go

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.359 
you see now is mixed so I'm gonna go
into<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.869> earth<00:01:43.049> Garchomp<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.920> resist<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
into that earth Garchomp to resist the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.920 
into that earth Garchomp to resist the
fire<00:01:44.579> move<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:44.970> he<00:01:45.030> goes<00:01:45.180> for<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.420> sub<00:01:45.720> which

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
fire move but he goes for the sub which

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.319 
fire move but he goes for the sub which
really<00:01:46.350> really<00:01:46.619> scared<00:01:47.070> me<00:01:47.130> since<00:01:47.939> if<00:01:48.149> he's

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
really really scared me since if he's

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.510 
really really scared me since if he's
running<00:01:48.630> bow<00:01:48.810> with<00:01:49.110> ice<00:01:49.350> beam<00:01:49.619> I'm<00:01:50.070> gonna<00:01:50.340> get

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
running bow with ice beam I'm gonna get

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.940 
running bow with ice beam I'm gonna get
wrecked<00:01:50.850> right<00:01:51.149> here<00:01:51.360> but<00:01:51.899> luckily<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.409> see<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
wrecked right here but luckily I see the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.100 
wrecked right here but luckily I see the
focus<00:01:53.310> punch<00:01:53.549> which<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.540> sigh<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.750> relief

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
focus punch which is the sigh of relief

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.510 
focus punch which is the sigh of relief
because<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.500> know<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.680> could<00:01:55.860> take<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> couple<00:01:56.130> of

because I know I could take a couple of

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.340 
because I know I could take a couple of
those<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.930> scare<00:01:57.930> him<00:01:57.990> off<00:01:58.079> with<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
those and scare him off with the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.760 
those and scare him off with the
earthquake<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.969> know<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.899> know<00:02:01.320> he<00:02:01.590> knows

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
earthquake and I know I know he knows

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.499 
earthquake and I know I know he knows
what<00:02:01.950> he's<00:02:02.100> doing<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.520> he's<00:02:02.670> gonna<00:02:02.880> know<00:02:03.149> he

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
what he's doing so he's gonna know he

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.590 
what he's doing so he's gonna know he
needs<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.899> ranit<00:02:04.200> are<00:02:04.350> for<00:02:04.560> my<00:02:04.710> ragu<00:02:05.700> russu<00:02:06.060> so

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
needs to ranit are for my ragu russu so

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.670 
needs to ranit are for my ragu russu so
he's<00:02:06.719> gonna<00:02:06.960> have<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.320> predict<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
he's gonna have to predict the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.400 
he's gonna have to predict the
earthquake<00:02:08.640> again<00:02:08.970> switch<00:02:09.629> out<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.080> save<00:02:10.289> his

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
earthquake again switch out to save his

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.440 
earthquake again switch out to save his
tyranitar<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.220> know<00:02:11.580> what<00:02:11.940> he's<00:02:12.030> going<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.300> do

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
tyranitar I know what he's going to do

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.710 
tyranitar I know what he's going to do
so

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
so

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.510

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
go for the outrage and that just made me

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.000 
go for the outrage and that just made me
look<00:02:14.640> like<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.850> pro<00:02:15.210> so<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:16.050> rent<00:02:16.350> that<00:02:16.680> Randi

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
look like a pro so that rent that Randi

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.560

Rousseau that I was worried about is no
longer<00:02:18.840> anything<00:02:19.440> so<00:02:20.010> that's<00:02:20.700> pretty<00:02:20.940> good

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.740 
could either kill him off with a fire
frame<00:02:31.680> or<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.370> don't<00:02:32.700> know<00:02:32.910> probably<00:02:33.360> not<00:02:33.540> kill

damage but I hurt myself in confusion
which<00:02:38.010> isn't<00:02:38.310> really<00:02:38.340> too<00:02:38.670> bad<00:02:38.850> since

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
which isn't really too bad since

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.080 
which isn't really too bad since
whenever<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:40.050> see<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.260> not<00:02:40.470> sorry<00:02:40.770> um<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.790> pretty

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
whenever I see a not sorry um I pretty

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.900 
whenever I see a not sorry um I pretty
much<00:02:42.180> see<00:02:42.620> this<00:02:43.620> rocky<00:02:43.920> Russo<00:02:44.160> said<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.700> fodder

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
much see this rocky Russo said of fodder

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.449 
much see this rocky Russo said of fodder
so<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.540> know<00:02:46.050> he's<00:02:46.290> gonna<00:02:46.440> go<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.740> latio<00:02:47.160> since

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
so I know he's gonna go to latio since

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.730 
so I know he's gonna go to latio since
he<00:02:47.580> knows<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.510> rat<00:02:48.870> crews<00:02:49.200> who<00:02:49.320> can't<00:02:49.590> do

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
he knows that rat crews who can't do

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.740 
he knows that rat crews who can't do
anything<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:50.250> larios<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:51.120> I'm<00:02:51.209> gonna<00:02:51.360> double

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
anything to larios so I'm gonna double

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.199 
anything to larios so I'm gonna double
switch<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.140> go<00:02:52.290> out<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.440> my<00:02:52.709> tyranitar<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.760> he

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
switch and go out to my tyranitar and he

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.910 
switch and go out to my tyranitar and he
does<00:02:54.420> go<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.840> latio<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.410> that's<00:02:55.560> really

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
does go to the latio so that's really

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.699 
does go to the latio so that's really
really<00:02:56.220> good<00:02:56.310> for<00:02:56.580> me<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:56.940> here<00:02:57.720> he<00:02:57.750> said<00:02:58.380> he

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
really good for me and here he said he

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.260 
really good for me and here he said he
thought<00:02:58.740> my<00:02:59.100> Tyranitar<00:02:59.610> Hyper<00:02:59.640> suit<00:03:00.120> but

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
thought my Tyranitar Hyper suit but

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.660 
thought my Tyranitar Hyper suit but
actually<00:03:00.630> don't<00:03:00.840> run<00:03:01.020> pursuit<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.340> go<00:03:02.490> for

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
actually don't run pursuit and I go for

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.580 
actually don't run pursuit and I go for
the<00:03:02.730> crunch<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.240> that's<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.660> dead<00:03:03.840> latigo<00:03:04.230> so

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.500 
art wait don't I reddit are still alive
I<00:03:51.030> think<00:03:51.269> so<00:03:51.680> yeah<00:03:52.680> well<00:03:53.310> at<00:03:53.670> least<00:03:53.730> at<00:03:54.239> this

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
I think so yeah well at least at this

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.420 
I think so yeah well at least at this
point<00:03:54.630> all<00:03:55.049> he<00:03:55.170> all<00:03:55.500> he<00:03:55.650> wants<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:55.920> do<00:03:56.100> is<00:03:56.220> like

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
point all he all he wants to do is like

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.970 
point all he all he wants to do is like
bringing<00:03:56.940> his<00:03:57.209> tyranitar<00:03:57.810> safely<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.470> go<00:03:58.830> ahead

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
bringing his tyranitar safely I go ahead

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.740 
bringing his tyranitar safely I go ahead
and<00:03:59.130> kill<00:03:59.220> him<00:03:59.400> off<00:03:59.489> with<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.790> focus<00:04:00.239> blast<00:04:00.420> so

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
and kill him off with the focus blast so

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.229 
and kill him off with the focus blast so
that's<00:04:01.440> pretty<00:04:01.650> good<00:04:01.860> so<00:04:02.580> I<00:04:02.610> think<00:04:02.790> he's<00:04:03.030> got

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
that's pretty good so I think he's got

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.690 
that's pretty good so I think he's got
two<00:04:03.450> left<00:04:03.720> which<00:04:04.049> would<00:04:04.320> be<00:04:04.489> tyranitar<00:04:05.489> in<00:04:05.580> his

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
two left which would be tyranitar in his

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.080 
two left which would be tyranitar in his
report<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:07.410> was<00:04:08.220> hoping<00:04:08.519> he'd<00:04:08.670> go<00:04:08.820> for<00:04:08.850> the

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
report and I was hoping he'd go for the

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.240 
report and I was hoping he'd go for the
crunch<00:04:09.360> but<00:04:09.660> he's<00:04:09.900> he's<00:04:10.320> not<00:04:10.350> that<00:04:10.799> dumb<00:04:10.860> he's

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
crunch but he's he's not that dumb he's

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.300 
crunch but he's he's not that dumb he's
he<00:04:11.790> knows<00:04:12.000> his<00:04:12.269> best<00:04:12.480> chances<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.380> to<00:04:13.980> make<00:04:14.160> me

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
he knows his best chances to to make me

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.400 
he knows his best chances to to make me
miss<00:04:14.549> with<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.880> substitute<00:04:15.480> stall<00:04:15.750> so

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
miss with the substitute stall so

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.890 
miss with the substitute stall so
luckily<00:04:17.040> I<00:04:17.160> hit<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.430> first<00:04:17.669> one<00:04:17.880> but<00:04:18.120> this

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
luckily I hit the first one but this

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.719 
luckily I hit the first one but this
really<00:04:19.109> isn't<00:04:19.320> gonna<00:04:19.530> turn<00:04:19.769> out<00:04:19.890> too<00:04:20.310> good<00:04:20.340> for

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
really isn't gonna turn out too good for

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.460 
really isn't gonna turn out too good for
me<00:04:20.820> since<00:04:21.030> I<00:04:21.180> i<00:04:21.450> highly<00:04:21.900> doubt<00:04:22.049> i'm<00:04:22.229> going<00:04:22.380> to

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
me since I i highly doubt i'm going to

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.020 
me since I i highly doubt i'm going to
hit<00:04:22.560> all<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:23.039> focus<00:04:23.400> blast

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
hit all of the focus blast

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.240 
hit all of the focus blast
I<00:04:24.120> think<00:04:24.960> he<00:04:25.020> had<00:04:25.110> like<00:04:25.290> three<00:04:25.500> more<00:04:25.680> subs<00:04:26.010> left

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
I think he had like three more subs left

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.720 
I think he had like three more subs left
so<00:04:26.610> here<00:04:27.420> i<00:04:27.450> miss<00:04:27.600> which<00:04:28.290> is<00:04:28.500> really<00:04:28.800> bad<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:29.160> I

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
so here i miss which is really bad and I

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.120 
so here i miss which is really bad and I
probably<00:04:30.330> should<00:04:30.690> have<00:04:30.780> switched<00:04:30.990> here<00:04:31.470> but

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
probably should have switched here but

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.700 
probably should have switched here but
um<00:04:32.330> yeah<00:04:33.330> I<00:04:33.540> don't<00:04:33.660> cuz<00:04:34.169> I<00:04:34.260> really<00:04:34.530> wasn't

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
um yeah I don't cuz I really wasn't

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.550 
um yeah I don't cuz I really wasn't
thinking<00:04:34.940> but<00:04:35.940> um<00:04:36.210> whatever<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:37.110> know<00:04:37.200> I<00:04:37.320> could

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
thinking but um whatever I know I could

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.500 
thinking but um whatever I know I could
take<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:37.710> crunch<00:04:38.100> hopefully<00:04:38.760> I<00:04:38.790> could<00:04:39.030> hit<00:04:39.210> um

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
take a crunch hopefully I could hit um

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.500 
take a crunch hopefully I could hit um
with<00:04:39.960> this<00:04:40.200> focus<00:04:40.560> blast<00:04:40.770> and<00:04:41.130> I<00:04:41.760> do<00:04:41.820> but<00:04:42.270> he's

with this focus blast and I do but he's

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.970 
with this focus blast and I do but he's
gonna<00:04:42.600> go<00:04:42.840> for<00:04:42.870> another<00:04:43.110> sub<00:04:43.620> I<00:04:43.800> hope

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
gonna go for another sub I hope

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.879 
gonna go for another sub I hope
hopefully<00:04:44.520> I'll<00:04:44.970> miss<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.570> I<00:04:46.410> do<00:04:46.470> end<00:04:46.770> up
