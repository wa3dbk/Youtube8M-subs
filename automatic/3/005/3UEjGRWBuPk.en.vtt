00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.019
 the dumb in st 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.470
 at least eight 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.360
 percent of all cases 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.400
 the 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.070
 observation gives a mute in the 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.740
 mostly asks for diabetics 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:29.079
 Patients with diabetes mellitus 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:31.599
 is the first thing I do 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:38.710
 Is he checking himself with the patient ? 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:40.540
 the pulse beat and the breathing still 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.219
 that is , whether they still exist 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.890
 spontaneously present in this fall 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.840
 is it so next i spend the 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.090
 Patients the so-called heart situation 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.740
 namely short contact with him on request 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.440
 whether heartache is present 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.230
 okay the patient will confirm me and 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.100
 then I ask him to sit down 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.620
 please the so-called herzlake is 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.170
 therefore necessary so that the load on for 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.920
 hearts is lowered and then calm down 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.920
 me the patient 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.030
 There are two more emergency measures 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.649
 in each but also in each one 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.080
 that may be appropriate 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:21.370
 First, an oxygen supply with a 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.920
 minutes flow from four to six 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.170
 liters per minute and the second what 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.630
 can always be necessary is as fast as 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:37.010
 possible an intravenous access too 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:38.300
 put the first 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.330
 by far the most dangerous complication 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.480
 are the so-called 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.460
 heart rhythm disturbances 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.690
 when people are having a heart attack 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.820
 they die in most 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.770
 Cases of cardiac arrhythmia on the 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.400
 we will go into more detail later 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.680
 then we have next complication 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.260
 Heart failure is the heart 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.240
 can be an adequate and needed 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.450
 can no longer afford the necessary work 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.880
 finally the cardio gene shock that 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.170
 heart breaks in his body 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.619
 completely together 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.350
 then we have the heart aneurysm and 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.130
 the heart rupture during an aneurysm 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:19.010
 it is a bulge of a 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.350
 but also in this case one 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.890
 Exploitation of the heart wall and the heart wall 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.380
 Rupture of the is the crack in the heart wall 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.530
 and the last complication is that 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:35.740
 re infarkt that is the appearance of a 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.740
 second or further infarction 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.250
 at a 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.860
 efficiency is the same as with all 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:51.930
 Organizational insufficiency around the disability 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:54.300
 of the organ a needs-based performance 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.310
 to provide that in relation to the 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.470
 Heart failure particularly interesting 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.080
 that means the heart is at 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.820
 burden is no longer able to 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.600
 Body is sufficient with oxygen and 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.600
 nutrients 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.420
 three types of heart failure that 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.970
 is once the left heart failure 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:23.970
 on the other hand, the right heart failure 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.970
 and third, global inefficiency 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.930
 when the time 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.129
 Heart failure should be present 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.590
 First of all with the anamnesis 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:40.069
 We begin by asking the patient 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.680
 the typical symptoms of stress 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.760
 left insufficiency we were amazed 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.849
 in the respiratory tract 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:51.370
 this means primarily the patient 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:55.310
 Has symptoms in the order 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:59.750
 Stress test calm display and the 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:02.090
 highest breath of the place opel during the 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.459
 Patient with the right heart failure 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.769
 or right mister right insufficiency in 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.989
 the first line of venous congestion has that 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.019
 means we have congestion in 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.599
 the veins, for example, or what 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.570
 very typical is very short 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.609
 said in the evening thick legs 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.410
 that means the patient has that in the evening 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.200
 feel that his shoes have become too tight 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.389
 or the skin is shopping for the fabric 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.700
 Beyond the shoe edge the 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.240
 In addition, dying can happen throughout 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.220
 Lower area of ​​the body occur 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.780
 lower leg of the legs possibly 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.860
 even abdominal problems at the left 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.490
 heart failure we have the symptoms 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.639
 of pulmonary edema that is we listen 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.700
 one of cult action of the lung russell 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.979
 noise and the patient becomes too 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.800
 have harmless symptoms 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:58.550
 in the case of sufficiency it can 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.830
 to the jam in the organs before the right 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.560
 Hearts are what it means to be stowage 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.010
 mills control together we call that 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:11.289
 couple tus plenum and mega li or 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.289
 even in bad cases the us title 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.889
 Put it in a heart failure 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:26.150
 the heart is no longer able to do that 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:28.490
 carry on blood if that 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.780
 the left heart stops the blood 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.240
 can transport 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.210
 then there is a jam if they are now 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.180
 think where does the blood come from before it 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.139
 in the left heart flows in very clearly 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.900
 from the lungs 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:50.510
 that is, in the case of left heart failure 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:52.430
 there is the backlog in the lungs back at 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.290
 the right insufficiency jams this 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.840
 blood in front of the right heart the name 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:59.330
 says it and where does the blood come from 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.210
 it flows into the right heart out of the 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.120
 Body cycle in the legislation 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:09.229
 sufficiency are therefore in the foreground the 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.310
 Symptoms of stasis in the periphery 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:13.010
 expected 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.050
 There are quite significant symptoms 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.680
 You can do this on the street every day 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.780
 see 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.280
 Just look at once 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.080
 older people on their legs 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.300
 There you will see them wiggling 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.080
 Walk the street and they'll see you 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.450
 the legs 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.960
 The lower legs maybe the ankles 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:32.150
 even just the feet jammed swollen 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.000
 the matthaus are swollen and that is 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.320
 a typical sign of a right 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.970
 Heart failure in a left 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.010
 heart failure said we have the 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:43.130
 jam in front of the left heart in the lungs 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.320
 back when blood enters the lungs 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.930
 dews what she thinks will happen 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:52.220
 the blood builds up in the lungs 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:54.950
 it comes to the emergence of serum in the 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:58.639
 respiratory tract, for example, in the alcoholic 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:00.530
 or in the peripheral space and the 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.660
 Patients develop pulmonary edema and 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:07.000
 the symptom that from this pulmonary edema 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:10.760
 the result is clearly the display 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.970
 These are the difficulties in breathing 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.780
 show up at the left 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.570
 Heart failure with increasing 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:20.270
 intensity that means first of all 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:23.060
 the disco is only under load too 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:25.010
 watch load display then 

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:28.390
 the symptoms get worse 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:30.830
 for rest display that means the patients 

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.960
 seething on the lungs last endes 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:36.200
 even in peace and at the end of the stands 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.599
 orthopedics highest art not those are the 

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.280
 Patients only with two three 

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:42.979
 or even more pillows sleeping in the back 

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.409
 because as soon as you lie down you can 

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:48.370
 it must say brutally, they drink 

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:48.370
 inwardly 

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:58.239
 ever have to explain from the 

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:00.189
 simple reason in both cases 

00:07:58.239 --> 00:08:03.089
 it is a disease picture 

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:03.089
 with the symptom
