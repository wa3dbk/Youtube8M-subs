00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.410
 then one of the major problems that 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.809
 you can meet on 1 2 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.830
 on a sailboat by manipulating the listen 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.389
 the waters on a winch 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.390
 this is called the age of legs 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.360
 ii on age legs you left your 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:28.320
 listening too much looser following is 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:31.170
 the slug in tension came across by 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.820
 on one of the people rolling on your 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.010
 midi is what is called on legs 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.210
 and play on little and there you can more 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.180
 do anything you're stuck because 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.210
 could no longer do your job 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.129
 kospi loosen when he could 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.390
 seem a magnificent no capstan on 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.460
 your richman gold unfortunately 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.440
 involuntary ok what to do 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.219
 you take another doubt enough 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.750
 long to be able to connect another winch 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:02.800
 from your edge and there on the part in 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.220
 tension of the listen you're going to do 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.600
 another capstan that I would call 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.910
 multiple 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.210
 do not hesitate to do several rounds 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.210
 tight 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.340
 so what is important to understand 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.090
 is that these towers must be 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:28.090
 enter your voltage button but the 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:31.040
 side of the winch and not the other side 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.860
 there you cross again that's why 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.909
 I call it capstan and you come back 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.909
 in the village loop 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.350
 immobilized 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.350
 your 9 well crocovert 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.350
 you see you brought the capstan 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.520
 here multi turn which is asymmetrical 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.229
 asymmetrical why because when 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.729
 you will shoot at the top you see 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.619
 that you will break the linearity of 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.020
 your listening what will you allow to 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.530
 put it in tension and bring down 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.530
 this tension 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.470
 from where to turn on your 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:18.110
 winch you come looking for another 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:20.840
 winch from the edge on which you are doing and 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:26.840
 a few laps and then you pick up the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.540
 tension at the miracle you found 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.819
 that your vault that was previously 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.230
 tension is now completely 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.050
 relaxed 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.640
 and you can undo all the 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.390
 loops that had inadvertently 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.030
 slipped on your record after easy 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.159
 to go do since the mass and a 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.769
 other capstan when you have facts 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.450
 your listening to undo this one made 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:58.780
 drama to release him attention on 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:03:02.629
 the other attention on austria here is 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.480
 your taste you're here you have to put 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:08.110
 your neck very simply as a 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.110
 other cases of the stands 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.960
 here 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.920
 what is a man 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.920
 is not self it's years 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.810
 so 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.520
 the troubles
