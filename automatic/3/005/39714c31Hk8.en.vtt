00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
have been natural since june and I'm

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.870 
have been natural since june and I'm
starting<00:03:13.020> to<00:03:13.050> get<00:03:13.170> those<00:03:13.440> two<00:03:14.160> strand<00:03:14.580> knots

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
starting to get those two strand knots

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.910 
starting to get those two strand knots
it<00:03:15.120> into<00:03:15.330> my<00:03:15.450> hair<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.960> became<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:16.710> crazy

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
it into my hair and it became so crazy

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.880 
it into my hair and it became so crazy
that<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.610> one<00:03:18.270> day<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.780> was<00:03:19.200> cutting<00:03:19.530> out<00:03:19.709> at

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
that and one day I was cutting out at

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.270 
that and one day I was cutting out at
least<00:03:20.100> 30<00:03:20.430> knots<00:03:20.670> in<00:03:20.850> my<00:03:20.880> hair<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:22.280> figured

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
least 30 knots in my hair and I figured

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.250 
least 30 knots in my hair and I figured
it<00:03:23.490> was<00:03:23.610> uneven<00:03:24.209> change<00:03:24.540> because<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:24.990> really

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
it was uneven change because I really

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.480 
it was uneven change because I really
didn't<00:03:25.440> know<00:03:25.470> how<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.709> control<00:03:26.040> those<00:03:26.220> knots

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
didn't know how to control those knots

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.010 
didn't know how to control those knots
and<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:27.240> know<00:03:27.360> kind<00:03:27.600> of<00:03:27.630> asked<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.900> couple

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
and you know kind of asked a couple

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.900 
and you know kind of asked a couple
people<00:03:28.290> off<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.340> some<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.880> people

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
people off you to some of the people

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.560 
people off you to some of the people
that<00:03:30.740> I<00:03:31.740> knew<00:03:32.070> maybe<00:03:32.520> they<00:03:32.670> knew<00:03:32.820> how<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.209> deal

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
that I knew maybe they knew how to deal

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.830 
that I knew maybe they knew how to deal
with<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.459> no<00:03:35.459> one<00:03:35.490> no<00:03:36.030> one<00:03:36.240> knows<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.450> I

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
with it and no one no one knows and I

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.480 
with it and no one no one knows and I
never<00:03:37.020> got<00:03:37.170> that<00:03:37.320> memo<00:03:37.500> when<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:37.860> was<00:03:38.070> going

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
never got that memo when I was going

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.850 
never got that memo when I was going
even<00:03:39.330> while<00:03:39.480> transitioning<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:40.380> guess<00:03:40.650> because

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
even while transitioning I guess because

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.100 
even while transitioning I guess because
the<00:03:41.790> ends<00:03:42.060> of<00:03:42.150> my<00:03:42.209> hair<00:03:42.270> would<00:03:42.630> still<00:03:42.900> have

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
the ends of my hair would still have

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.420 
the ends of my hair would still have
palm<00:03:43.350> on<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:43.800> they<00:03:43.890> didn't<00:03:44.130> curl<00:03:44.310> around

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
palm on it so they didn't curl around

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.340 
palm on it so they didn't curl around
itself<00:03:44.910> but<00:03:45.180> now<00:03:45.330> that<00:03:45.510> there's<00:03:45.690> no<00:03:45.840> perm<00:03:46.140> on

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
itself but now that there's no perm on

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.680 
itself but now that there's no perm on
my<00:03:46.470> hair<00:03:46.740> when<00:03:47.010> my<00:03:47.100> hair<00:03:47.310> is<00:03:47.340> wet<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:48.120> curls<00:03:48.480> up

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
my hair when my hair is wet it curls up

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.150 
my hair when my hair is wet it curls up
and<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.959> wraps<00:03:49.110> around<00:03:49.230> itself<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.890> creates

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
and it wraps around itself it creates

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.190 
and it wraps around itself it creates
enough<00:03:50.430> those<00:03:51.360> are<00:03:51.540> called<00:03:51.720> either<00:03:51.870> fairy

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
enough those are called either fairy

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.660 
enough those are called either fairy
knots<00:03:52.440> or<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.740> try<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.040> not<00:03:53.160> so<00:03:53.370> that's<00:03:53.550> what
