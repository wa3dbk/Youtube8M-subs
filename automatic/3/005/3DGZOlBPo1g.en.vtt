00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 nearly 10 million square 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.379
 kilometers is the second largest 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.480
 a country of the world but only 3-4 live there 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.800
 million inhabitants 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.719
 australia takes 7 million 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.549
 square kilometers is 6 country by 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.279
 only 22 live in it 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.920
 million for comparison china third 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.529
 place by area and population 1 and 3 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.260
 billion usa fourth place 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.410
 areas there are 320 million a germany 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.560
 Generally 62 place on area but there 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.140
 lives in 82 million people for 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.280
 what goals are kept unoccupied by people 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.410
 and the territory of Canada and Australia 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.270
 global predictor does not believe that 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.670
 such things can be random especially 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.440
 if we consider that without the country of the monarchy 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.520
 ruled by english king 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.020
 primarily according to the main concept 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.199
 globalization which is now being held 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.520
 settles down exactly comfortable stay 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.690
 places if you look at canada map 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.309
 or australia 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.920
 you will see in this who is called in china 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.159
 large enough areas unsuitable 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.939
 for stitching and more precisely so they are difficult 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.619
 own and we master and and there you can live 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.530
 there you can conduct some kind of economic 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.880
 life but within the existing 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.950
 economic model it will be 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:26.220
 unprofitable therefore she is no life there 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.320
 As for the general population of the planet 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.180
 earth you need to remember no matter how much 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.610
 lived in europe is the whole population 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.920
 sentenced to destruction through creation 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.610
 European Islamic Caliphate 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.780
 and generally the policy of the golden billion 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:47.140
 now and 500 million she in general 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:52.450
 exists as soon as the question of 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:56.170
 artificially the birth of people right now 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.330
 very tilted he has neither 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.090
 planning here look after all not 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.840
 such a funny comedy with schwarzenegger 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.090
 where a man gives birth to a child 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.620
 that is, no matter who how 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.209
 will be carrying a baby now in 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.410
 the technology already allows this 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.290
 do when this problem is solved 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.840
 required level of security 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.520
 labor force 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:30.430
 here they will be there that way 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:33.910
 reproduce in certain how and where 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.620
 animals then to the nursery when there will be 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.840
 issue and from these nurseries already 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.230
 ready people to these people 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:46.959
 were the service personnel on the production lines 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.970
 and on services from people as lackeys to this 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.709
 who will be elected to live in the new world 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.430
 so the entire population of the planet is general 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.730
 condemned to destruction and salvation 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.840
 drowning the work of drowning themselves 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.820
 global predictor wants to destroy 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.459
 the whole population is what he does not want now 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.870
 Specifically, the war in Ukraine does not mean 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.090
 that he doesnâ€™t want that war 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.579
 Ukraine under certain circumstances 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.010
 this war will be launched 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.519
 for the complete destruction of the entire population 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.140
 and the global predictor is very responsive 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.959
 Here is this Bandera Bender project 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.970
 by the way it is the global predictor 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.549
 launched this 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.760
 Bandera Belgorod project to Hitler 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.650
 fully and not allowed 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.750
 take advantage of just allowed 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.610
 form one division Galicia 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.030
 because she was actually 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.980
 necessary here is a sacrifice for the future and 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.930
 in order to some extent 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.320
 stabilize a bit of Hitler himself 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:48.160
 they are moreover a fully project 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.640
 organization bandage orientation 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.640
 Ukraine to Hitler did not give in the hands therefore 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.560
 the main one Stepan Bandera sat 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.030
 comfortable in a concentration camp traveled from 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.800
 concentration camps berlin at the meeting so have 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.990
 we have how to represent if 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.100
 concentration camp then there must be some 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.770
 the barracks 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.040
 barbed wire and everything else really 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.050
 Deal concentration camp is a place where under protection 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.970
 and there were different people for example 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.340
 Admiral Canaris was also a concentration camp and 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.730
 lived in a separate cottage he had 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.430
 servants feed other people not like admiral 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.590
 Canary in or as Bandera, too, separately 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.590
 lived lived in houses 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:33.280
 here's a type here's a modern multi-unit 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.320
 but they had no free exit 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.270
 for the territory of the concentration camp that is it 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.270
 there was a certain living
