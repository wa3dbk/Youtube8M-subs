calm<00:00:17.390> here<00:00:18.390> we're<00:00:19.050> asked<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.410> find<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.859> next

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
calm here we're asked to find the next

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.250 
calm here we're asked to find the next
three<00:00:20.580> numbers<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:22.020> pattern<00:00:22.550> 1<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.760> 1/4<00:00:24.330> 1

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
three numbers in the pattern 1 and 1/4 1

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.240 
three numbers in the pattern 1 and 1/4 1
and<00:00:25.439> 1/2<00:00:26.029> 1<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.240> 3/4<00:00:28.199> 2<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:30.210> on<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:31.859> key<00:00:32.099> to

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
and 1/2 1 and 3/4 2 and so on the key to

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.090 
and 1/2 1 and 3/4 2 and so on the key to
understanding<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.270> pattern<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.829> think

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
understanding this pattern is to think

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.470 
understanding this pattern is to think
of<00:00:35.219> one<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.489> 1/2<00:00:36.059> as<00:00:36.590> one<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.239> 2/4<00:00:40.520> now<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:42.270> can

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
of one in 1/2 as one and 2/4 now we can

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.430 
of one in 1/2 as one and 2/4 now we can
see<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.930> we're<00:00:43.079> adding<00:00:43.320> 1/4<00:00:44.309> each<00:00:44.579> time<00:00:45.440> so

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
see that we're adding 1/4 each time so

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.850 
see that we're adding 1/4 each time so
for<00:00:46.800> example<00:00:47.399> 1<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.510> 1/4<00:00:49.309> plus<00:00:50.309> 1/4<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.710> 1<00:00:52.710> in

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
for example 1 and 1/4 plus 1/4 is 1 in

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:01.910 
for example 1 and 1/4 plus 1/4 is 1 in
2/4<00:00:53.960> one<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.110> 2/4<00:00:55.980> plus<00:00:56.969> 1/4<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.370> 1<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.520> 3/4<00:01:00.920> one

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
2/4 one in 2/4 plus 1/4 is 1 in 3/4 one

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.940 
2/4 one in 2/4 plus 1/4 is 1 in 3/4 one
in<00:01:02.070> 3/4<00:01:03.000> plus<00:01:03.690> 1/4<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:05.000> 2

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
in 3/4 plus 1/4 is 2

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.170 
in 3/4 plus 1/4 is 2
continuing<00:01:07.950> with<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.310> same<00:01:08.580> pattern<00:01:09.409> 2<00:01:11.180> plus

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
continuing with the same pattern 2 plus

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:23.810 
continuing with the same pattern 2 plus
1<00:01:12.510> 4<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:14.210> 2<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.710> 1/4<00:01:17.509> 2<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.720> 1/4<00:01:20.030> plus<00:01:21.030> 1/4<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.820> 2

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
1 4 is 2 and 1/4 2 and 1/4 plus 1/4 is 2

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.069 
1 4 is 2 and 1/4 2 and 1/4 plus 1/4 is 2
and<00:01:24.000> 2<00:01:24.060> forts<00:01:24.810> or<00:01:25.049> 2<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.130> 1/2<00:01:26.580> +<00:01:28.189> 2<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.369> 1/2

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
and 2 forts or 2 and 1/2 + 2 and 1/2

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:38.630 
and 2 forts or 2 and 1/2 + 2 and 1/2
plus<00:01:31.079> 1/4<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:33.110> 2<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.290> 3/4<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.009> next<00:01:38.250> three

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
plus 1/4 is 2 and 3/4 so the next three

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.109 
plus 1/4 is 2 and 3/4 so the next three
numbers<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.270> our<00:01:39.390> pattern<00:01:39.720> are<00:01:40.220> 2<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.400> 1/4<00:01:44.119> 2

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
numbers in our pattern are 2 and 1/4 2

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.340 
numbers in our pattern are 2 and 1/4 2
and<00:01:45.299> 1/2<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:47.460> 2<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:49.470> 3/4
