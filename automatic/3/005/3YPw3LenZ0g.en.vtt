00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
watch this pink oh that actually didn't

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.020 
watch this pink oh that actually didn't
sound<00:01:57.430> like<00:01:57.549> it<00:01:57.670> helped<00:01:59.400> not<00:02:00.400> sure<00:02:00.640> what<00:02:00.850> went

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
sound like it helped not sure what went

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.930 
sound like it helped not sure what went
wrong<00:02:01.270> there<00:02:03.330> I<00:02:04.330> think<00:02:05.290> ebgames<00:02:05.909> offers<00:02:06.909> a

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
wrong there I think ebgames offers a

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.380 
wrong there I think ebgames offers a
warranty<00:02:07.869> in<00:02:08.800> case<00:02:08.860> this<00:02:09.340> happens<00:02:09.850> to<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.149> if

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
warranty in case this happens to you if

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.790 
warranty in case this happens to you if
it<00:02:10.539> still<00:02:10.929> won't<00:02:11.170> read<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.590> disc<00:02:12.690> then<00:02:13.800> EB

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
it still won't read the disc then EB

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.710 
it still won't read the disc then EB
Games<00:02:14.830> has<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.340> pretty<00:02:15.610> good<00:02:15.700> warranty<00:02:16.090> program

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.350 
Games has a pretty good warranty program
I<00:02:16.870> think<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.350> will<00:02:17.470> it's<00:02:18.190> got<00:02:18.489> protection

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
I think that will it's got protection

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.770 
I think that will it's got protection
against<00:02:19.870> any<00:02:19.989> damage<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:24.250> other<00:02:24.400> words<00:02:24.780> you

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
against any damage so in other words you

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.630 
against any damage so in other words you
can<00:02:25.959> either<00:02:26.050> say<00:02:26.410> fuck<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:26.950> stop<00:02:27.280> playing

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
can either say fuck it and stop playing

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.060 
can either say fuck it and stop playing
and<00:02:27.910> fuck<00:02:28.269> infinity<00:02:28.870> ward<00:02:29.140> because<00:02:29.950> they

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
and fuck infinity ward because they

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.180 
and fuck infinity ward because they
