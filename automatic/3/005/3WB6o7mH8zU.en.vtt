00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.309
 welcome a fan of the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.440
 superheroes to a new idea or review 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.090
 all the followers of martelly of the 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.680
 comics in general were impressed 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.809
 when the news was confirmed that after 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.390
 the events of the century for the universe 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.070
 marvel the comic will restart as 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.630
 they listen more see follow the steps of their 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.449
 competition will find a clean slate 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.329
 new or something like that but as really 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.890
 will be the beginning of marvel in the comics 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.720
 everything will start in May when it is published 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.700
 the first number of the secret world there 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.710
 different universes all belonging 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.600
 Marvel will be confronted in a 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.390
 wow pattern for example there we will see 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.489
 faced with the 1992 x-men series 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.949
 against the characters of the civil saga 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.050
 war some of the serious ones that will form 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.859
 Part of this pattern words are planet 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.289
 hulk x-men of 1992 the era of apocalypse 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:55.800
 amazing armor war 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.339
 spider-man gears of and inhuman troops a 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.489
 dylan rising ultimate marvel dynasty dm 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:06.750
 future imperfect avengers versus xmen 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.210
 oldman logan civil war the gauntlet of the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.549
 infinity made full track btr its 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.940
 'smartphones' zombies these are just the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.710
 half 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.450
 the other part was known during the 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.010
 course of the saga as they can 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.660
 appreciate many of the fighters by 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.010
 call it somehow are sagas that 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.780
 have gone through a marvel universe 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.910
 traditional what draws attention 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.170
 because that means that not only does 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.570
 they will face different universes 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.010
 also different times of marvel what 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.020
 interesting about it is that it will look 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.060
 end of the universe 616 and the universe 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.890
 ultimate by merging both and creating 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.960
 something completely new this analogy 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.360
 It was made by Alex Alonso and Tom Brevoort 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.220
 chief editor and executive editor of marvel 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.230
 respectively in a press conference 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.630
 where he did not explain some details of 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.580
 sigrid word also made it very clear 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.070
 that this is not about a wife or 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.480
 alternate is a marvel universe crashing 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.950
 in itself 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.010
 marvel is publishing its continuity 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.360
 since 1961 and since then the only thing 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.340
 they have made are small robots 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.080
 some adjustments do the continuity of 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.910
 your characters or updates of 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.710
 some stories but something so big 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.540
 as what is intended to be done or are we going 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.310
 to show with secret wars never 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.690
 obviously the most important people 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.520
 who has gone through marvel have seen 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.440
 surprised and have given their point of 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.420
 seen in this regard the first to raise the 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.280
 voice was the stanley himself who manifested 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.230
 the following is probably something 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.239
 good with certain events 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.739
 they usually attract the attention of fans the 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.930
 people want to see what happens and to 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.909
 where will you go to the new marvel universe 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.590
 you can not keep doing the same one and 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.690
 again you have to innovate with new 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.430
 ideas and different approaches I think 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.620
 a very good decision has me 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.629
 intrigued is not the only one to speak 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.310
 jerry with white who is in charge of 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.930
 carry out the death of gwen stacy in 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.269
 the comics also gave his point of view 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.680
 I like the idea although the way in how 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.690
 is going to be carried out is even more 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.340
 important than the idea itself the 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.629
 great challenge is to maintain the 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.700
 project coherently and 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.010
 consistent so that everything does not appear 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.629
 assembled by force then 3 simonson 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.640
 highlighted by draw and script hoist the 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.200
 thor series I also speak as 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.879
 I understand perfectly the professional 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.470
 idea of ​​the reboot as well as the 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.690
 incorporation of new ways of counting 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.370
 stories I understand why they do it without 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.470
 However, as I am a type rather 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.450
 empirical I prefer to wait and avoid 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.160
 instant reactions we should 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.920
 re -analyze it within a year 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.510
 to see how everything else turned out to be 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.090
 could miss with his opinion is john 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.069
 roman father I think old fans 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.349
 they will be angry and the new ones will not go 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.940
 to have problems I am not a businessman but 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.739
 I know how the companies of 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.310
 comics do anything to call 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.040
 attention 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.819
 resort to constant shock 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.650
 personally he always hates 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.090
 silly decisions like this when 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.310
 I was in Marvel, I did everything possible 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.200
 to fight them but it's not something that 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.849
 you can stop whatever happens in 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.380
 secret work all ensure that the 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.480
 Marvel universe will not be the 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.920
 Even if we are honest, it is not the 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.450
 first time marvel tells us that 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.450
 when will you post a macro saga 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.870
 personally I think the new 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.400
 human universe in the comic is going to 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.799
 look more like the cinematic universe 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.079
 is more than bad is what more gain 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.860
 is giving you at this time 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.140
