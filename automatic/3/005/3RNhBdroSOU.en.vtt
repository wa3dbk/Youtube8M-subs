00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
have my temperature thing their

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:57.210 
have my temperature thing their
temperature<00:03:53.139> thing<00:03:54.359> whatever<00:03:55.409> anyway<00:03:56.409> the

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
temperature thing whatever anyway the

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.729 
temperature thing whatever anyway the
thermometer<00:03:57.909> that<00:03:58.840> would<00:03:59.049> be<00:03:59.169> a<00:03:59.199> temperature

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
thermometer that would be a temperature

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.159 
thermometer that would be a temperature
thing<00:03:59.949> right<00:04:00.669> there<00:04:00.819> so<00:04:01.090> that<00:04:01.120> at<00:04:01.419> all<00:04:01.449> times<00:04:01.870> i

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
thing right there so that at all times i

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.679 
thing right there so that at all times i
can<00:04:02.379> check<00:04:02.620> what<00:04:03.609> temperature<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.269> is<00:04:04.389> and

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:04.689 
can check what temperature it is and

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.920 
can check what temperature it is and
know<00:04:04.810> that<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.139> rooms<00:04:05.319> okay<00:04:06.689> and<00:04:07.689> you<00:04:07.780> must

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
know that the rooms okay and you must

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.499 
know that the rooms okay and you must
always<00:04:08.169> keep<00:04:08.439> in<00:04:08.620> mind<00:04:08.859> that<00:04:09.040> hot<00:04:09.790> air<00:04:09.970> rises

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:10.509 
always keep in mind that hot air rises

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:13.349 
always keep in mind that hot air rises
so<00:04:11.079> your<00:04:11.229> piggies<00:04:11.590> on<00:04:11.829> the<00:04:12.400> bottom<00:04:12.759> aren't

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
so your piggies on the bottom aren't

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.539 
so your piggies on the bottom aren't
going<00:04:13.509> to<00:04:13.569> be<00:04:13.689> as<00:04:13.769> warm<00:04:14.769> as<00:04:15.009> the<00:04:15.129> pigs<00:04:15.370> on<00:04:15.519> the

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
going to be as warm as the pigs on the

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.529 
going to be as warm as the pigs on the
top<00:04:15.909> so<00:04:16.870> that's<00:04:17.049> a<00:04:17.199> good<00:04:17.229> reason<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:19.060> keep<00:04:19.269> your

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
top so that's a good reason to keep your

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.360 
top so that's a good reason to keep your
room<00:04:19.750> nice<00:04:20.049> and<00:04:20.079> warm<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:20.769> put<00:04:21.009> the<00:04:21.130> thermometer

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
room nice and warm I put the thermometer

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.399 
room nice and warm I put the thermometer
on<00:04:21.759> the<00:04:22.030> floor<00:04:22.270> it's<00:04:22.419> going<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.690> be<00:04:22.840> about<00:04:22.990> I

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.409 
on the floor it's going to be about I

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.490 
on the floor it's going to be about I
find<00:04:24.070> about<00:04:24.250> a<00:04:24.310> degree<00:04:24.729> or<00:04:24.909> so<00:04:25.150> lower<00:04:26.110> than

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
find about a degree or so lower than

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.709 
find about a degree or so lower than
what<00:04:26.710> it<00:04:26.830> is<00:04:26.949> when<00:04:27.219> it's<00:04:27.370> sitting<00:04:27.580> at<00:04:28.479> the

00:04:28.709 --> 00:04:28.719 
what it is when it's sitting at the

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:31.589 
what it is when it's sitting at the
midpoint<00:04:28.960> of<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.500> room<00:04:30.180> but<00:04:31.180> I<00:04:31.210> always<00:04:31.360> have

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
midpoint of the room but I always have

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.140 
midpoint of the room but I always have
their<00:04:31.780> room<00:04:31.960> more<00:04:32.259> than<00:04:32.440> warm<00:04:32.770> enough<00:04:33.070> so<00:04:34.030> it

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
their room more than warm enough so it

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.679 
their room more than warm enough so it
doesn't<00:04:34.479> matter<00:04:36.330> um<00:04:37.330> so<00:04:37.960> what<00:04:38.080> are<00:04:38.169> you<00:04:38.289> doing

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:40.689 
doesn't matter um so what are you doing

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.659 

so<00:04:41.689> those<00:04:41.840> are<00:04:42.020> my<00:04:42.080> tips<00:04:42.199> I<00:04:42.740> think<00:04:43.250> everybody

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
so those are my tips I think everybody

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.279 
so those are my tips I think everybody
whether<00:04:44.060> you<00:04:44.210> have<00:04:44.300> freed<00:04:44.629> pigs<00:04:44.870> or<00:04:45.110> not

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
whether you have freed pigs or not

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.790 
whether you have freed pigs or not
should<00:04:45.590> have<00:04:45.740> cozy<00:04:46.129> beds<00:04:47.139> you<00:04:48.139> don't<00:04:48.289> know<00:04:48.439> how

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
should have cozy beds you don't know how

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.860 
should have cozy beds you don't know how
your<00:04:49.009> piggy<00:04:49.219> feels<00:04:49.580> for<00:04:49.969> warmth<00:04:50.360> so<00:04:50.810> you

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
your piggy feels for warmth so you

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.050 
your piggy feels for warmth so you
should<00:04:51.110> always<00:04:51.289> have<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.740> option<00:04:51.770> of<00:04:52.460> them

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
should always have the option of them

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.570 
should always have the option of them
having<00:04:53.389> a<00:04:53.479> place<00:04:53.719> to<00:04:53.750> go<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:54.319> get<00:04:54.919> cuddly<00:04:55.400> and

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
having a place to go and get cuddly and

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.909 
having a place to go and get cuddly and
warm<00:04:55.990> that's<00:04:56.990> just<00:04:57.199> what<00:04:57.379> I<00:04:57.409> think<00:04:57.530> and

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
warm that's just what I think and

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.800 
warm that's just what I think and
especially<00:04:58.639> if<00:04:58.879> you<00:04:58.939> have<00:04:59.000> skinny<00:04:59.360> pigs<00:04:59.659> I

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
especially if you have skinny pigs I

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.959 
especially if you have skinny pigs I
think<00:05:00.020> it's<00:05:00.169> a<00:05:00.259> must<00:05:00.530> I<00:05:00.889> don't<00:05:01.550> think<00:05:01.729> anybody

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:01.969 
think it's a must I don't think anybody

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.689 
think it's a must I don't think anybody
with<00:05:02.300> skinny<00:05:02.569> pigs<00:05:02.900> should<00:05:03.770> go<00:05:03.979> without<00:05:04.370> beds

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
with skinny pigs should go without beds

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.110 
with skinny pigs should go without beds
