00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
to hit those multi ball power-ups you

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.820 
to hit those multi ball power-ups you
see<00:01:52.600> you<00:01:52.660> down<00:01:52.810> at<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.990> end<00:01:53.140> of<00:01:53.230> the<00:01:53.320> hall<00:01:53.350> or

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
see you down at the end of the hall or

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.070 
see you down at the end of the hall or
you<00:01:54.610> can<00:01:54.760> just<00:01:54.850> add<00:01:55.090> more<00:01:55.300> power<00:01:55.570> by<00:01:55.810> hitting

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
you can just add more power by hitting

right a little more texture and color in
there<00:03:58.830> and<00:03:59.510> then<00:04:00.510> I<00:04:00.540> think<00:04:00.750> I<00:04:00.810> want<00:04:00.960> a<00:04:01.020> tree

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
there and then I think I want a tree

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.720 
there and then I think I want a tree
line<00:04:01.530> in<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.770> background<00:04:02.250> could<00:04:02.460> i<00:04:02.520> get<00:04:02.670> some

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
line in the background could i get some

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.440 
line in the background could i get some
green<00:04:06.890> all<00:04:07.890> right<00:04:08.130> there's<00:04:08.340> my<00:04:08.430> tree<00:04:08.820> line<00:04:09.060> so

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
green all right there's my tree line so

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.840 
green all right there's my tree line so
i<00:04:09.980> think<00:04:10.980> that's<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.400> pretty<00:04:11.550> awesome

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850
