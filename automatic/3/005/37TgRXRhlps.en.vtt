the guys that I learned from did that
basically<00:01:58.110> always<00:01:58.380> leave<00:01:58.770> some<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
basically always leave some of the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.130 
basically always leave some of the
background<00:01:59.399> noises<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.210> Corps<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.780> get

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.480 
background noises on so I Corps you get
to<00:02:01.200> hear<00:02:01.770> some<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> Yammer<00:02:02.280> from

being<00:03:50.930> most<00:03:51.930> definitely<00:03:52.530> but<00:03:52.740> fantasy<00:03:53.160> right

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
being most definitely but fantasy right

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.610 
being most definitely but fantasy right
now<00:03:53.400> he<00:03:53.460> has<00:03:53.580> bunch<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.210> recipes<00:03:54.330> that<00:03:54.810> were

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
now he has bunch of recipes that were

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.970 
now he has bunch of recipes that were
blocking<00:03:56.010> his<00:03:56.280> ramp<00:03:57.410> now<00:03:58.410> probably<00:03:58.680> thinking

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
blocking his ramp now probably thinking

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.140 
blocking his ramp now probably thinking
of<00:03:59.070> expanding<00:03:59.340> right<00:03:59.580> now<00:03:59.670> just<00:03:59.820> spawning

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
of expanding right now just spawning

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.610 
of expanding right now just spawning
everything<00:04:00.510> around<00:04:00.690> but<00:04:01.080> still<00:04:01.380> not<00:04:01.560> very

everything around but still not very

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.340 
everything around but still not very
good<00:04:01.860> position<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.160> be<00:04:02.250> in<00:04:02.640> because<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:04.020> don't

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
good position to be in because I don't

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.890 
good position to be in because I don't
see<00:04:04.530> any<00:04:04.740> Academy<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:05.280> don't<00:04:05.550> see<00:04:05.670> any<00:04:05.850> ebay<00:04:06.330> and

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
might be we miss reading there we go no

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.729 
might be we miss reading there we go no
there<00:04:18.910> you<00:04:19.030> go<00:04:19.209> I'm<00:04:19.810> not<00:04:19.959> sure<00:04:20.109> to<00:04:20.320> get<00:04:20.410> it<00:04:20.560> hang

is actually a very crucial step in the
game<00:04:28.240> right<00:04:28.690> now<00:04:29.160> because<00:04:30.160> if<00:04:30.419> fantasy<00:04:31.419> get

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
game right now because if fantasy get

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.450 
game right now because if fantasy get
some<00:04:31.810> detection<00:04:32.290> going<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:32.650> fights<00:04:32.979> this<00:04:33.220> off

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
some detection going and fights this off

he's gonna be in a good position you're
gonna<00:04:35.260> go<00:04:35.410> out<00:04:35.440> there<00:04:35.560> puts<00:04:36.160> on<00:04:36.280> some<00:04:36.490> pressure

gonna go out there puts on some pressure
puts<00:04:37.150> on<00:04:37.300> put<00:04:38.080> on<00:04:38.169> some<00:04:38.320> pressure<00:04:38.530> with<00:04:38.830> the

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
puts on put on some pressure with the

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.300 
puts on put on some pressure with the
four<00:04:40.030> Marines<00:04:40.300> and<00:04:40.630> the<00:04:41.050> tank<00:04:41.320> you<00:04:41.979> know<00:04:42.070> JB

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
four Marines and the tank you know JB

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.909 
four Marines and the tank you know JB
also<00:04:42.610> actually<00:04:42.850> expanding<00:04:43.690> right<00:04:43.840> now<00:04:43.990> so

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
also actually expanding right now so

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.890 
also actually expanding right now so
he's<00:04:45.160> definitely<00:04:45.340> has<00:04:45.699> a<00:04:45.729> fail-safe<00:04:46.180> good<00:04:46.720> but

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
he's definitely has a fail-safe good but

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.290 
he's definitely has a fail-safe good but
there<00:04:47.110> are<00:04:47.350> mines<00:04:48.039> Islands<00:04:48.729> well<00:04:48.880> just<00:04:49.060> JB

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
there are mines Islands well just JB

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.120 
there are mines Islands well just JB
phantoms<00:04:50.199> are<00:04:50.289> getting<00:04:50.620> mine<00:04:50.830> so<00:04:51.010> those

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
phantoms are getting mine so those

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.710 
phantoms are getting mine so those
watches<00:04:51.460> those<00:04:51.639> might<00:04:52.000> be<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.360> same<00:04:52.479> agrees

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
watches those might be the same agrees

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.900 
watches those might be the same agrees
those<00:04:52.930> might<00:04:53.169> be<00:04:53.199> what<00:04:53.470> safe<00:04:53.740> mines<00:04:54.580> here<00:04:54.820> at

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
those might be what safe mines here at

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.370 
those might be what safe mines here at
the<00:04:54.970> natural<00:04:55.120> expedient<00:04:55.660> planet<00:04:55.960> down<00:04:56.080> those

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
the natural expedient planet down those

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.230 
the natural expedient planet down those
might<00:04:56.800> be<00:04:56.830> what<00:04:57.160> saves<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.669> game<00:04:57.820> form<00:04:58.120> right

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
might be what saves the game form right

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.170 
might be what saves the game form right
now<00:04:58.449> those<00:04:59.380> mines<00:04:59.710> get<00:05:00.070> into<00:05:00.280> the<00:05:00.400> DTS<00:05:00.760> and<00:05:00.940> T's

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
now those mines get into the DTS and T's

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.939 
now those mines get into the DTS and T's
does<00:05:01.360> manage<00:05:01.660> to<00:05:01.690> pick<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.020> market<00:05:02.350> position
