to go see what we got for damage can't
see<00:00:18.830> that's<00:00:19.830> where<00:00:20.039> one<00:00:20.279> bolt<00:00:20.520> goes<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.720> hold

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
see that's where one bolt goes to hold

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.810 
see that's where one bolt goes to hold
the<00:00:22.050> bumper<00:00:22.320> bracket<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.550> other<00:00:23.699> one

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
goes right here and after I took that

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.620 
goes right here and after I took that
piece<00:00:28.380> off<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.619> there<00:00:28.849> that<00:00:29.849> away<00:00:30.119> these<00:00:30.480> are

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
piece off of there that away these are

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.790 
piece off of there that away these are
the<00:00:30.750> two<00:00:30.929> holes<00:00:31.230> right<00:00:32.120> here<00:00:33.500> you<00:00:34.500> see<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
the two holes right here you see the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.530 
the two holes right here you see the
stock<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> inside<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:36.570> support<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:38.540> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
stock on the inside that support the the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.110 
stock on the inside that support the the
engine<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:42.920> it's<00:00:43.920> pretty<00:00:44.370> good<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:45.090> know

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
engine and it's pretty good you know

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.000 
engine and it's pretty good you know
there<00:00:45.360> was<00:00:45.480> nothing<00:00:45.600> holding<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.110> just<00:00:46.890> a

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
there was nothing holding it just a

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.220 
there was nothing holding it just a
piece<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.340> sheet<00:00:47.520> metal<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.960> wasn't<00:00:49.110> even

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
piece of sheet metal and it wasn't even

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.600 
piece of sheet metal and it wasn't even
welded<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.800> was<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.309> sitting<00:00:50.489> in

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
welded and I was just just sitting in

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.729 
welded and I was just just sitting in
there<00:00:50.840> there's<00:00:51.840> pretty<00:00:52.020> much<00:00:52.079> covered<00:00:52.500> up<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
there there's pretty much covered up the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.760 
there there's pretty much covered up the
area<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> idea<00:00:54.660> was<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.809> try<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.050> come

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
area I think the idea was to try to come

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.069 
area I think the idea was to try to come
off<00:00:55.800> these<00:00:56.100> two<00:00:56.280> bolts<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.020> support<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
off these two bolts and support the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.220 
off these two bolts and support the
piece<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.379> metal<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:59.160> support<00:01:00.020> these<00:01:01.020> two

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
piece of metal to support these two

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.750 
piece of metal to support these two
bolts<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.430> again<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.940> didn't<00:01:03.239> fare<00:01:03.690> very<00:01:03.719> well

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
bolts and again it didn't fare very well

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.580 
bolts and again it didn't fare very well
so<00:01:05.760> that's<00:01:06.540> kind<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.840> with<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> before<00:01:07.380> look

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
so that's kind of with the before look

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.170 
so that's kind of with the before look
is<00:01:12.049> and<00:01:13.049> cutting<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.010> way<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.850> what<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:14.970> did

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
is and cutting in a way but what I did

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.770 
is and cutting in a way but what I did
do<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.560> hook<00:01:16.560> some<00:01:16.740> cardboard<00:01:17.070> oh<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:18.630> wanted

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
do is hook some cardboard oh you wanted

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.060 
do is hook some cardboard oh you wanted
a<00:01:18.930> piece<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.110> came<00:01:19.380> out<00:01:19.500> where<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:22.070> that's

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
a piece that came out where is it that's

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.640 
a piece that came out where is it that's
what<00:01:23.310> was<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.549> there<00:01:24.830> they<00:01:25.830> said<00:01:26.040> no<00:01:26.280> wha<00:01:27.650> no

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
what was in there they said no wha no

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.440 
what was in there they said no wha no
welding<00:01:29.070> required<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.670> guess<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.090> hold<00:01:30.299> your

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
welding required I guess to hold your

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.450 
welding required I guess to hold your
frame<00:01:30.600> together<00:01:32.299> so<00:01:33.500> out<00:01:34.500> with<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> old<00:01:34.860> and

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
frame together so out with the old and

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.069 
frame together so out with the old and
we're<00:01:36.240> gonna<00:01:36.329> go<00:01:36.860> about<00:01:38.420> improving<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.049> a

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
we're gonna go about improving on this a

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.660 
we're gonna go about improving on this a
little<00:01:40.259> bit<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.070> took<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.460> piece<00:01:41.610> of

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
little bit so I took a piece of

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.219 
little bit so I took a piece of
cardboard<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:43.009> made<00:01:44.009> my<00:01:44.189> template<00:01:44.840> to<00:01:45.840> match

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
cardboard and made my template to match

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.469 
cardboard and made my template to match
the<00:01:47.009> outer<00:01:47.280> section<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.909> rail<00:01:48.149> which<00:01:48.390> is

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
the outer section of the rail which is

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:57.410 
the outer section of the rail which is
going<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:51.710> perfect<00:01:52.710> there<00:01:53.000> that<00:01:54.000> will<00:01:54.180> fit

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.719 

one<00:01:58.409> hand<00:01:58.620> who<00:01:58.740> does<00:01:58.890> not<00:01:59.010> make<00:01:59.159> easy<00:01:59.370> anyway

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
one hand who does not make easy anyway

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.330 
one hand who does not make easy anyway
so<00:02:00.090> that's<00:02:00.270> gonna<00:02:00.420> go<00:02:00.720> suck<00:02:01.229> us<00:02:01.380> up<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.920> good

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
so that's gonna go suck us up to good

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.910 
so that's gonna go suck us up to good
metal<00:02:02.729> pretty<00:02:02.940> much<00:02:03.120> all<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.170> way<00:02:04.200> around<00:02:04.650> so

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
metal pretty much all the way around so

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.969 
metal pretty much all the way around so
I'm<00:02:05.100> gonna<00:02:05.250> cut<00:02:05.520> out<00:02:06.350> probably<00:02:07.350> leave<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.710> half

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
I'm gonna cut out probably leave a half

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.190 
I'm gonna cut out probably leave a half
inch<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> backside<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.360> may<00:02:09.990> leave<00:02:10.170> a

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
inch on the backside I may leave a

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.680 
inch on the backside I may leave a
little<00:02:10.380> bit<00:02:10.560> more<00:02:10.800> if<00:02:10.979> it's<00:02:11.160> thicker<00:02:11.600> tell<00:02:12.600> you

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
little bit more if it's thicker tell you

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.570 
little bit more if it's thicker tell you
why<00:02:12.810> in<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.990> minute

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
why in a minute

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
I gotta hang the bracket back on for the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.880 
make a plate for this one yet two and
got<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.000> finalized<00:02:27.690> where<00:02:28.050> these<00:02:28.260> two<00:02:28.500> bolts

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
got a finalized where these two bolts

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.640 
got a finalized where these two bolts
need<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.310> be<00:02:29.870> nothing<00:02:30.870> bolts<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.350> then<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.500> got

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
need to be nothing bolts and then I got

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.250 
need to be nothing bolts and then I got
welded<00:02:31.980> from<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.190> backside<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.080> it's<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.200> know

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
welded from the backside so it's I know

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.600 
welded from the backside so it's I know
it's<00:02:34.560> because<00:02:34.830> you're<00:02:35.160> not<00:02:35.250> gonna<00:02:35.370> be<00:02:35.430> able<00:02:35.519> to

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
it's because you're not gonna be able to

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.420 
it's because you're not gonna be able to
access<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:37.140> then<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.769> last<00:02:38.070> piece<00:02:38.280> I

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
access this and then the last piece I

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.920 
access this and then the last piece I
have<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.670> make<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:38.850> panel<00:02:39.239> it<00:02:39.330> goes<00:02:39.480> across<00:02:39.690> that

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
have to make a panel it goes across that

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.979 
have to make a panel it goes across that
back<00:02:40.140> section<00:02:40.380> right<00:02:41.340> there<00:02:42.110> so<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:44.989> was

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
back section right there so that was

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.410 
back section right there so that was
already<00:02:46.400> made<00:02:48.110> out<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.260> metal<00:02:50.239> there's<00:02:51.239> that

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
already made out of metal there's that

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.470 
already made out of metal there's that
bolt<00:02:51.630> I'm<00:02:52.019> talking<00:02:52.410> about<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.180> the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
bolt I'm talking about this is the

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.090 
bolt I'm talking about this is the
bottom<00:02:54.780> side<00:02:54.989> so<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.230> you'll<00:02:55.769> be<00:02:55.890> able<00:02:55.980> to

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
bottom side so that you'll be able to

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.800 
bottom side so that you'll be able to
take<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.280> bolt<00:02:56.489> back<00:02:56.670> out<00:02:56.880> but<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.420> have<00:02:57.660> to

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
take the bolt back out but I have to

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.479 
take the bolt back out but I have to
weld<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.290> nut<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.040> there's<00:02:59.190> not<00:02:59.310> gonna<00:02:59.430> be

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
weld that nut and there's not gonna be

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.789 
weld that nut and there's not gonna be
any<00:02:59.610> access<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:00.870> while<00:03:01.320> it's<00:03:01.500> half

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
any access to it so while it's half

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.460 
any access to it so while it's half
built<00:03:02.489> I<00:03:02.670> have<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.230> figure<00:03:04.230> out<00:03:04.260> what<00:03:04.410> my

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
built I have to figure out what my

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.530 
built I have to figure out what my
location<00:03:04.799> is<00:03:05.040> weld<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:05.760> stuff<00:03:06.060> up<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:06.450> then

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
location is weld that stuff up and then

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.759 
location is weld that stuff up and then
I<00:03:06.570> could<00:03:06.750> weld<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.769> other<00:03:07.860> plate<00:03:08.160> on<00:03:08.310> here

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
I could weld the other plate on here

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:16.759 
I could weld the other plate on here
that<00:03:10.769> guy<00:03:12.470> bring<00:03:13.470> me<00:03:13.560> up<00:03:13.650> right<00:03:13.769> now<00:03:15.769> it's

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
that guy bring me up right now it's

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.300 
that guy bring me up right now it's
gonna<00:03:16.920> go<00:03:17.130> in<00:03:17.360> something<00:03:18.360> unlike<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:19.310> my

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
gonna go in something unlike that my

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.890 
gonna go in something unlike that my
lighting<00:03:20.610> sex<00:03:21.799> so<00:03:22.799> I<00:03:23.130> sawed<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.090> cuddle<00:03:24.360> again

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
lighting sex so I sawed the cuddle again

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.750 
lighting sex so I sawed the cuddle again
all<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.230> old<00:03:25.380> metal<00:03:25.590> out<00:03:25.739> of<00:03:25.860> there<00:03:25.980> yet<00:03:26.220> but<00:03:26.459> I

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
all the old metal out of there yet but I

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.270 
all the old metal out of there yet but I
get<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.209> idea

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
get the idea

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.380 
get the idea
that<00:03:29.280> would<00:03:29.400> be<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.610> 1/2<00:03:30.000> of<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.239> rail<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.950> then

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
that would be the 1/2 of a rail and then

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.789 
that would be the 1/2 of a rail and then
the<00:03:33.390> reason<00:03:33.660> why<00:03:33.750> I'm<00:03:33.900> doing<00:03:34.140> it<00:03:34.260> like<00:03:34.290> this<00:03:34.620> by

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
the reason why I'm doing it like this by

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.220 
the reason why I'm doing it like this by
the<00:03:34.829> way<00:03:34.950> half<00:03:35.790> at<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:36.000> time<00:03:36.060> I'm<00:03:36.840> trying<00:03:37.170> to

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
the way half at a time I'm trying to

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.920 
the way half at a time I'm trying to
maintain<00:03:37.380> this<00:03:38.130> location<00:03:38.850> before<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.630> engine

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
maintain this location before the engine

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.080 
maintain this location before the engine
mount<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.230> don't<00:03:40.410> want<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.709> move<00:03:40.910> so<00:03:41.910> that's

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
mount I don't want it to move so that's

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.670 
mount I don't want it to move so that's
why<00:03:42.269> I'm<00:03:42.450> gonna<00:03:42.570> cut<00:03:42.810> away<00:03:42.930> these<00:03:43.380> are<00:03:43.440> gonna

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
why I'm gonna cut away these are gonna

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.759 
why I'm gonna cut away these are gonna
stay<00:03:44.040> here<00:03:44.070> these<00:03:44.489> two<00:03:44.640> pieces<00:03:44.850> I<00:03:45.239> could<00:03:46.110> put

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
stay here these two pieces I could put

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.240 
stay here these two pieces I could put
the<00:03:47.160> my<00:03:48.150> new<00:03:48.329> play<00:03:48.570> on<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.560> could<00:03:49.739> tack<00:03:50.010> it

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
the my new play on and I could tack it

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.670 
the my new play on and I could tack it
from<00:03:50.489> that<00:03:50.610> from<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.090> front<00:03:51.329> side<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.810> then

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
from that from the front side and then

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.759 
from that from the front side and then
when<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:52.950> remove<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.910> back<00:03:54.060> side<00:03:54.530> when<00:03:55.530> I<00:03:55.560> make

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
when I remove the back side when I make

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.620 
when I remove the back side when I make
this<00:03:55.920> one<00:03:56.100> then<00:03:56.700> I<00:03:56.730> can<00:03:56.970> just<00:03:57.120> weld<00:03:57.420> right

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
this one then I can just weld right

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.910 
this one then I can just weld right
around<00:03:57.900> them<00:03:58.019> from<00:03:58.170> the<00:03:58.260> backside<00:03:58.709> and

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
around them from the backside and

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.500 
around them from the backside and
that'll<00:03:59.430> be<00:03:59.519> my<00:03:59.549> location<00:03:59.790> now<00:04:00.120> I'll<00:04:00.299> put<00:04:00.420> the

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
that'll be my location now I'll put the

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.470 
that'll be my location now I'll put the
bolts<00:04:00.690> through<00:04:00.900> with<00:04:01.049> the<00:04:01.140> bracket<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:02.480> you

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
bolts through with the bracket and you

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.130 
bolts through with the bracket and you
know

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
know

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.680 
know
am<00:04:06.140> I<00:04:06.260> trying<00:04:06.320> to<00:04:06.500> say<00:04:07.850> I'll<00:04:08.150> weld<00:04:08.390> it<00:04:08.480> again

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
am I trying to say I'll weld it again

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.800 
am I trying to say I'll weld it again
from<00:04:08.840> this<00:04:08.990> side<00:04:09.200> -<00:04:09.380> when<00:04:09.560> I<00:04:10.180> locate<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.540> other

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
from this side - when I locate the other

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.010 
from this side - when I locate the other
channel<00:04:12.110> holes<00:04:12.260> you'll<00:04:12.890> see<00:04:13.510> okay<00:04:14.510> I'll<00:04:14.840> see

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
channel holes you'll see okay I'll see

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.740 
channel holes you'll see okay I'll see
somebody<00:04:15.350> we'll<00:04:15.440> see<00:04:15.790> but<00:04:16.790> that's<00:04:17.390> where<00:04:17.630> it

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
somebody we'll see but that's where it

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.570 
somebody we'll see but that's where it
is<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.290> I<00:04:18.620> figure<00:04:18.860> I<00:04:18.920> start<00:04:19.190> with<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.370> stuff

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
is and I figure I start with the stuff

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.210 
is and I figure I start with the stuff
that's<00:04:19.790> most<00:04:20.660> detrimental<00:04:21.170> to<00:04:21.620> its<00:04:21.800> health

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
that's most detrimental to its health

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.030 
that's most detrimental to its health
first<00:04:22.790> and<00:04:23.090> that<00:04:23.450> I<00:04:23.720> would<00:04:24.230> definitely<00:04:24.560> say<00:04:24.800> is

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
first and that I would definitely say is

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.720 
first and that I would definitely say is
that<00:04:25.610> fact<00:04:25.880> that<00:04:25.970> your<00:04:26.150> engine<00:04:26.390> can<00:04:26.810> fall<00:04:27.050> out

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
that fact that your engine can fall out

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.440 
that fact that your engine can fall out
might<00:04:28.730> be<00:04:28.910> a<00:04:29.380> slight<00:04:30.380> issue<00:04:31.180> that's<00:04:32.180> Maya

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
might be a slight issue that's Maya

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:43.030 
might be a slight issue that's Maya
might<00:04:32.960> get<00:04:33.170> up<00:04:33.290> for<00:04:33.410> holding<00:04:33.710> it<00:04:41.830> and<00:04:42.830> these

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
might get up for holding it and these

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.620 
might get up for holding it and these
are<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.250> brackets<00:04:43.690> that<00:04:46.000> hold<00:04:47.000> up<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.360> engine

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
are the brackets that hold up the engine

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.810 
are the brackets that hold up the engine
and<00:04:47.750> they<00:04:47.960> have<00:04:48.110> to<00:04:48.260> slip<00:04:48.530> over<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:49.340> rail<00:04:49.550> and

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
and they have to slip over the rail and

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.840 
and they have to slip over the rail and
that's<00:04:50.210> your<00:04:50.390> holes<00:04:50.600> for<00:04:50.960> it<00:04:51.160> it<00:04:52.160> does<00:04:52.610> sit<00:04:52.820> on

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
that's your holes for it it does sit on

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.840 
that's your holes for it it does sit on
an<00:04:53.090> angle<00:04:53.360> -<00:04:54.010> so<00:04:57.370> I'll<00:04:58.370> see<00:04:58.520> what<00:04:58.640> it's<00:04:58.760> made

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
an angle - so I'll see what it's made

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.670 
an angle - so I'll see what it's made
with<00:05:00.130> all<00:05:01.130> right<00:05:01.280> I<00:05:01.490> use<00:05:02.090> this<00:05:02.450> is<00:05:02.660> a<00:05:02.690> what<00:05:03.650> a

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
with all right I use this is a what a

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.990 
with all right I use this is a what a
couple<00:05:03.950> years<00:05:04.130> ago<00:05:04.310> it's<00:05:04.490> a<00:05:04.520> Harbor<00:05:04.790> Freight

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
couple years ago it's a Harbor Freight

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.690 
couple years ago it's a Harbor Freight
like<00:05:05.360> three<00:05:05.690> and<00:05:05.840> one<00:05:05.990> it's<00:05:06.620> good<00:05:06.950> for<00:05:07.220> like<00:05:07.250> I

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
like three and one it's good for like I

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.760 
like three and one it's good for like I
think<00:05:08.210> it's<00:05:08.330> 18<00:05:08.510> gauge<00:05:08.870> of<00:05:08.990> 20<00:05:09.260> gauge<00:05:09.410> not<00:05:09.620> it's

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
think it's 18 gauge of 20 gauge not it's

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.150 
think it's 18 gauge of 20 gauge not it's
not<00:05:09.890> much<00:05:10.190> at<00:05:10.400> all<00:05:10.430> 20<00:05:10.760> gauge<00:05:11.230> but<00:05:12.230> believe<00:05:13.070> it

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
not much at all 20 gauge but believe it

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.740 
not much at all 20 gauge but believe it
or<00:05:13.220> not<00:05:13.340> it's<00:05:13.520> good<00:05:13.700> for<00:05:13.880> the<00:05:14.060> cardboard<00:05:14.570> you

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
or not it's good for the cardboard you

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.450 
or not it's good for the cardboard you
put<00:05:15.320> your<00:05:15.440> marks<00:05:15.680> on<00:05:15.860> where<00:05:16.070> you<00:05:16.160> want<00:05:16.340> to

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
put your marks on where you want to

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.580 
put your marks on where you want to
shape<00:05:17.060> and<00:05:17.480> model<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:18.110> patches<00:05:18.440> of<00:05:18.470> the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
shape and model the patches of the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.680 
shape and model the patches of the
cardboard<00:05:18.920> and<00:05:19.330> I<00:05:20.770> use<00:05:21.770> that<00:05:21.800> for<00:05:22.600> trimming<00:05:23.600> it

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
cardboard and I use that for trimming it

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.090 
cardboard and I use that for trimming it
and<00:05:23.810> getting<00:05:23.960> nice<00:05:24.140> straight<00:05:24.470> lines<00:05:24.710> on<00:05:24.950> the

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
and getting nice straight lines on the

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.500 
and getting nice straight lines on the
piece<00:05:25.250> that<00:05:25.370> you<00:05:25.460> want<00:05:25.520> to<00:05:25.640> make<00:05:25.760> and<00:05:26.090> you<00:05:26.360> can

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
piece that you want to make and you can

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.510 
piece that you want to make and you can
fold<00:05:26.690> the<00:05:26.840> cardboard<00:05:27.110> on<00:05:27.700> on<00:05:28.700> this<00:05:29.180> thing<00:05:29.390> -

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
fold the cardboard on on this thing -

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.770 
fold the cardboard on on this thing -
you<00:05:31.520> got<00:05:31.990> there's<00:05:32.990> your<00:05:33.140> brake<00:05:34.330> is<00:05:35.330> a<00:05:35.390> shear

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
you got there's your brake is a shear

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.220 
you got there's your brake is a shear
down<00:05:36.020> here<00:05:36.320> and<00:05:37.390> then<00:05:38.390> up<00:05:38.510> top<00:05:38.660> this<00:05:38.870> a<00:05:38.900> set<00:05:39.140> of

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
down here and then up top this a set of

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.190 
down here and then up top this a set of
rollers<00:05:39.880> but<00:05:40.880> that's<00:05:41.480> how<00:05:41.540> the<00:05:41.660> cardboard<00:05:42.110> is

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
rollers but that's how the cardboard is

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.290 
rollers but that's how the cardboard is
made<00:05:42.410> on<00:05:42.790> another<00:05:43.790> machine<00:05:43.910> I'm<00:05:44.120> going<00:05:44.240> to

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
made on another machine I'm going to

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.980 
made on another machine I'm going to
show<00:05:44.420> you<00:05:44.450> I<00:05:44.570> made<00:05:44.950> this<00:05:45.950> Bend<00:05:46.280> and<00:05:46.580> then<00:05:47.540> this

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
show you I made this Bend and then this

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.370 
show you I made this Bend and then this
one<00:05:48.320> I<00:05:49.000> couldn't<00:05:50.000> catch<00:05:50.180> the<00:05:50.420> edge<00:05:50.540> of<00:05:50.720> it<00:05:50.870> so<00:05:51.020> I

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
one I couldn't catch the edge of it so I

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.020 
one I couldn't catch the edge of it so I
wasn't<00:05:51.680> able<00:05:51.830> to<00:05:51.980> to<00:05:52.400> bend<00:05:52.610> to<00:05:52.700> any<00:05:52.820> other

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
wasn't able to to bend to any other

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.940 
wasn't able to to bend to any other
machine<00:05:53.300> so<00:05:53.450> what<00:05:53.540> I<00:05:53.570> did<00:05:53.750> is<00:05:53.840> I<00:05:53.930> started<00:05:53.990> it<00:05:54.650> on

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
machine so what I did is I started it on

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.990 
machine so what I did is I started it on
here<00:05:56.320> then<00:05:57.320> went<00:05:57.470> over<00:05:57.620> to<00:05:57.740> the<00:05:57.860> bikes<00:05:58.010> rolled

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
here then went over to the bikes rolled

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.870 
here then went over to the bikes rolled
it<00:05:59.150> over<00:05:59.360> the<00:05:59.480> rest<00:05:59.630> of<00:05:59.750> the<00:05:59.840> way<00:05:59.990> and<00:06:00.760> at<00:06:01.760> that

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
it over the rest of the way and at that

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.030 
it over the rest of the way and at that
point<00:06:02.030> it's<00:06:02.300> kind<00:06:02.420> of<00:06:02.510> lumpy<00:06:02.900> but<00:06:03.110> I<00:06:03.140> stuck<00:06:03.920> it

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
point it's kind of lumpy but I stuck it

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.790 
point it's kind of lumpy but I stuck it
in<00:06:04.190> this<00:06:04.280> machine<00:06:05.290> which<00:06:06.290> is<00:06:06.440> this<00:06:06.590> guy

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
in this machine which is this guy

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.390 
in this machine which is this guy
there's<00:06:07.550> a<00:06:07.610> whole<00:06:07.790> meat

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
there's a whole meat

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.290 
there's a whole meat
breaking<00:06:10.270> and<00:06:11.430> has<00:06:12.430> a<00:06:12.460> video<00:06:12.790> on<00:06:12.850> it<00:06:13.030> somewhere

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
breaking and has a video on it somewhere

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.270 
breaking and has a video on it somewhere
but<00:06:13.540> anyway<00:06:13.750> it<00:06:14.440> goes<00:06:14.590> up<00:06:14.770> and<00:06:14.919> down<00:06:14.949> it's<00:06:15.160> made

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
but anyway it goes up and down it's made

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:26.670 
but anyway it goes up and down it's made
out<00:06:15.430> of<00:06:15.460> a<00:06:15.610> screw<00:06:16.919> and<00:06:23.370> okay<00:06:25.380> talk<00:06:26.380> about<00:06:26.470> how

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
out of a screw and okay talk about how

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.680 
out of a screw and okay talk about how
to<00:06:26.740> turn<00:06:27.010> that<00:06:27.040> that's<00:06:27.460> dirty<00:06:27.820> right<00:06:30.630> okay<00:06:31.630> so

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.570 
your impact gun and that goes to a screw
there's<00:07:01.000> a<00:07:01.260> 3/4<00:07:02.260> drive<00:07:02.500> socket<00:07:03.010> welded<00:07:03.490> on

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
there's a 3/4 drive socket welded on

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.909 
there's a 3/4 drive socket welded on
backwards<00:07:04.030> to<00:07:04.180> another<00:07:04.419> socket<00:07:04.840> that<00:07:05.650> drives

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 
backwards to another socket that drives

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:19.050 
backwards to another socket that drives
that<00:07:06.039> square<00:07:15.780> anyway<00:07:16.780> so<00:07:17.520> what<00:07:18.520> that<00:07:18.669> does<00:07:18.880> is

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:19.060 
that square anyway so what that does is

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:31.369 
that square anyway so what that does is
that<00:07:19.090> he's<00:07:19.450> got<00:07:19.570> angle<00:07:19.870> on<00:07:19.990> top<00:07:20.139> and<00:07:20.289> bottom

00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:31.379 

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:34.110 

that's<00:07:32.379> what<00:07:32.530> gives<00:07:32.710> you<00:07:32.830> your<00:07:32.979> bins<00:07:33.340> and<00:07:33.610> then

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 
that's what gives you your bins and then

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.550 
that's what gives you your bins and then
what<00:07:34.659> I<00:07:34.690> did<00:07:34.780> was<00:07:34.900> they<00:07:35.020> just<00:07:35.199> flipped<00:07:35.379> it<00:07:35.440> over

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:35.560 
what I did was they just flipped it over

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.020 
what I did was they just flipped it over
and<00:07:35.770> I<00:07:35.800> hit<00:07:36.220> the<00:07:36.340> top<00:07:36.550> one<00:07:38.699> stuck<00:07:39.699> it<00:07:39.789> in<00:07:39.909> like

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.030 
and I hit the top one stuck it in like

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.279 
and I hit the top one stuck it in like
that<00:07:40.180> and<00:07:40.240> it<00:07:40.449> just<00:07:40.479> chewed<00:07:40.900> up<00:07:41.050> the<00:07:41.080> other

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:41.289 
that and it just chewed up the other

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:44.369 
that and it just chewed up the other
edge<00:07:42.090> so<00:07:43.090> what<00:07:43.240> this<00:07:43.389> is<00:07:43.539> a<00:07:43.629> 14-gauge<00:07:44.139> by<00:07:44.319> the

00:07:44.369 --> 00:07:44.379 
edge so what this is a 14-gauge by the

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:46.890 
edge so what this is a 14-gauge by the
way<00:07:44.639> it's<00:07:45.639> the<00:07:45.819> same<00:07:46.240> as<00:07:46.389> what<00:07:46.539> the<00:07:46.599> bus<00:07:46.750> was

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:46.900 
way it's the same as what the bus was

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.339 
way it's the same as what the bus was
made<00:07:47.080> out<00:07:47.110> I<00:07:47.259> have<00:07:47.530> to<00:07:47.650> watch<00:07:47.830> my<00:07:47.860> thickness<00:07:48.460> I

00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:49.349 
made out I have to watch my thickness I

00:07:49.349 --> 00:07:51.570 
made out I have to watch my thickness I
wanted<00:07:50.349> to<00:07:50.440> make<00:07:50.530> it<00:07:50.620> out<00:07:50.710> of<00:07:50.830> eighth<00:07:50.949> but<00:07:51.280> I

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:51.580 
wanted to make it out of eighth but I

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.100 
wanted to make it out of eighth but I
can't<00:07:52.180> be<00:07:52.270> a<00:07:52.330> little<00:07:52.419> too<00:07:52.690> fat<00:07:52.930> because

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.110 
can't be a little too fat because

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.390 
can't be a little too fat because
there's<00:07:53.259> a<00:07:53.319> bunch<00:07:53.409> of<00:07:53.590> stuff<00:07:53.770> that<00:07:53.800> it<00:07:54.099> has<00:07:54.250> to

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:54.400 
there's a bunch of stuff that it has to

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.189 
there's a bunch of stuff that it has to
slip<00:07:54.639> over<00:07:54.819> and<00:07:55.180> you<00:07:55.659> got<00:07:55.810> a<00:07:55.840> little<00:07:55.960> bit<00:07:56.139> of

00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:56.199 
slip over and you got a little bit of

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:58.980 
slip over and you got a little bit of
fudge<00:07:56.349> room<00:07:56.500> but<00:07:56.710> not<00:07:56.800> too<00:07:56.949> much<00:07:57.099> so<00:07:57.870> all<00:07:58.870> right
