00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello everyone my name is ash and good 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.320
 to the review of the mod which 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.540
 called everyone hello my name is ouch 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.630
 welcome to the fashion review which 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.820
 translated from English as 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.609
 metal rods and their own 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.160
 craft in the middle just put two 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.279
 scroll either iron or lettuce friend over 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.000
 friend and get here such here 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.740
 metal shelves roughly also this 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.020
 mod adds an iron hatch which 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.530
 you can not open my hand I just failed 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.700
 some kind of roadstone signal that's it 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.180
 craft it looks like 6 iron bars 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:48.329
 located at the bottom of the crafting field further 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.160
 follow a variety of crafting recipes 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.719
 associated with these rods 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.610
 here for example the crafting recipe for ordinary rails 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.430
 so here is just 6 rods and one stick 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.399
 in the middle here is the recipe for crafting energy 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.270
 rails and below it follows the recipe 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:10.380
 crafting rail with sensor is not all 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.650
 this mod also adds an alternate 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.250
 recipe grids now they can be crafted 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.220
 like a fence of 6 iron rods like this 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.430
 Here it looks and in principle on this all 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.259
 and there is one more thing that I forgot 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.790
 this 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.270
 various tools here 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.350
 huge amount more how much 22 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.409
 pieces and the same number of balls as 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.990
 it works you just instead of the usual 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.570
 wooden sticks that were put before 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.290
 can either put gold or 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.049
 iron by this you very dramatically increase 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.750
 the lifetime of your tools because 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.509
 what is it like 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.719
 undeniable that tool with wooden 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.369
 wooden handle will last less than 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.570
 tool with iron or more so 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.509
 golden hilt 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.719
 see for yourself how many here 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.789
 a variety of things but with iron or 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.160
 golden handle you will not succeed 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.660
 make wooden tools 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.170
 although i don't 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.830
 Why do wooden tools with 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.930
 with an iron handle 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.930
 small mod was today in my review
