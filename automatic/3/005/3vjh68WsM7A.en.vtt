it with just consistency now if you are

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.270 
it with just consistency now if you are
going<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.970> use<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.509> aloe<00:01:33.689> vera<00:01:33.840> gel<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:35.070> could

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
going to use the aloe vera gel you could

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.660 
going to use the aloe vera gel you could
use<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:36.290> little<00:01:37.290> less<00:01:37.530> clay<00:01:38.040> because<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> aloe

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
use a little less clay because the aloe

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.160 
use a little less clay because the aloe
vera<00:01:38.939> isn't<00:01:39.299> going<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.479> water<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.750> down<00:01:39.990> as

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
vera isn't going to water it down as

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.569 
vera isn't going to water it down as
much<00:01:40.200> because<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.920> little<00:01:41.130> bit<00:01:41.280> thicker

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
much because it's a little bit thicker

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.300 
much because it's a little bit thicker
and<00:01:42.150> because<00:01:42.780> it's<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.049> gel<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.799> can<00:01:44.130> kind

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
and because it's a gel so you can kind

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.730 
and because it's a gel so you can kind
of<00:01:44.340> play<00:01:44.549> with<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.149> adjust<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.990> found

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740

long period of time you just want to

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.350 
long period of time you just want to

place<00:04:53.690> you<00:04:53.720> can<00:04:54.020> even<00:04:54.139> keep<00:04:54.410> it<00:04:54.500> in<00:04:54.590> the<00:04:54.680> fridge

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
place you can even keep it in the fridge

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.339 
place you can even keep it in the fridge
like<00:04:55.190> if<00:04:55.340> you<00:04:55.460> put<00:04:55.639> it<00:04:55.729> in<00:04:55.849> a<00:04:55.970> glass<00:04:56.900> container

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
like if you put it in a glass container

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.469 
like if you put it in a glass container
a<00:04:57.979> small<00:04:58.250> glass<00:04:58.490> container<00:04:58.970> you<00:04:59.180> can<00:04:59.300> make<00:04:59.450> a

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
a small glass container you can make a

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.180 
a small glass container you can make a
big<00:04:59.780> batch<00:04:59.990> of<00:05:00.020> this<00:05:00.320> this<00:05:00.680> is<00:05:00.889> probably

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
big batch of this this is probably

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.020 
big batch of this this is probably
enough<00:05:01.490> for<00:05:01.820> like<00:05:02.510> two<00:05:02.960> mats<00:05:03.789> probably<00:05:04.789> maybe

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
enough for like two mats probably maybe

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.060 
enough for like two mats probably maybe
even<00:05:05.450> more<00:05:05.690> probably<00:05:06.410> more<00:05:06.500> like<00:05:06.710> three

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
even more probably more like three

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.070 
even more probably more like three
minutes<00:05:07.280> because<00:05:07.910> we<00:05:08.060> use<00:05:08.240> the<00:05:08.419> water<00:05:08.570> so<00:05:08.960> it

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
minutes because we use the water so it

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.219 
minutes because we use the water so it
spreads<00:05:09.380> it<00:05:09.500> out<00:05:09.620> a<00:05:09.650> little<00:05:09.830> bit<00:05:09.950> more<00:05:10.720> so<00:05:11.720> you

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
spreads it out a little bit more so you

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:13.719 
spreads it out a little bit more so you
can<00:05:12.410> keep<00:05:12.590> it<00:05:12.770> in<00:05:12.860> the<00:05:12.950> fridge<00:05:13.160> because<00:05:13.460> you

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
can keep it in the fridge because you

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.400 
can keep it in the fridge because you
want<00:05:13.940> to<00:05:14.120> keep<00:05:14.330> the<00:05:14.570> essential<00:05:14.960> oils<00:05:15.289> out<00:05:15.349> of

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
want to keep the essential oils out of

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.990 
want to keep the essential oils out of
certain<00:05:15.620> temperature<00:05:16.130> so<00:05:16.340> they<00:05:16.460> don't<00:05:16.639> start

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
certain temperature so they don't start

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.820 
certain temperature so they don't start
to<00:05:17.210> go<00:05:17.330> bad<00:05:17.539> and<00:05:17.870> oxidize<00:05:19.599> so<00:05:20.599> when<00:05:21.470> you<00:05:21.620> do

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
to go bad and oxidize so when you do

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.370 
to go bad and oxidize so when you do
decide<00:05:22.460> to<00:05:22.520> use<00:05:22.729> this<00:05:23.210> especially<00:05:23.750> if<00:05:24.200> you've

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
decide to use this especially if you've

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.710 
decide to use this especially if you've
been<00:05:24.410> keeping<00:05:24.740> it<00:05:25.070> stored<00:05:25.610> in<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.090> fridge<00:05:26.360> or

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
been keeping it stored in the fridge or

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.629 
been keeping it stored in the fridge or
someplace<00:05:26.900> cool<00:05:27.440> you<00:05:27.979> want<00:05:28.130> to<00:05:28.190> just<00:05:28.340> give<00:05:28.550> it

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
someplace cool you want to just give it

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:29.290 
someplace cool you want to just give it
a<00:05:28.729> stir

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
a stir

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.999 
a stir
right<00:05:29.599> before<00:05:29.750> you<00:05:30.020> use<00:05:30.259> it<00:05:30.440> because<00:05:30.590> a<00:05:30.710> lot<00:05:30.800> of

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009 
right before you use it because a lot of

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.860 
right before you use it because a lot of
times<00:05:31.190> the<00:05:31.370> oils<00:05:31.729> will<00:05:32.000> start<00:05:32.300> to<00:05:32.449> separate

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
times the oils will start to separate

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.659 
times the oils will start to separate
depending<00:05:33.379> on<00:05:33.470> how<00:05:33.650> long<00:05:33.830> it's<00:05:34.069> been<00:05:34.159> since

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
depending on how long it's been since

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.839 
depending on how long it's been since
you've<00:05:34.940> mixed<00:05:35.930> it<00:05:36.110> up<00:05:36.259> so<00:05:37.129> just<00:05:37.460> give<00:05:37.699> it<00:05:37.789> a

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
you've mixed it up so just give it a

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:39.279 
you've mixed it up so just give it a
good<00:05:37.970> stir<00:05:38.240> and<00:05:38.360> make<00:05:38.509> sure<00:05:38.690> it's<00:05:38.810> nice<00:05:39.050> and

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.330 
like antibacterial qualities and other
qualities<00:06:03.620> that<00:06:03.650> are<00:06:03.919> really<00:06:04.159> good<00:06:04.310> for

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
qualities that are really good for

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.029 
qualities that are really good for
healing<00:06:04.729> acne<00:06:05.030> and<00:06:05.449> just<00:06:05.629> really<00:06:05.930> good<00:06:06.139> in

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
healing acne and just really good in

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:09.939 
healing acne and just really good in
general<00:06:07.460> for<00:06:07.729> keeping<00:06:08.030> your<00:06:08.840> skin<00:06:09.020> clean<00:06:09.500> and

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699 
so it's also like it's working on that

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:17.200 
so it's also like it's working on that
into<00:06:14.120> not<00:06:14.389> just<00:06:14.500> moisturizing<00:06:15.520> so<00:06:16.520> I<00:06:16.909> usually

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
into not just moisturizing so I usually

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.700 
into not just moisturizing so I usually
just<00:06:17.569> give<00:06:17.719> a<00:06:17.750> big<00:06:17.960> glob<00:06:18.169> on<00:06:18.319> my<00:06:18.379> finger<00:06:18.680> and

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
just give a big glob on my finger and

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.709 
just give a big glob on my finger and
start<00:06:19.219> right<00:06:19.400> here<00:06:19.759> like<00:06:20.030> at<00:06:20.150> my<00:06:20.270> third<00:06:20.509> eye

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:20.719 
start right here like at my third eye

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:23.020 
start right here like at my third eye
and<00:06:21.080> then<00:06:21.530> I<00:06:21.590> come<00:06:21.830> up<00:06:22.009> and<00:06:22.159> around<00:06:22.400> and<00:06:22.940> I

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
and then I come up and around and I

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.180 
and then I come up and around and I
outline<00:06:23.449> my<00:06:23.629> eyes<00:06:23.840> I<00:06:25.389> do<00:06:26.389> it<00:06:26.599> over<00:06:26.750> here<00:06:27.190> and

the jawline and the forehead and the
hairline<00:06:34.940> and<00:06:35.240> just<00:06:35.449> make<00:06:35.630> sure<00:06:35.840> that<00:06:35.870> you're

not getting it too close to your eye and

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.860 
not getting it too close to your eye and

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419 
it's not really for that purpose lightly

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:46.719 
it's not really for that purpose lightly
pull<00:06:44.810> it<00:06:45.020> over<00:06:45.500> to<00:06:45.680> the<00:06:45.830> side<00:06:46.130> so<00:06:46.159> like<00:06:46.550> nice

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729 
pull it over to the side so like nice

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.300 
pull it over to the side so like nice
straight<00:06:47.270> slow<00:06:47.750> lines<00:06:48.050> and<00:06:48.770> you'll<00:06:48.919> see<00:06:49.130> that

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310 
straight slow lines and you'll see that

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.879 
straight slow lines and you'll see that
it<00:06:49.460> will<00:06:49.490> be<00:06:50.090> nice<00:06:50.419> and<00:06:50.840> smooth<00:06:51.229> that<00:06:51.529> way<00:06:51.710> and

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:51.889 
it will be nice and smooth that way and

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:54.430 
it will be nice and smooth that way and
you<00:06:51.979> can<00:06:52.130> kind<00:06:52.310> of<00:06:52.370> just<00:06:52.550> do<00:06:53.150> that<00:06:53.330> all<00:06:53.690> the<00:06:53.719> way

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 
you can kind of just do that all the way

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.610 
you can kind of just do that all the way
down<00:06:54.590> your<00:06:55.279> face<00:06:55.550> and<00:06:56.180> then<00:06:56.810> you<00:06:57.080> just<00:06:57.289> let<00:06:57.500> it

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
down your face and then you just let it

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.040 
down your face and then you just let it
dry<00:06:57.889> and<00:06:58.400> it<00:06:58.639> only<00:06:58.819> takes<00:06:59.120> about<00:06:59.300> 20<00:07:00.020> minutes

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.050 
dry and it only takes about 20 minutes

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.080 
dry and it only takes about 20 minutes
depending<00:07:00.680> on<00:07:00.800> how<00:07:00.949> thick<00:07:01.279> you<00:07:01.400> put<00:07:01.610> it<00:07:01.699> on<00:07:01.849> or

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.090 
depending on how thick you put it on or

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.180 
depending on how thick you put it on or
how<00:07:02.180> thin<00:07:02.389> you<00:07:02.479> put<00:07:02.659> it<00:07:02.750> on<00:07:02.900> you<00:07:03.710> can<00:07:03.740> always

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.190 
how thin you put it on you can always

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.700 
how thin you put it on you can always
thin<00:07:04.460> it<00:07:04.580> out<00:07:04.669> with<00:07:04.729> more<00:07:05.150> water<00:07:05.419> and<00:07:05.870> if<00:07:06.560> you

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710 
thin it out with more water and if you

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.070 
thin it out with more water and if you
do<00:07:06.949> use<00:07:07.190> aloe<00:07:07.430> vera<00:07:07.669> gel<00:07:08.060> it<00:07:08.449> does<00:07:08.750> take<00:07:09.050> longer

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080 
do use aloe vera gel it does take longer

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.290 
do use aloe vera gel it does take longer
to<00:07:09.590> dry<00:07:09.740> because<00:07:10.039> it's<00:07:10.370> more<00:07:10.580> of<00:07:10.669> a<00:07:10.729> gel<00:07:10.969> and

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:11.300 
to dry because it's more of a gel and

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.719 
to dry because it's more of a gel and
it's<00:07:11.419> the<00:07:11.930> goopy<00:07:12.289> and<00:07:12.319> it's<00:07:12.800> it's<00:07:13.159> not<00:07:13.370> going

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:13.729 
it's the goopy and it's it's not going

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:17.830 
it's the goopy and it's it's not going
to<00:07:13.909> dry<00:07:14.120> out<00:07:14.150> as<00:07:14.479> quick<00:07:14.810> as<00:07:15.050> the<00:07:15.590> water<00:07:15.800> will<00:07:16.840> so

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 
to dry out as quick as the water will so

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.450 
to dry out as quick as the water will so
take<00:07:18.050> that<00:07:18.199> into<00:07:18.440> consideration<00:07:18.560> when<00:07:19.340> you're

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:19.460 
take that into consideration when you're

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.939 
take that into consideration when you're
making<00:07:19.669> your<00:07:19.789> recipe<00:07:20.330> and<00:07:20.569> then<00:07:21.529> once<00:07:21.800> it

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:21.949 
making your recipe and then once it

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:23.559 
making your recipe and then once it
dries<00:07:22.190> it<00:07:22.219> will<00:07:22.520> actually<00:07:22.849> start<00:07:23.090> to<00:07:23.150> crack

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:23.569 
dries it will actually start to crack

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:26.589 
dries it will actually start to crack
and<00:07:24.020> so<00:07:24.229> what<00:07:24.409> I<00:07:24.440> do<00:07:24.560> then<00:07:25.009> is<00:07:25.400> I<00:07:26.000> just<00:07:26.060> go<00:07:26.360> over

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:26.599 
and so what I do then is I just go over

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:28.689 
and so what I do then is I just go over
a<00:07:26.719> garbage<00:07:27.020> and<00:07:27.500> I<00:07:27.560> just<00:07:27.800> take<00:07:27.919> my<00:07:28.069> fingers<00:07:28.460> and

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:28.699 
a garbage and I just take my fingers and

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:30.200 
a garbage and I just take my fingers and
start<00:07:28.909> kind<00:07:29.180> of<00:07:29.240> rubbing<00:07:29.599> the<00:07:29.750> edge

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.210 
start kind of rubbing the edge

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.960 
start kind of rubbing the edge
and<00:07:30.479> it'll<00:07:30.660> just<00:07:30.840> start<00:07:31.380> falling<00:07:31.590> off<00:07:31.979> and<00:07:32.430> so

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:32.970 
and it'll just start falling off and so

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.820 
and it'll just start falling off and so
I<00:07:33.000> just<00:07:33.210> go<00:07:33.330> do<00:07:33.539> that<00:07:33.720> and<00:07:33.780> then<00:07:34.259> I<00:07:34.350> just<00:07:34.380> do<00:07:34.800> it

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:34.830 
I just go do that and then I just do it

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.650 
I just go do that and then I just do it
all<00:07:34.979> over<00:07:35.190> my<00:07:35.340> face<00:07:35.370> until<00:07:36.000> I<00:07:36.270> get<00:07:36.419> to<00:07:36.570> the

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:36.660 
all over my face until I get to the

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.010 
all over my face until I get to the
point<00:07:36.900> where<00:07:37.550> not<00:07:38.550> much<00:07:38.970> release<00:07:39.449> coming<00:07:39.810> off

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.020 
point where not much release coming off

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.290 
point where not much release coming off
easily<00:07:40.530> and<00:07:40.830> then<00:07:41.070> I'll<00:07:41.430> go<00:07:41.580> to<00:07:41.610> the<00:07:41.789> sink<00:07:42.060> and

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:42.300 
easily and then I'll go to the sink and

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.960
