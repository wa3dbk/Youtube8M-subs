00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.219
 obviously it's something that pleases 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.139
 many photos are stopped in the street 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.470
 so many kids with enthusiasm like it 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.369
 they are transmitting and therefore not 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.849
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.250
 because the field I miss a lot but 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.100
 there is still some work to be done though 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.560
 time is slowly getting better 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.150
 more and more a physical enough 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.899
 important so maybe they put us a 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.129
 little more but the important thing then 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.320
 keep it for the whole year because at 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:41.729
 end of the championship is long and hard 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.649
 I've done my whole career of 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:46.379
 staying also for salvation is what goes 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.729
 so I want to win and so this is it 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.889
 an important project beautiful square e 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:54.239
 therefore important how to do the 

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:56.129
 championship at the top 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.440
 they told me I had done for five days 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.809
 just to convince me more 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.940
 family remains but it is even if by now the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.940
 decision had been made I ca n't 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.580
 offer but let's say I was already thinking 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.540
 convincing and then hearing many 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.400
 positive comments especially for the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.670
 city ​​and for the people because of the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.300
 team of the square I already knew 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.330
 he has instead played against often therefore 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:29.700
 that didn't help me much though 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.550
 already with the first meeting were 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.080
 positive sensations whose gordon to one 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.530
 important challenge when I was with the 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.780
 chievo verona in a series that was a challenge 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.290
 salvation we can say that we won then 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.930
 in the end he won lecce 3 to 2 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.230
 an incredible comeback public push 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.410
 so but I played practically 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.270
 anywhere in front if with more attackers 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.900
 quick to attack together 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.320
 physically important so I don't have 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.210
 problems also because we are not alone in 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.540
 two a 3 playing in front there is all the 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.580
 team support therefore not 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.730
 I thought I could coexist well between teams there 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.430
 must be precise balances 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:20.020
 then there are no bands to play too 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.760
 now let 's start the championship if 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.530
 things could be fine on the pitch 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.740
 do something definitely something out 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.850
 if there are people, they can appreciate one 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:34.180
 what a nice cute because I live it 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.070
 so always especially joke things 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:45.430
 often sat at the right time of 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:49.690
 do it here you want this question us 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:54.330
 let's talk a bit from the do 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.409
 giallorossa later 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.450
 what they passed by so the 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.670
 lecce we are still there to incite the 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.909
 team on the first day of August instead of 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.060
 going to the sea are to be admired and that 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:10.629
 surely you know I said I have 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.000
 always seen the opponents however with already 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:16.090
 they admire them because in their minds the squares 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.250
 hot type regardless of the meyer in 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.170
 doses is always nice to play with 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.170
 large audience even if you are an opponent
