00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
sabotage but with a flag instead there's

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.709 
sabotage but with a flag instead there's
one<00:00:31.769> flag<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.250> spawns<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.270> map<00:00:33.540> that's

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
one flag that spawns in the map that's

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.389 
one flag that spawns in the map that's
neutral<00:00:34.230> both<00:00:34.530> teams<00:00:34.800> have<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.190> basically

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
neutral both teams have to basically

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.209 
neutral both teams have to basically
capture<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.270> then<00:00:36.809> take<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.739> enemy

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
capture it and then take it to the enemy

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.950 
capture it and then take it to the enemy
spawn<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.820> rush<00:00:39.030> all<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.480> way<00:00:39.629> into

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
spawn you have to rush all the way into

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.040 
spawn you have to rush all the way into
the<00:00:40.290> enemy<00:00:40.530> spawn<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.160> then<00:00:42.059> plant<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.719> there

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
the enemy spawn and then plant it there

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.500 
the enemy spawn and then plant it there
or<00:00:43.290> make<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> capture<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.210> it's

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
or make a capture so it's it's

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.060 
or make a capture so it's it's
essentially<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> same<00:00:46.230> thing<00:00:46.500> as<00:00:46.620> sabotage

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
essentially the same thing as sabotage

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.369 
essentially the same thing as sabotage
but<00:00:47.370> instead<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.789> actually<00:00:48.210> planting<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.170> bomb

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
but instead of actually planting a bomb

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.619 
but instead of actually planting a bomb
in<00:00:49.649> their<00:00:49.829> spawn<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.340> has<00:00:50.489> like<00:00:50.760> 40<00:00:51.210> seconds

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
in their spawn that has like 40 seconds

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.660 
in their spawn that has like 40 seconds
or<00:00:51.719> 45<00:00:52.079> seconds<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.590> go<00:00:52.739> off<00:00:52.949> all<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.489> need<00:00:53.640> to

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
or 45 seconds to go off all you need to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.490 
or 45 seconds to go off all you need to
do<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:53.969> capture<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> flag<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
do is just capture the flag and the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.110 
do is just capture the flag and the
points<00:00:55.829> go<00:00:56.010> up<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.460> have<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.699> score<00:00:56.910> more

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
points go up you have to score more

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.689 
points go up you have to score more
points<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.449> your<00:00:57.600> team<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.579> then<00:00:59.579> eventually

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
points for your team and then eventually

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.369 
points for your team and then eventually
later<00:01:00.180> down<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.359> line<00:01:00.480> you'll<00:01:00.750> switch<00:01:01.020> sides

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
later down the line you'll switch sides

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.380 
later down the line you'll switch sides
and<00:01:01.649> if<00:01:01.949> you're<00:01:02.129> tying<00:01:02.460> then<00:01:02.940> they'll<00:01:03.120> be<00:01:03.270> in

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
and if you're tying then they'll be in

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.390 
and if you're tying then they'll be in
overtime<00:01:03.960> now<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.290> game<00:01:04.470> mode<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.799> very<00:01:05.070> very

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
overtime now this game mode is very very

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.210 
overtime now this game mode is very very
crazy<00:01:05.850> because<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.409> say<00:01:07.740> there's<00:01:07.979> not

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
crazy because as I say there's not

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.370 
crazy because as I say there's not
essentially<00:01:09.030> two<00:01:09.299> flags<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.930> map<00:01:10.200> but

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
essentially two flags on the map but

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.440 
essentially two flags on the map but
there's<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:10.799> which<00:01:11.070> means<00:01:11.210> everyone's<00:01:12.210> going

there's one which means everyone's going
for<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.659> one<00:01:12.720> point<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.350> one<00:01:13.619> map<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.130> it

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
for this one point this one map and it

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.460 
for this one point this one map and it
is<00:01:14.610> absolutely<00:01:14.939> crazy<00:01:15.479> here<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.140> got<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> few

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.640 
is absolutely crazy here I got a few
games<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.950> there<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.460> map<00:01:18.140> hijacked<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.380> it

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
games on there the map hijacked and it

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.469 
games on there the map hijacked and it
was<00:01:19.890> very<00:01:20.189> very<00:01:20.340> crazy<00:01:20.640> because<00:01:20.880> everyone

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
was very very crazy because everyone

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.120 
was very very crazy because everyone
seems<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.780> be<00:01:21.869> underground<00:01:22.380> because<00:01:22.710> quite<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
seems to be underground because quite a

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.370 
seems to be underground because quite a
good<00:01:23.310> tactic<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.030> because<00:01:24.900> that's<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.170> best

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
good tactic and because that's the best

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.929 
good tactic and because that's the best
way<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> kind<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.920> sneak<00:01:26.009> under<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.549> map<00:01:26.759> and

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
way to kind of sneak under the map and

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.670 
way to kind of sneak under the map and
it's<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> same<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.689> capture<00:01:28.110> flag<00:01:28.409> when<00:01:28.619> you

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
it's the same as capture flag when you

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.230 
it's the same as capture flag when you
actually<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.430> flag<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.030> you're<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
flag carrier there is big kill sign over

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.280 
flag carrier there is big kill sign over
your<00:01:32.759> head<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.390> everyone's<00:01:33.780> going<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.200> you

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
like that on them and it just has some

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.580 
like that on them and it just has some
really<00:01:48.149> really<00:01:48.600> epic<00:01:48.869> moments<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:49.439> this

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
really really epic moments like this

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.710 
really really epic moments like this
I'll<00:01:49.799> just<00:01:49.829> door<00:01:50.070> from<00:01:50.280> dived<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.820> managed<00:01:51.509> to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
I'll just door from dived and managed to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.210

get<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.079> equalized<00:01:52.439> for<00:01:52.649> my<00:01:52.740> team<00:01:52.979> and

get the equalized for my team and

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.130

because<00:01:54.090> without<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.329> we<00:01:54.630> probably<00:01:54.869> put<00:01:55.110> a

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
because without that we probably put a

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.200 
because without that we probably put a
loss<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:56.009> has<00:01:56.250> some<00:01:56.430> definitely<00:01:56.850> very

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
loss but it has some definitely very

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.840 
loss but it has some definitely very
epic<00:01:57.600> moments<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.280> it's<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.460> lot<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.670> fun<00:01:59.820> i
