00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.860 
puts the coordinates of where the text
will<00:03:23.620> be<00:03:23.770> displayed<00:03:24.040> or<00:03:24.730> where<00:03:25.000> our<00:03:25.300> time<00:03:25.630> will

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
will be displayed or where our time will

will be displayed or where our time will
be<00:03:26.020> displayed<00:03:26.980> so<00:03:27.270> we're<00:03:28.270> gonna<00:03:28.360> do<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.510> similar

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
be displayed so we're gonna do a similar

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.300 
be displayed so we're gonna do a similar
function<00:03:29.050> as<00:03:29.800> well<00:03:30.040> so<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:31.360> want<00:03:31.750> us<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:32.020> write

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
function as well so you want us to write

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
function as well so you want us to write
but<00:03:33.310> instead<00:03:33.550> of<00:03:33.610> putting<00:03:33.820> say<00:03:34.420> like<00:03:34.920> hello

sprocket<00:03:40.090> we're<00:03:40.690> gonna<00:03:40.780> put<00:03:41.020> want<00:03:41.320> and

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
sprocket we're gonna put want and

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:50.190 
sprocket we're gonna put want and
bracket<00:03:42.390> text<00:03:43.390> utils<00:03:44.340> dot<00:03:46.080> format<00:03:48.000> time<00:03:49.200> and

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
bracket text utils dot format time and

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.260 
bracket text utils dot format time and
then<00:03:50.680> we're<00:03:50.830> gonna<00:03:50.950> another<00:03:51.550> open<00:03:51.880> bracket

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
then we're gonna another open bracket

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.750 
then we're gonna another open bracket
sign<00:03:52.420> go<00:03:53.410> or<00:03:53.770> we're<00:03:54.580> stop<00:03:55.180> tying<00:03:56.520> then<00:03:57.520> that's

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
sign go or we're stop tying then that's

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.370 
sign go or we're stop tying then that's
a<00:03:57.880> function<00:03:58.090> so<00:03:58.510> there<00:03:58.840> we<00:03:58.959> have<00:03:59.080> our<00:03:59.110> function

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
a function so there we have our function

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.650 
a function so there we have our function
and<00:03:59.740> I<00:03:59.800> just<00:04:00.160> put<00:04:00.370> a<00:04:00.400> zero<00:04:00.700> and<00:04:00.850> stem<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:01.180> all<00:04:01.360> I

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
and I just put a zero and stem and all I

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.860 
and I just put a zero and stem and all I
do<00:04:01.840> that<00:04:02.080> often<00:04:03.090> cuz<00:04:04.090> I'm<00:04:04.209> an<00:04:04.300> idiot

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
do that often cuz I'm an idiot

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.020 
do that often cuz I'm an idiot
and<00:04:05.080> we're<00:04:05.890> gonna<00:04:05.980> put<00:04:06.190> a<00:04:06.220> call<00:04:06.430> on<00:04:06.610> and<00:04:06.880> then

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
and we're gonna put a call on and then

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.080 
and we're gonna put a call on and then
put<00:04:07.390> the<00:04:08.170> true<00:04:08.380> so<00:04:08.980> that's<00:04:09.280> where<00:04:09.550> the<00:04:09.700> true<00:04:09.910> is

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
put the true so that's where the true is

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.050 
put the true so that's where the true is
so<00:04:10.600> obviously<00:04:10.959> mild<00:04:11.709> true<00:04:12.040> and<00:04:12.370> since<00:04:12.910> we're

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
so obviously mild true and since we're

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.039 
so obviously mild true and since we're
saying<00:04:13.239> it<00:04:13.390> is<00:04:13.540> true<00:04:13.840> it<00:04:14.350> will<00:04:14.410> do<00:04:14.709> it

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
saying it is true it will do it

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.920 
saying it is true it will do it
hopefully<00:04:17.049> that<00:04:17.380> makes<00:04:17.590> sense<00:04:17.770> to<00:04:17.950> everyone

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
hopefully that makes sense to everyone

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.180 
hopefully that makes sense to everyone
since<00:04:19.930> this<00:04:20.080> is<00:04:20.260> all<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.590> monitors<00:04:20.950> that<00:04:21.100> we

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
since this is all the monitors that we

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.830 
since this is all the monitors that we
have<00:04:21.400> at<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.609> minute<00:04:21.910> we<00:04:22.300> don't<00:04:22.419> need<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.690> put

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
have at the minute we don't need to put

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.469 
have at the minute we don't need to put
any<00:04:22.990> more<00:04:23.229> in<00:04:23.290> the<00:04:23.650> actual<00:04:24.070> and<00:04:24.280> body<00:04:24.550> of<00:04:24.820> the

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
any more in the actual and body of the

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.480 
any more in the actual and body of the
cord<00:04:25.750> so<00:04:25.990> we<00:04:26.590> can<00:04:26.710> just<00:04:26.860> end<00:04:26.919> up<00:04:27.130> what

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
cord so we can just end up what

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.529 
cord so we can just end up what
and<00:04:28.060> then<00:04:28.630> we<00:04:28.840> can<00:04:29.699> just<00:04:30.699> follow<00:04:30.910> it<00:04:31.180> up<00:04:31.300> with

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
and then we can just follow it up with

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:39.809 
and then we can just follow it up with
putting<00:04:32.340> monitor<00:04:34.050> dot<00:04:35.160> restore<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:39.340> what<00:04:39.729> we

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:39.819 
putting monitor dot restore so what we

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:43.409 
putting monitor dot restore so what we
do<00:04:39.970> control<00:04:40.509> it's<00:04:41.380> easier<00:04:41.740> control<00:04:42.009> s<00:04:42.460> control

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
do control it's easier control s control

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.379 
do control it's easier control s control
a<00:04:43.660> and<00:04:43.930> do<00:04:44.530> that<00:04:44.710> like<00:04:44.919> light<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:45.759> fast<00:04:45.970> and

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
a and do that like light and fast and

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.200 
a and do that like light and fast and
it's<00:04:47.169> quite<00:04:47.410> good<00:04:47.440> just<00:04:48.190> if<00:04:48.520> it<00:04:48.699> ever<00:04:49.030> does

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
it's quite good just if it ever does

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.670 
it's quite good just if it ever does
flash<00:04:49.509> backwards<00:04:49.900> and<00:04:50.020> forwards<00:04:50.259> I<00:04:50.319> will<00:04:50.470> just

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
flash backwards and forwards I will just

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.390 
flash backwards and forwards I will just
say<00:04:50.770> that<00:04:50.949> and<00:04:51.069> I<00:04:51.400> can't<00:04:52.120> do<00:04:52.300> that<00:04:52.330> pretty<00:04:52.630> fast

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
say that and I can't do that pretty fast

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.430 
say that and I can't do that pretty fast
that's<00:04:54.400> always<00:04:54.580> going<00:04:54.819> to<00:04:54.910> reboot<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:55.870> comes

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
that's always going to reboot and comes

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.270 
that's always going to reboot and comes
up<00:04:56.590> yes

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
up yes

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:04.260

see it's 20 so you can get it's getting

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.510 
see it's 20 so you can get it's getting
pretty<00:05:07.270> late

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
pretty late

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.640 
pretty late
yeah<00:05:09.520> if<00:05:10.360> I<00:05:10.539> should<00:05:10.720> I<00:05:10.750> should<00:05:10.870> have<00:05:11.139> cheats<00:05:11.440> on

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
yeah if I should I should have cheats on

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:21.810 
yeah if I should I should have cheats on
so<00:05:13.110> set<00:05:14.110> time<00:05:14.789> zero<00:05:15.789> zero<00:05:16.380> yeah<00:05:18.120> dot<00:05:20.070> time<00:05:21.099> ha

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
so set time zero zero yeah dot time ha

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.260 
so set time zero zero yeah dot time ha
ha<00:05:22.000> ha<00:05:22.180> MIDI<00:05:22.509> again<00:05:22.840> things<00:05:23.050> wrong<00:05:23.289> way<00:05:23.380> around

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
ha ha MIDI again things wrong way around

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.450 
ha ha MIDI again things wrong way around
there<00:05:25.270> we<00:05:25.330> go

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
there we go

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.710 
there we go
so<00:05:27.460> I<00:05:27.490> see<00:05:27.940> and<00:05:28.090> then<00:05:28.210> it<00:05:28.300> just<00:05:28.419> comes<00:05:28.630> from

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
so I see and then it just comes from

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.990 
so I see and then it just comes from
there<00:05:29.050> so<00:05:29.740> it's<00:05:29.860> it's<00:05:30.099> very<00:05:30.190> it's<00:05:30.580> very<00:05:30.610> snazzy

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
there so it's it's very it's very snazzy

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.270 
there so it's it's very it's very snazzy
I<00:05:31.300> don't<00:05:31.840> know<00:05:31.900> why<00:05:32.050> it<00:05:32.110> has<00:05:32.380> that<00:05:32.409> third<00:05:32.860> digit

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
I don't know why it has that third digit

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.219 
I don't know why it has that third digit
but<00:05:33.550> you<00:05:33.789> can<00:05:33.909> sometimes<00:05:34.090> resize<00:05:34.659> it<00:05:34.900> just<00:05:35.080> a

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
but you can sometimes resize it just a

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.399 
but you can sometimes resize it just a
thing<00:05:35.590> just<00:05:36.460> to<00:05:36.639> show<00:05:36.849> that<00:05:37.030> -<00:05:37.360> I'm<00:05:37.930> not<00:05:38.229> sure

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409 
thing just to show that - I'm not sure

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:41.700 
thing just to show that - I'm not sure
but<00:05:38.440> it's<00:05:39.340> a<00:05:39.430> bit<00:05:39.610> odd<00:05:39.870> anyways<00:05:40.870> another<00:05:41.229> fun

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
but it's a bit odd anyways another fun

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.879 
but it's a bit odd anyways another fun
general<00:05:42.220> computer<00:05:42.909> craft<00:05:43.150> function<00:05:43.810> is<00:05:44.110> you

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
general computer craft function is you

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.980 
general computer craft function is you
kind<00:05:45.159> of<00:05:45.190> edit<00:05:45.490> on<00:05:45.610> it<00:05:45.789> this<00:05:46.000> after<00:05:46.509> we<00:05:46.599> reboot

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
kind of edit on it this after we reboot

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.260 
kind of edit on it this after we reboot
because<00:05:47.080> the<00:05:47.380> cord<00:05:48.159> cuts<00:05:48.460> out<00:05:48.610> from<00:05:48.880> editing

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
because the cord cuts out from editing

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.930 
because the cord cuts out from editing
so<00:05:50.139> what<00:05:50.320> you<00:05:50.440> want<00:05:50.650> to<00:05:50.740> do<00:05:50.830> is<00:05:51.099> to<00:05:51.370> edit<00:05:51.849> this

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
so what you want to do is to edit this

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.890 
so what you want to do is to edit this
cord<00:05:52.270> again<00:05:52.539> once<00:05:52.780> you<00:05:52.900> put<00:05:53.139> it<00:05:53.229> in<00:05:53.349> is<00:05:53.590> and

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
cord again once you put it in is and

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.540 
cord again once you put it in is and
ctrl<00:05:55.900> T<00:05:56.139> just<00:05:56.740> hold<00:05:56.919> it<00:05:57.039> down<00:05:57.070> for<00:05:57.190> a<00:05:57.400> bit

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
ctrl T just hold it down for a bit

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.330 
ctrl T just hold it down for a bit
determining<00:05:58.539> its<00:05:58.659> program<00:05:59.080> and<00:05:59.320> this<00:05:59.949> just

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
determining its program and this just

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.770 
determining its program and this just
enables<00:06:00.759> it<00:06:00.940> so<00:06:01.240> you<00:06:01.360> can<00:06:01.539> edit<00:06:01.750> edit<00:06:02.560> it<00:06:02.919> so

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
enables it so you can edit edit it so

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.839 
enables it so you can edit edit it so
the<00:06:04.780> size<00:06:05.050> of<00:06:05.259> the<00:06:05.380> text<00:06:05.590> wasn't<00:06:06.009> really<00:06:06.430> up<00:06:06.699> to

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 
the size of the text wasn't really up to

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.670 
the size of the text wasn't really up to
scratch<00:06:07.120> so<00:06:08.020> we're<00:06:08.139> just<00:06:08.169> going<00:06:08.380> to<00:06:08.409> use<00:06:08.560> the

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
scratch so we're just going to use the

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.129 
scratch so we're just going to use the
arrow<00:06:08.800> keys<00:06:09.099> to<00:06:09.130> move<00:06:09.550> back<00:06:10.090> to<00:06:10.389> where<00:06:10.840> it<00:06:11.110> was

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
arrow keys to move back to where it was

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.740 
arrow keys to move back to where it was
and<00:06:11.680> change<00:06:12.130> up<00:06:12.250> to<00:06:12.340> five<00:06:12.550> draw<00:06:13.240> less<00:06:13.419> control

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
and change up to five draw less control

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.080 
and change up to five draw less control
a<00:06:14.669> reboot<00:06:17.099> and<00:06:18.099> see<00:06:18.159> it<00:06:18.400> blocked<00:06:18.669> us<00:06:18.820> out<00:06:18.969> again

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
a reboot and see it blocked us out again

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.550 
a reboot and see it blocked us out again
but<00:06:19.449> that's<00:06:19.570> alright<00:06:19.960> because<00:06:20.020> if<00:06:20.349> you<00:06:20.440> don't

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
but that's alright because if you don't

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.279 
but that's alright because if you don't
mind<00:06:20.830> and<00:06:21.729> see<00:06:22.150> that's<00:06:22.479> a<00:06:22.599> lot<00:06:22.750> better<00:06:22.960> size

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 
mind and see that's a lot better size

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:26.159 
mind and see that's a lot better size
for<00:06:23.680> what<00:06:24.219> you<00:06:24.340> want<00:06:24.630> you<00:06:25.630> could<00:06:25.750> have<00:06:25.900> it<00:06:26.050> as

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
for what you want you could have it as

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:29.399 
for what you want you could have it as
big<00:06:26.349> as<00:06:26.440> you<00:06:26.560> want<00:06:26.770> you<00:06:27.490> put<00:06:27.699> any<00:06:27.909> value<00:06:28.300> in<00:06:28.479> it

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:29.409 
big as you want you put any value in it

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:31.200 
big as you want you put any value in it
depends<00:06:29.800> on<00:06:29.889> how<00:06:30.070> big<00:06:30.310> your<00:06:30.400> monitor<00:06:30.820> is<00:06:30.849> to<00:06:31.120> be

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
depends on how big your monitor is to be

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.540 
depends on how big your monitor is to be
honest<00:06:31.479> and<00:06:31.659> you<00:06:31.900> might<00:06:32.620> want<00:06:32.830> it<00:06:32.889> just<00:06:33.250> did<00:06:33.430> it

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
honest and you might want it just did it

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.159 
honest and you might want it just did it
a<00:06:33.580> bit<00:06:33.849> and<00:06:34.120> then<00:06:34.240> you<00:06:34.270> want<00:06:34.539> it<00:06:34.630> massive<00:06:35.490> but

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:37.169 
a bit and then you want it massive but

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:40.920 
a bit and then you want it massive but
that's<00:06:38.169> it<00:06:38.409> that's<00:06:38.919> that<00:06:39.580> didn't<00:06:39.969> this<00:06:40.300> just

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
that's it that's that didn't this just

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:41.850 
that's it that's that didn't this just
like<00:06:41.169> the<00:06:41.409> last

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
like the last

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.730 
like the last
it's<00:06:42.520> engineered<00:06:43.330> so<00:06:43.539> it<00:06:43.689> doesn't<00:06:44.500> break<00:06:44.680> when

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
it's engineered so it doesn't break when

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.480 
it's engineered so it doesn't break when
your<00:06:45.159> server<00:06:45.340> goes<00:06:45.610> off<00:06:45.849> or<00:06:46.120> and<00:06:47.340> stuff<00:06:48.340> like

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
your server goes off or and stuff like

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.520 
your server goes off or and stuff like
that<00:06:48.729> and<00:06:49.030> so<00:06:49.629> you<00:06:49.689> don't<00:06:49.840> have<00:06:49.930> to<00:06:50.050> reset<00:06:50.409> it

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:50.530 
that and so you don't have to reset it

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.040 
that and so you don't have to reset it
and<00:06:50.759> because<00:06:51.759> when<00:06:51.939> you<00:06:52.120> restart<00:06:52.449> server<00:06:52.750> all

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
and because when you restart server all

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.709 
and because when you restart server all
the<00:06:53.229> computers<00:06:53.830> rebooting<00:06:54.490> if<00:06:54.939> it<00:06:55.090> reboots<00:06:55.509> on

00:06:55.709 --> 00:06:55.719 
the computers rebooting if it reboots on
