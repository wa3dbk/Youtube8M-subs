plates<00:00:16.949> in<00:00:17.250> second<00:00:17.730> gear<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.270> know

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
plates in second gear and you know

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.540

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
dusted but as I say I think I think we

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.980 
dusted but as I say I think I think we
did<00:00:23.100> generally<00:00:23.519> play<00:00:23.730> some<00:00:23.970> nice<00:00:24.150> football<00:00:24.449> I

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
did generally play some nice football I

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.810 
did generally play some nice football I
think<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.680> biggest<00:00:25.830> thing<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.189> take<00:00:26.460> out<00:00:26.640> of

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
think the biggest thing I take out of

think the biggest thing I take out of
that<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:28.050> see<00:00:28.349> really<00:00:28.650> where

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
know no one wants to wait because we

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.700

Liverpool<00:01:42.270> but<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.960> know<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.259> probably<00:01:43.619> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
Liverpool but you know it's probably a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.560 
Liverpool but you know it's probably a
past<00:01:44.009> season<00:01:44.460> for<00:01:44.700> where<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:45.000> are<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.360> four

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
past season for where we are the four

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.149 
past season for where we are the four
teams<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.170> finished<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.560> bubbas<00:01:46.920> I've

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
teams that have finished the bubbas I've

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.490 
teams that have finished the bubbas I've
you<00:01:47.850> know<00:01:47.909> got<00:01:48.240> better<00:01:48.479> squad<00:01:48.869> some<00:01:49.140> spent

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
you know got better squad some spent

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.039 
you know got better squad some spent
more<00:01:49.829> money<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.280> general<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.119> probably

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
more money in general and probably

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.270 
more money in general and probably
should<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.530> finishing<00:01:52.829> above<00:01:53.100> us

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
should be finishing above us

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.399 
should be finishing above us
unfortunately<00:01:54.149> it's<00:01:54.299> frustrating<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.140> say

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
unfortunately it's frustrating to say

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.020 
unfortunately it's frustrating to say
because<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:56.009> know<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.280> make<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.790> look<00:01:56.880> at

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
because you know you make it you look at

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.130 
because you know you make it you look at
anything<00:01:57.210> well<00:01:57.479> that's<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.899> we're<00:01:58.049> never

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
anything well that's it we're never

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.170 
anything well that's it we're never
going<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.530> any<00:01:58.770> better<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.820> just<00:02:00.000> have

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
going to be any better but you just have

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.999 
going to be any better but you just have
to<00:02:00.299> be<00:02:00.420> realistic<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.990> say<00:02:01.229> that's<00:02:01.560> that's

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
to be realistic and say that's that's

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.980 
to be realistic and say that's that's
probably<00:02:02.520> where<00:02:02.759> where<00:02:03.149> we've<00:02:03.360> ended<00:02:03.450> up<00:02:03.719> and

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
probably where where we've ended up and

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.810 
probably where where we've ended up and
that<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.259> what<00:02:04.409> else<00:02:04.560> center<00:02:05.310> forward<00:02:05.549> and

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
that is what else center forward and

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.190 
that is what else center forward and
that<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.030> again<00:02:06.509> you've<00:02:06.689> got<00:02:06.719> extremely

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
that you again you've got extremely

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.900 
that you again you've got extremely
positive<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.740> say<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.129> if<00:02:08.310> we<00:02:08.670> divide

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
positive and say that if we divide

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.990 
positive and say that if we divide
storage<00:02:09.300> even<00:02:09.780> remotely<00:02:10.140> fit<00:02:10.500> we

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
storage even remotely fit we

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.180 
storage even remotely fit we
you<00:02:11.030> would<00:02:11.180> have<00:02:11.300> been<00:02:11.420> well<00:02:11.750> in<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.320> top<00:02:12.500> 4<00:02:12.770> so

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
you would have been well in the top 4 so

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.260 
you would have been well in the top 4 so
just<00:02:13.580> have<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.820> wait<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:13.970> see<00:02:14.060> what<00:02:14.240> happens

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
just have to wait and see what happens

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.000 
just have to wait and see what happens
