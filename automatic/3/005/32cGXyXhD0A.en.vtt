00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 the restoration of the 1974 chevette in the book 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.130
 shankar is almost done 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:18.330
 see how was the preparation of the bodywork 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:20.340
 to receive painting our chevette 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.320
 has gone through three parts in its 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.320
 restoration in car evolution 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:38.000
 it was all dismantled the ink was gone 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.000
 chosen very carefully 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.010
 the rust spots were removed in 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.160
 a meticulous work done with great 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.160
 quality 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.330
 well we're starting the third 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.330
 of 1974 Chevette Restoration 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.970
 famous shark we are on evolution here 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.830
 here by my side such valcimar is a store 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.050
 differentiated product that has a very 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.710
 It's cool to work this, we 'll see. 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.570
 shortly 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.520
 now finalizing chevette I'm seeing 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.160
 here it is almost ready for 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.710
 receive the paint what was done in this 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.320
 week our process now this 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.880
 restoration paulo does not surprise us 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.050
 amount of rust spots that 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.940
 we found this car 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.190
 the antioxidant treatment processes 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.110
 the past was not as efficient as 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.180
 people today are identifying these 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.979
 points he ended up getting a little 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.510
 more anti-corrosion treatment than 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.040
 we expected this it demands a little 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.290
 more time but nothing to disturb 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.600
 our schedule what was done to 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.070
 assume with this rust the first is 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.530
 treated inside the plate then we 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.300
 uses the tin technique to fill 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.830
 the gap you took then is filled 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.110
 with strange to return to originality 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.420
 of the drawing plate I came with the curve of the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.520
 the entire region of SÃ£o Paulo that has the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.990
 Finishing of rubber fittings 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.880
 they will receive special treatment 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.980
 a special sealant because the trend is 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.510
 that they continue to accumulate water and I 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.490
 I saw that he had to make a 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.500
 another kind of treatment how was it 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.480
 made there below the lodging of the steppe 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.160
 material does not resist corrosion and 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.119
 she took a lot of the material 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.530
 of the plate 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.230
 we had to apply a new toll 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.750
 plate make a construction of one of a 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.000
 piece cam and apply it again 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.410
 in the region of the lodging of the steppe 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.450
 now I'm realizing here that the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.180
 people are starting to sanding the car 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.790
 how does this phase have this painting? 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.019
 to be totally to get to the new 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.150
 this phase is what we call 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.890
 pickling we'll get on the bare plate 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.390
 they will take all substrate all over 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.340
 material the good part that we are 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.560
 finding only paint and varnish 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.850
 has no mass has none of one 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.250
 part that has found a repaint 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.970
 in this case it really proves the origin 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.380
 his 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.720
 so we're going to take this whole layer 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.280
 Do not come on the plate and let's get started. 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.260
 with the fund going down from below to 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.110
 top 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.019
 process has already been done on the 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.700
 trunk in the doors and hood 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.310
 we realize that he has a 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.319
 a part here is already gray. 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.970
 closed and the other 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.670
 what's happening here I'm going to smoke 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.989
 at this stage he receives a second 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.549
 layer of background that we call 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.829
 Budget control this 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.230
 irregularity of the paint this texture 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.519
 it will indicate more wind in the 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.560
 first of the list if he is still 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.950
 have any imperfections to be corrected or 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.629
 not 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.890
 in this case where the professional is 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.359
 working there we did not find any 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.220
 imperfection 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.379
 This is interesting because we can 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.760
 perceive the type of work that is 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.150
 being done right? 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.010
 a workshop - careful not this here not 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.849
 would be happening then that work 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.739
 and you realize that there is the right hand of the 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.389
 professional and letter in action is 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.269
 where he gives the final touch him 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:44.700
 practically smooths the car strokes to 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.980
 that he has the sensitivity to see 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.319
 where are the points of perfection and 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.209
 this is only really done in workshops 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.650
 who have this commitment and this 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.650
 quality of service 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.680
 and next week you will continue to 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.200
 follow here in the auto news the other 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.599
 stage of the restoration of that chevette 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.120
 will be the stage of painting where that ink 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.370
 what you saw being finally prepared 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.070
 go to the body and now we go 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.320
 take the banks of that car there in rhino 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.739
 for them to come back to their 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.739
 originality 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.520
 the chevette seats 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.860
 although they are well preserved 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.320
 were covered in leather that a 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.190
 lighter shade which flees 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.580
 original pattern at vino vino's partner store 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.050
 auto news and that works very well with 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.800
 coating of benches and plotting 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.950
 cars 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:52.960
 they returned to the original color the black that 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.960
 will give a more sober air to the shark 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:11.180
 this chevette dozens of other cars 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.850
 will be exhibited at the 13th meeting 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.300
 of old airfield field cars 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.160
 great on August 23rd and 24th 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.380
 It's going to be a great event with 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.810
 Aircraft paratroopers 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.670
 army and many other attractions 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.250
 but if you bring a pound of food 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.290
 non-perishable aircraft still competes for a 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.490
 Panoramic with Air Force Aircraft 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.490
 do not lose
