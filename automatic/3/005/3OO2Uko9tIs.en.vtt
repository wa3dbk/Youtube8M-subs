00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.060
 hello guys here we are in a new video 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.650
 of minecraft this time I bring you 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.360
 call it somehow a tutorial 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.240
 although it is not a tutorial it is a small 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.230
 trick that maybe you did not know or what 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.359
 better yes it is from the comparators that 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.489
 you are seeing here yes yes yes this is what 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.930
 more important that you are going to see from this 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.850
 video that you are seeing here that are 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.250
 appreciating that a coke a pie is 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.900
 sending a pulse of rest this I 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.489
 it seems if I am not mistaken before the others 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.850
 trying some 7 and it did not work that 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.760
 only 1.8 work and it's going to have 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.920
 many sexy utilities hop and that 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.129
 flowers good as the chestnut leaves 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:58.030
 look at a cake with a comparator to 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.979
 side is able to send 14 14 14 that I 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.559
 I know language the lock pulses of remains worth 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:05.710
 a total of 14 if you eat a bit 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.810
 of cake and will only send 12 if you eat 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.119
 two bits, then 10 if I told you that 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.400
 after holes and you eat 4 then 6 if you 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:16.750
 eat 5 then 4 if they eat you 6 then two 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:20.110
 It's great because, for example, you 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.630
 you can make an adventure map in it 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.550
 have a cake you put next to the 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.380
 cake you put to eat and if you eat 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.080
 the best a piece of cake that opens 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.540
 to the ground and you fall and how can you 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.250
 hide hide forgiveness the comparator 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.770
 Very easy, you know that if you put 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.320
 a block and then a comparator in this 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.240
 case look at the pie the block and the 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.850
 comparator emits the same pulses of 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.160
 rest although they are 14 with which you can 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.020
 hide the reston mechanism behind 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.880
 a wall and stick the object in question 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.920
 to that very wall that more tricks 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.720
 that maybe he did not know and about 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.200
 comparison of good objects first by 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.119
 what works this my theory is worth it 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.680
 it is a block composed of many blocks 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.750
 it's as if you're taking it right now 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.880
 a chest an oven and fill it is with 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.800
 eight objects and you were removing two 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.570
 then you remove all exotic and then 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.940
 I took another two from the pulse of the rest 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.590
 it would be less and less that it does not work 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.630
 exactly like that but good for what 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.160
 you understand, here it happens exactly what 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.820
 same every time you eat a piece of 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.760
 pie the block loses content and sends 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.849
 one pulse the rest in minor 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.010
 you eat a piece or a portion of that 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.720
 block as it is emitting a pulse of 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.129
 rest a minor the important thing with what 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.450
 you have to stay is that the pies 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:38.099
 they emit pulses of rest if you do not know good 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.260
 another thing that maybe you did not know or such 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.140
 and although this time it is too old 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.930
 this since the incorporation of 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.420
 cauldrons practically then I do not know if 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.629
 you will know it or not you have some calder 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.970
 milestones filled with water worth had a 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.970
 you can empty it twice 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.980
 one and one and two if I now turn to 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.530
 empty one more would remain the cauldron 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.209
 empty you are worth with a jar you start 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.829
 fill bottles I will fill them 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.019
 total of three bottles before it 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.639
 empty the cauldron because obviously it is 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.159
 same thing that happens with the cake here there 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:14.370
 a lot of water here there is a smaller portion and 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:16.109
 here and there is hardly any water with which and the 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.959
 full cauldron will emit three pulses of 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:21.150
 rest the cauldron half full only two 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.680
 Reston pulses and the cauldron that is 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.620
 point to empty that you have filled two 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.599
 bottles as it will emit a pulse of the rest 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.490
 ok I put one more so that 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:33.150
 is that it is off but emits three 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.410
 and 1 and the last the last guy quit by 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.320
 so to say it can also come to us 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.420
 well for adventure maps is that as 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.250
 it's called the language portal framework 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.590
 of the portal at last as it is called 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.450
 minecraft in Spanish does not emit a pulse 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.240
 of rest but on the contrary if 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.200
 you put an eye of ender man inside so 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:55.120
 suddenly you're going to issue 14 14 no 15 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.239
 forgiveness 15 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.730
 I do not say it's worth 15 return this rest 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.319
 with which this can also come very 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.420
 well to trolling tuba behaves the 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.920
 law and you tell your friend and emt there the 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.450
 selling eye that is missing and when you put 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.310
 the or sell suddenly to the best falls 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.069
 ceiling active lava us a comparator 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.290
 as you see here back there so that what 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.810
 you see well a comparator was activated that 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.690
 sends a pulse a dispenser and the guide 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.150
 part and nothing and it was just a video 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.770
 very fast I want to say that the 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.030
 information about the tarts I've 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.530
 taken from a video of a Thai guy 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.180
 ok you know that sometimes I get to 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.889
 see videos of reston and ended up in 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.960
 rare channels I saw it the other day before 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.760
 going to sleep seemed very curious and 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.190
 I say I want to bring it because it is a data 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.500
 very nice fresh detail for my cuit 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.030
 and I do not put the channel in the description of 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.770
 this guy in question because I saw him in 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.330
 the mobile was about to go to sleep and 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.830
 I do not have it if I find it I promise you 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.479
 so what I'll put it this way is 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.550
 I already tell you it's a Thai boy 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.530
 whether or not you were going to understand anything 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.139
 speak but good if I find it what 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.699
 I'll have to give him credit anyway because 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.200
 I did not know this about the pies and it's 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.060
 pretty cool 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.880
 the caldrons and those of the eyes of inder 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.220
 Manzi who knew it but good if he has 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.960
 liked the video and you already know a like and 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.150
 a favorite and always share it 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.020
 thank you see you in the next 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.180
 tutorial or video of whatever it was or 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.600
 thank you for watching this video 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.600
 and goodbye
