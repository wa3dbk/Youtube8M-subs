show there we're really excited about it
because<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:12.630> reel<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.200> ideal<00:00:13.980> for<00:00:14.730> drop<00:00:15.299> shot

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
because this reel is ideal for drop shot

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.400 
because this reel is ideal for drop shot
shaky<00:00:16.139> head<00:00:16.580> techniques<00:00:17.580> it's<00:00:18.570> an<00:00:18.960> aluminum

so<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.780> all<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.140> guys<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.530> can<00:00:49.649> also<00:00:49.770> while

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
so you all like guys you can also while

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.709 
so you all like guys you can also while
I<00:00:50.039> fish<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.579> real<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:51.149> great<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.629> that

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
I fish with is real it's great for that

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.410 
I fish with is real it's great for that
too<00:00:52.280> if<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.399> need<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.550> back<00:00:53.760> really<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.300> do

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
too if you need a back really you can do

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.900 
too if you need a back really you can do
so<00:00:54.890> if<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> don't<00:00:56.190> want<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.760> want<00:00:56.820> to

so if you don't want to you want to

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.790 
so if you don't want to you want to
engage<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.180> turn<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.140> your<00:00:58.500> clutch

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
engage just turn it on and your clutch

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.220 
engage just turn it on and your clutch
is<00:00:59.070> working<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.420> stopped<00:01:00.719> each<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.079> every

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
is working and it stopped each and every

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.270 
is working and it stopped each and every
time

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280
