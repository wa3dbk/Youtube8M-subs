00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
this layer off there was the original

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.840 
this layer off there was the original
picture<00:00:38.750> of<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:38.990> pug<00:00:39.200> and<00:00:39.410> then<00:00:39.980> here<00:00:40.370> is<00:00:40.550> the

eyes a little bit on the bulged outside

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.800 
eyes a little bit on the bulged outside
so<00:00:46.160> let's<00:00:46.340> go<00:00:46.460> ahead<00:00:46.490> and<00:00:46.670> turn<00:00:46.880> that<00:00:47.090> off<00:00:47.300> what

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
so let's go ahead and turn that off what

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.180 
so let's go ahead and turn that off what
I'm<00:00:47.900> going<00:00:48.079> to<00:00:48.110> do<00:00:48.290> is<00:00:48.410> I'm<00:00:48.590> going<00:00:48.620> to

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.030

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
duplicate my layer you do not have to do

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.470 
duplicate my layer you do not have to do
this<00:00:52.070> unless<00:00:52.460> you<00:00:52.610> want<00:00:52.910> to<00:00:53.000> save<00:00:53.239> the

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
this unless you want to save the

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.479 
this unless you want to save the
original<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.140> you<00:00:54.290> can<00:00:54.470> do<00:00:54.590> some<00:00:54.800> comparison

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489

size that I want to move on over to the

size that I want to move on over to the
other<00:02:25.550> one<00:02:25.970> once<00:02:26.480> again<00:02:26.630> Center<00:02:27.260> it<00:02:27.410> up<00:02:27.530> and

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
tapping gently until I get the I to

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.660 
tapping gently until I get the I to
approximately<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.590> size<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.190> I<00:02:34.250> want<00:02:34.310> now

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
approximately the size that I want now

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.340 
approximately the size that I want now
one<00:02:34.820> of<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.970> reasons<00:02:35.270> i<00:02:35.360> use<00:02:35.600> this<00:02:35.810> technique

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
one of the reasons i use this technique

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.930 
one of the reasons i use this technique
is<00:02:36.560> because<00:02:36.920> it's<00:02:37.100> a<00:02:37.220> little<00:02:37.580> bit<00:02:37.730> more

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
is because it's a little bit more

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.720 
is because it's a little bit more
believable<00:02:38.420> because<00:02:38.990> you<00:02:39.350> stopped<00:02:39.950> losing<00:02:40.400> a

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
believable because you stopped losing a

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.370 
believable because you stopped losing a
lot<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.150> detail<00:02:41.510> around<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.960> eyes<00:02:42.110> so<00:02:42.320> i'm

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
lot of the detail around the eyes so i'm

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.690 
lot of the detail around the eyes so i'm
going<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.590> keep<00:02:42.740> going<00:02:42.950> just<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.370> little<00:02:43.400> bit

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
going to keep going just a little bit

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.060 
going to keep going just a little bit
now<00:02:44.350> definitely<00:02:45.350> if<00:02:45.560> you're<00:02:45.830> going<00:02:46.010> to

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
now definitely if you're going to

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.370 
now definitely if you're going to
sharpen<00:02:46.700> your<00:02:46.790> photo<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.300> want<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:48.050> do<00:02:48.200> this

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
sharpen your photo you want to do this

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.260 
sharpen your photo you want to do this
method<00:02:48.800> before<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.550> sharpen<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.090> photo

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
method before you sharpen the photo

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.180 
method before you sharpen the photo
because<00:02:50.510> as<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:50.870> can<00:02:51.020> see<00:02:51.230> it's<00:02:51.530> getting<00:02:51.980> just

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
because as you can see it's getting just

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.190 
because as you can see it's getting just
a<00:02:52.280> little<00:02:52.310> bit<00:02:52.640> blurry<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.750> next<00:02:54.020> thing<00:02:54.140> that

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
a little bit blurry the next thing that

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.260 
a little bit blurry the next thing that
we<00:02:54.410> want<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.740> do<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:55.040> we<00:02:55.160> want<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.550> take<00:02:55.790> the

we're going to keep tapping all around

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.380 
we're going to keep tapping all around
the<00:03:04.790> edge<00:03:04.970> of<00:03:05.240> the<00:03:05.510> eye<00:03:06.520> making<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:07.790> just<00:03:08.300> a

knows some people have a little bit more
of<00:05:08.630> a<00:05:08.780> bulb<00:05:09.080> on<00:05:09.320> their<00:05:09.650> nose<00:05:09.890> and<00:05:10.190> what<00:05:10.370> we're

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
of a bulb on their nose and what we're

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.640 
of a bulb on their nose and what we're
going<00:05:10.610> to<00:05:10.730> do<00:05:10.910> is<00:05:11.060> wherever<00:05:11.360> you<00:05:11.900> want<00:05:12.170> that<00:05:12.410> to
