 render sony vegas then good 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.920
 this gif then make an approach 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.869
 to see that it is a file 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.330
 gif that has an animation 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.240
 this is a zip file I'm going to open 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.820
 double click and we see that the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.490
 animation this animation we are going to 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.580
 convert into a video in the format of 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.009
 video then well let's open sony 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.410
 vegas vegas but in this case I'm going to 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.170
 use the pro 2 and what would be 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.320
 approved se and pro 11 have this option 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.090
 to convert if in video formats in 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.210
 I do not know if previous versions 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.880
 as version 10 accept these formats 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.470
 video as git and can render it 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.060
 Well, in any video format the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.399
 I'm really unaware because I have not tried 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.920
 but hey he threw and 12 if they can 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.979
 perform this action then well this 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.630
 gif I will drag it to our line 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.880
 time of sony vegas in a new 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.470
 I'm going to drag the project 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.130
 our timeline here in the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.140
 second I want 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.159
 and now here I am going to tell me good 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.020
 he asks if he said that the 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.479
 Video settings match 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.770
 I'm going to give this means in no because 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.840
 my project is already in high definition 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.509
 here then good if it's not going to 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.840
 change the pixels then here what 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.720
 I have a hundred in 1080 but good here 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.400
 I see two black bars that I'm going 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.019
 to remove as we remove them then 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.510
 we just have to right click 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.849
 properties and in maintaining relationship of 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.980
 aspect we have to uncheck it for 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.840
 that is full plant then 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.569
 well here it has appeared to me like screen 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.489
 complete in my sony vegas here has 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.959
 detected as if it were a video because 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.700
 Well it 's here because it lasts 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.310
 as it is an animation then obviously 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.370
 lasts in this case 5 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.569
 seconds then good here I'm going to give you 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.950
 in play so that they see that if 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.290
 play the gif that happens 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.510
 the same gif that I'm going to convert into 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.400
 any video format then 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.860
 well just any gift that they have 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.720
 imported can they can even 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.580
 together all the geeks in case 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.410
 want to be good that they are several 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.590
 videos in a single video can be 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.330
 import and they will render the in this 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.430
 case or lease is only this 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.010
 how are you going to render it then I'm going to have 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:15.470
 to select all the gif and then give 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.660
 in file in render as here 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.489
 I'm going to select any format 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.959
 that I want as I said they are 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.510
 they can sell it hoisting in any 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:28.549
 format that accepts sony vegas in this 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:31.549
 case can be mobile 3g mp4 wmv this 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.049
 good many other formats also be 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.790
 here too 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.640
 well , I'm going to be more like 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.590
 avi format can give in this little eyelash 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.450
 to see what options do I have 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:47.390
 render in 720 x 60 p here I'm going to 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.970
 give in h in this case and good here in 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.769
 examine I will indicate the route where 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.310
 want the video to turn on 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.989
 wherever 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.700
 be saved I'm going to fine-tune 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.890
 save and change the route and style 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.950
 I can render it click here 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.870
 to render 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.520
 and when you're going to start doing what 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.680
 what would be the video 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.570
 and they go here we see the preview and a 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.640
 Once you want finished I can 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.200
 close here I'm going to go to the desk 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.260
 that was where I wanted them to be saved 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.170
 in this case my file is here and 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.570
 point the size you can see it is from 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.060
 600 2 megabytes but it is very heavy 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.060
 because it is in high definition and good 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.650
 because in reality avi format is not a 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.380
 test is not a compressed format 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.900
 with the comparison of mp4 that if he 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.910
 would have chosen from mp4 well it would be 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.460
 as a quarter of the weight of this 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.650
 much lighter habit but in this 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.660
 I auditioned this case to April you 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.210
 I'm going to double click to see that 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.289
 They started playing the play 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.479
 what will be the video 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.029
 I think it pixelates a bit here 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:05:00.149
 it looks like that pixelated because good 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:05:01.710
 as the original was 640 x 400 can 

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:05.909
 not how I converted it in high definition 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.399
 thousand 280 x 720 obviously large 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.439
 the image and that is pixelated this 

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:12.539
 but well they can even leave the same 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:14.669
 resolution in case you want it 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.099
 but when I'm going to make the decision to 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:19.080
 you who are going to also mention 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:22.529
 here you can select a good one 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.119
 can import an audio to this kit and 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:26.099
 good when converting into video 

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:28.020
 obviously it will be able to reproduce 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.149
 the audio that they have imported in case of 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.610
 they want it and well that would be all 

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:34.589
 I hope you liked them I leave you my 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.509
