00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
I have to rotate the phone this way but

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.080 
I have to rotate the phone this way but
then<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.850> notice<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.150> little<00:02:34.760> if<00:02:35.760> we<00:02:35.910> get<00:02:36.030> a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
then you notice a little if we get a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.030 
then you notice a little if we get a
this<00:02:36.900> helicopters<00:02:37.380> need<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.860> half

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
this helicopters need is just a half

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.090 
this helicopters need is just a half
till<00:02:38.340> will<00:02:39.209> change<00:02:39.480> columns<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.890> catch<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:43.100> no

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
till will change columns to catch it no

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.979 
till will change columns to catch it no
multiplayer<00:02:44.430> yet<00:02:44.760> but<00:02:44.970> what<00:02:45.090> people<00:02:45.690> do<00:02:45.810> is

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
multiplayer yet but what people do is

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.800 
multiplayer yet but what people do is
that<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.560> points<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.130> earn<00:02:47.450> then<00:02:48.450> go<00:02:48.660> up

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
that the points that you earn then go up

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.949 
that the points that you earn then go up
onto<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.110> global<00:02:49.440> website<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.420> we<00:02:51.690> cool

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
onto a global website and you is we cool

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.440 
onto a global website and you is we cool
points<00:02:52.380> together<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:53.160> as<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.090> cooperative

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
points together and as a cooperative

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.780 
points together and as a cooperative
game<00:02:54.959> so<00:02:55.590> its<00:02:55.739> sense<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.130> every<00:02:56.400> kill<00:02:56.640> point

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
game so its sense that every kill point

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.210 
game so its sense that every kill point
is<00:02:57.000> earned<00:02:57.299> is

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
is earned is

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.730 
is earned is
group<00:02:58.490> I<00:02:58.640> scoreboard<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.630> you<00:03:00.230> can<00:03:00.380> inject

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
group I scoreboard and you can inject

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.530 
group I scoreboard and you can inject
likereply<00:03:01.340> purple<00:03:01.850> trees<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.240> bring<00:03:02.360> back<00:03:02.510> a

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
likereply purple trees and bring back a

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.080 
likereply purple trees and bring back a
real<00:03:02.810> environment<00:03:03.140> and<00:03:03.500> then<00:03:04.310> this<00:03:04.940> is<00:03:05.000> where

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
real environment and then this is where

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.580 
real environment and then this is where
the<00:03:05.210> rule<00:03:05.330> over<00:03:05.660> that<00:03:05.690> comes<00:03:05.960> in<00:03:06.140> is<00:03:06.320> that<00:03:06.530> you

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
the rule over that comes in is that you

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.500 
the rule over that comes in is that you
can<00:03:06.710> actually<00:03:06.860> play<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.490> game<00:03:07.670> on<00:03:07.970> Twitter<00:03:08.360> or
