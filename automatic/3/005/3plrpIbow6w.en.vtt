00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.110
 parents were readers and with my father was 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.270
 a great reader has a very good 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.310
 library and he started to recommend me 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.410
 things thanks to him because I do not know I read 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.860
 people like conan doyle or chesterton 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.570
 good and many classics and good little to 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.100
 little I was really fond of 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.530
 first money that they gave me the first 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.390
 straw that they gave me I bought a volume of 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.630
 the parallel plutarco citations that 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.920
 then they were worth twelve or fifteen pesetas 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.809
 I still feel very collector and 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.520
 he also collected what was sold 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.680
 the bottle caps or such I started 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.230
 also then to collect books 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.019
 then my love of books but has 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.769
 come for being a reader and being also 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.769
 collector 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.260
 Well, better call me at 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.789
 contents that the first sack where 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.769
 we have invented is a friend of mine 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.960
 and that is a pretty fun thing and 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.950
 picturesque and I also had 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.270
 always I had feel a little bit of 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.890
 bulimia to think that the video I'm going to 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.840
 disappear or that they could stop xavi 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.250
 libraries then when he's had 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.060
 always want to buy reduce 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.270
 find the largest number of mortgages 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.220
 possible well somehow me and another 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.470
 people many other friends I think 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.840
 that we have helped a little good to 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.729
 review the Spanish literary history 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.229
 especially the Spanish of the past 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:37.740
 centuries and give it some form as a one 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.930
 renew my intuition or my idea is that 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.450
 that literature is going to have a little 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.210
 less important and he's going to read a 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.009
 minority as it happened of 1918 and in the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.960
 previous centuries but that is always going to 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.460
 see people you read and certain people who 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.350
 think 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.950
 and that it interests him well to deepen a 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.950
 little things
