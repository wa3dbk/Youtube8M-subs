00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:09.900
 called him the year of release 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.139
 here we are spokes rabal beat means 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.849
 all sewage which were fields 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:28.199
 directly at the construction site now he 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:30.560
 jumps to walk like a dial setting 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.949
 start need 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.949
 which directly 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.610
 sometimes she is near you setting 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:17.560
 and here 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.030
 this 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.680
 here we are 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.280
 but 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.640
 auto frets lower to bow us about everything 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.640
 rest 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:56.120
 a little bit and clockwise 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:00.110
 wicker order you 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:03.650
 girls that it was through the portal 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:10.270
 This is of course to us well, well, letâ€™s 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.270
 You will need I do not know where 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.770
 now we have not prepared a deck not 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.540
 build until he rules it gives it 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.540
 light on the middle chair 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:33.340
 these almost half a ton that i did not pull 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.340
 o'clock 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:54.790
 Howardâ€™s countries should teach us 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:54.790
 quantum people we do n't even have 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.970
 now we continue on setting 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.930
 directly the entire instrument then 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.500
 I have now 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.870
 medium range and extremely unnecessary threads 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.390
 on section heights right now you 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.250
 demonstrate how it sounds we will 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:42.300
 even under the countries, yes here we are 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:44.480
 octave through the act here for example well 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.480
 let's say 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.400
 I'll show you how I will 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.469
 I will configure now 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:00.409
 the upper preset range we are here now 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:04:02.840
 let's say the item here 0 got to 2 2 what am i 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:06.400
 did the ice key put on a peg lead to 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.400
 rock town now for a second 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.240
 about a little bit to lift 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:33.000
 because she does not build back see 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:35.300
 and here's straight for a little bit of it 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.039
 raised on 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.819
 i will ask so we check i do the roots 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:46.240
 upstairs and quints she has zlata 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:49.520
 From the first string of this top one 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.860
 it's queen. good now here we are 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.419
 these rattles at us means you need everything under 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:07.840
 hulk top strings to bring 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:07.840
 well, let's go further 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:48.240
 rulers breaking the format we check 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:52.400
 I remember we barely reach 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.400
 my vertica tuck 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:07.080
 Look at the car in general 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.970
 but 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:25.080
 all why so several 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:29.720
 tried to get them out first because 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.720
 we do as 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:51.390
 but you will appear so if you 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:53.460
 you will build up from the screw down 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:57.390
 all time matching through octave 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:07:01.200
 watch let's passively handle 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:04.860
 take you succeed 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.850
 shoot as they say about your page 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.850
 tool to teach correctly 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.850
 thank
