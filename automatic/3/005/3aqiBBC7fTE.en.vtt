00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:10.060
 well-found friends of tuttoandroid.net 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.010
 we are at the asus stand here at the mobile 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.590
 world congress mila 15 to see asus 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.349
 sanford two the first smartphone with ben 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.999
 4 gigabytes of RAM 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.919
 in reality there are two variants but 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:23.710
 let's see the features 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:26.499
 meanwhile techniques is intuitive is moved by 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.339
 a 4-bit processor intel south for 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:34.809
 atom accuracy z 35 60 or 30 cynical 80 is 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:36.309
 a quad core with power r series of 6 of 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.649
 gpu 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.190
 we then like 2 or 4 gigabytes 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:45.219
 in your ram memory model and 16 32 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.870
 or 64 gb instead the internal memory is 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.109
 then present a webstorage then a 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.719
 cloud of asus and as a gift there are 5 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:56.260
 gigabyte 5.5 inch display milan 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:58.690
 20 x 1080 the resolution of 403 ppa is the 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.870
 5 megapixel camera definition 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.640
 with focal length 2.0 is a wide angle 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.950
 while on rai 3, soy is always pixelated 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.689
 with 2.0 to five focal length 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.299
 therefore elements should be one 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.250
 camera and we also have a led flash 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.009
 indeed the double LED flash with different le 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.590
 of its volume button temperatures 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.390
 volume down while the power button is 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.240
 here in the opinion quite discovered the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.250
 upper part next to the page hole 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.540
 created with ciro mm and next to a 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.479
 second microphone for removing 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.920
 back walls on the front led tv in here in 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.890
 high front camera you need 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.899
 make method and the speaker in headphones 43 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.079
 soft touch rates on the bottom 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:42.759
 always the typical knurled band now 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:44.740
 of the asus with regard to the display 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.500
 certainly as you can see of 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.350
 quality and value are quite faithful 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.539
 in battery 3000 milian for obviously 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.350
 supports lte connectivity 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:59.710
 then the 4g gps present wifi or on 211 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.520
 ac and you want to give all 4.0 nfc not 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.850
 missing dimensions 102 mm person 7.2 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.250
 x 10.9 mm thick 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.069
 the back is like a curved net so it varies 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.319
 according to 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.469
 the measured area varies between the three 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.930
 lived and mm here on the edges at 10.9 in 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:20.359
 half 160 grams an effective therefore not 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.219
 just very light and also quite 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:24.260
 bulky you can see the edges here 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:26.359
 around express no I'm not 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.129
 practically particular contents the 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.840
 camera that takes pixel technology back 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.120
 previous zen phone master 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.730
 so you can take pictures in the dark 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.469
 however of quality and therefore it is commendable 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.209
 about the software part they found 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:40.579
 android lolli porto with interface 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.469
 So zewi graphics is an interface 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.819
 very renovated very particular but 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.169
 especially very customizable 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.709
 think we can go for example 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:51.139
 in the menu and in the drover e 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.419
 install and apply an icon pack is 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:55.129
 different we find many on 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:58.040
 play store but above all the 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.449
 compatibility is very very broad 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.760
 we then exit to edit also 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:04.400
 scroll animations and more 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.049
 so really a chance to 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.730
 advanced customization for example 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.760
 we mark in homescreen wallpapers 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.470
 we can go to set transparency 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.930
 better than the alpha of the status bar 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.879
 then set 6 percent again 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.129
 as you can see if you want to set 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.109
 also the transparency therefore the alpha of the 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.660
 background in finding applications 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.730
 so really 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.470
 great customization I remember the 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.750
 those two applications are present 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.270
 those of asus are not too many 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.100
 but some allow you to take advantage of the 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.610
 better this smartphone for example 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.840
 in the lockscreen we can find again 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.090
 the buttons that takes us directly 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.370
 to the camera to calls and messages 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.130
 or lollipop-style notifications 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.680
 an interesting thing is the fact that a 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.940
 continue turning on and off positive 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.070
 with a double tap on the screen as I have 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.570
 done in this case or we can 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.770
 also use screen gestures 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.080
 off to open example 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.540
 in this case there is an application 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.590
 gone April messages with an s with 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.270
 the double curve for example must be 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.090
 open the browser but they are anyway 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.010
 gesture pre settable other things 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.050
 zenworks mais manager obviously for 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.209
 check his latest wearable 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.980
 company but the product that can be executed 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.940
 also in another variant a little more 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:22.000
 economical from 1 or 2 gigabytes of memory 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.700
 ram and with a slightly less processor 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.540
 performance we talk about this zen 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:32.169
 Economic fondue says ze 5 50 ml 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.970
 instead with the president 15 51 ml that is 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.150
 equipped with 4 bit holy processor always 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.669
 intel atom but if the 35 30 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.620
 we have as I said a gigabyte or two in 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.660
 based on the ram memory model and then 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.860
 inside the phone all the various 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.210
 presentations I showed you before 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.229
 then 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.919
 for example that installed an icon pack 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:55.840
 custom we also go to 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:58.840
 apply and as you see the icons are 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.400
 change other important difference than 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.229
 the play even if not to the same extent 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.870
 of the previous model we have seen 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:07.060
 to a hd resolution that no longer full hd 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.650
 will also come at a much higher price 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.539
 content 199 euros 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.560
 or rather 79 dollars in america but in 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.569
 Italy at the moment we do not know 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.190
 however we will report the price and the 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:16.360
 availability of this smartphone is 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.949
 also in the other inside 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.389
 video preview article first 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.470
 all goodbye from michael and 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.470
 lose android puntonet
