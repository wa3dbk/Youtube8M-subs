00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.370
 an ideal day to catch tents on surface little wind high temperature 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.609
 and with some clouds 

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:11.609
 the lure must fall into the water near the shore 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.209
 is where the carps are eating 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.400
 the fisherman 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.489
 is focused on the movement of the lure 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.169
 waiting for the bite 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.169
 and in the end if it produces 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.849
 it's a piece and it does not get beat 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.960
 by the way of fighting 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.960
 it is a good piece 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.880
 impatient the fisherman 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.400
 but with enough serenity 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.400
 so that the piece does not escape 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.900
 finally you see 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.900
 it's a big tent 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.920
 in his thought the fisherman 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.920
 know that it is not over yet 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.930
 with these great specimens 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.210
 the serenity 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.640
 and patience 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.640
 they are two fundamental weapons 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.269
 another problem added 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.499
 is not having an old sac 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:19.769
 since it is complicated to cover with your hands a piece of this size 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:27.499
 serenely the fisherman find the land 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.319
 to have a base donda support the tent 

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:43.769
 with a great job he manages to get the carp out of the water 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.309
 a nice piece 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:51.399
 that has given the fisherman many minutes of struggle 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:52.739
 how grateful 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.739
 returns the piece to its habitat 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:10.509
 a colony of black storks gather to migrate 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.029
 again the lure of the ice 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:17.029
 it moved with its attractive noise 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.329
 irresistible for the tent 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.580
 again another bite 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.840
 It seems a good piece 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.840
 has thrown towards the center of the reservoir 

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.569
 effectively another good piece 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:45.569
 although it is smaller than the previous 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.340
 a balboa has approached the tent 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:01.249
 it seems he wants to take the decoy from the carp 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.759
 the bank has also been nailed to the unnumbered 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.389
 is awesome 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.389
 the strength of both fish pulling 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:55.999
 a curiosity 

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:57.379
 never seen 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:59.539
 caught a carp 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.539
 and took out 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.209
 the barbo me on the occasion to take away the food the carp 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:11.839
 and surprised 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:14.839
 is stuck in the lure 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.439
 not having been able to take the two pieces together
