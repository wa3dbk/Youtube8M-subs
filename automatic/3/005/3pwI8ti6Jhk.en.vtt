that's kind of stupid to say that

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.219 
that's kind of stupid to say that
because<00:01:39.819> if<00:01:39.940> you<00:01:40.000> give<00:01:40.149> a<00:01:40.179> dog<00:01:40.420> Prozac<00:01:41.020> it

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
because if you give a dog Prozac it

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.809 
because if you give a dog Prozac it
works<00:01:41.440> on<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.619> dog<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.039> same<00:01:42.190> way<00:01:42.369> it<00:01:42.459> does<00:01:42.610> on<00:01:42.759> a
