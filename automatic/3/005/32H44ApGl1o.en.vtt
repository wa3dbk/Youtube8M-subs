00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.590
 today we are going to talk about the rear wing of the mobile rear wing you have 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.459
 a novel narrates regretted of 2011 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.189
 As you have seen in the television images, they are in favor of their 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:16.199
 backwards cameras 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.210
 skele the upper element smaller element the wing can move 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.539
 to see the other scenario here by hand but what makes a lot of force 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.169
 why 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.140
 act that overcome the force of the dock 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.999
 and the hydraulic force that's like now 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:31.069
 and how it closes 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:34.020
 when really when it works we have 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.690
 some hydraulic lines that go inside their rows 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.790
 federal real estate senator 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.530
 these lines have suffered depression to raise them 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.530
 in at least a tenth of a second we have it up 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.820
 when the national pilot 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.940
 it is very quick open peace throughout the line and as soon as they brake or 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.180
 lift the gas foot 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.960
 she alone low we see a dock to work prone to force 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.290
 Wind dynamics are so great as soon as you remove the pressure from 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.280
 hydraulics 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.190
 for one hundrerd 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.929
 goes down with tremendous force that's why this one 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:05.540
 these closures are always 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.940
 quite violent 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.890
 the intention that we have with this at 10 activate the always when the car has 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.150
 left the conviasa curve with the gas in depth 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.660
 we are not interested in the dynamic load, we hope it is to achieve the maximum 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.140
 speed for that when we pick it up 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.330
 the air passes between the two wings and what it does is that it completely breaks 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.390
 the flow 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.870
 already when decreasing the assistance 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.190
 in the wind the car can run much more 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.950
 we get to win depends on the straight to 10 12 or 13 kilometers per hour 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.970
 If the line is long enough 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.980
 Well, the way we have now to activate the 3% 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.250
 when the conditions are met that the bottom rider and we are not trying 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.810
 to stop 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.119
 the pilot then receives the prd that nothing can be activated and he has to 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.200
 be the button 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.430
 in each curve according to proven efe 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.570
 that vote win 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.480
 would open with this lara once I would leave it open for the entire line and the 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.220
 to step on the brake today lift the accelerator foot it automatically 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.280
 it would close 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.740
 when you take the straight you will have to give it back then I thought of the one 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.409
 In addition to giving the curve just when already already finished the curve in the 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.819
 to give as soon as possible always and there where 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.319
 in a fast turn in polyphenols makes the difference you have to give it what 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.009
 always possible as long as we have a maximum of time 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:18.159
 the open wing 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.709
 plus another change that there has been to avoid ad hoc to totally ban 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.249
 the epigraph of what we had is that last year 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:26.209
 it's p 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.829
 you can not do any 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:34.949
 no any surface with a radius d - they said nothing millimeter if it is with 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:35.559
 cape 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.200
 They seem complicated but 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.049
 they have that all adult only radios with ends 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.400
 those are the converts every year with payments must have a radius 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.889
 minimum I defend as you see our to the according to radio 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.889
 quite bigger 2 here we could for a ball 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.889
 the tuna fleet efe-radio would be a fleet of more than one meter 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.450
 percent at some point could become less than 100 is a problem 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.120
 that had sauber and at its top moment it was too curved
