NES accessories let's start with the
zapper<00:00:28.560> back<00:00:29.010> then<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:29.490> just<00:00:29.519> called<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
zapper back then we just called it the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.060 
zapper back then we just called it the
gun<00:00:30.599> because<00:00:31.140> that's<00:00:31.320> what<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.740> there's

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
gun because that's what it is there's

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.590 
gun because that's what it is there's
nothing<00:00:32.219> more<00:00:32.520> satisfying<00:00:32.820> than<00:00:33.360> just

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
nothing more satisfying than just

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.840 
nothing more satisfying than just
shooting<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.020> thing<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.579> was<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
shooting the thing it was the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.119 
shooting the thing it was the
quintessential<00:00:36.450> gaming<00:00:36.989> accessory<00:00:37.559> almost

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
the gun the only problem it doesn't work

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.000 
the gun the only problem it doesn't work
so<00:00:43.200> great<00:00:43.410> anymore

you're<00:00:46.440> using<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> gun<00:00:47.309> itself<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.940> have

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
you're using and the gun itself I have

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.850 
you're using and the gun itself I have
three<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.660> them<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.230> first<00:00:49.500> one<00:00:49.680> is

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
three of them the first one is

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.189 
three of them the first one is
completely<00:00:50.520> random<00:00:50.850> sometimes<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.870> makes<00:00:52.020> its

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
completely random sometimes it makes its

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.459 
completely random sometimes it makes its
target<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:52.890> most<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.280> time<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.760> doesn't<00:00:57.469> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
target but most the time it doesn't the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.290 
target but most the time it doesn't the
second<00:00:58.890> one<00:00:58.980> has<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> pattern<00:00:59.520> every<00:01:00.180> other

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
second one has a pattern every other

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.660 
second one has a pattern every other
round<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:00.989> goes<00:01:01.260> dead<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.190> here<00:01:02.340> comes<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
round it like goes dead so here comes a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.850

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
zapper use light detection that is when

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.570 
zapper use light detection that is when
you<00:01:41.229> pull<00:01:41.439> the<00:01:41.560> trigger<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:42.070> screen<00:01:42.369> goes

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
you pull the trigger the screen goes

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.639 
you pull the trigger the screen goes
black<00:01:42.909> for<00:01:42.940> a<00:01:43.270> fraction<00:01:43.780> of<00:01:43.899> a<00:01:43.990> second<00:01:44.440> and<00:01:44.560> the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
targets become white squares the zapper

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.630 
targets become white squares the zapper
detects<00:01:47.380> whether<00:01:47.710> or<00:01:47.860> not<00:01:47.979> it's<00:01:48.190> pointing<00:01:48.580> at

the light hence the term light gun that
everybody<00:01:51.039> likes<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.399> call<00:01:51.610> it<00:01:51.789> but<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.570> super

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
everybody likes to call it but the super

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.080 
everybody likes to call it but the super
scope<00:01:53.259> uses<00:01:53.680> a<00:01:53.710> sensor<00:01:54.310> that<00:01:54.340> you<00:01:54.640> plug<00:01:54.909> into

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
scope uses a sensor that you plug into

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.670 
scope uses a sensor that you plug into
the<00:01:55.180> Super<00:01:55.509> Nintendo<00:01:55.570> another<00:01:56.259> thing<00:01:56.560> about

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
the Super Nintendo another thing about

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.620 
the Super Nintendo another thing about
the<00:01:56.950> super<00:01:57.340> scope<00:01:57.580> is<00:01:57.789> that<00:01:57.909> it<00:01:58.030> isn't<00:01:58.270> powered

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
the super scope is that it isn't powered

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.870 
the super scope is that it isn't powered
by<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.810> NES<00:01:59.289> it's<00:01:59.649> wireless<00:01:59.979> which<00:02:00.460> you<00:02:00.700> think

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
by the NES it's wireless which you think

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.490 
by the NES it's wireless which you think
would<00:02:01.119> be<00:02:01.240> cool<00:02:01.479> but<00:02:01.899> that<00:02:02.050> means<00:02:02.229> that<00:02:02.350> you

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
would be cool but that means that you

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.440 
would be cool but that means that you
got<00:02:02.649> to<00:02:02.679> use<00:02:02.860> six<00:02:03.190> double-a<00:02:03.700> batteries<00:02:04.299> and

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
got to use six double-a batteries and

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.320 
got to use six double-a batteries and
this<00:02:04.539> beast<00:02:05.200> drains<00:02:05.619> them<00:02:05.799> in<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:05.979> few<00:02:06.220> hours

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
this beast drains them in a few hours

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.969 
this beast drains them in a few hours
and<00:02:07.330> why<00:02:07.479> is<00:02:07.539> the<00:02:07.750> trigger<00:02:08.049> on<00:02:08.289> the<00:02:08.410> top<00:02:08.649> it

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
and why is the trigger on the top it

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.660 
and why is the trigger on the top it
should<00:02:09.190> be<00:02:09.340> down<00:02:09.549> here<00:02:09.580> this<00:02:10.569> is<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:12.340> think

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
should be down here this is you think

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.100 
should be down here this is you think
the<00:02:12.819> super<00:02:13.180> scope<00:02:13.420> would<00:02:13.600> be<00:02:13.720> more<00:02:13.930> reliable

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
the super scope would be more reliable

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.500 
the super scope would be more reliable
than<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.769> original<00:02:15.250> zapper<00:02:15.700> but<00:02:16.150> it's<00:02:16.269> not

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
than the original zapper but it's not

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.620 
than the original zapper but it's not
now<00:02:17.440> let's<00:02:17.680> look<00:02:17.830> at<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.100> miracle<00:02:18.549> piano
