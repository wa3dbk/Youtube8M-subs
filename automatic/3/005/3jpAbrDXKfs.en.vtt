good things about it and they also have

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.620

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
a spray which I have tried and I think

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.900 
a spray which I have tried and I think
that's<00:03:26.780> called<00:03:26.990> the<00:03:27.290> tan<00:03:27.770> icon<00:03:28.190> extreme<00:03:28.610> and

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.580 
that's called the tan icon extreme and
that<00:03:29.300> what<00:03:29.420> i<00:03:29.450> really<00:03:29.690> love<00:03:29.840> as<00:03:29.990> well<00:03:30.170> because

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
that what i really love as well because

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.080 
that what i really love as well because
it<00:03:30.709> has<00:03:30.830> a<00:03:30.860> color<00:03:31.130> guard<00:03:31.340> on<00:03:31.520> it<00:03:31.640> so<00:03:31.790> you<00:03:31.850> can

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
it has a color guard on it so you can
