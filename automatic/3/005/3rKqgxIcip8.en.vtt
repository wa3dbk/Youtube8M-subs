00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
right here it's like a space effect and

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.800 
right here it's like a space effect and
other<00:02:18.500> thing<00:02:18.980> can<00:02:19.190> do<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.670> if<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.600> go<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:21.340> that

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
other thing can do is if you go to that

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.630 
other thing can do is if you go to that
paintbrush<00:02:23.810> icon<00:02:24.110> right<00:02:24.590> here<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:25.490> can

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
paintbrush icon right here you can

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.550 
paintbrush icon right here you can
select<00:02:25.820> how<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:26.360> layer<00:02:26.630> is<00:02:26.660> going<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.260> blend

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
select how this layer is going to blend

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.210 
select how this layer is going to blend
with<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.310> layer<00:02:28.790> underneath<00:02:29.270> it<00:02:29.630> so<00:02:30.470> if<00:02:30.950> i<00:02:31.190> put

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
with the layer underneath it so if i put

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.730 
with the layer underneath it so if i put
it<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.820> black<00:02:32.570> and<00:02:32.780> white<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.200> makes<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.560> black

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
it to black and white and makes it black

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.390 
it to black and white and makes it black
and<00:02:33.770> white<00:02:34.120> if<00:02:35.120> i<00:02:35.210> put<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.660> blue<00:02:35.900> strike

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
and white if i put it to blue strike

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.870 
and white if i put it to blue strike
it's<00:02:37.400> going<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.970> add<00:02:38.330> some<00:02:38.360> blues<00:02:38.990> in<00:02:39.230> there

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
it's going to add some blues in there

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
light effects as you can see they they

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.729 
light effects as you can see they they
add<00:03:21.410> kind<00:03:21.890> of<00:03:22.070> like<00:03:22.310> a<00:03:22.820> little<00:03:23.360> light<00:03:24.170> dimples
