00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.300

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:13.770

 that we do not over here 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.090
 There are many rulers around here 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.509
 and the sign indicates 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.509

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:50.950

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.460
 problem with sending your child

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.310
 this seems more like a gangster than me 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.250
 be a factor 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.930
 let's take a closer look 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.940
 Caillou found that the water was dirty 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.940
 he could see the reason 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:33.600
 four gigs and I ate there 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:34.950
 I'm only with 3 2 I believe the animals 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.830
 the living here are happy about it 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.280
 again about her home talking about what 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.260
 types are very shy 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.190
 we have to be quiet and ears 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.190
 tip to find her 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:58.430
 So what did that sound like? 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:03:00.930
 was good back that you have in the middle 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.550
 yes it's true we want from the top now 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.950
 to be bitten down 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.950
 dipascali to smear it in the eyes 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.550
 The mosquitoes like this profession too and 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.550
 let us hope to rest 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:26.010
 some suffered so much can 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:29.010
 For days explore lingus and in this 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.170
 swamp here there is alligator river glad 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.080
 that there are aggregators in this marsh 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.580
 All of a sudden, the swamp found a lot 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.580
 more interesting than before 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.690
 I bet every one goes through this 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.060
 something the can eat them 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.050

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:09.740

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.440
 kaya glad he had the binoculars like that 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.310
 He could do the heating from a distance 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:44.339
