00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
potential as pewters 2003 wasn't so

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.289 
potential as pewters 2003 wasn't so
great<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.340> 2007<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.759> hoped<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.150> would

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
great and in 2007 we hoped that it would

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.080 
great and in 2007 we hoped that it would
be<00:01:33.420> great<00:01:33.600> again<00:01:34.159> we<00:01:35.159> had<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> good<00:01:35.549> team<00:01:35.820> and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
be great again we had a good team and

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.760 
be great again we had a good team and
lots<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.509> things<00:01:36.780> were<00:01:36.930> falling<00:01:37.170> into<00:01:37.530> place

lots of things were falling into place

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.890 
lots of things were falling into place
so<00:01:38.490> there<00:01:38.670> was<00:01:38.790> potential<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.810> be

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
so there was potential for it to be

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
so there was potential for it to be
better<00:01:40.079> than<00:01:40.430> 1999

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920
