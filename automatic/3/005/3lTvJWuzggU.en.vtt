 and is a kind person 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.040
 since we spent a lot of time in the kitchen 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.810
 it is a tactile space 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.100
 architecturally we dedicate a lot 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.120
 weather 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.120

 laundry is made of a laundry 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.980
 already has an information so that

 house can invest in leaving 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.270
 no problem another of the advantages is 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.960
 that when you design a house 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.960
 forever 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.519
 use 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.329
 an area destined for a local 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.760
 commercial that can be used very well 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.959
 local demonstration conventions and local 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.640
 you would have to approach with your advisor 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.590
 sales to tell you what the 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.489
 difference in case it tilts 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.489
 for a house of commerce 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.940
 continuing our journey through this 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.760
 wonderful 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.100
 we can observe the guest bathroom that 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.800
 It consists of a complete bathroom 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.700
 of visits industry will naturally see 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.810
 and collegiate with all accessories 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.520
 we also see this space under the 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.130
 stands is intended for a winery 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.080
 you can do the 3 cloth and two 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.420
 doors and that you have an adriÃ¡n 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.290
 a nice winery so they can 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.290
 you invest 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.830
 one of the interesting things in this 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.310
 house as you can appreciate is the 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.310
 space 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.180
 very nice and many times I love 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.000
 initially he had spent a small 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:26.920
 rectangular window and that's very comfortable 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.920
 to take advantage of the view of the environment 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.440
 regarding the environment of the house of 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.060
 second level and we already found in a 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.800
 shared bathroom that you can see 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:43.349
 these two children 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.040
 one wants to use the bathroom for several 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.820
 families 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.100
 in this option 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.100
 no match for two rooms 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.060
 in the background you are appreciating the 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.470
 master bedroom where the main thing that 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.480
 it was designed 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:05.230
 counting 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.890
 a private bathroom and a closet area 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.890
 and a balcony 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.830
 what you are looking for in this bedroom is 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.830
 have all the necessary space 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.030
 but also 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.260
 a goddess deprived of the bathroom 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.540
 and a 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.540
 a balcony that naturally is the house 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.640
 You can see the finishes where 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.060
 and now we're heading to the second 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.440
 room 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.969
 because it has 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.799
 5 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:48.840
 which also has a closet area that 

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:51.290
 one can take advantage 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.120
 to make the boys in closet 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:58.100
 accommodating and taking advantage of all 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.100
 available spaces of the house 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.610

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.210
 interiors 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:15.930
 and over here this is the third room 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.900
 initially when it was designed in the house 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.580
 he had contemplated leaving a study 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.409
 after the needs of families 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:27.330

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.569
 room 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.040

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.820
 as you can appreciate 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.320
