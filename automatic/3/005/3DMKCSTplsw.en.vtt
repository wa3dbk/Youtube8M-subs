00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
a little bit easier but they're not

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.160 
a little bit easier but they're not
quite<00:01:05.460> as<00:01:05.610> good<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.060> are<00:01:06.270> sticky<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
quite as good and are sticky for the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.429 
quite as good and are sticky for the
street<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:08.119> I'm<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.450> rookie<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.080> they<00:01:10.229> seem

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
street but I'm a rookie so they seem

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.100 
street but I'm a rookie so they seem
pretty<00:01:10.650> fine<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.040> me<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.220> think<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.610> got<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> 150<00:01:12.299> no

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
pretty fine to me I think I got a 150 no

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.200 
pretty fine to me I think I got a 150 no
160<00:01:13.890> 50<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> rear<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.150> 120<00:01:17.000> 70<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.180> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
160 50 in the rear and a 120 70 in the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.690 
160 50 in the rear and a 120 70 in the
front<00:01:18.680> so<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.710> makes<00:01:19.950> sense<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.340> think<00:01:20.369> that's

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
front so that makes sense I think that's

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.730 
front so that makes sense I think that's
right<00:01:21.740> but<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.890> thing<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.250> completely

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
right but this thing is completely

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.410 
right but this thing is completely
stopped<00:01:25.740> nothing<00:01:26.189> has<00:01:26.520> been<00:01:26.549> done<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.240> and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
stopped nothing has been done to it and

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.210 
stopped nothing has been done to it and
I'm<00:01:27.960> kind<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.290> excited<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.799> hear<00:01:28.979> what<00:01:29.040> you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
instinct is to do an exhaust system with

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.649 
instinct is to do an exhaust system with
the<00:01:34.650> header<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.400> then<00:01:35.610> reach<00:01:36.030> at<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> carb

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the header and then reach at the carb

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.410 
the header and then reach at the carb
and<00:01:37.590> I've<00:01:37.650> heard<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.890> lot<00:01:38.009> about<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.340> 3x3<00:01:38.759> mod

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
and I've heard a lot about the 3x3 mod

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.060 
and I've heard a lot about the 3x3 mod
or<00:01:39.750> something<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.229> which<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.740> guess<00:01:40.920> I

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
or something like that which I guess I

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.630 
or something like that which I guess I
could<00:01:41.220> do<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.430> all<00:01:41.549> at<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> same<00:01:41.909> time<00:01:42.439> but

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
could do it all at the same time but

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.920 
could do it all at the same time but
yeah<00:01:44.640> let<00:01:45.030> me<00:01:45.060> know<00:01:45.240> what<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.479> think<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.750> should

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
yeah let me know what you think I should

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.289 
yeah let me know what you think I should
do<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.229> guy<00:01:46.320> said<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:46.710> never<00:01:46.950> been<00:01:47.130> down<00:01:47.399> but

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
do the guy said it's never been down but

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.620 
do the guy said it's never been down but
I<00:01:48.540> see<00:01:48.810> some<00:01:49.110> scrapes<00:01:49.680> here<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.579> make<00:01:51.450> me

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
I see some scrapes here that make me

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.899 
I see some scrapes here that make me
think<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.960> may<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.530> been<00:01:52.740> down<00:01:53.159> once<00:01:53.610> or

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
think it may have been down once or

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.179 
think it may have been down once or
twice<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.509> its<00:01:54.659> day<00:01:54.869> but<00:01:54.899> as<00:01:55.799> far<00:01:55.950> as<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.130> can

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
twice in its day but as far as I can

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.249 
twice in its day but as far as I can
tell<00:01:56.430> she<00:01:56.640> rides<00:01:56.850> perfect<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.509> otherwise

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
tell she rides perfect and otherwise

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.160
