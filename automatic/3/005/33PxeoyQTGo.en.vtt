00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.240
 Many times you ask me about the 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.280
 zucchini how is it that I get 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.619
 songs so great because 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.929
 they are simply planted in this 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.630
 huge planter that as you see next 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.020
 of the square pots so you can see their 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.779
 measured size it seems to me that they are about half 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.539
 long and wide we have 60 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.539
 centimeters and I do not have two planted 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.700
 bushes of zucchini 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.030
 if you look at the size of the leaves 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.990
 you can make an idea something here a 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.300
 Bush 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.760
 and we have another brand here that is the one 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.490
 has now taught us the flowers and here 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.360
 os side is the vine which also 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.980
 have you ever spoken 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.480
 It is not very big 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.910
 Y 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.880
 and I make one it seems that he has no intention 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.100
 to make any kind of fruit 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.350
 regarding courgettes is very 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.960
 usual that there are doubts about whether 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.060
 a plant has ear that is a type of 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.460
 fungus or they are just normal spots 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.950
 and let's see here we have a little bit of 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.300
 everything is heard and there are normal spots with 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.759
 which then I'm going to show you this 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.229
 younger sheet in which the mantles that 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.900
 they appear to be the stained machines 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.390
 whitish we release projects 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.250
 we see that they are not deleted they do not leave this is 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.960
 because the plant to the leaf forgiveness is 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.000
 healthy and specifically because this 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.160
 variety of zucchini is like that 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.440
 has its sheet instead if we go some 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.660
 of the older leaves is very common 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.780
 that take a video you see in this case 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.850
 the spots are almost almost formed 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.820
 that have disappeared instead we see 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.429
 as a type of white powder 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.380
 we hope so if we have our hands 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.600
 not to mention the plants the leaves 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.240
 who are harmed if you want that 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.940
 they were good in this case covers that 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.330
 what we do for nothing we cut them from 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.800
 what a way then 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.360
 I always try to do it from the base 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:08.110
 identify each of the leaves which 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.110
 is and how to organize islands by cutting 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.140
 because nothing should always watching 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.810
 do when we tear leaves I see that 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.840
 the first symptoms of red spider and 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.840
 they are here in fact you can observe 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.330
 pretty good little dots 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.800
 they move one sometimes they do not move with 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.069
 relative speed 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.109
 at these small intersections 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:38.409
 you can see the small 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.409
 villas 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.900
 and they form that are also symptoms of 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.010
 the plague is enclosed and that wants 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.349
 say that from now on since 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.650
 I have to start doing quilting for 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:54.260
 conserve moisture apply a 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.819
 water vaporization more or less followed 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.139
 and when then on this page as you see 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:02.379
 I had heard and also the chopped 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.379
 discolorations 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.930
 proper to the attack of the red spider 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.250
 the garden wants you to be very aware 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.380
 of him 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.070
 I could not be this week and 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.290
 well, this means that you 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.640
 this can happen but well no one is 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.640
 discourage that everything has a solution 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.849
 one of the most common queries that 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.129
 they are made in the zucchini is that 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:35.239
 it looks like the courgettes come out and they 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:39.260
 dry as for example you see this here 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.260
 I will actually start 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.690
 this happens because they simply have not 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.629
 politicized is very surprising when one 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.060
 start the urban garden he knows all the 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:53.300
 learn that the recordings have 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.340
 male and female flowers then 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.550
 What we are going to do now is learn to 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.069
 and identifying when each of 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.280
 these of these flowers in the case of 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.620
 feminine flowers we will always see that 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.040
 appear 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.810
 with you I love her 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.260
 the case are zucchini 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.690
 we will see that a small zucchini comes out 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.730
 with a flower on the tip 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.470
 and some more here is for example 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.470
 that seems to be already imposed hoisted 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.650
 because if you look at the flower it is already like 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.020
 we can remove it or we can leave it 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.750
 but well it may have been 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.360
 seconded and that's why it has this color in 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.650
 change down here there is one that is created 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.790
 that is a little yellowish and 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.820
 possibly what has happened is that 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.190
 it has not been politicized and 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.440
 it will possibly fall like the others that 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.230
 we have started first let's see from 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.370
 close how are these these flowers for 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.770
 that you learn to identify them better 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.520
 we are ahead and here we can appreciate 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:58.010
 several types of flowers if you notice this 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.570
 it would be a female flower with a flower by 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.660
 open still with a small zucchini 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:07.139
 forward below forgiveness and this would be a 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:10.229
 It is culina that only you can see 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:13.219
 the stem with the flower on the tip we have 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.219
 2 open here 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.870
 I do not know if it is appreciated very well in this 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.150
 case you leave this here below is 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.139
 a female flower where has the 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:28.749
 Zucchini is already open and if you look 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:31.560
 in the central part the shape that has 

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:34.110
 it's different 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.970
 and this is a flower 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.460
 is here that is a male flower 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.740
 it is the stem 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:44.780
 with the flower above 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:47.780
 and if you look at the central part is 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.520
 totally different what always 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.200
 recommends doing in the case of 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.270
 urban gardens is to help a little 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.930
 Well in this case with a brush 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.970
 we would enjoy inside 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.400
 if you notice, it's easy to take a 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:06.160
 little bit of pollen and then what 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.160
 we do is move to the female flower 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.000
 and pass this pollen 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.150
 In the center 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.130
 nor the plant 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.170
 I always have them full of ants with 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.100
 what met that sometimes the 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.170
 work is done alone 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.680
 but we can always help 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:27.920
 doing this explained take a little 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.310
 from ponent 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.090
 and taking it to the flower 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.090
 feminine 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:39.249
 If pollinated, it is seen immediately because 

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:42.899
 automatically that flower is feminine it 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:45.339
 Close and start embroidering the zucchini 

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:47.829
 what's below, although it 's very interesting 

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:50.660
 it is always to observe how many flowers 

00:06:47.829 --> 00:06:52.490
 we have future 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.120
 because that is going to ensure 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.120
 pollination
