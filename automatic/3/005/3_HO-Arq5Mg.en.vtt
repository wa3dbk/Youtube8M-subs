00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
 good to all and welcome to this 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.950
 new video of grand theft auto 'online 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.140
 in which I bring you an information 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.010
 news about a video that I'm going to take 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.230
 on my channel as of now 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.330
 probably once a week and I go 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.740
 to do together with forward 09 going to 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.540
 work with me to help me 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.490
 make this video and it's about a 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.050
 questions and answers in which we are going to 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.960
 resolve any questions you have 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.699
 about online gta or gta 5 or in general 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.230
 rockstar from as I say the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.660
 questions that you leave in the comments 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.510
 of this video and when we take out the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.430
 first episode because of that video 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.690
 question and so we will choose several 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.040
 questions to answer so 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.160
 extensive we want to be videos 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.840
 extensive of about 67 minutes all 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.430
 It will depend on the number of questions because 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.200
 maybe if there are many and very 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.670
 interesting we can make videos of 15 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.440
 minutes and we still do not have it 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.300
 planned that everything will depend on the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.710
 questions that you leave us in this video and 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.840
 if it is in this video in which you have to 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.370
 leave any kind of doubt or question 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.530
 that you have about the game can be 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.270
 about next dlc can be about 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.980
 any kind of trick then that type 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.050
 of problem that you have had any 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.300
 type of concern or desire that you want 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.580
 check the probability of it coming out 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.680
 We will tell you if we know 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.270
 from any other type of comment 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.690
 in the videos we ask please 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.880
 put 2 points and then the question 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.800
 below for example of two points 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.410
 when the casino dlc comes out like this 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.600
 example any now I repeat it that 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.860
 it is necessary that you put it so that 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.600
 we can easily distinguish the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.610
 questions if you do not put we can pass 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.650
 unnoticed that's the comment 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.730
 although I always checked 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.110
 all comments and only 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.520
 answer them all in this case the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.650
 questions I will not answer them for 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.970
 leaving them for the video would not have the 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.560
 thank you and I answer them first 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.940
 text and then the a with the video because no 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.470
 It would be funny I will not answer the 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.090
 comments as always but the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.290
 questions I'll leave them for the video to 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.720
 solve them in the video so 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.280
 extensive and with the help of forward 09 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.080
 oaks here this video I hope you have 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.030
 liked do not forget to leave your 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.450
 comment and greetings and even the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.170
