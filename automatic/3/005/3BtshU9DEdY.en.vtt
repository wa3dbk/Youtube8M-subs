00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.690
 on the occasion of the broadcast of the ten 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.000
 eighth pokemon movie in Japan a short 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.009
 teaser on movie 19 was broadcast to 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.710
 the end of the film and would have unveiled a 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.810
 new pokemon the people who saw 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.509
 the film then drew the mysterious 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.040
 pokemon and on his drawings this one he 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.590
 represented green color 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.390
 with a red pattern and an eye 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.149
 bigger than the other during the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.610
 teaser he would have come out of the letter o of the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.379
 title pokemon the movie ex flocks and 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.420
 would have rebounded to finally fall 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.430
 then would have been seen after 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.110
 mysterious pokemon that appeared in 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.120
 the coro coro of august 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.860
 So we can wonder if this 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.600
 pokemon will have a link or report exile 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.400
 guard according to many fans 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.860
 it could be that this thing is a 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.370
 mini revolution that is to say the stage in 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.450
 underneath or then a new pokemon of 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.700
 the seventh generation 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.570
 but if it's a pokemon from the 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.159
 seventh generation 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.689
 it would still be very surprising to 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.259
 reveal a little kimon of this new 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.479
 generation 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.880
 while steals truck still has not 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.930
 been formalized which is part of 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.510
 the sixth generation 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.430
 to come back to ten guards as I 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.900
 you said an image was shown 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.479
 in coro coro and would unveil a 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.190
 mysterious pokemon this same pokemon 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.320
 appears in the teaser accompany the 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.210
 end of movie 18 and one may wonder 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.130
 did we have this thing? 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.210
 a relationship with six guards because it's 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.430
 true that there are several similarities 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.909
 as they come out of the diamond kia he has 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.260
 on his eyes suddenly blow is that 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.630
 this thing a relationship with six guards 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.040
 we do not know too much but a fan has drawn 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.920
 what could this mysterious 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.320
 pokemon this silhouette that we see 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.049
 and so suddenly is it a 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.939
 mega evolution or a second form 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.560
 nothing is known yet knows 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.510

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.490
