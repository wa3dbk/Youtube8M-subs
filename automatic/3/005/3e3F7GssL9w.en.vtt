00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
became really close with my professors

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.350 
became really close with my professors
because<00:00:31.779> they<00:00:32.650> work<00:00:32.890> together<00:00:33.100> they<00:00:33.370> put<00:00:34.269> our

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
because they work together they put our

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.060 
because they work together they put our
lesson<00:00:34.720> plans<00:00:34.960> together<00:00:35.199> it's<00:00:35.769> like<00:00:35.860> the

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
lesson plans together it's like the

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.469 
lesson plans together it's like the
support<00:00:36.430> system<00:00:36.790> like<00:00:36.910> you<00:00:37.000> have<00:00:37.180> other

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:37.479 
support system like you have other

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:39.630 
support system like you have other
people<00:00:37.900> to<00:00:37.989> fall<00:00:38.140> back<00:00:38.379> on<00:00:38.409> if<00:00:38.799> you<00:00:39.010> have<00:00:39.489> to

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
people to fall back on if you have to

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.009 
people to fall back on if you have to
miss<00:00:39.790> a<00:00:39.820> day<00:00:40.059> or<00:00:40.210> you<00:00:40.299> don't<00:00:40.540> understand

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
miss a day or you don't understand

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:48.910 
miss a day or you don't understand
something

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.189 

a<00:00:49.039> lot<00:00:49.609> of<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.789> work<00:00:49.969> you<00:00:50.269> know<00:00:50.420> work<00:00:50.839> for<00:00:51.079> one

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
a lot of the work you know work for one

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.770 
a lot of the work you know work for one
course<00:00:51.500> sort<00:00:52.280> of<00:00:52.370> coincides<00:00:53.179> with<00:00:53.300> work<00:00:53.600> for

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
course sort of coincides with work for

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.360 
course sort of coincides with work for
another<00:00:53.870> core<00:00:54.230> so<00:00:54.469> it<00:00:54.559> actually<00:00:54.710> lightens<00:00:55.280> the

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
another core so it actually lightens the

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.310 
another core so it actually lightens the
workload<00:00:55.820> a<00:00:55.850> little<00:00:56.149> for<00:00:56.359> students<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:56.960> that's

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
workload a little for students so that's

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.709 
workload a little for students so that's
nice<00:00:57.579> basically<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:58.699> communication<00:00:59.390> I<00:00:59.479> think

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
nice basically the communication I think

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.599 
nice basically the communication I think
this<00:00:59.870> mean<00:01:00.109> but<00:01:00.289> so<00:01:00.589> professor<00:01:00.949> so<00:01:01.399> that

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
this mean but so professor so that

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.819 
this mean but so professor so that
they're<00:01:02.089> all<00:01:02.239> on<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.539> same<00:01:02.719> page<00:01:02.780> you<00:01:03.379> know

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
they're all on the same page you know

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.340 
they're all on the same page you know
their<00:01:04.119> assignments<00:01:05.119> homework<00:01:05.869> assignments

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
their assignments homework assignments

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.710 
their assignments homework assignments
like<00:01:06.470> collaborating<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.490> different<00:01:07.880> the

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
like collaborating the different the

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.480 
like collaborating the different the
different<00:01:09.049> classes<00:01:09.440> together<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.460> that

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
different classes together so that

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.249 
different classes together so that
they're<00:01:10.850> all<00:01:11.060> you<00:01:11.479> know<00:01:11.600> working<00:01:11.780> towards<00:01:12.200> the

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
they're all you know working towards the

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.139 
they're all you know working towards the
same<00:01:12.289> objective<00:01:12.979> of<00:01:13.189> whatever<00:01:13.520> their<00:01:13.729> program

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
same objective of whatever their program

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:24.640 
same objective of whatever their program
or<00:01:14.270> cluster<00:01:14.659> specified

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.100 

I<00:01:24.740> think<00:01:25.400> it's<00:01:25.520> just<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:25.850> diversity<00:01:26.510> here<00:01:26.780> of

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
I think it's just a diversity here of

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.300 
I think it's just a diversity here of
all<00:01:27.290> different<00:01:27.500> students<00:01:28.040> of<00:01:28.160> all<00:01:28.280> different

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
all different students of all different

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.430 
all different students of all different
professors<00:01:29.060> coming<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.110> finding<00:01:30.350> that

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
professors coming and finding that

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.590 
professors coming and finding that
common<00:01:30.500> ground<00:01:30.890> together<00:01:31.190> because<00:01:32.060> you<00:01:32.480> know

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
common ground together because you know

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
common ground together because you know
I've<00:01:32.810> been<00:01:32.840> sitting<00:01:33.230> down<00:01:33.380> at<00:01:33.500> that<00:01:33.560> table

like ideas come to me inside just like
be<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:15.350> restricted<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.190> know<00:02:16.420> desert<00:02:17.420> but

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
be so restricted you know desert but

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:27.510 
be so restricted you know desert but
it's<00:02:18.170> really<00:02:18.350> I<00:02:18.620> like<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.310> pizza

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.300 

I<00:02:27.610> really<00:02:28.420> think<00:02:28.600> that<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.960> fyc<00:02:29.380> program<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.100> a

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
I really think that the fyc program is a

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.000 
I really think that the fyc program is a
really<00:02:30.790> positive<00:02:31.000> experience<00:02:31.330> for<00:02:32.010> the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
really positive experience for the

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.820 
really positive experience for the
president<00:02:33.600> it's<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:35.380> type<00:02:35.560> of<00:02:35.590> situation

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
president it's the type of situation

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.640 
president it's the type of situation
where<00:02:36.490> it's<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.790> great<00:02:37.380> transition<00:02:38.380> from<00:02:38.500> high

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
where it's a great transition from high

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.740 
where it's a great transition from high
school<00:02:39.010> into<00:02:39.190> college<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.880> like<00:02:40.210> that<00:02:40.360> boxing

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
school into college I like that boxing

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.560 
school into college I like that boxing
program<00:02:40.900> because<00:02:41.910> three<00:02:42.910> of<00:02:42.970> my<00:02:43.060> classes<00:02:43.120> are

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
program because three of my classes are

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.480 
program because three of my classes are
all<00:02:43.780> with<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.260> same<00:02:44.290> kids<00:02:44.740> and<00:02:44.950> it's<00:02:45.070> kind<00:02:45.370> of

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
all with the same kids and it's kind of

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.490 
all with the same kids and it's kind of
an<00:02:45.850> easier<00:02:46.270> transition<00:02:46.510> from<00:02:47.020> high<00:02:47.170> school<00:02:47.200> to

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
an easier transition from high school to

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.670 
an easier transition from high school to
college<00:02:48.330> where<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:49.900> get<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.200> meet<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.500> same

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
college where you get to meet the same

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.560 
college where you get to meet the same
people<00:02:50.860> every<00:02:51.220> day<00:02:51.250> it's<00:02:51.670> familiar<00:02:52.120> faces<00:02:52.330> and

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
people every day it's familiar faces and

00:02:52.570 --> 00:03:06.030 
people every day it's familiar faces and
it's<00:02:52.900> not<00:02:53.230> so<00:02:53.410> intimidating

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.530 

I<00:03:06.129> think<00:03:06.819> what's<00:03:06.939> really<00:03:07.000> nice<00:03:07.299> for<00:03:07.450> the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
I think what's really nice for the

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.839 
I think what's really nice for the
students<00:03:07.989> is<00:03:08.110> that<00:03:08.439> they<00:03:08.640> all<00:03:09.640> know<00:03:09.819> each

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
students is that they all know each

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.699 
students is that they all know each
other<00:03:10.150> as<00:03:10.359> they<00:03:10.510> go<00:03:10.629> from<00:03:10.750> class<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.049> class<00:03:11.230> I

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
other as they go from class to class I

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.470 
other as they go from class to class I
finally<00:03:12.159> have<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.310> really<00:03:12.549> nice<00:03:12.700> class<00:03:12.969> after

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
finally have a really nice class after

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.410 
finally have a really nice class after
fair<00:03:13.780> in<00:03:14.019> my<00:03:14.140> classes<00:03:14.409> and<00:03:14.799> I<00:03:15.219> compare<00:03:16.209> them<00:03:16.359> a

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
fair in my classes and I compare them a

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.640 
fair in my classes and I compare them a
little<00:03:16.540> bit<00:03:16.719> with<00:03:16.870> my<00:03:16.989> other<00:03:17.109> sections<00:03:17.530> that

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
little bit with my other sections that

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.589 
little bit with my other sections that
are<00:03:17.709> not<00:03:17.890> FY<00:03:18.189> c<00:03:18.340> sections<00:03:18.760> and<00:03:19.209> they<00:03:19.329> see<00:03:19.390> that

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
are not FY c sections and they see that

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.240 
are not FY c sections and they see that
there's<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.959> real<00:03:20.200> camaraderie<00:03:20.530> it's<00:03:21.159> a

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
there's a real camaraderie it's a

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.670 
there's a real camaraderie it's a
cohesiveness<00:03:21.640> of<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.510> group<00:03:22.780> they<00:03:23.349> could<00:03:23.500> get

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
cohesiveness of the group they could get

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.890 
cohesiveness of the group they could get
to<00:03:23.829> see<00:03:24.010> each<00:03:24.189> other<00:03:24.370> every<00:03:24.849> day<00:03:24.909> or<00:03:25.420> you<00:03:25.840> know

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
to see each other every day or you know

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.509 
to see each other every day or you know
freaking<00:03:26.290> three<00:03:26.409> times<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.829> week<00:03:26.859> and<00:03:27.189> that's

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
freaking three times a week and that's

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.610 
freaking three times a week and that's
much<00:03:27.730> better<00:03:27.909> than<00:03:28.269> if<00:03:29.109> you're<00:03:29.319> in<00:03:29.409> five

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
much better than if you're in five

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.140 
much better than if you're in five
independent<00:03:29.890> classes<00:03:30.579> because<00:03:30.700> you<00:03:31.000> don't

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
independent classes because you don't

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.910 
independent classes because you don't
get<00:03:31.359> things<00:03:31.480> like<00:03:31.720> connect<00:03:32.049> another<00:03:32.560> freshman

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920

but I'll tell you I wish I have this

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.780 
but I'll tell you I wish I have this
program<00:03:34.870> when<00:03:34.989> i<00:03:35.019> was<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.260> freshman<00:03:35.769> because<00:03:36.189> it

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
program when i was a freshman because it

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.039 
program when i was a freshman because it
would<00:03:36.969> make<00:03:37.090> my<00:03:37.299> life<00:03:37.329> a<00:03:37.629> little<00:03:37.780> easier

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
would make my life a little easier

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:40.440 
would make my life a little easier

together<00:03:52.629> and<00:03:52.900> then<00:03:52.989> you'll<00:03:53.109> kind<00:03:53.290> of<00:03:53.379> work

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
together and then you'll kind of work

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.050 
together and then you'll kind of work
towards<00:03:53.859> a<00:03:53.919> common<00:03:54.159> goal<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:54.639> I<00:03:54.700> think<00:03:54.790> it's

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
towards a common goal so I think it's

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.699 
towards a common goal so I think it's
good<00:03:55.299> in<00:03:55.419> that<00:03:55.569> sense<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.019> you<00:03:56.109> find<00:03:56.409> people

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
good in that sense that you find people

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.500 
good in that sense that you find people
with<00:03:56.829> similar<00:03:56.859> interests<00:03:57.519> and<00:03:57.790> then<00:03:58.239> you<00:03:58.329> can

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
with similar interests and then you can

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.909 
with similar interests and then you can
move<00:03:58.659> forward<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.290> that<00:03:59.379> way<00:03:59.590> you<00:03:59.650> don't<00:03:59.859> have

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
move forward and that way you don't have

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.550 
move forward and that way you don't have
to<00:04:00.099> have<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.700> uncomfortable<00:04:01.150> feeling<00:04:01.560> about

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
to have that uncomfortable feeling about

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.409 
to have that uncomfortable feeling about
who<00:04:02.829> do<00:04:02.980> I<00:04:03.099> know<00:04:03.370> how<00:04:03.909> am<00:04:04.030> I<00:04:04.090> going<00:04:04.209> to<00:04:04.299> find

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419 
who do I know how am I going to find

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.449 
who do I know how am I going to find
people<00:04:04.720> that<00:04:04.780> I'm<00:04:04.930> interested<00:04:05.260> in<00:04:05.560> so<00:04:06.280> put

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459

people that I'm interested in so put
your<00:04:06.609> step<00:04:07.419> ahead<00:04:07.569> of<00:04:07.720> cooking

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.069
