00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.610
 high stress and sports injuries 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.770
 are common with inflammation of the 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.000
 tend to be strained muscles ligaments or 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.250
 joints connected 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.100
 These are the cause of the occurring 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.750
 swelling and pain 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.700
 The cause of the complaints is one 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.890
 imbalance inflammation- offered materials 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.200
 in the affected tissue at each 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.290
 inflammation are messengers called so-called 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.730
 Cytokines significantly involved over them 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.379
 the different ones communicate 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.660
 Defensive cells of the body among themselves 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.600
 to pathogens or tissue damage 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.280
 to combat specifically 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.120
 There are cytokines which cause inflammation 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.960
 promote and those that inhibit it 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.539
 basically the inflammation is one 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.559
 necessary reaction of the immune system 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.270
 However, it must not be out of control 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.640
 devices 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.520
 one too many of the one group is called the 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.470
 inflammation so that it becomes acute 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.790
 one too much of the other group can be 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.790
 choose and become chronic 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.770
 acute or chronic cause is therefore one 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.350
 imbalance in the moon system 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.689
 the hour of the enzymes are enzymes 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.490
 Inflammatory regulators will be through them 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.940
 the inflammatory reaction to a healthy 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.760
 Measured returned 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.010
 where gasoline plus contains highly concentrated 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.170
 Enzymes of natural origin the the 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.420
 regulate the course of an inflammation and 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.729
 it happens like that 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.409
 the pre-bands plus tablets are like that 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.670
 They coated that acidic environment 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.650
 of the stomach to survive unscathed 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.479
 in the small intestine, the tablet then dissolves 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.570
 on and gives the special enzyme 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.159
 combination of gasoline plus free over 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.890
 the intestinal mucosa is supplied by the enzymes 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.930
 into the blood for intake of enzymes 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.399
 to ensure the intestine must 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.750
 tablets outside meals 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.250
 be taken 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.220
 in the blood, the enzymes are already from 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.680
 alpha 2 macro globally them expected 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.800
 alpha 2 macro globulin binds two 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.050
 enzymes cool it changes the protein 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.290
 his structure and attains a new one 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.119
 ability at the place of the happening at the 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.220
 The inflammation that occurs may cause it 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.320
 the inflammatory messengers bind the 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.240
 Excess of cytokines is skimmed off 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.550
 the immune balance will be back 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.470
 made the inflammation stop 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.670
 faster the symptoms such as 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.810
 example swelling and pain 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.970
 go back 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.450
 prevention course with the plus 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.540
 attraction against the inflammation 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:34.700
 inflammation away from pain where 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:38.120
 Gasoline plus enzymes can do more 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.120
