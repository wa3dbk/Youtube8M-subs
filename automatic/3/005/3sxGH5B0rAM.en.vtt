00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
craftsmanship I guess this is what they

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.890 
craftsmanship I guess this is what they
call<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.840> double<00:00:25.320> bank<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.820> just<00:00:27.689> have<00:00:27.869> to

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
really good and also that is not like

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.170 
really good and also that is not like
the<00:01:39.079> other<00:01:40.079> thing<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.729> not<00:01:41.729> many<00:01:41.970> ram

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the other thing that not many ram

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.230 
the other thing that not many ram
companies<00:01:42.659> do<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.100> like<00:01:44.670> nailed

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
companies do is that it's like nailed

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.440 
companies do is that it's like nailed
everything<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.860> nailed<00:01:47.299> with<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
everything like it's nailed with the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.380 
everything like it's nailed with the
nail<00:01:48.630> gun<00:01:48.659> i<00:01:48.899> guess<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:50.390> except

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
nail gun i guess like that except

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.440 
nail gun i guess like that except
exactly<00:01:52.079> like<00:01:52.290> Black<00:01:52.560> River<00:01:52.740> does<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:54.119> that's

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
exactly like Black River does so that's

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.630 
exactly like Black River does so that's
really<00:01:54.659> professional<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:58.130> it<00:01:59.130> doesn't<00:01:59.520> break

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
really professional and it doesn't break

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.700 
really professional and it doesn't break
as<00:01:59.880> easily<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.719> don't<00:02:01.049> think<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.350> would<00:02:01.500> break

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
as easily I don't think it would break

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.940 
as easily I don't think it would break
but<00:02:02.689> it's<00:02:03.689> like<00:02:03.930> really<00:02:04.259> hard<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.590> break<00:02:04.740> it

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
but it's like really hard to break it

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.400 
but it's like really hard to break it
and

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.450 

yeah<00:02:11.320> there's<00:02:12.320> really<00:02:12.590> not<00:02:12.830> much<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.130> say

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
yeah there's really not much to say

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.700 
yeah there's really not much to say
about<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.730> craftsmanship<00:02:14.180> because<00:02:14.660> I<00:02:14.960> don't

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
about the craftsmanship because I don't

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.260 
about the craftsmanship because I don't
really<00:02:15.740> I<00:02:16.130> don't<00:02:16.160> really<00:02:16.400> want<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.820> compare<00:02:17.240> it

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
really I don't really want to compare it

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.050 
really I don't really want to compare it
to<00:02:17.360> out<00:02:17.600> to<00:02:17.870> other<00:02:18.020> companies<00:02:18.260> but<00:02:18.830> i<00:02:19.190> would

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
to out to other companies but i would

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.690 
to out to other companies but i would
actually<00:02:20.180> actually<00:02:20.960> say<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.260> is<00:02:21.740> exactly

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
actually actually say that is exactly

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.280 
actually actually say that is exactly
like<00:02:22.940> black<00:02:23.570> rammer<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:25.510> yeah<00:02:26.510> that's<00:02:27.080> about

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
like black rammer so yeah that's about

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.860 
like black rammer so yeah that's about
it<00:02:27.440> for<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.800> craftsmanship<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:31.300> as<00:02:32.300> far<00:02:32.750> as

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870
