so we actually lost a huge chunk of time
while<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.530> was<00:00:13.650> waiting<00:00:14.009> for<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.280> stats<00:00:14.549> to

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
while I was waiting for the stats to

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.240 
while I was waiting for the stats to
come<00:00:14.910> in<00:00:15.030> for<00:00:15.240> like<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.690> bullet<00:00:15.990> my<00:00:16.740> bad

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
come in for like the bullet my bad

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.420 
come in for like the bullet my bad
I'll<00:00:17.970> try<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.180> avoid<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.690> future<00:00:19.430> anyway

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430

so<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.119> episode<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.720> think<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.170> need<00:00:22.320> to

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
so for this episode I think we need to

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.810 
so for this episode I think we need to
use<00:00:22.500> some<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.070> topics<00:00:23.250> we've<00:00:23.580> just

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
use some of the topics we've just

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.470 
use some of the topics we've just
research<00:00:24.180> for<00:00:24.480> example<00:00:25.199> we<00:00:25.650> just<00:00:25.980> researched

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
research for example we just researched

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.390 
research for example we just researched
sci-fi<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.410> might<00:00:28.590> as<00:00:28.680> well<00:00:28.769> do<00:00:28.949> that

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
sci-fi so we might as well do that

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
tombow or not we just don't know yet so

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.900 
tombow or not we just don't know yet so
this<00:00:54.000> will<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> good<00:00:54.420> test<00:00:55.640> now<00:00:56.640> another

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
this will be a good test now another

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.220 
this will be a good test now another
thing<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.210> want<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.480> eventually<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:57.989> is

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
thing I want to eventually do is

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.130 
thing I want to eventually do is
research<00:00:58.680> custom<00:00:59.340> game<00:00:59.550> engine<00:00:59.579> I<00:01:00.270> think<00:01:00.930> will

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
research custom game engine I think will

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.840 
research custom game engine I think will
be<00:01:01.230> very<00:01:01.440> useful<00:01:01.770> when<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:01.949> publish<00:01:02.460> for<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
be very useful when we publish for the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.469 
be very useful when we publish for the
tes<00:01:03.359> or<00:01:03.600> NES<00:01:04.049> or<00:01:04.229> whatever<00:01:05.060> but<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.270> can't

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
tes or NES or whatever but we can't

currently<00:01:06.960> do<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.229> yet<00:01:07.380> because<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:07.740> don't

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
currently do it yet because we don't

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.950 
currently do it yet because we don't
have<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.159> research<00:01:08.400> points<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.659> currently

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
have the research points so currently

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.880 
have the research points so currently
it's<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.170> something<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.740> prepare

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
it's just something we have to prepare

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.830 
it's just something we have to prepare
for<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.580> keep<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:11.909> mind<00:01:13.549> alright<00:01:14.630> so<00:01:15.630> we're

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.570 
course it's gonna be sci-fi genre RPG
hopefully<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.530> will<00:01:22.619> be<00:01:22.740> better<00:01:22.920> than<00:01:23.130> black

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
hopefully this will be better than black

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.660 
hopefully this will be better than black
lord<00:01:23.850> matumbo<00:01:25.159> alright<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.369> looking<00:01:26.549> at

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
lord matumbo alright so looking at

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.940 
lord matumbo alright so looking at
market<00:01:26.970> share<00:01:27.119> right<00:01:27.299> now<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:28.020> g6<00:01:28.409> store<00:01:28.680> is

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
market share right now the g6 store is

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.480 
market share right now the g6 store is
not<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.430> far<00:01:29.670> behind<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.150> tes<00:01:31.130> ever<00:01:32.130> if

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
not that far behind the tes ever if

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.800 
not that far behind the tes ever if
we're<00:01:32.640> making<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.939> lot<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.119> money<00:01:33.329> any

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
we're making a lot of money any

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.690 
we're making a lot of money any
percentage<00:01:34.350> game<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.829> actually<00:01:35.100> worth<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.490> lot

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
percentage game is actually worth a lot

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.450 
percentage game is actually worth a lot
so<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.270> think<00:01:36.720> developing<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.680> TS<00:01:38.070> might

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
so I think developing for the TS might

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.609 
so I think developing for the TS might
be<00:01:38.579> worth<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.939> especially<00:01:39.570> since<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.380> think<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
be worth it especially since I think the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.219 
be worth it especially since I think the
G<00:01:40.829> 64<00:01:41.400> doesn't<00:01:41.939> end<00:01:42.090> up<00:01:42.270> doing<00:01:42.780> very<00:01:42.810> well<00:01:43.020> in

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
G 64 doesn't end up doing very well in

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.679 
G 64 doesn't end up doing very well in
the<00:01:43.320> long<00:01:43.439> run<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.329> that's<00:01:45.329> why<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.479> want<00:01:45.630> to

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
the long run so that's why I want to

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.310 
the long run so that's why I want to
plan<00:01:45.869> ahead

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
plan ahead

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.200 
plan ahead
what's<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.920> big<00:01:47.100> issue<00:01:47.189> here<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.670> huge

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
what's the big issue here is that huge

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.980 
what's the big issue here is that huge
licensing<00:01:48.899> cost

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
licensing cost

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.480 
licensing cost
but<00:01:50.409> I<00:01:50.439> don't<00:01:50.619> want<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:50.770> do<00:01:50.920> that<00:01:51.040> yet<00:01:51.280> until

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
but I don't want to do that yet until

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.149 
but I don't want to do that yet until
I've<00:01:51.970> done<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.240> custom<00:01:52.689> game<00:01:52.810> engine<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.920> first

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
I've done a custom game engine so first

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.249 
I've done a custom game engine so first
things<00:01:54.340> first<00:01:54.399> let's<00:01:54.820> do<00:01:55.030> another<00:01:55.119> g64<00:01:58.049> mmm<00:01:59.049> I

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
things first let's do another g64 mmm I

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.920 
things first let's do another g64 mmm I
think<00:01:59.619> we'll<00:01:59.710> just<00:01:59.860> do<00:01:59.920> a<00:01:59.950> text<00:02:00.280> based<00:02:00.460> RPG

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
think we'll just do a text based RPG

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.789 
think we'll just do a text based RPG
this<00:02:01.930> doesn't<00:02:02.259> seem<00:02:02.350> like<00:02:02.500> something<00:02:02.770> that

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
this doesn't seem like something that

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.669 
this doesn't seem like something that
will<00:02:03.009> need<00:02:03.159> really<00:02:03.460> fancy<00:02:03.789> graphics<00:02:04.180> for<00:02:04.360> yet

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.740 

all<00:02:08.679> right<00:02:09.119> looking<00:02:10.119> good<00:02:10.239> so<00:02:10.450> far

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
all right looking good so far

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.259 
all right looking good so far
well<00:02:10.989> it's<00:02:11.260> an<00:02:11.349> RPG<00:02:11.910> storing<00:02:12.910> quests<00:02:13.209> of

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
well it's an RPG storing quests of

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.150 
well it's an RPG storing quests of
course<00:02:14.160> engine<00:02:15.160> seems<00:02:15.459> less<00:02:15.700> important

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
course engine seems less important

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.500 
course engine seems less important
here's<00:02:18.160> where<00:02:18.340> my<00:02:18.670> issue<00:02:18.880> with<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.150> engine

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
here's where my issue with the engine

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.000 
here's where my issue with the engine
because<00:02:19.750> it's<00:02:19.900> not<00:02:20.080> like<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.410> Final<00:02:20.680> Fantasy

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
because it's not like the Final Fantasy

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.620 
because it's not like the Final Fantasy
7<00:02:21.160> moment<00:02:21.610> where<00:02:21.730> engine<00:02:22.120> became<00:02:22.299> a<00:02:22.360> big<00:02:22.600> deal

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
7 moment where engine became a big deal

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.009 
7 moment where engine became a big deal
yet<00:02:23.080> right<00:02:23.319> so<00:02:24.280> how<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.459> this<00:02:24.610> game<00:02:24.850> gonna<00:02:25.019> take

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
yet right so how is this game gonna take

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.170 
yet right so how is this game gonna take
care<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:26.440> like<00:02:27.370> at<00:02:27.580> this<00:02:27.730> point<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.060> would

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
care of that like at this point I would

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.430 
care of that like at this point I would
think<00:02:28.299> game<00:02:28.540> play<00:02:28.750> is<00:02:28.840> more<00:02:28.959> important<00:02:29.350> I

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
think game play is more important I

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.470 
think game play is more important I
think<00:02:29.500> eventually<00:02:29.910> we'll<00:02:30.910> actually<00:02:31.239> switch

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
think eventually we'll actually switch

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:39.320 
think eventually we'll actually switch
over<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:32.700> don't<00:02:33.700> know<00:02:33.760> let's<00:02:34.360> do<00:02:34.569> this<00:02:34.690> for<00:02:34.900> now

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.120 

not<00:02:40.330> bad<00:02:40.569> wow<00:02:41.230> we<00:02:41.470> have<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.590> lot<00:02:41.799> of<00:02:41.950> design

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
not bad wow we have a lot of design

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.809 
not bad wow we have a lot of design
points<00:02:43.080> all<00:02:44.080> right<00:02:44.350> so<00:02:44.980> dialogue<00:02:45.640> is

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
points all right so dialogue is

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.479 
points all right so dialogue is
important

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
important

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.220 
important
the<00:02:48.489> level<00:02:48.790> design<00:02:48.819> I<00:02:49.450> guess<00:02:49.630> is<00:02:49.750> important

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
the level design I guess is important

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.870 
the level design I guess is important
I'm<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:51.099> little<00:02:51.280> worried<00:02:51.459> about<00:02:51.489> this<00:02:51.670> balance

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
I'm a little worried about this balance

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.150 
I'm a little worried about this balance
again<00:02:52.239> we<00:02:52.450> might<00:02:52.750> go<00:02:53.349> off<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.620> rails

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
again we might go off the rails

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.590 
again we might go off the rails
see<00:02:54.640> that's<00:02:54.850> what<00:02:54.970> would<00:02:55.060> happen<00:02:55.299> last<00:02:55.450> night

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
see that's what would happen last night

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.449 
see that's what would happen last night
watching<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:56.200> lot<00:02:56.769> of<00:02:56.829> things<00:02:57.010> happened<00:02:57.340> last

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
watching a lot of things happened last

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.430 
watching a lot of things happened last
time<00:02:57.730> this<00:02:58.420> time<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:58.870> think<00:02:58.930> we<00:02:59.109> picked<00:02:59.320> a

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
time this time I think we picked a

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.520 
time this time I think we picked a
decent<00:02:59.890> combo<00:03:00.220> but<00:03:00.810> we<00:03:01.810> might<00:03:02.019> be<00:03:02.140> screwed<00:03:02.380> in

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
decent combo but we might be screwed in

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.330 
decent combo but we might be screwed in
this<00:03:02.650> design<00:03:03.100> -<00:03:03.310> technology<00:03:03.790> mix<00:03:05.160> no<00:03:06.160> wait

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
this design - technology mix no wait

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.060 
this design - technology mix no wait
this<00:03:06.820> is<00:03:06.910> an<00:03:06.970> RPG<00:03:07.060> hi<00:03:07.630> designs<00:03:07.989> good<00:03:08.200> there<00:03:08.620> at

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
this is an RPG hi designs good there at

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.720 
this is an RPG hi designs good there at
least<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:09.910> think<00:03:10.030> high<00:03:10.420> design<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:10.900> good<00:03:11.730> we'll

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
least I think high design is good we'll

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:23.849 
least I think high design is good we'll
see<00:03:19.410> all<00:03:20.410> right<00:03:20.799> RPG<00:03:21.430> world<00:03:22.680> graphics<00:03:23.680> and

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
see all right RPG world graphics and

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.069 
see all right RPG world graphics and
sound<00:03:24.130> I<00:03:24.340> don't<00:03:24.430> know<00:03:24.609> to<00:03:24.880> me<00:03:25.000> that<00:03:25.959> both

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
sound I don't know to me that both

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.990 
sound I don't know to me that both
equally<00:03:26.470> important<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:29.590> I<00:03:30.160> think<00:03:30.700> world

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
equally important so I think world

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.970 
equally important so I think world
design<00:03:31.269> is<00:03:31.359> probably<00:03:31.540> more<00:03:32.410> important<00:03:32.950> than

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
design is probably more important than

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:42.740 
design is probably more important than
both<00:03:33.130> of<00:03:33.190> them<00:03:33.959> yeah<00:03:34.959> see<00:03:35.319> what<00:03:35.380> happens<00:03:35.680> today

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.030 

all<00:03:43.750> right<00:03:43.930> now<00:03:44.260> let's<00:03:44.500> see<00:03:44.590> whether<00:03:44.830> my

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
all right now let's see whether my

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.040 
all right now let's see whether my
theory<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:45.459> high<00:03:45.760> design<00:03:46.060> is<00:03:46.239> good<00:03:46.390> for<00:03:46.540> RPG

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
theory that high design is good for RPG

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.120 
theory that high design is good for RPG
is<00:03:47.260> true<00:03:47.620> or<00:03:47.739> not

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
is true or not

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:56.509 
is true or not
see<00:03:48.940> what<00:03:49.060> happens<00:03:52.319> new<00:03:53.319> record<00:03:53.680> not<00:03:53.860> bad

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.580 

it<00:03:57.519> is<00:03:57.700> great<00:03:58.000> combo<00:03:58.360> excellent<00:03:58.989> so<00:03:59.170> sci-fi

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
it is great combo excellent so sci-fi

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.860 
it is great combo excellent so sci-fi
RPG<00:04:00.190> is<00:04:00.400> a<00:04:00.430> great<00:04:00.849> combo<00:04:01.209> we<00:04:01.450> might<00:04:01.599> use<00:04:01.750> this

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
RPG is a great combo we might use this

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.740 
RPG is a great combo we might use this
again<00:04:02.170> in<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.349> future<00:04:02.380> when<00:04:03.040> we<00:04:03.069> do<00:04:03.280> sequels

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
again in the future when we do sequels

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.770 
again in the future when we do sequels
could<00:04:04.750> be<00:04:04.840> an<00:04:04.900> option<00:04:05.700> now<00:04:06.700> this<00:04:07.030> time<00:04:07.239> our

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
could be an option now this time our

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.259 
could be an option now this time our
design<00:04:08.620> was<00:04:08.890> a<00:04:08.950> high<00:04:09.489> record<00:04:09.790> endings<00:04:10.209> only

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
design was a high record endings only

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.090 
design was a high record endings only
one<00:04:10.569> higher<00:04:10.750> than<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:11.019> last<00:04:11.260> game<00:04:11.500> but

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
one higher than the last game but

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.970 
one higher than the last game but
technology<00:04:12.640> is<00:04:12.760> kind<00:04:13.150> on<00:04:13.299> the<00:04:13.420> low<00:04:13.569> side<00:04:13.980> we'll

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
technology is kind on the low side we'll

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.590 
technology is kind on the low side we'll
see<00:04:15.160> what<00:04:15.280> happens<00:04:17.669> all<00:04:18.669> right<00:04:18.729> what<00:04:19.419> does<00:04:19.540> the

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
see what happens all right what does the

see what happens all right what does the
review<00:04:19.930> say<00:04:22.050> hey<00:04:23.050> not<00:04:23.590> bad<00:04:23.620> not<00:04:24.310> bad

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.330 

so<00:04:32.290> this<00:04:32.440> is<00:04:32.560> sort<00:04:32.740> of<00:04:32.800> where<00:04:32.919> it's<00:04:33.130> kind<00:04:33.280> of

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
so this is sort of where it's kind of

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.170 
so this is sort of where it's kind of
hard<00:04:33.490> to<00:04:33.550> tell<00:04:33.790> I<00:04:34.090> think<00:04:35.080> in<00:04:35.200> terms<00:04:35.410> of<00:04:35.650> the

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
hard to tell I think in terms of the

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.879 
hard to tell I think in terms of the
design<00:04:37.180> of<00:04:37.360> technology<00:04:37.750> points<00:04:38.050> overall<00:04:38.770> we

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
design of technology points overall we

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.040 
design of technology points overall we
were<00:04:38.979> lower<00:04:39.130> than<00:04:39.220> last<00:04:39.460> time<00:04:39.840> stuff<00:04:40.840> we<00:04:40.930> kind

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
were lower than last time stuff we kind

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.290 
were lower than last time stuff we kind
of<00:04:41.169> pretty<00:04:41.350> damn<00:04:41.590> good<00:04:41.770> score<00:04:42.100> so<00:04:42.130> how<00:04:43.090> does

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
of pretty damn good score so how does

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.610 
of pretty damn good score so how does
the<00:04:43.419> actual<00:04:43.720> review<00:04:44.050> system<00:04:44.320> in<00:04:44.410> this<00:04:44.470> game

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
the actual review system in this game

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
work is it affected by genre is it not

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
need more research points it's not just

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.719 
need more research points it's not just
the<00:05:02.500> game<00:05:02.650> engine<00:05:02.860> I<00:05:03.010> need<00:05:03.160> there<00:05:03.430> are<00:05:03.460> other

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
numeric so we can clearly see whether I

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.170 
numeric so we can clearly see whether I
achieve<00:05:22.780> it<00:05:22.900> or<00:05:23.020> not<00:05:23.200> and<00:05:23.860> overall<00:05:24.850> the<00:05:25.000> point

of the challenge is for me to take all

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.700 
of the challenge is for me to take all
my<00:05:26.889> previous<00:05:27.100> game<00:05:27.490> data<00:05:27.729> and<00:05:28.030> use<00:05:28.600> it<00:05:28.630> to<00:05:28.960> sort

possibly might lack a mastery and of

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.120 
possibly might lack a mastery and of
course<00:05:35.080> since<00:05:35.200> you're<00:05:35.320> giving<00:05:35.590> a<00:05:35.620> challenge

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
not really a challenge if I don't get

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.670 
not really a challenge if I don't get
punished<00:05:40.000> for<00:05:40.060> it<00:05:40.210> right<00:05:40.419> no<00:05:41.410> that's<00:05:41.560> just

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
something to keep in mind let's go see

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.810 
something to keep in mind let's go see
how<00:05:43.780> well<00:05:43.990> this<00:05:44.110> game<00:05:44.289> sells

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
how well this game sells

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.970 
how well this game sells
all<00:05:46.820> right<00:05:47.120> so<00:05:47.330> based<00:05:47.510> on<00:05:47.690> the<00:05:48.290> score<00:05:48.710> and

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
all right so based on the score and

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.650 
all right so based on the score and
topsails<00:05:49.670> rank<00:05:49.940> we're<00:05:50.390> actually<00:05:50.480> just

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
topsails rank we're actually just

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.650 
topsails rank we're actually just
slightly<00:05:51.320> below<00:05:51.680> like<00:05:52.130> the<00:05:52.280> bullying<00:05:52.660> however

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
slightly below like the bullying however

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.170 
slightly below like the bullying however
in<00:05:53.870> terms<00:05:53.990> of<00:05:54.170> profit<00:05:54.620> we<00:05:54.800> made<00:05:55.010> 40k<00:05:55.820> more

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
in terms of profit we made 40k more

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.680 
in terms of profit we made 40k more
roughly<00:05:57.140> 25<00:05:57.860> percent<00:05:57.890> more<00:05:58.340> profit<00:05:58.730> that's

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
roughly 25 percent more profit that's

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.780 
roughly 25 percent more profit that's
kind<00:05:59.900> of<00:05:59.930> awesome<00:06:00.260> and<00:06:00.530> in<00:06:01.340> the<00:06:01.400> future<00:06:01.580> I

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
kind of awesome and in the future I

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.700 
kind of awesome and in the future I
might<00:06:01.940> make<00:06:02.150> more<00:06:02.390> sequels<00:06:02.810> of<00:06:02.870> this<00:06:03.020> like<00:06:03.470> say

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
might make more sequels of this like say

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.850 
might make more sequels of this like say
Jericho<00:06:04.280> recommended<00:06:04.820> but<00:06:05.720> until<00:06:05.960> then<00:06:06.140> thank
