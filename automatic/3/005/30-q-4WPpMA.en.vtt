00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.040

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.990
 hello and welcome guys I'm axel and today 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.270
 I bring you the ornament of a vigilante 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.180
 I had promised greetings to Katz 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.240
 odreman giovanni words in agacho then 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.210
 Look, it was he who gave me the idea and here 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.550
 thousand years later then I make the video for 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.739
 start we need to go to the militia of 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.829
 astrud castle of a magna el borgo 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.430
 justiciero village buried and cold 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.840
 stress we need to click on the 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.610
 posters and a mission appears 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.590
 we just have to go look for 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.120
 that monster kill him and deliver him in the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.190
 zone once we enter all the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.410
 monsters if we do not know where there are any 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.899
 Well, simply go here to the tab 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.749
 of bestiary for example in the case of 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.059
 the cakes already say cakes and where 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:03.780
 it is then we give you here we see that you are 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.180
 we already give cakes to the magnifying glass and we 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.220
 says in the area where it usually appears not 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.550
 it's always but good we go testing 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.090
 in the case of no 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.460
 it would be close to will is to look for it 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.010
 kill him deliver all the monsters and 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.420
 then kill the vigilantes also what 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.210
 good thing is that if we kill all those 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.320
 monsters we will make the achievement that we see 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.320
 here in this little eyelash 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.130
 in search and capture then if the 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.150
 we deliver all of the mandalas those of 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.560
 magna those of the village those of cold stress 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.150
 well here 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.150
 we will get enough achievements too 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.399
 now we go to the tab 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.649
 vigilante that is what is going to 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.780
 interest to take out the ornament 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.020
 first here we have here fly 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.970
 supervillain are simply missions the 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.060
 first is with the captain to magna that 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.770
 we have spoken and previously with him and 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.049
 once we do this mission we can already 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.049
 go down to the area of ​​vigilantes to the base 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.909
 to be able to do all the other things 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.770
 the missions are not difficult but 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.840
 yes it is true that as a puppet is 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.880
 the army of shadow and prestige and 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.069
 pollution are going to ask us to go to 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.769
 several dungeon in this case the first 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.950
 it will be drama of the second shadow and the 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:21.739
 third mercator then we have here 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.260
 down alive or dead because these are the 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.140
 monsters from looking for the area 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.000
 justiciero that would be the summits erased 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.489
 dera poisons and the field interest 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.709
 we also need to go to where drama 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.630
 mercator shadow and those of cold three that 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.640
 they are english similar clean me free and 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.400
 count against back 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.709
 once we kill all this they give us 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.930
 the badge of vigilantes that if we give 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.819
 here to the recipe we see here the layer of 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.510
 vigilantes that apart from having a 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.069
 good looks can give us a p 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.680
 well let's say with the tabs 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.750
 we are in hazing practical training and 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.430
 new justicieros approval of 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.379
 new promotion of vigilantes because it is 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.150
 fairly simple they are practical in 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.370
 Improvised combat learning are 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.590
 different missions and doctorate in 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.989
 approach after the tie to ment 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.750
 from third parties so what we have to 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.030
 to do is go down once we have done 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.440
 the missions and let us go down if not 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.989
 meet the requirements is that you have not 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.590
 finished the mission to protect and serve 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.079
 we speak with flechita malva and we 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.359
 we go to the school of 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.670
 vigilantes if we get to this map 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:31.370
 Well, we see that here is how I scale 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.819
 teaching the crow acz and we have here 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.319
 those for recruits to be able to do 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.109
 those missions we just talk to 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.599
 strings here we would appear then teach 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.549
 or help a recruit or something and 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.459
 we then give us the option to choose 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:49.010
 for example if we want to go to cakes already 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.440
 they send us to the map where would be cakes 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.350
 already and 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.600
 with four characters plus the recruit 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.710
 we have to kill that enemy 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.470
 obviously the first monster we can 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.270
 kill them alone and as they go 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.040
 increasing the difficulty as we can 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.040
 bring then other allies 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.460
 monsters that cost me more to me 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.100
 it was me mechanisms so that I recommend 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:15.160
 characters that stick to water or agility 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.630
 and what plugin since we need to be 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.850
 stay at the tap to remove the 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.389
 invulnerability and above it is thrown 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.759
 a shield hits a pretty 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.650
 pretty hard it was shown apart that 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.229
 we have the recruit that normally 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.990
 artificial intelligence leaves a lot that 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.879
 wish since we have that we can not 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.670
 allow him to die because if he does not 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:38.880
 lose the fight 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.500
 and it has as it goes quite sack and 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.880
 quite suicidal was shown and sometimes 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.010
 it even hits us 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.220
 well in that case if we do we have 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.810
 all the monsters already captured 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.450
 we can talk to crows have a 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.730
 same day if we are motivated we can 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.280
 take out all these all these 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.480
 missions that would be practical 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.640
 Bachelor's master's apprenticeships and 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.130
 doctorate doctorates are those of 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.450
 frigo stress and everything is increasing according to 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.710
 the difficulty then we have hazing and 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.300
 practical training for hazing 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.830
 pretty simple since if we go 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.050
 killing here in new promotion of 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.570
 vigilantes are going to come out monsters and 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.820
 either we're going to kill the monster and a 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.800
 recruit because you can be the recruit 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.450
 explosive the sautéed edged and 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.370
 depending on what you are going to help yourself 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.790
 you go here marking as you have 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.860
 helped and once you help everyone 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:32.410
 they give you these 10 points of achievement and 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.120
 the last one is the one that there is hardly 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.150
 information is this that is the 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.090
 practical training for this we need 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.520
 10 weeks we talk in this case with 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.800
 escalo 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.690
 and we tell you what training we want 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.139
 do we can put it first year 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:51.659
 usually lets us choose and the random 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.360
 it tells us that click here we have these 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:57.240
 little leaves from here we go to the zone of 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.030
 training and he gives us one randomly from the 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:03.300
 monsters of that formation if the first 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.159
 year for example is an acorn piece and 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.560
 others more because maybe by chance 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:08.699
 gives us pieces acorn we kill him and now 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.240
 we will have to wait for the next 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:15.060
 week to give us the next 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.650
 once we have achieved for all 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.620
 achievements are obviously going to give us the 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:23.030
 ornament 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:25.040
 here we see if we do the mission is this 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.990
 the one of hazing practical training and 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.080
 new promotion of vigilantes give us 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.630
 the title of justifier of the chrome and the 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.310
 justice ornament in that sense 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.370
 It is quite simple but it is true 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.380
 that makes it difficult to kill the 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.450
 most hardcore monsters in the area 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.400
 justiciero and have captured all the 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.490
 monsters before before coming to 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.770
 Justicialists of rest the missions are 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.330
 pretty simple and good I hope that you 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.470
 have solved the doubts we see the 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.470
 next video and greetings
