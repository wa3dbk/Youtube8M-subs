00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.310 
right here when you're looking at the
bomb<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.790> like<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.570> bomb<00:01:48.930> should<00:01:49.200> be

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
bomb just like that the bomb should be

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.010 
bomb just like that the bomb should be
placed<00:01:49.560> right<00:01:49.799> there<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.759> if<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.509> can<00:01:51.750> make

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
placed right there so if you can make

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.219 
placed right there so if you can make
your<00:01:52.140> way<00:01:52.200> over<00:01:52.380> into<00:01:52.920> school<00:01:53.460> over<00:01:53.790> here<00:01:54.229> run

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
your way over into school over here run

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.499 
your way over into school over here run
all<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.710> way<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.829> school<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.490> all<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> way<00:01:57.450> to

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
all the way in school and all the way to

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.830 
all the way in school and all the way to
where<00:01:57.780> be<00:01:58.079> bomb<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.500> now<00:01:59.130> if<00:01:59.549> you<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.479> a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
where be bomb is now if you have a

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.959 
where be bomb is now if you have a
overkill<00:02:01.829> sniper<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.280> would<00:02:02.430> be<00:02:02.549> completely

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
overkill sniper this would be completely

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.520 
overkill sniper this would be completely
dominant<00:02:03.450> because<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.960> could<00:02:04.140> have<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> better

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
dominant because you could have a better

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.260 
dominant because you could have a better
view<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.070> but<00:02:05.579> if<00:02:05.729> they're<00:02:05.880> going<00:02:06.060> for

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
view of this but if they're going for

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.559 
view of this but if they're going for
the<00:02:06.360> diffuse<00:02:07.129> welcome<00:02:08.129> just<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.060> just

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
the diffuse welcome just like that just

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.119 
the diffuse welcome just like that just
jump<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:09.869> top<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.349> thing<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.800> can<00:02:10.860> see

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
jump on top of that thing so you can see

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.730 
jump on top of that thing so you can see
if<00:02:11.220> they're<00:02:11.370> laying<00:02:11.580> down

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
if they're laying down

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.040 
if they're laying down
if<00:02:13.010> you're<00:02:13.160> doing<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.580> you<00:02:14.000> are<00:02:14.030> pretty<00:02:14.780> much

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
if you're doing that you are pretty much

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.920 
if you're doing that you are pretty much
all<00:02:15.320> set<00:02:15.560> if<00:02:15.710> there<00:02:16.270> crouched<00:02:17.270> down<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.780> makes

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
all set if there crouched down it makes

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.380 
all set if there crouched down it makes
it<00:02:18.110> even<00:02:18.200> easier<00:02:18.500> but<00:02:19.400> like<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:20.030> said<00:02:20.060> if<00:02:20.360> you

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
it even easier but like I said if you

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.060 
it even easier but like I said if you
have<00:02:20.570> an<00:02:20.660> overkill<00:02:20.990> sniper<00:02:21.320> these<00:02:21.620> spots<00:02:21.890> are

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
have an overkill sniper these spots are

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.240 
have an overkill sniper these spots are
just<00:02:22.340> come<00:02:22.640> finally<00:02:23.210> just<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:24.200> will<00:02:24.380> decimate
