this is true but I think moto3 has 16
rounds<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.380> think<00:03:29.620> it's<00:03:29.770> hips<00:03:30.010> to<00:03:30.190> round<00:03:30.400> on<00:03:30.550> the

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.190 
rounds I think it's hips to round on the
hundred<00:03:30.910> percent<00:03:31.150> although<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:31.930> can<00:03:32.080> let<00:03:32.170> me
