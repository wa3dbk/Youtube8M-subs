00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
like and it is very dark once again as I

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.290 
like and it is very dark once again as I
said<00:05:42.870> so<00:05:43.680> if<00:05:44.160> you<00:05:44.700> like<00:05:44.850> to<00:05:44.940> wear<00:05:45.060> a<00:05:45.090> lot<00:05:45.270> of

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
said so if you like to wear a lot of

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.630 
said so if you like to wear a lot of
dark<00:05:45.570> colors<00:05:45.960> on<00:05:46.169> your<00:05:46.200> eyes<00:05:46.470> sometimes<00:05:47.190> I

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
dark colors on your eyes sometimes I

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.610 
dark colors on your eyes sometimes I
like<00:05:47.910> to<00:05:47.940> change<00:05:48.300> up<00:05:48.510> my<00:05:48.660> eyeshadow<00:05:49.169> routine

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
like to change up my eyeshadow routine

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.190 
like to change up my eyeshadow routine
and<00:05:49.830> I'll<00:05:50.370> go<00:05:50.550> really<00:05:50.880> dark<00:05:51.210> for<00:05:51.600> one<00:05:51.750> day<00:05:51.960> and

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
and I'll go really dark for one day and

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.920 
and I'll go really dark for one day and
so<00:05:53.040> that's<00:05:53.460> kind<00:05:54.180> of<00:05:54.270> why<00:05:54.390> I<00:05:54.419> bought<00:05:54.720> it

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
so that's kind of why I bought it

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.680 
so that's kind of why I bought it
because<00:05:55.200> I<00:05:55.650> just<00:05:56.580> like<00:05:56.700> to<00:05:57.150> wear<00:05:57.240> dark<00:05:57.480> colors

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
because I just like to wear dark colors

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.690 
because I just like to wear dark colors
sometimes<00:05:58.020> and<00:05:58.500> so<00:05:58.919> I<00:05:59.160> think<00:05:59.430> it's<00:05:59.610> really

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
sometimes and so I think it's really

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.000 
sometimes and so I think it's really
pretty<00:06:00.090> for<00:06:00.210> that<00:06:00.390> last<00:06:00.720> thing<00:06:01.080> that<00:06:01.110> I<00:06:01.320> got<00:06:01.680> is

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
pretty for that last thing that I got is

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.000 
pretty for that last thing that I got is
this<00:06:02.669> is<00:06:03.180> this<00:06:03.480> bareMinerals<00:06:03.810> bronzer<00:06:04.800> and

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
this is this bareMinerals bronzer and

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.550 
this is this bareMinerals bronzer and
this<00:06:05.400> is<00:06:05.580> the<00:06:05.730> color<00:06:05.970> warm<00:06:06.390> and<00:06:06.600> it<00:06:07.020> looks<00:06:07.440> like

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
this is the color warm and it looks like

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.320 
this is the color warm and it looks like
this

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.510 

it's<00:06:12.330> not<00:06:12.660> too<00:06:12.930> light<00:06:13.170> not<00:06:13.470> too<00:06:13.650> dark<00:06:13.890> and<00:06:14.100> I

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
it's not too light not too dark and I

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.900 
it's not too light not too dark and I
have<00:06:14.700> very<00:06:14.910> fair<00:06:15.300> skin<00:06:15.360> and<00:06:16.020> so<00:06:16.950> I<00:06:17.280> don't<00:06:17.700> like

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
have very fair skin and so I don't like

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.360 
have very fair skin and so I don't like
to<00:06:17.940> wear<00:06:18.300> dark<00:06:18.870> bronzer<00:06:19.320> because<00:06:19.470> it<00:06:19.890> will

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
to wear dark bronzer because it will

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.910 
to wear dark bronzer because it will
look<00:06:20.400> really<00:06:20.580> cakey<00:06:21.300> and<00:06:21.450> so<00:06:22.260> I'm<00:06:22.530> just<00:06:22.740> gonna

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:22.920 
look really cakey and so I'm just gonna

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.940 
look really cakey and so I'm just gonna
swatch<00:06:23.790> this<00:06:24.120> onto<00:06:24.660> my<00:06:24.810> skin<00:06:24.870> and<00:06:25.260> I<00:06:25.680> am

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
swatch this onto my skin and I am

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.880 
swatch this onto my skin and I am
wearing<00:06:26.550> this<00:06:26.730> on<00:06:27.000> my<00:06:27.600> cheeks<00:06:27.960> right<00:06:28.350> now<00:06:28.560> if

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
wearing this on my cheeks right now if

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.190 
wearing this on my cheeks right now if
you<00:06:29.640> can<00:06:29.820> see<00:06:30.060> that<00:06:30.090> it's<00:06:30.480> just<00:06:30.660> really<00:06:30.870> pretty

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.200 
you can see that it's just really pretty

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.740 
you can see that it's just really pretty
and<00:06:31.440> I<00:06:31.530> think<00:06:31.740> it<00:06:31.860> it<00:06:32.400> gives<00:06:32.790> your<00:06:32.970> cheeks<00:06:33.510> a

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
and I think it it gives your cheeks a

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.060 
and I think it it gives your cheeks a
really<00:06:34.050> nice<00:06:34.260> glow<00:06:34.680> as<00:06:34.980> well<00:06:35.310> and<00:06:36.680> so<00:06:37.680> here's

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
really nice glow as well and so here's

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.160 
really nice glow as well and so here's
what<00:06:38.310> it<00:06:38.430> looks<00:06:38.670> like<00:06:38.880> you<00:06:39.690> can't<00:06:39.960> really

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.170 
what it looks like you can't really

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.390
