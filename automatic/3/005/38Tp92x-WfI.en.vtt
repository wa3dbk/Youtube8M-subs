 % 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.020
 how do you talk about religious tolerance in this period when 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.670
 we witness the cairo to those that we call the war between Muslims and Copts 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.900
 why insult 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.220
 this is why I believe we must 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.999
 to speak and 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.109
 this is a problem I'm not today 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.429
 is a problem I believe of all societies 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.999
 since the ancient world 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.650
 and then find 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.400
 and understand com 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.870
 sistri and how many experiences how much suffering there is 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.240
 also been in the past because of this without 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.440
 it should 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.680
 should we hope we wish it just in view 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.080
 make us understand how it is 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.850
 the bike. initial really is 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.190
 of rights 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.830
 fundamental human beliefs must be guaranteed everywhere 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.390
 freedom of thought let's say the sense 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.900
 + plateau therefore also the high confident until we will see this war in 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.480
 act 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.950
 for this I am not 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.880
 a prophet to say it 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.800
 but I believe 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.930
 who makes conscience 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.920
 of the advantages 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.900
 of religious freedom therefore religious freedom not like you are my jung 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.670
 generic syncretism 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.400
 own professional. but deeper 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.500
 participation 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.460
 religious feeling I believe that blackjack keqy and get to understand it has the 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.580
 must 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.940
 d spread it to spread your status 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.090
 and the difficult cannot be said 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.180
 for us we are tolerant but we want to expect the same from everyone else 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.710
 tolerance this way I do not 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.639
 you don't go much further 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:09.919
 need 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.500
 bet on yourself without starting gears 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.679
 to actually be 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:16.789
 we are 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:21.529
 we all have tendencies to be intolerant if we look closely 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.079
 currently in Italy there is religious integration 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.379
 I don't know about religious integration 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.439
 but certainly in words 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:37.879
 click the principle of religious freedom of the crowd I would say the art 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.559
 anton the bend era 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:40.599
 pe 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.069
 it is accepted by all the practice is not this 

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:47.729
 what is the message that will launch these young ounces 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.709
 e-mail message 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.939
 for what concerns us in Italy 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.939
 billy Christianity in his 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:02.459
 here for example with del piero that we look at the period the passage of the 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.869
 persecution 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:06.079
 to the whole Christian 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.470
 avatar the minds 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.699
 let's say 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:12.699
 close 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.519
 let's face it the most important personalities 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.839
 they understood 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:21.509
 and they brought year 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:26.789
 they really pushed to affirm the principle already at that time 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.069
 at the beginning of this century 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.259
 religious freedom for all 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:35.169
 certainly not imaginable in terms of time 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.139
 which we do not rightly hope for today 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.839
 but it makes us understand how 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:48.079
 in the Christian tradition religious intolerance that a betrayal of the 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:49.159
 Christian message 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.290
 currently, according to you, our region is that they are 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.290
 still manages to attract young people 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.019
 and this must be asked of them too, I am not 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.019
 + so young certainly or I believe that 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.699
 there 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:07.699
 bureaucratization politicization 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.509
 and of the churches of the Christian community 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:13.829
 ziare.ro 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.319
 the aspect that perhaps most distances 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:19.039
 young people 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.059
 trieste road map 

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:22.469
 this is my impression
