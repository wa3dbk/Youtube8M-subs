00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.529
 bouquet to the holiday of lovers in the frame 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.340
 remember heart this frame was made 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.520
 from cardboard 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.830
 mohair threads that is, we took white and 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.609
 lilac color and generally mixed with 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.939
 you don't need white red faces we 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:35.210
 all the same and which threads do you have or 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.559
 what ideas do you have up to also we did 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.500
 such an interlacing of cancer 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.860
 so that it is convenient for us to sigh flowers on 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.980
 to keep it like a frame for you 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.980
 pretty complicated the most difficult 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.020
 we will use flowers 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.270
 following this we will have lilac roses 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.390

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.159
 three worlds will be green 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.790

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.160
 far wall 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.200
 we have not decided how much we need 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.730
 so far we have this set of colors 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.040
 we will continue to compose on the go 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.470
 but a set of colors there will definitely need 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.660
 small, that is, the main role will be played 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.850
 frame we will use this 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.630

 we begin to collect from the flowers at the very 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.030
 cause which is thicker because 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.960
