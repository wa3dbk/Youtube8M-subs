 if it is a smartphone on the market today capable 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.540
 to hit the front with the iphone 5 of

 apple and samsung galaxy s 3 esse

 device is the nokia lumia 920 main 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.430
 the Finnish company using the 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.070
 in full shape to the features of windows 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.529
 phone 8 is also an attempt by the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.109
 microsoft to sign up in the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.090
 mobile operating systems a task 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.730
 very difficult thanks to its competitors 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.620
 of weight 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.780
 looking for competitiveness in nokia 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.090
 positioned the product side by side with the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.340
 its main competitors by aligning 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.020
 including the same price range for the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.649
 smartphone launch 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.570
 the detailed analysis of the nokia lumia 920 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.550
 the main smartphone with windows phone 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.149
 available in the market is what you 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.149
 check now 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.629
 quick and accurate response to ringtones 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.510
 screen and the integration between hardware 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.080
 of the nokia lumia 921 windows phone 8 da 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.759
 microsoft is just perfect 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.320
 fingers on the display of the device is 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.560
 a pleasant and quite experience 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.750
 gentle sensitivity appears to have been 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.820
 configured in the right way what 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.750
 results in an excellent usability of the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.869
 model 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.060
 the dual core processor from 1.5 ghz to 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.130
 more than enough to ensure the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.899
 stability of the activity that in no 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.869
 moment presented choking or 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.940
 however, we should point out that 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.830
 the limited number of apps that require 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.720
 much of the processing capacity of the 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.850
 the control device makes it 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.929
 stability management 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.130
 the sensation you have when you see the number 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.679
 920 is that you are facing a 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.920
 rugged and rugged 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.899
 impeccable finish 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.179
 in fact if the galaxy s 3 can be 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.909
 considered fragile by its rear 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.739
 and the iphone 5 is susceptible to 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.099
 risks due to its structure 

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:02.970
 the lumia 920 runs away from these two 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.369
 problems 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.140
 presenting a hard product in the fall and 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.379
 which honors the nokia tradition in 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.660
 resistant building apparatus in 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.599
 right side of the appliance to three 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.060
 physical power volume buttons and a 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.879
 dedicated exclusively to 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.280
 activate the camera you can use it 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.440
 even if the device is locked or 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.629
 either it is not necessary to go through the screen 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.580
 starting to get the option of 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.660
 camera which decreases one step of the 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.379
 process 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.209
 among all the elements of nokia lumia 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.860
 920 one of the most highlighted 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.920
 by the Finnish company 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.349
 it was your camera without a shadow of a doubt 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.480
 we can be categorical in claiming that the 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.739
 rear camera present in nokia lumia 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.120
 is good for conventional users 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.610
 certainly it will meet all the 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.440
 needs for both 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.220
 urns and for capturing images 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.709
 in natural conditions of 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.650
 photos taken with the 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.630
 1920 automatic white balance 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.720
 attenuates in a way a contrast 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.970
 making 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.130
 you less realistic for example than 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.410
 taken with iphone 5 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.810
 it is worth mentioning that since it is a 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.940
 automatic feature it is natural that 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.600
 depending on the element focused on some 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.300
 Photos 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.700
 this stands out - resulting in more 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.920
 contrast and sharpness 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.350
 already captured in 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.960
 completely obscure this correction if 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.610
 shows an excellent differential 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.520
 ensuring greater color fidelity to the 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.560
 object depicted the system 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.830
 stabilization in nokia videos lumia 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.630
 920 does not leave perfect blur images 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.780
 but causes the movements to be 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.910
 much softer when making a move 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.220
 camera with others 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.200
 For example, it is natural for 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.880
 images are blurry and misshapen 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.890
 during the action 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.320
 this is not an exclusive feature 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.330
 nokia lumia 920 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.430
 we can not fail to mention the 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.860
 exclusive applications that 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.950
 accompany this version of the device 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.709
 are they nokia want nokia nokia lens 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.780
 maps and nokia music all of them 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.000
 add useful features for the 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.700
 making the user experience 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.010
 more pleasant operating system 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.620
 the battery is another issue where nokia 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.240
 lumia 920 works very well 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.550
 following the example of its main 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.440
 competitors it is possible to withstand 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.810
 tranquility an entire day without 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.150
 charge the device if its use is 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.160
 moderate as in internet access via 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.220
 3g at some times of the day 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.290
 an innovation brought by Nokia in its 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.120
 line of devices is the possibility of 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.190
 wireless charging or 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.110
 avoiding the use of wires 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.630
 this aerial loading base is 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.750
 sold separately and because of this 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.030
 we can not test the effectiveness however 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.950
 only compatibility with this type 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.950
 of technology is already a great differential 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:06.089
 although the design of the product is a point 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:09.270
 positive we can not fail to point out 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:11.099
 a very uncomfortable aspect in particular 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.969
 who keeps the device in the pocket of the 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.389
 trousers 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:17.939
 the lumia 920 has corner the squares o 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.949
 which results in slightly pointed chinas 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:22.499
 this causes the product to become 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:25.860
 discomfort to the 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:28.620
 sit down while handling the cell phone 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.050
 the lower corners can also act 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.449
 against the user revealing himself not so 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.649
 anatomical and making the footprint of the 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:38.999
 product may not be the best you can 

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:40.499
 unfortunately windows phone 8 is still 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:42.960
 paid the price of being a system 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:45.210
 relatively new operational 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.339
 compared to its competitors and 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.580
 account has a library of 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:52.949
 considerably smaller apps for our 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.020
 tests we separated the first five 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.909
 placed between paid and 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.740
 free of charge from each of the 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:01.889
 android apps 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.169
 then the Hindus phone 81 as some are 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.749
 coincident among the most downloaded 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:09.870
 final list got 27 applications 

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:12.749
 of these 27 the store for android had 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.959
 of 22 while the Western store found 

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:18.689
 21 of them already in the case of windows phone 8 

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:20.610
 only 12 were found which 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:21.599
 corresponds to less than half of 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.180
 Software 

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:26.490
 it is not only in external appearance that the 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.020
 nokia lumia 920 proves to be a 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.419
 robust device 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:34.469
 among the top phones in the market it is 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:36.180
 also the heavier its 185 grams 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:39.149
 are many if we analyze model 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:42.240
 isolated but compared to the iphone 

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:45.360
 5 pieces of 112 grams we see that the 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.749
 product is at least 35% 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.749
 more 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:56.080
 the nokia lumia 921 handset with much 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.599
 more qualities than defects 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.819
 but its high price at least in this 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:03.249
 allied to an operating system 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:05.019
 which is still lacking in content can 

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:06.549
 make your first steps 

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:08.709
 are frustrated 

00:07:06.549 --> 00:07:11.169
 the market launch price 

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:13.629
 Brazilian currency is 2 thousand reais 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:15.879
 if on the one hand this puts you in the 

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:17.829
 the other, this gives the 

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:20.949
 consumers the right to argue for a 

00:07:17.829 --> 00:07:22.809
 more consistent apparatus at that point 

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:24.819
 missing windows phone apps 8 by 

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:25.749
 example it still weighs heavily at the 

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.579
 purchase 

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:30.339
 for hardware though 

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:31.989
 there are practically no exceptions in all 

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:33.849
 The appliance has a 

00:07:31.989 --> 00:07:35.559
 satisfactory performance 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:37.449
 if you do not mind the lack of 

00:07:35.559 --> 00:07:39.399
 applications and even games with 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:41.979
 very high graphic level plus a 

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:43.779
 large volume of launches in this case 

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:45.099
 the nokia handset meets your 

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:48.189
 needs 

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:50.079
 the tendency is for this bottleneck to decrease 

00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:51.879
 over time and if you are 

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:53.949
 willing to bet your chips on the 

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:56.499
 product can rest easy with regard to 

00:07:53.949 --> 00:07:58.929
 hardware to fame hard in the fall 

00:07:56.499 --> 00:07:59.619
 still falling like a glove for the
