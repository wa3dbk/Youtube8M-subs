 berlin a city with over three 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.590
 millions of inhabitants and innumerable 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.590
 Attractions 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:20.279
 but what connects the tv tower to the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.470
 humboldt university the german dom 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.330
 The Berlin Zoo and the Potsdamer Platz 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.570
 with every third berlin household and 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.840
 many public buildings that 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.059
 Fernwärmenetz von Vattenfall more than 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.010
 one million Berlin residential units 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.760
 be using environmentally friendly district heating 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.540
 heated and come every year about 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.540
 20,000 more added 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.350
 eleven Berlin power plants and over 30 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.000
 Combined heat and power plants produce electricity 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.560
 and heat in heat coupling kwk im 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.360
 the heart of the city lies one of the 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.390
 most modern plants in Europe 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.550
 the power plant in the middle in one 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.470
 CHP will be electricity and heat in 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.910
 generated a process and thus the 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.070
 optimally utilized fuel 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.050
 in the middle of the power plant will be added 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.600
 Gas turbines and steam turbines in one 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.119
 combined process used and thus 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.400
 again better used fuel 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.490
 flows from the heat and power plants, the 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.340
 district heating in the form of up to 135 degrees 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.450
 hot water in a joint 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.310
 Fernwärmenetz the so-called connected 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.700
 the district heating in berlin ensures that 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.140
 rame flats and hot showers that 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.970
 remote lady systems where there is a 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.890
 closed water system in the 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.930
 Power plants will depend on the water 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.200
 the outside temperature preheated and to 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.490
 the buildings transported in the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.740
 transfer stations of the building becomes the 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.470
 Heat to the domestic water system or to 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.720
 The building heating delivered at the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.789
 Customer cooled water then becomes too 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.910
 returned to the power plants and 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.950
 heated up again around 200,000 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.810
 cubic meters of water flow in the circulation 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.460
 system from the power plants to 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.460
 customers and back again 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.859
 through the network is the supply 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.049
 especially safe should be one 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:18.030
 generation unit can fail 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.450
 other power plants improve their performance 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.450
 compensate 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.120
 the underground pipe network already has 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.579
 a total length of 1775 kilometers 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.500
 but because more and more Berliners for 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.420
 Environmentally friendly district heating decide 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.750
 vattenfall builds the management system in 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.750
 every year about 20 to 25 kilometers out 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.030
 in metz pumping stations like this one 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.040
 Your village square in Charlottenburg will be 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.870
 the pressure in the heat pipe increases 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.610
 so that the district heating also in further 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.940
 distant areas are transported 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.940
 can 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.060
 are coordinated and monitored the 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.220
 Berlin power plants and the 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.680
 district heating network in the ultra-modern heat 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.750
 control room in the prenzlauer Berg and the 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.370
 Around the clock 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.260
 the core of the waiting is the 18 meters 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.990
 long and 1 meter 50 high 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.910
 Projection wall on it is the whole 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.890
 district heating and cooling network berlin 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.780
 shown from here is a 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.720
 seconds of remote control of the 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.780
 network thus the supply smoothly 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.410
 works are about 1800 employees 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.030
 for the vattenfall heat in use 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.400
 this benefits district heating and 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.190
 Remote cooling customers like the scandic hotel 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.180
 at the potsdamer place 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.560
 district heating and cooling it for the night 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.730
 scandic berlin potsdamer place the 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.470
 optimal solution 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.960
 for example, it is not necessary 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.660
 expensive technology to invest in the house 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.700
 It is very low maintenance and hotel guests 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.980
 very consciously choose ours 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.600
 hotel and come to us due to the 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.000
 sustainability of the concept which 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.710
 provide values ​​within the framework of 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.470
 climate protection agreement with the country 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.630
 berlin promised vattenfall in 2009 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.360
 his co2 output in the city through 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.090
 many ambitious measures by 2020 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.490
 to reduce more than half 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.140
 Vattenfall invests for this purpose 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.360
 almost two billion euros 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.459
 we see that with our customers 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.570
 many of us are demanding many innovative ones 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.830
 demand ideas 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.780
 that's a big one, of course 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.910
 challenge for our district heating team 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.040
 but we face this challenge 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.940
 We like and there we have good 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.190
 ideas in the quiver around in the future 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.720
 market so successful and maybe still 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.580
 a tick to be more successful than 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.249
 so far 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.249
 Vattenfall and the city of Berlin a 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:40.249
 ambitious
