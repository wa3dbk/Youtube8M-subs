00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
big difference that feeling of

really enjoyed the combat it's kind of

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.610 
really enjoyed the combat it's kind of
dodgy<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.180> kind<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.570> side<00:00:48.809> side<00:00:49.200> step<00:00:49.410> around

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
dodgy you kind of side side step around

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.889 
dodgy you kind of side side step around
things<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.100> feels<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.640> lot<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.390> probably

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899

them see I reverted to type and I was

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.820 
them see I reverted to type and I was
playing<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> sorcerer<00:01:13.409> because<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.619> nearly

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
playing a sorcerer because I nearly

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.020 
playing a sorcerer because I nearly
always<00:01:13.950> play<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> mage<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.670> kind<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.909> game

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
always play a mage in this kind of game

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.969

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.649 
and I had a really good time with it and
maybe<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.640> because<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.970> say<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> little<00:01:18.420> bit

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
maybe it is because you say a little bit

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.780 
maybe it is because you say a little bit
flappy<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.830> Malay<00:01:20.130> but<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.520> the

actually<00:01:33.119> teaming<00:01:33.540> up<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.780> completing

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
actually teaming up and completing

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.770 
actually teaming up and completing
missions<00:01:35.340> together<00:01:35.759> yeah<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.540> definitely

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
missions together yeah it definitely

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.240 
missions together yeah it definitely
made<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> lot<00:01:37.290> more<00:01:37.439> sense<00:01:37.650> he<00:01:37.799> kind<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:37.979> clicked

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
made a lot more sense he kind of clicked

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.520 
made a lot more sense he kind of clicked
a<00:01:38.460> bit<00:01:38.820> better<00:01:38.939> than<00:01:39.180> 83<00:01:39.630> because<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.500> I

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
a bit better than 83 because you and I

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.100 
a bit better than 83 because you and I
were<00:01:40.740> playin<00:01:40.979> next<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.119> each<00:01:42.180> other<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.570> were

physics<00:02:02.610> unfortunately<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.270> can't

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
physics unfortunately you can't

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.999 
physics unfortunately you can't
manipulate<00:02:03.600> individual<00:02:04.380> objects<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:04.890> like

manipulate individual objects and like

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.580 
manipulate individual objects and like
float<00:02:05.250> them<00:02:05.460> around<00:02:05.700> which<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.750> tragedy<00:02:07.259> I

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
physics in an MMO that would be amazing

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.020

characters you know as in people your

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.050 
characters you know as in people your
group<00:02:18.959> with<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.700> ask<00:02:20.910> the

group with and you can I ask the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.250 
group with and you can I ask the
developer<00:02:21.450> who<00:02:21.540> said<00:02:21.690> that's<00:02:21.870> not<00:02:22.020> something

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
developer who said that's not something

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.020 
developer who said that's not something
we've<00:02:22.350> included<00:02:22.530> but<00:02:23.250> it's<00:02:23.550> something<00:02:23.880> we

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
we've included but it's something we

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.730 
we've included but it's something we
would<00:02:24.150> be<00:02:24.330> willing<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.959> consider<00:02:25.200> including

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
would be willing to consider including

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.770 
would be willing to consider including
if<00:02:25.920> there<00:02:26.100> was<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.280> lot<00:02:26.459> of<00:02:26.490> support<00:02:27.300> for<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.660> so

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
if there was a lot of support for it so

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
if there was a lot of support for it so
if<00:02:27.870> doing<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.230> something<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.500> want<00:02:28.620> you

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
if doing is something you want you

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.949 
if doing is something you want you
should<00:02:28.860> probably<00:02:29.190> tell<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.030> developers<00:02:30.540> and

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
should probably tell the developers and

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.809 
should probably tell the developers and
I<00:02:31.020> think<00:02:31.200> that's<00:02:31.319> a<00:02:31.410> pity<00:02:31.620> because<00:02:31.819> inevitably

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819

you know you're gonna try out your

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.690 
you know you're gonna try out your
character<00:02:37.770> against<00:02:37.980> their<00:02:38.130> character<00:02:38.580> and
