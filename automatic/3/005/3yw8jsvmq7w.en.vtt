grab a loop here we will insert our hook
we<00:03:17.190> pour<00:03:17.549> our<00:03:17.970> thread<00:03:18.540> we<00:03:19.260> grab<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.950> loop<00:03:20.190> we

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
we pour our thread we grab the loop we

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.819 
we pour our thread we grab the loop we
turn<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.180> our<00:03:21.239> project<00:03:21.870> we<00:03:22.680> crochet<00:03:23.160> 3<00:03:23.640> chains

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
turn to our project we crochet 3 chains

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:33.890 
turn to our project we crochet 3 chains
one<00:03:25.829> two<00:03:26.690> three<00:03:29.930> grab<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.109> loop<00:03:31.669> at<00:03:32.900> this

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
one two three grab the loop at this

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.960 
one two three grab the loop at this
point<00:03:34.290> we're<00:03:34.739> not<00:03:34.950> going<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.370> insert<00:03:35.700> our<00:03:35.760> hook

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
point we're not going to insert our hook

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.470 
point we're not going to insert our hook
on<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.569> first<00:03:36.870> hole<00:03:37.590> because<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.489> stitch<00:03:39.000> is

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
on the first hole because this stitch is

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.930 
on the first hole because this stitch is
equivalent<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.590> three<00:03:40.859> chains<00:03:41.280> we<00:03:41.669> wove

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
equivalent to the three chains we wove

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.740 
equivalent to the three chains we wove
first<00:03:42.480> to<00:03:43.260> start<00:03:43.590> our<00:03:43.829> first<00:03:44.099> row<00:03:44.819> the

following hole is the first one that we

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.539 
following hole is the first one that we
will<00:03:49.440> use<00:03:49.730> we<00:03:50.730> insert<00:03:51.180> our<00:03:51.209> hook

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
will use we insert our hook

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:56.320 
will use we insert our hook
we<00:03:53.549> grab<00:03:53.849> a<00:03:53.880> loop

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.590 

again<00:03:56.950> one<00:03:57.950> two<00:03:58.600> and<00:03:59.600> two<00:04:00.940> again<00:04:01.940> grab<00:04:02.270> a<00:04:02.300> loop

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
again one two and two again grab a loop

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.110 
again one two and two again grab a loop
which<00:04:03.410> is<00:04:03.680> that<00:04:04.250> we<00:04:04.400> are<00:04:04.460> within<00:04:04.700> is<00:04:05.060> the

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
which is that we are within is the

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.270 
which is that we are within is the
stitch<00:04:05.600> that<00:04:05.630> is<00:04:05.990> going<00:04:06.320> to<00:04:06.470> be<00:04:06.590> smooth<00:04:06.980> with

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
stitch that is going to be smooth with

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.700 
stitch that is going to be smooth with
no<00:04:07.520> increases<00:04:08.120> this<00:04:08.930> is<00:04:09.200> what<00:04:09.440> we<00:04:09.620> are

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
no increases this is what we are

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.530 
no increases this is what we are
learning<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.250> do<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.760> make<00:04:10.940> a<00:04:10.970> double<00:04:11.420> crochet

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
learning to do to make a double crochet

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.390 
learning to do to make a double crochet
and<00:04:11.960> remember<00:04:12.860> that<00:04:13.070> when<00:04:13.220> you<00:04:13.370> are

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
and remember that when you are

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.250 
and remember that when you are
crocheting<00:04:13.940> it<00:04:14.330> is<00:04:14.450> important<00:04:14.990> that<00:04:15.020> your

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
crocheting it is important that your

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.830 
crocheting it is important that your
stitches<00:04:15.590> are<00:04:15.920> not<00:04:16.220> biting<00:04:16.519> or<00:04:16.850> thread<00:04:17.150> so<00:04:17.750> it

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
stitches are not biting or thread so it

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.509 
stitches are not biting or thread so it
is<00:04:17.959> important<00:04:18.470> to<00:04:18.500> know<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:18.950> thickness<00:04:19.190> of

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
is important to know the thickness of

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.250 
is important to know the thickness of
your<00:04:19.580> thread<00:04:19.970> and<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.360> thickness<00:04:20.600> of<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:21.019> hook

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
your thread and the thickness of a hook

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.110 
your thread and the thickness of a hook
with<00:04:21.920> which<00:04:22.220> we<00:04:22.700> will<00:04:22.940> crochet

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.530 

here's<00:04:43.940> a<00:04:44.060> small<00:04:44.240> hole

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
here's a small hole

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.350 
here's a small hole
where<00:04:45.870> we<00:04:46.050> will<00:04:46.200> insert<00:04:46.260> or<00:04:47.010> hook<00:04:47.310> well<00:04:48.060> or

finally stitch one two and two it seems

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.890 
finally stitch one two and two it seems
that<00:04:56.160> there<00:04:56.370> are<00:04:56.460> no<00:04:56.640> more<00:04:56.820> stitches<00:04:57.420> or<00:04:57.600> chain

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
so here we grab the loop now we need to

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.900 
so here we grab the loop now we need to
decide<00:05:30.180> we<00:05:30.390> are<00:05:30.480> going<00:05:30.750> to<00:05:30.930> insert<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.800> hook

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
decide we are going to insert the hook

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:39.890 
decide we are going to insert the hook
well<00:05:32.910> we<00:05:33.180> are<00:05:33.240> going<00:05:33.480> to<00:05:33.540> do<00:05:33.660> it<00:05:33.780> here

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.820 

we<00:05:40.440> grab<00:05:40.710> the<00:05:40.740> loop<00:05:41.480> here's<00:05:42.480> a<00:05:42.570> hole

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
we grab the loop here's a hole

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.950 
we grab the loop here's a hole
we<00:05:45.370> grab<00:05:45.610> again

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.250 

so<00:05:48.440> here<00:05:48.620> two<00:05:48.949> threads<00:05:49.310> with

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
so here two threads with

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.900 
so here two threads with
we<00:05:50.710> take<00:05:50.980> one<00:05:51.280> two<00:05:51.880> and<00:05:52.180> two<00:05:52.960> and<00:05:53.340> this<00:05:54.340> is<00:05:54.400> how

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
we take one two and two and this is how

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.720 
we take one two and two and this is how
this<00:05:55.420> is<00:05:55.660> our<00:05:55.810> last<00:05:56.050> stitch<00:05:56.530> if<00:05:56.890> you<00:05:57.130> look<00:05:57.370> here

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
this is our last stitch if you look here

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.690 
this is our last stitch if you look here
this<00:05:58.060> hole<00:05:58.390> is<00:05:58.780> on<00:05:58.900> top<00:05:59.320> of<00:05:59.350> the<00:05:59.650> stitch<00:06:00.010> on<00:06:00.280> the

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
this hole is on top of the stitch on the

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.700 
this hole is on top of the stitch on the
first<00:06:00.970> row<00:06:01.270> as<00:06:01.510> in<00:06:01.780> the<00:06:01.930> previous<00:06:02.140> row<00:06:02.500> I'm

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
first row as in the previous row I'm

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.920 
first row as in the previous row I'm
going<00:06:02.770> to<00:06:03.130> undo<00:06:03.460> this<00:06:03.700> stitch<00:06:04.180> for<00:06:04.450> you<00:06:04.570> to<00:06:04.750> see

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
going to undo this stitch for you to see

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.860 
going to undo this stitch for you to see
which<00:06:05.230> is<00:06:05.410> another<00:06:05.770> option<00:06:06.370> but<00:06:06.910> ideally<00:06:07.450> you

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
which is another option but ideally you

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.890 
which is another option but ideally you
should<00:06:07.900> not<00:06:08.320> do<00:06:08.650> this<00:06:08.680> last<00:06:09.190> stitch<00:06:09.670> here<00:06:09.900> here

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
should not do this last stitch here here

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.380 
should not do this last stitch here here
you<00:06:11.380> could<00:06:11.590> get<00:06:11.830> just<00:06:12.100> this<00:06:12.310> one<00:06:12.610> thread<00:06:12.970> this

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
you could get just this one thread this

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.690 
you could get just this one thread this
option<00:06:13.930> is<00:06:14.050> easier<00:06:14.530> but<00:06:14.800> I<00:06:14.830> do<00:06:14.950> not<00:06:15.190> think<00:06:15.250> is

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
option is easier but I do not think is

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.570 
option is easier but I do not think is
the<00:06:15.940> best<00:06:16.150> because<00:06:16.840> look<00:06:17.200> what<00:06:17.380> happens<00:06:17.580> maybe

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
the best because look what happens maybe

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.090 
the best because look what happens maybe
now<00:06:19.180> it's<00:06:19.420> not<00:06:19.570> very<00:06:19.810> obvious<00:06:20.020> since<00:06:20.710> we<00:06:20.920> just

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
now it's not very obvious since we just

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.820 
now it's not very obvious since we just
started<00:06:21.640> our<00:06:21.790> project<00:06:22.060> but<00:06:22.570> after<00:06:22.780> as<00:06:23.320> we

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
started our project but after as we

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.190 
started our project but after as we
advance<00:06:24.250> on<00:06:24.460> it<00:06:24.640> here<00:06:25.450> you<00:06:25.570> will<00:06:25.690> see<00:06:25.930> a<00:06:25.960> little

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
advance on it here you will see a little

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.470 
advance on it here you will see a little
pull<00:06:26.800> and<00:06:27.040> it<00:06:27.430> will<00:06:27.580> feel<00:06:27.820> that<00:06:28.090> is<00:06:28.240> less

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
pull and it will feel that is less

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.780 
pull and it will feel that is less
resistant<00:06:29.170> because<00:06:29.560> we<00:06:29.680> are<00:06:29.830> holding<00:06:30.100> only<00:06:30.670> a

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
resistant because we are holding only a

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.550 
resistant because we are holding only a
single<00:06:31.300> thread<00:06:31.620> so<00:06:32.620> it<00:06:33.280> is<00:06:33.400> the<00:06:33.520> first<00:06:33.820> round

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
single thread so it is the first round

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.590 
single thread so it is the first round
the<00:06:35.560> first<00:06:35.590> row<00:06:36.070> and<00:06:36.370> perhaps<00:06:36.670> is<00:06:37.270> not

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
the first row and perhaps is not

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.570 
the first row and perhaps is not
noticeable<00:06:38.380> but<00:06:39.060> ideally<00:06:40.230> then<00:06:41.230> well<00:06:41.890> the<00:06:42.400> way

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
noticeable but ideally then well the way

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.450 
noticeable but ideally then well the way
it<00:06:42.730> seems<00:06:43.030> to<00:06:43.300> me<00:06:43.480> better<00:06:43.780> I<00:06:44.140> want<00:06:44.890> to<00:06:45.130> show<00:06:45.400> you

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
it seems to me better I want to show you

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.370 
it seems to me better I want to show you
is<00:06:45.970> to<00:06:46.870> get<00:06:47.350> the<00:06:47.500> two<00:06:47.710> threads<00:06:48.070> the<00:06:48.580> two<00:06:49.380> we

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
is to get the two threads the two we

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.320 
is to get the two threads the two we
pull<00:06:50.710> one<00:06:51.490> two<00:06:52.450> and<00:06:52.750> two<00:06:53.290> and<00:06:54.250> then<00:06:54.820> the<00:06:55.300> third

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
pull one two and two and then the third

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.680 
pull one two and two and then the third
row<00:06:56.140> is<00:06:56.440> the<00:06:56.500> same<00:06:56.770> we<00:06:57.430> came<00:06:57.700> up<00:06:57.910> with<00:06:58.450> three

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
row is the same we came up with three

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.770 
row is the same we came up with three
chains<00:06:59.170> and<00:06:59.530> turn<00:06:59.950> our<00:07:00.100> project<00:07:00.640> back<00:07:00.850> let's

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780 
chains and turn our project back let's

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.810 
chains and turn our project back let's
keep<00:07:01.990> the<00:07:02.200> first<00:07:02.470> hole<00:07:02.740> because<00:07:03.490> the<00:07:03.610> three

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:03.820 
keep the first hole because the three

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.050 
keep the first hole because the three
chains<00:07:04.090> are<00:07:04.450> considering<00:07:04.990> it<00:07:05.140> here<00:07:05.790> go<00:07:06.790> to<00:07:06.850> the

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060 
chains are considering it here go to the

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.909 
chains are considering it here go to the
second<00:07:07.480> hole<00:07:07.720> we<00:07:07.930> get<00:07:08.170> one

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 
second hole we get one

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.950 
second hole we get one
two<00:07:10.919> and<00:07:11.280> two<00:07:11.610> and<00:07:11.850> so<00:07:12.419> on

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 
two and two and so on
