00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello dear friends with you pavel 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.529
 shakers and today we look at this 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.800
 a hero like leon this character is 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.290
 ranged magician as well as powerful and 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.210
 p and we are on the situation of a gunter and he is not weak 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.430
 can ignite our enemies 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.430
 especially batnichek it is now more detail 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.800
 about what his wives will ignite first with him 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.810
 there is a tank which is also nuka in 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.570
 At home there are several 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.820
 goals for nearly three seconds with proper 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.610
 using of course further we have 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.460
 hex that outputs from the game as much as the enemy 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.050
 for 4 seconds and pretty nearly 7 seconds 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.350
 control is just a fairy tale 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.840
 Our third skill will give you a lot 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.090
 hemorrhoids this is mana drain on the final 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.450
 heart level in 4 seconds we can 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.010
 suck up 480 baths and leave the enemy without 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.890
 his combat potential 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.840
 also man himself filled well and the most 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.149
 the main thing for us and the worst for 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.399
 our enemies is our ult fuse 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.969
 kukans 2000 who are at the final level 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.479
 inflicts 850 health to the enemy asu forcefully 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.840
 There are aganims already all 1025 damage plus 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.930
 if you are so pugna well understand 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.280
 about the plague all this is our plus now the cons 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.409
 Leona is not enough mana 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.570
 in the sense that our ult is on final 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.909
 level are 650 mana 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.740
 what do you think it is made for 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.140
 so imagine the situation 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.810
 you throw on the enemy camps to control 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.470
 evoy damazhit out of hand after which another hex 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.770
 on 4 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.170
 This you have minus 370 mangle to 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.810
 fill u behind this andrey assign them 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.939
 Well, well, after you suck everything in 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.860
 there is nothing left except 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.440
 run in horror here you overtake him 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.180
 its gaulle there 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.130
 our minus is that we are not enough 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.670
 mobile do not have impressive 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.520
 by stock 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.980
 cops have a very precise and silencer 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.140
 so Leon must be careful 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.570
 and collect items like portnov 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.430
 Aganim and Facebook will be all 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.500
 there will compensate for the lack of good 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.720
 max and up to mars will allow us at 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.490
 situation get away from imminent death or 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.100
 catch up with the enemy to charge it 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.410
 something of our arsenal and also will 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.260
 we will replenish there a second and give 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.060
 plus 10 intelligence and this is a plus to manners 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.430
 which again I repeat is not so 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.250
 a lot and the way to damage knocks well and our 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.770
 the main goal in the game is amanim not 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.600
 feel free to usa for pharma start because we 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.840
 we can always pour out the bath and creak 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.550

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.050
 our prayer may comment 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.950

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.890

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.350

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.320

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.270

 Enemies are those who came to Mona for solid 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.280
 or those who have great damage and magician 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.230
 protection from magic for example it is antimag well 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.239
 and finally phantom lancer due to the fact that 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.730
 your point and you can not determine 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.920

 determine it will burn you mana diffusions 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.780
 he will also be killed on shant and there it is bkb and 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.300
 for us it is like death for example 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.480
 the bar gathered him overclocked on a chair 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.360
 He is definitely a corpse now decide on 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.190

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.590
 lived and provided you told the future 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.870
 download you need to start on 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.360

 availability that is right away with 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.319
 getting 6 11 and 16 levels forget 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.450
 about all sorts of nicknames or lasso not for you 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.910
 try to ward you whenever possible 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.460

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.530
 zagat and save your behavior in 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.600
 batch should be following you as 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.210
 any designer must withdraw from the game 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.400
 powerful enemy and infuse it your ultu 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.530
 there your casemates will finish 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.900
 feel free to style if you are 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.120
 watch the enemy go to low hp and 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.400
 suddenly he has some escape 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.530
 or your teammates will buy something ul. 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.600

 level when it is 40 seconds 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.669
 drained a total of 20 in total I think 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.950
 enough to clarify the essence of the gameplay for 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.630
