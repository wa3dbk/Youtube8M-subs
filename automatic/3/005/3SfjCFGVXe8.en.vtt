00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
so today we're going to talk about

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.450 
so today we're going to talk about
connective<00:00:02.010> tissues<00:00:03.529> what<00:00:04.529> about<00:00:04.830> them<00:00:05.040> well

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
connective tissues what about them well

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.160 
connective tissues what about them well
they<00:00:05.759> connect<00:00:06.150> your<00:00:06.270> body<00:00:06.450> parts<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:06.960> you<00:00:07.020> can

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
they connect your body parts and you can

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.500 
they connect your body parts and you can
tell<00:00:07.379> that<00:00:07.560> from<00:00:07.859> just<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.429> name<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:08.610> them<00:00:08.790> you

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
tell that from just the name of them you

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.259 
tell that from just the name of them you
find<00:00:09.840> them<00:00:10.080> everywhere<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:11.040> every<00:00:11.519> organ<00:00:12.059> in

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
find them everywhere in every organ in

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.480 
find them everywhere in every organ in
every<00:00:12.599> organ<00:00:12.900> system<00:00:12.929> all<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.219> different

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
every organ system all the different

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.099 
every organ system all the different
parts<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.790> your<00:00:14.910> body<00:00:15.089> they're<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.960> most

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
parts of your body they're the most

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.870 
parts of your body they're the most
common<00:00:16.440> type<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.710> tissue<00:00:17.100> found<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.609> your<00:00:17.699> body

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
common type of tissue found in your body

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.330 
common type of tissue found in your body
and<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.690> two<00:00:18.869> things<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.260> they<00:00:19.500> all<00:00:19.680> have<00:00:20.189> in

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
and the two things that they all have in

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.090 
and the two things that they all have in
common<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.270> they<00:00:21.600> have<00:00:21.630> cells<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.410> an

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
common is that they have cells and an

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.070 
common is that they have cells and an
extracellular<00:00:23.789> matrix<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.630> you'll<00:00:24.840> remember

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
extracellular matrix and you'll remember

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.589 
extracellular matrix and you'll remember
from<00:00:25.439> daily<00:00:26.310> Latin<00:00:26.580> connection<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.180> extra

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
from daily Latin connection that extra

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.900 
from daily Latin connection that extra
means<00:00:27.810> outside<00:00:28.080> or<00:00:28.710> outward<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.490> matrix

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
means outside or outward so this matrix

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.810 
means outside or outward so this matrix
is<00:00:30.119> found<00:00:30.359> outside<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.929> cells<00:00:31.460> well<00:00:32.460> what<00:00:32.759> do

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
is found outside the cells well what do

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.389 
is found outside the cells well what do
they<00:00:32.940> do<00:00:33.890> because<00:00:34.890> there<00:00:35.100> are<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.340> many

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
they do because there are so many

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.880 
they do because there are so many

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
sort of the non cellular stuff it's got

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.309 
sort of the non cellular stuff it's got
a<00:02:12.330> lot<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.629> water<00:02:12.989> in

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
a lot of water in

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.280 
a lot of water in
it<00:02:13.579> it<00:02:14.579> helps<00:02:14.969> with<00:02:15.120> diffusion<00:02:15.569> of<00:02:15.810> material

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
it it helps with diffusion of material

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.619 
it it helps with diffusion of material
it<00:02:16.439> also<00:02:16.590> acts<00:02:17.040> as<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.370> reservoir<00:02:17.819> for<00:02:18.599> water

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
it also acts as a reservoir for water

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.330 
it also acts as a reservoir for water
we'll<00:02:19.139> talk<00:02:19.319> about<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:19.769> little<00:02:19.920> bit<00:02:20.129> more

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
we'll talk about that a little bit more

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.250 
we'll talk about that a little bit more
there's<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.510> there<00:02:21.840> are<00:02:21.930> these<00:02:22.019> things

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
there's the there are these things

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.640 
there's the there are these things
called<00:02:22.409> adhesion<00:02:23.010> proteins<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.200> it's<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
called adhesion proteins and it's the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.800 
called adhesion proteins and it's the
glue<00:02:26.099> with<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.519> sticky<00:02:26.909> stuff<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.510> help

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
glue with the sticky stuff that help

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.259 
glue with the sticky stuff that help
keep<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.469> cells<00:02:28.769> attached<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.639> the<00:02:29.819> fibers

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
keep the cells attached to the fibers

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.099 
keep the cells attached to the fibers
and<00:02:31.340> there<00:02:32.340> are<00:02:32.430> also<00:02:32.840> polysaccharides<00:02:33.840> and

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
and there are also polysaccharides and

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.280 
and there are also polysaccharides and
the<00:02:34.500> function<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.099> those<00:02:35.250> are<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.639> trap<00:02:35.909> water

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
the function of those are to trap water

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.890 
the function of those are to trap water
now<00:02:37.340> when<00:02:38.340> we<00:02:38.489> get<00:02:38.670> into<00:02:38.909> talking<00:02:39.599> about<00:02:39.780> the

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
now when we get into talking about the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.330 
now when we get into talking about the
different<00:02:40.169> kinds<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.680> connective<00:02:41.310> tissue

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
different kinds of connective tissue

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.899 
different kinds of connective tissue
tissue<00:02:42.239> you'll<00:02:42.569> see<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.909> texture

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
tissue you'll see that the texture

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.229 
tissue you'll see that the texture
varies<00:02:45.419> tremendously<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.639> so<00:02:47.639> the

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
varies tremendously and so the

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.709 
varies tremendously and so the
polysaccharides<00:02:49.169> are<00:02:49.409> what<00:02:49.709> help<00:02:50.719> determine

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:51.719 
polysaccharides are what help determine

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.539 
polysaccharides are what help determine
the<00:02:51.870> texture<00:02:52.379> if<00:02:52.530> there<00:02:53.040> are<00:02:53.159> a<00:02:53.219> few

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
the texture if there are a few

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.679 
the texture if there are a few
polysaccharides<00:02:54.419> then<00:02:54.930> it's<00:02:55.109> going<00:02:55.319> to<00:02:55.409> be

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
polysaccharides then it's going to be

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.509 
polysaccharides then it's going to be
really<00:02:57.689> thin<00:02:58.079> not<00:02:58.319> have<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.530> great<00:02:58.769> density<00:02:59.280> if

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
really thin not have a great density if

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.189 
really thin not have a great density if
there's<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.849> huge<00:03:00.239> number<00:03:00.449> of<00:03:00.629> polysaccharides

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:01.199 
there's a huge number of polysaccharides

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.050 
there's a huge number of polysaccharides
then<00:03:01.650> you're<00:03:01.769> going<00:03:01.859> to<00:03:01.919> have<00:03:02.099> a<00:03:02.340> very<00:03:02.819> dense

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
then you're going to have a very dense

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.470 
then you're going to have a very dense
material<00:03:04.069> then<00:03:05.069> you<00:03:05.219> also<00:03:05.400> find<00:03:05.730> within<00:03:06.030> this

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
material then you also find within this

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.920 
material then you also find within this
matrix<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.530> fibers<00:03:08.069> some<00:03:08.930> connective

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
matrix the fibers some connective

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.319 
matrix the fibers some connective
tissues<00:03:10.230> have<00:03:10.439> lots<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.980> fibers<00:03:11.400> some<00:03:12.120> have

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
tissues have lots of fibers some have

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.689 
tissues have lots of fibers some have
some<00:03:12.629> and<00:03:12.870> some<00:03:13.049> don't<00:03:13.290> have<00:03:13.349> any<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.069> let's

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:14.699 
some and some don't have any so let's

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:16.069 
some and some don't have any so let's
talk<00:03:14.849> about<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.209> three<00:03:15.449> most<00:03:15.599> common<00:03:16.049> types

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
talk about the three most common types

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.559 
talk about the three most common types
that<00:03:16.500> you'd<00:03:16.650> find<00:03:17.150> collagen<00:03:18.150> which<00:03:18.389> are

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
that you'd find collagen which are

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.259 
that you'd find collagen which are
called<00:03:18.840> white<00:03:19.259> fibers<00:03:19.949> they<00:03:20.549> give<00:03:20.729> it<00:03:20.879> a<00:03:20.909> high

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
called white fibers they give it a high

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.009 
called white fibers they give it a high
tensile<00:03:21.780> strength<00:03:23.479> elastic<00:03:24.479> or<00:03:24.659> yellow

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
tensile strength elastic or yellow

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.679 
tensile strength elastic or yellow
fibers<00:03:25.500> help<00:03:26.040> whatever<00:03:26.729> it<00:03:26.909> is<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.269> it's

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:27.689 
fibers help whatever it is that it's

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:29.599 
fibers help whatever it is that it's
part<00:03:27.959> of<00:03:28.079> stretch<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.799> recoil<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.459> its

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
part of stretch and recoil to its

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.749 
part of stretch and recoil to its
original<00:03:30.030> shape<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:31.459> reticular<00:03:32.459> fibers

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:32.759 
original shape and reticular fibers

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:35.599 
original shape and reticular fibers
actually<00:03:33.629> make<00:03:34.199> up<00:03:34.379> the<00:03:34.560> internal<00:03:34.979> structure

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
actually make up the internal structure

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.929 
actually make up the internal structure
of<00:03:35.639> a<00:03:35.849> soft<00:03:36.180> organ<00:03:36.780> such<00:03:37.109> as<00:03:37.319> your<00:03:37.949> spleen<00:03:38.549> and

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:38.939 
of a soft organ such as your spleen and

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:41.569 
of a soft organ such as your spleen and
your<00:03:39.120> kidney<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:39.780> your<00:03:40.079> lymph<00:03:40.500> nodes<00:03:40.799> they're

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
your kidney and your lymph nodes they're

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.710 
your kidney and your lymph nodes they're
very<00:03:42.060> um<00:03:43.250> then<00:03:44.250> their<00:03:44.759> structure<00:03:45.269> is<00:03:45.419> not

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
very um then their structure is not

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.020 
very um then their structure is not
quite<00:03:46.079> as<00:03:46.199> organized<00:03:46.739> as<00:03:47.009> you<00:03:47.519> would<00:03:47.639> find<00:03:47.879> in

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
quite as organized as you would find in

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.270 
quite as organized as you would find in
a<00:03:48.060> heart<00:03:48.329> or<00:03:48.479> a<00:03:48.540> lung<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.470> these<00:03:49.650> reticulate

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
a heart or a lung so these reticulate

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.379 
a heart or a lung so these reticulate
tissues<00:03:50.699> help<00:03:51.109> maintain<00:03:52.109> their<00:03:52.379> structure

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
tissues help maintain their structure

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.589 
tissues help maintain their structure
all<00:03:54.389> right<00:03:54.989> so<00:03:55.250> classifications<00:03:56.389> there<00:03:57.389> are

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
all right so classifications there are

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.439 
all right so classifications there are
actually<00:03:58.049> four<00:03:58.319> classifications<00:03:59.219> and<00:03:59.519> we'll

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:00.449 
actually four classifications and we'll

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.749 
actually four classifications and we'll
go<00:04:00.599> over<00:04:00.780> each<00:04:00.989> individually<00:04:01.799> so<00:04:02.280> this<00:04:02.459> dense

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:02.759 
go over each individually so this dense

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.839 
go over each individually so this dense
connective<00:04:03.030> tissue<00:04:03.540> which<00:04:03.810> you<00:04:03.959> find<00:04:04.259> in

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
connective tissue which you find in

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.879 
connective tissue which you find in
tendons<00:04:05.849> and<00:04:06.060> ligaments<00:04:06.479> and<00:04:06.750> Apryl<00:04:07.319> neurosis

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
tendons and ligaments and Apryl neurosis

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.709 
tendons and ligaments and Apryl neurosis
is<00:04:08.069> a--<00:04:08.599> is<00:04:09.599> basically<00:04:10.199> a<00:04:10.650> tendon<00:04:11.579> but<00:04:12.389> it's<00:04:12.569> a

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:12.719 
is a-- is basically a tendon but it's a

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.689 
is a-- is basically a tendon but it's a
sheet<00:04:13.049> of<00:04:13.229> tendon<00:04:13.709> as<00:04:13.829> opposed<00:04:14.129> to<00:04:14.219> a<00:04:14.310> rope

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
sheet of tendon as opposed to a rope

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.339 
sheet of tendon as opposed to a rope
like<00:04:15.000> tendon<00:04:15.419> and<00:04:15.780> we'll<00:04:15.930> talk<00:04:16.139> more<00:04:16.289> about

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
like tendon and we'll talk more about

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.909 
like tendon and we'll talk more about
those<00:04:16.590> later

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
those later

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.099 
those later
then<00:04:17.489> there's<00:04:17.699> irregular<00:04:18.419> dense<00:04:18.840> connective

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
then there's irregular dense connective

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.259 
then there's irregular dense connective
tissue<00:04:19.620> which<00:04:20.070> you've<00:04:20.219> actually<00:04:20.459> seen<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:20.969> lot

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
tissue which you've actually seen a lot

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.060 
tissue which you've actually seen a lot
of<00:04:21.299> in<00:04:21.659> looking<00:04:21.930> at<00:04:22.019> your<00:04:22.139> epithelial<00:04:22.349> slides

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
of in looking at your epithelial slides

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.500 
of in looking at your epithelial slides
because<00:04:23.279> it's<00:04:23.490> that<00:04:23.699> kind<00:04:24.000> of<00:04:24.060> connective

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
because it's that kind of connective

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.379 
because it's that kind of connective
tissue<00:04:24.539> that's<00:04:25.349> right

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
tissue that's right

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.110 
tissue that's right
to<00:04:26.689> the<00:04:27.110> epithelium<00:04:27.759> there's<00:04:28.759> loose

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
to the epithelium there's loose

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.450 
to the epithelium there's loose
connective<00:04:29.840> tissues<00:04:30.319> and<00:04:30.530> now<00:04:30.710> that<00:04:31.219> we've

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
connective tissues and now that we've

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.129 
connective tissues and now that we've
talked<00:04:31.849> about<00:04:31.909> what<00:04:32.120> dense<00:04:32.360> is<00:04:32.569> the<00:04:32.930> loose

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
talked about what dense is the loose

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.029 
talked about what dense is the loose
kind<00:04:33.319> of<00:04:33.469> makes<00:04:33.620> sense

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
kind of makes sense

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.339 
kind of makes sense
we've<00:04:34.430> got<00:04:34.669> adipose<00:04:35.210> or<00:04:35.419> fat<00:04:35.479> which<00:04:35.930> is<00:04:35.960> loose

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:36.349 
we've got adipose or fat which is loose

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:40.269 
we've got adipose or fat which is loose
we<00:04:36.740> have<00:04:37.729> areolar<00:04:38.659> which<00:04:39.020> is<00:04:39.259> a<00:04:39.439> we'll<00:04:40.069> talk

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:40.279 
we have areolar which is a we'll talk

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:42.999 
we have areolar which is a we'll talk
more<00:04:40.430> about<00:04:40.490> this<00:04:40.759> it's<00:04:40.939> very<00:04:40.990> spidery<00:04:42.009> spider

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
more about this it's very spidery spider

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.119 
more about this it's very spidery spider
webby<00:04:43.340> not<00:04:43.610> spider<00:04:43.879> but<00:04:44.180> spider<00:04:44.210> webby<00:04:44.779> and

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:45.129 
webby not spider but spider webby and

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:47.709 
webby not spider but spider webby and
then<00:04:46.129> there's<00:04:46.370> the<00:04:46.520> reticular<00:04:47.090> which<00:04:47.300> is<00:04:47.479> just

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:47.719 
then there's the reticular which is just

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:49.779 
then there's the reticular which is just
these<00:04:47.930> fibers<00:04:48.349> giving<00:04:48.740> structure<00:04:49.189> to<00:04:49.370> soft

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
these fibers giving structure to soft

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:50.469 
these fibers giving structure to soft
organs

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
organs

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.809 
organs
there<00:04:51.050> are<00:04:51.139> also<00:04:51.229> fluid<00:04:51.889> connective<00:04:52.400> tissues

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:52.819 
there are also fluid connective tissues

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:56.290 
there are also fluid connective tissues
so<00:04:53.979> thing<00:04:54.979> when<00:04:55.340> we<00:04:55.490> talk<00:04:55.669> about<00:04:55.699> connective

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
so thing when we talk about connective

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.420 
so thing when we talk about connective
tissues<00:04:56.629> it's<00:04:56.810> not<00:04:57.020> necessarily<00:04:57.770> directly

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
tissues it's not necessarily directly

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.269 
tissues it's not necessarily directly
connecting<00:04:59.419> one<00:04:59.689> thing<00:05:00.050> to<00:05:00.259> another<00:05:00.409> but<00:05:01.159> in

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:01.279 
connecting one thing to another but in

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:03.459 
connecting one thing to another but in
terms<00:05:01.490> of<00:05:01.669> fluid<00:05:02.060> connective<00:05:02.360> tissues<00:05:02.960> the

00:05:03.459 --> 00:05:03.469 
terms of fluid connective tissues the

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.649 
terms of fluid connective tissues the

classification<00:05:17.330> is<00:05:17.449> supporting<00:05:17.990> connective

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
classification is supporting connective

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.260 
classification is supporting connective
tissues<00:05:18.889> and<00:05:19.159> the<00:05:19.460> only<00:05:19.610> one<00:05:19.819> we'll<00:05:20.000> put<00:05:20.029> in

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
tissues and the only one we'll put in

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.279 
tissues and the only one we'll put in
there<00:05:20.449> is<00:05:20.629> cartilage

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
there is cartilage

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.040 
there is cartilage
oh<00:05:21.349> no<00:05:21.710> wait<00:05:21.979> this<00:05:22.189> too<00:05:22.430> cartilage<00:05:23.419> and<00:05:23.629> bone

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
oh no wait this too cartilage and bone

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.320 
oh no wait this too cartilage and bone
tissue<00:05:24.379> osseous<00:05:25.069> is<00:05:25.279> the<00:05:25.580> name<00:05:25.729> for<00:05:26.029> bone

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
tissue osseous is the name for bone

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.129 
tissue osseous is the name for bone
tissue<00:05:27.159> okay<00:05:28.159> we<00:05:28.699> talked<00:05:28.969> about<00:05:29.139> epithelial

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
tissue okay we talked about epithelial

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.679 
tissue okay we talked about epithelial
tissues<00:05:30.500> last<00:05:30.830> week<00:05:31.099> and<00:05:31.370> we<00:05:31.460> said<00:05:31.729> that<00:05:32.029> all

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:32.689 
tissues last week and we said that all

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:35.050 
tissues last week and we said that all
of<00:05:32.750> them<00:05:33.289> are<00:05:33.409> a<00:05:33.620> vascular<00:05:34.129> none<00:05:34.580> of<00:05:34.759> them<00:05:34.849> have

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
of them are a vascular none of them have

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.119 
of them are a vascular none of them have
any<00:05:35.240> blood<00:05:35.509> supply<00:05:35.900> well<00:05:36.379> in<00:05:36.560> the<00:05:36.680> connective

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:37.129 
any blood supply well in the connective

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:40.540 
any blood supply well in the connective
tissues<00:05:37.550> it<00:05:38.389> varies<00:05:39.259> tremendously<00:05:39.469> there<00:05:40.400> are

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
tissues it varies tremendously there are

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.639 
tissues it varies tremendously there are
a<00:05:40.610> few<00:05:40.849> tissues<00:05:41.240> that<00:05:41.449> are<00:05:41.479> highly<00:05:42.110> vascular

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:42.649 
a few tissues that are highly vascular

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:45.269 
a few tissues that are highly vascular
such<00:05:43.159> as<00:05:43.339> bone<00:05:43.580> tissue<00:05:43.969> and<00:05:44.360> reticular<00:05:44.930> tissue

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:45.279 
such as bone tissue and reticular tissue

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:47.969 
such as bone tissue and reticular tissue
again<00:05:46.279> remember<00:05:46.789> osseous<00:05:47.419> is<00:05:47.569> for<00:05:47.779> bone

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
again remember osseous is for bone

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.550 
again remember osseous is for bone
reticular<00:05:48.979> is<00:05:49.250> the<00:05:49.639> structure<00:05:50.210> for<00:05:50.560> the

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
reticular is the structure for the

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.670 
reticular is the structure for the
spleen<00:05:51.919> and<00:05:52.189> things<00:05:52.580> like<00:05:52.729> that<00:05:52.939> a<00:05:53.719> poor<00:05:54.259> blood

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
spleen and things like that a poor blood

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.769 
spleen and things like that a poor blood
supply<00:05:54.889> you<00:05:55.159> will<00:05:55.490> find<00:05:55.759> in<00:05:56.029> tendons<00:05:56.599> and

00:05:56.769 --> 00:05:56.779 
supply you will find in tendons and

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:58.990 
supply you will find in tendons and
ligaments<00:05:57.110> that's<00:05:58.099> part<00:05:58.430> of<00:05:58.490> the<00:05:58.580> reason<00:05:58.879> why

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
ligaments that's part of the reason why

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.519 
ligaments that's part of the reason why
they<00:05:59.180> take<00:05:59.419> so<00:05:59.599> long<00:05:59.779> to<00:05:59.960> heal<00:06:00.169> is<00:06:00.289> because

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:00.529 
they take so long to heal is because

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:03.249 
they take so long to heal is because
they<00:06:00.649> don't<00:06:00.830> have<00:06:01.009> a<00:06:01.849> great<00:06:02.479> direct<00:06:02.960> blood

00:06:03.249 --> 00:06:03.259 
they don't have a great direct blood

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:06.339 
they don't have a great direct blood
supply<00:06:03.620> the<00:06:04.219> only<00:06:04.520> a<00:06:04.550> vascular<00:06:05.389> connective

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:06.349 
supply the only a vascular connective

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:09.730 
supply the only a vascular connective
tissue<00:06:06.589> is<00:06:06.919> cartilage<00:06:07.839> again<00:06:08.839> also<00:06:09.169> explains

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
tissue is cartilage again also explains

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.959 
tissue is cartilage again also explains
why<00:06:10.000> cartilage<00:06:11.000> is<00:06:11.240> so<00:06:11.659> difficult<00:06:11.870> to<00:06:12.349> heal<00:06:13.039> so

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:13.969 
why cartilage is so difficult to heal so

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:15.850 
why cartilage is so difficult to heal so
that's<00:06:14.389> the<00:06:14.599> end<00:06:14.750> of<00:06:14.899> our<00:06:15.139> connective<00:06:15.680> tissue

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
that's the end of our connective tissue

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.889 
that's the end of our connective tissue
notes<00:06:16.159> and<00:06:16.399> we'll<00:06:16.789> talk<00:06:17.149> about<00:06:17.300> this<00:06:17.569> in<00:06:17.750> class

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:17.899 
notes and we'll talk about this in class

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:21.849 
notes and we'll talk about this in class
tomorrow<00:06:18.849> Thanks
