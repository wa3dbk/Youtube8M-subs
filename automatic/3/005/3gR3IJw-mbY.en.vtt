00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.310
 me 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.940
 Hmm 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.640
 That Tokyo Station Marunouchi station building 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:37.620
 I was able to get back to about 100 years ago 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:42.629
 Even though is about more than work on it took a period of about five years I'm sorry little 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:47.650
 As construction of 8 fleets can only do for approximately three hours, it is more than five years in that sense 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:52.900
 Because opportunity is with the real you will also find such talk 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:56.050
 In it was 11,000 or I wait of the pile when this is that I was able to 100 years ago 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.190
 Because there was nothing like concrete pile 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:03.500
 You hit the last pile 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:08.090
 I heard that the following supports this 70,000 tons of structures 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:16.159
 Under such circumstances , I arrived in the Great Kanto Earthquake, but there was almost no damage 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:21.619
 Just dig a hole under this station building to make this structure even stronger now 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:27.409
 When you make the basement underground, you can see the original station building of this ground part 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:28.080
 The contents of the Moee gave me to do at that time our own in Well perhaps four times say that the seismic isolation structure 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.120
 think 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:38.130
 It is also possible to isolate all of this 335 meter long station building 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:43.670
 I haven't heard about it so much, so I made this so it's really safe 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.670
 I think that you have the image of love and no doubt 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.520
 Hmm 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.520

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.520
 Hmm 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.640
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.640
 I'm waiting 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.640
 Hmm 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.850
 Have 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.100
 me 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.090

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.190
 Oh 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.910
 Hmm

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.130
 Hmm 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.490

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.940
 Ah ah ah ah

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.610
 car 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.610
 Took it 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.020
 rar 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.210
