00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:18.660

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:24.109

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.080

 I wish I sold this black sun and 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.960

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.259

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.060

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.910

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.590

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.940
 giving hook 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.630

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:06.670

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.660
 I found another recipe here 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.670
 and we can craft it like this 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:24.330

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:28.890
