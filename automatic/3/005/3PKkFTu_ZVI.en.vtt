00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
that looks a little bit better than

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:06.620 
that looks a little bit better than
before<00:01:55.970> let's<00:01:56.970> try<00:01:57.180> for<00:01:57.360> round<00:01:57.540> three

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.949 

um<00:02:07.610> yeah<00:02:08.610> now<00:02:08.849> it's<00:02:09.000> pretty<00:02:09.209> much<00:02:09.270> stuck<00:02:09.690> so

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
um yeah now it's pretty much stuck so

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.449 
um yeah now it's pretty much stuck so
I'm<00:02:10.110> going<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.349> loosen<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.950> because<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.280> don't

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
I'm going to loosen this because I don't

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:22.759 
I'm going to loosen this because I don't
want<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.640> put<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> new<00:02:12.060> dent<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.569> there<00:02:21.769> well

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
but I bet this thing would work a lot

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.090 
but I bet this thing would work a lot
better<00:03:54.490> if<00:03:55.210> I<00:03:55.300> had<00:03:55.570> help<00:03:55.870> from<00:03:56.610> this<00:03:57.610> guy<00:03:59.100> this

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
better if I had help from this guy this

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.420 
better if I had help from this guy this
guy<00:04:00.490> right<00:04:01.330> here<00:04:01.360> his<00:04:02.020> plasma<00:04:02.470> diamond

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
guy right here his plasma diamond

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.820
