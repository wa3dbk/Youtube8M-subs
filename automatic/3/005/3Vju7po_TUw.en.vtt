American<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:30.950> there's<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.340> he<00:02:31.940> brings<00:02:32.269> up<00:02:32.420> the

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
American so there's the he brings up the

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.350 
American so there's the he brings up the
idea<00:02:33.170> about<00:02:33.409> the<00:02:33.650> gun<00:02:34.069> show<00:02:34.340> loophole<00:02:34.879> right

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
idea about the gun show loophole right

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.850 
idea about the gun show loophole right
so<00:02:35.569> they<00:02:35.720> have<00:02:35.840> background<00:02:36.079> checks<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:36.739> if

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
so they have background checks so if

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.920 
so they have background checks so if
you're<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.010> licensed<00:02:37.489> gun<00:02:37.670> dealer<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.269> you're

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
you're a licensed gun dealer and you're

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.390 
you're a licensed gun dealer and you're
selling<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.349> gun<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.680> somebody<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:40.129> have<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.280> do

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
selling a gun to somebody you have to do

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.800 
selling a gun to somebody you have to do
a<00:02:40.430> background<00:02:40.670> check<00:02:40.940> that's<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:41.450> law<00:02:41.569> but

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
a background check that's the law but

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.990 
a background check that's the law but
they<00:02:41.930> have<00:02:42.110> gun<00:02:42.470> shows<00:02:42.970> where<00:02:44.170> theoretically

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
they have gun shows where theoretically

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.729 
they have gun shows where theoretically
regular<00:02:47.000> citizens<00:02:47.569> sell<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.140> other<00:02:48.290> regular

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
regular citizens sell to other regular

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.440 
regular citizens sell to other regular
citizens<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.459> when<00:02:49.579> that<00:02:49.730> happens<00:02:50.209> you<00:02:50.329> don't

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
citizens and when that happens you don't

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.720 
citizens and when that happens you don't
need<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.870> have<00:02:51.049> a<00:02:51.079> background<00:02:51.379> check<00:02:51.709> so<00:02:52.489> gun

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
need to have a background check so gun

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.479 
need to have a background check so gun
shows<00:02:53.030> are<00:02:53.269> work<00:02:53.780> that's<00:02:54.379> a<00:02:54.470> big<00:02:54.680> loophole<00:02:54.980> in

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
shows are work that's a big loophole in

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.149 
shows are work that's a big loophole in
the<00:02:56.090> background<00:02:56.569> check<00:02:56.659> gun<00:02:57.049> law<00:02:57.230> because<00:02:57.590> 40%

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
the background check gun law because 40%

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.399 
the background check gun law because 40%
of<00:02:58.579> all<00:02:58.730> guns<00:02:59.000> according<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.599> the<00:02:59.720> ATF<00:03:00.140> are

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
no background check is happening there

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.319 
no background check is happening there
