00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.870
 lg 2012 TVs you can 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.660
 see the frame 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.210
 and the rest they will show you themselves 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.369
 Hi there, this is an online photo shop and 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.760
 we look at the sixth seventh and eighth 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.760
 lg tv series of 2012 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.640
 Let's start with the 6 series in this series a few 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.370
 models that are almost identical 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.629
 Of course they are different design plus 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.960
 some more chips 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.030
 the first model 620 has no built 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.180
 Wi fi adapter need to buy it 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.820
 separately starting with 640 models above 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.920
 the adapter is the second here is the remote 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.670
 which is called magic magic magic 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.769
 motion 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.449
 it is not in all models but only 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.089
 starts 660 and 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.129
 and above why does he need all these TVs 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.079
 support voice control and 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.899
 gestures that are carried out using 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.320
 this console how it works I will show 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.890
 later 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.350
 the third in all but 620 model types 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.170
 led backlight + what does it mean i 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.630
 I will tell further well and the last all models 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.470
 already completed with four pairs of 3d 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.330
 points but in model 760 besides that 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.340
 there are two additional pair of points 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.289
 for playing together which are called 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.820
 dual play 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.310
 starting with this model and above these 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.380
 Points are completed with all TVs lg 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.079
 how they work me too a bit later 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.229
 tell this model 669 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:41.470
 and 670 are exactly the same leg 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:45.040
 different test i will 670 model 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.100
 and start as usual with connectors Sai slot 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.079
 4 hdmi three branches desk with the option 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.030
 connecting splitter output for 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.710
 headphone 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.950
 composite component inputs fools 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.100
 card digital audio output rgb rca input 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.479
 audio input and lan port update frequency 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.869
 screen 400 hertz 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.420
 And the resolution of the image is full hd black 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.799
 the color is really black not like 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.840
 you know it happens in some TVs 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.600
 you look at black and he is gray 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.579
 This because here and highlight led 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.920
 plus this technology is local 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:20.290
 dimming which works so 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.720
 LEDs can turn off alternately 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.109
 this way more 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.359
 deep black color in general image 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:30.549
 Loved it all the more with such 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:33.040
 thin frame as the screen here seems 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.739
 even more and you are like in the cinema 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.560
 you are sitting by the way TV design 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.360
 especially so thin frame 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.190
 manufacturers clearly city 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.930
 but because they came up with such a design 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.090
 name cinema screen 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.960
 with this design is cool to watch 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.630
 movies in 3d 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.910
 the framework as if absolutely no now I 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.970
 show you how this remote works 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.890
 we clamp the central button and here at 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.730
 such a move we switch to 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.110
 the next channel but with this 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.960
 back to the list of recent actions 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.300
 on this gesture management is over 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.250
 a bunch of features to customize 3d 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.890
 These are standard features for everyone. 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.880
 modern 3d TV conversion 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.500
 2d to 3d 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.720
 adjust the depth of the volumetric image 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:23.459
 and special surround technologies 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:25.560
 sound 3 landing party link 3d image 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.810
 I liked the eyes on his forehead do not climb 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.660
 as often happens in my opinion wil 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.640
 je was best realized 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.500
 conversion from 2d to 3d smart heavy 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.980
 here in principle the same as everywhere 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.660
 all the same you see social networks 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.200
 video services and so on only here 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.750
 more 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.370
 games and applications browser is also there 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.100
 pretty smart so you can 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.410
 full internet usage plus 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.690
 unique service 3d world which 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.790
 let you watch the video in 3d right 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.250
 from the internet there are several categories 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.500
 video you will be what to choose only 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.150
 it is necessary to get a good internet I 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.400
 just do not know what the Internet should 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.350
 be for viewing we have 10 megabits on 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.040
 the world but what it writes when trying 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.040
 enable video 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:23.970
 if you have a smartphone with support 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.270
 android you can install yourself 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.129
 application l g-smart remout it will allow 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.139
 you control telekom from your phone like 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:33.360
 using the remote control to watch programs from the TV 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:36.090
 on the smartphone and vice versa play 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.990
 video photo and audio files from the phone to 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.810
 tv 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.419
 well, and then I ran into my problem 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.699
 smartphone does not see the TV on the network as 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.620
 I tried after hours trying 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.319
 network reboots reinstalled 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.060
 apps i threw this thing but 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:53.190
 software updated 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.069
 every day so i'm sure that with 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.120
 time everything will work correctly 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:05:00.870
 TV has a built-in digital 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.580
 tuner 9 2 is a new format broadcast on 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.099
 which in a couple of years will go all 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.069
 Channels if you do not have such a Chinara 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:10.349
 will have to buy it separately of course 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:12.419
 the same telly is mounted on the wall format 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:15.210
 Weight attachment size depends on 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:19.909
 the diagonals here are 400 by 400 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:23.219
 and here is the TV next 7 series lm 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:25.770
 761 in this series honestly 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:27.690
 here everything is the same as in the 6 series but 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.659
 here the update frequency is increased 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.639
 screen up to 800 hertz + kit added 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:34.889
 two pairs of dollars to play 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.979
 will allow to play together without sharing the screen 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.199
 two halves from model 670 this one as 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.330
 see different color plus he 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.729
 weight on two kilos on this 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.190
 the difference ends here 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.050
 representative of the 8 series by the way too 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.810
 only from its predecessor 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.089
 Differs a little in the first place design 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.589
 secondly here at this point is embedded 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:57.960
 microphone so that you can 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:59.960
 use voice features this 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.460
 Internet search and social networking 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.159
 for example, you can reply to a message 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:11.810
 voice let's see how he 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:11.810
 responds to the Russian language select the search 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.220
 voice search 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.220
 elji 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:30.580
 Liza is not even Russian let's do it again 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:30.580
 try hello 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:40.120
 bolivia del video speak again 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.120
 hello slowly and clearly 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.730
 in general, like that, and the last to all 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.530
 the rest of the built-in tuner added 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.570
 dvb-s tuner 2 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:55.000
 this is a new generation of satellite broadcasting 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.930
 which roughly allows you to broadcast in 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.900
 best quality 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.910
 so in the case of 2 5 2 broadcast in this 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.940
 For now, only a few 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:06.610
 satellite channels a whole tv me 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.070
 and like from 3d i'm really excited 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.680
 This is the best I've seen at home 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.050
 TVs are a little upsetting that everyone 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.480
 those chips that make this telly 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.730
 Mega modern I did not work 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.130
 take advantage namely control with 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:23.650
 using smartphone and voice features 

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:26.260
 the rest of the telly loved 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:29.230
 Especially pleased with the magic motion remote 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.780
 management plan is that with each new 

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:34.090
 series added only the price they function 

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.340
 for me is not news so many do a 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:39.040
 the rest of the TV and really cool 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:41.230
 they show in chic quality with them 

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.510
 cool cool design then you too 

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:45.280
 pleased browser does not fools set 

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.890
 no problem text 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.140
 I personally have enough of this with my head on 

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.560
 This was all with you was an online store
