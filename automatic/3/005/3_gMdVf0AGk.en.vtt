I<00:01:37.500> got<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.299> t21<00:01:39.299> here<00:01:41.270> decently<00:01:42.270> thick<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.780> I

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
I got a t21 here decently thick and I

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:50.840 
I got a t21 here decently thick and I
got<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> t41<00:01:46.009> very<00:01:47.009> thin<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.960> t21<00:01:49.500> 21<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.369> t41

the<00:01:51.360> same<00:01:51.630> finish<00:01:52.189> very<00:01:53.189> more<00:01:53.549> metal<00:01:53.909> leaf<00:01:54.060> I'd

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
the same finish very more metal leaf I'd

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.740 
the same finish very more metal leaf I'd
say<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.500> more<00:01:55.860> more<00:01:56.369> rubbery<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:57.000> softer

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
say this is more more rubbery it softer

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.870 
say this is more more rubbery it softer
but<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.560> still<00:01:58.890> feels<00:01:59.159> really<00:01:59.490> really<00:02:00.450> sturdy

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.220 

all<00:02:08.930> right<00:02:09.080> this<00:02:09.710> is<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:09.830> 15<00:02:10.250> point<00:02:10.520> 4<00:02:10.850> inch

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
all right this is a 15 point 4 inch

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:19.620 
all right this is a 15 point 4 inch

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.450 

it<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:21.170> resolution<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:21.890> nine<00:02:23.860> twenty<00:02:24.860> by

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
it the resolution is nine twenty by

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.790 
it the resolution is nine twenty by
twelve<00:02:26.090> hundred
