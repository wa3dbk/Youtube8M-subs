00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.850 

and<00:04:11.410> also<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:13.450> harmonizer<00:04:14.450> pedal<00:04:14.960> the<00:04:15.620> boss

so<00:04:26.580> those<00:04:27.300> two<00:04:27.509> pedals<00:04:27.870> are<00:04:28.139> in<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.800> effects

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
so those two pedals are in the effects

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.279 
so those two pedals are in the effects
loop<00:04:29.669> in<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.150> bugera<00:04:30.419> so<00:04:30.689> that's<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.020> pedal

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
loop in the bugera so that's the pedal

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.490 
loop in the bugera so that's the pedal
board<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:33.210> only<00:04:33.330> other<00:04:33.419> things<00:04:33.810> is<00:04:34.110> I<00:04:34.229> use

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
board and the only other things is I use

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.029 
board and the only other things is I use
double<00:04:35.400> up<00:04:35.520> BIG's<00:04:36.150> w<00:04:36.569> 2<00:04:36.780> millimeter<00:04:37.229> pics<00:04:37.560> to

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
double up BIG's w 2 millimeter pics to

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.219 
double up BIG's w 2 millimeter pics to
real<00:04:38.189> thick<00:04:38.430> ones<00:04:38.669> and<00:04:39.090> I<00:04:39.449> use<00:04:39.659> live<00:04:39.960> wire

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
real thick ones and I use live wire

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.679 
real thick ones and I use live wire
cables<00:04:40.819> so<00:04:41.819> that's<00:04:42.000> pretty<00:04:42.300> much<00:04:42.389> the<00:04:42.509> whole

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:42.689 
cables so that's pretty much the whole

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:45.200 
cables so that's pretty much the whole
setup<00:04:43.080> the<00:04:43.740> big<00:04:43.889> difference<00:04:44.219> is<00:04:44.400> between<00:04:44.819> the

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
setup the big difference is between the

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.480 
setup the big difference is between the
death<00:04:45.389> writers<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.469> sole<00:04:46.800> abandon<00:04:47.189> setup

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
death writers and the sole abandon setup

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.939 
death writers and the sole abandon setup
it's<00:04:47.669> just<00:04:47.879> the<00:04:48.000> head<00:04:48.180> that<00:04:48.330> I<00:04:48.419> use<00:04:48.689> I<00:04:48.960> use<00:04:49.650> the

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
it's just the head that I use I use the

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.640 
it's just the head that I use I use the
bugera<00:04:50.250> 626<00:04:51.000> for<00:04:51.270> all<00:04:51.330> of<00:04:51.479> my<00:04:51.659> soul<00:04:52.020> band<00:04:52.319> stuff
