last year was we left here a little bit
devastated<00:02:24.359> because<00:02:24.840> we<00:02:25.140> thought<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.590> we

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
devastated because we thought that we

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.020 
devastated because we thought that we
played<00:02:25.980> really<00:02:26.190> well<00:02:26.310> enough<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.820> win<00:02:26.910> that

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
played really well enough to win that

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.020 
played really well enough to win that
game<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:29.040> just<00:02:29.250> came<00:02:29.340> down<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.700> couple<00:02:29.820> of

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
game it just came down to a couple of

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.670 
game it just came down to a couple of
ways<00:02:30.299> where<00:02:30.540> we<00:02:30.570> could<00:02:31.019> have<00:02:31.109> been<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:31.290> top<00:02:31.470> at

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
ways where we could have been on top at

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.360 
ways where we could have been on top at
the<00:02:31.709> end<00:02:31.890> but<00:02:32.989> being<00:02:33.989> here<00:02:34.079> in<00:02:34.290> 09<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.620> last

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
the end but being here in 09 and last

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.309 
the end but being here in 09 and last
year<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.880> was<00:02:36.750> just<00:02:36.989> something<00:02:37.170> that

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
year it was just something that

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.860 
year it was just something that
especially<00:02:37.829> being<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.100> senior<00:02:38.660> really<00:02:39.660> wanted

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
especially being a senior really wanted

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.520 
especially being a senior really wanted
to<00:02:39.959> get<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.859> guys<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.250> know<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:42.319> being<00:02:43.319> here

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
to get the guys to know that being here

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.349 
to get the guys to know that being here
is<00:02:43.590> not<00:02:43.739> an<00:02:43.829> easy<00:02:43.890> easy<00:02:44.190> place<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.459> play<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.730> we

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
is not an easy easy place to play and we

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.280 
is not an easy easy place to play and we
know<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.769> from<00:02:46.769> previous<00:02:47.160> experiences<00:02:47.760> but

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
know that from previous experiences but

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.870 
know that from previous experiences but
we<00:02:49.290> did<00:02:49.440> we<00:02:49.680> had<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.889> team<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.190> year<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.579> we

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
we did we had the team this year that we

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.360 
we did we had the team this year that we
could<00:02:51.000> take<00:02:51.150> them<00:02:51.209> down<00:02:51.389> I<00:02:51.859> think<00:02:52.859> we<00:02:52.920> put<00:02:53.100> a

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
could take them down I think we put a

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.970 
could take them down I think we put a
good<00:02:53.840> solid<00:02:54.840> team<00:02:55.170> performance<00:02:55.650> up<00:02:55.799> all

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
good solid team performance up all

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.129 
good solid team performance up all
around<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.480> came<00:02:57.480> off<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.780> wind<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.109> feels

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
around and came off the wind it feels

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.850 
around and came off the wind it feels
good<00:02:58.470> like<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.680> said<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.010> be<00:02:59.100> on<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.280> other<00:02:59.370> end

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860
