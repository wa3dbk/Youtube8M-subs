it's<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.850> small<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:40.020> even<00:00:40.290> doing<00:00:40.770> even

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
it's so small that even doing even

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.610 
it's so small that even doing even
though<00:00:41.250> we<00:00:41.460> could<00:00:41.670> resize<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:43.050> width<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
though we could resize the width of the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.430 
though we could resize the width of the
video<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.340> was<00:00:44.610> still<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.360> title<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
video it was still the title of the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.889 
video it was still the title of the
video<00:00:46.559> will<00:00:46.920> still<00:00:47.190> get<00:00:47.760> crunched<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.420> you

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
video will still get crunched in you

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
know it was a bad you can still do it

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.400 
know it was a bad you can still do it
and<00:00:51.149> it'll<00:00:51.329> still<00:00:51.570> work<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
and it'll still work but it's just the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
write three lines of code I'm gonna

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.920 
write three lines of code I'm gonna
write<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.239> snickering<00:02:12.870> in<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.080> string

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930

I'm<00:02:14.930> gonna<00:02:15.170> call<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.800> code<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:17.450> can<00:02:17.599> be<00:02:17.780> posed

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
I'm gonna call it code that can be posed

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.750 
I'm gonna call it code that can be posed
to<00:02:18.050> our<00:02:18.730> embed<00:02:19.730> code<00:02:20.000> from<00:02:20.209> YouTube

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
to our embed code from YouTube

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.570 
to our embed code from YouTube
and<00:02:22.360> then<00:02:22.510> just<00:02:22.840> click<00:02:23.530> on<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.860> video<00:02:23.980> color

share and then ended in copy data copy
the<00:02:30.550> whole<00:02:30.700> thing<00:02:31.110> now<00:02:32.110> let's<00:02:32.440> go<00:02:32.620> back<00:02:32.800> to

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
the whole thing now let's go back to

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.430 
the whole thing now let's go back to
Xcode<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.580> paste<00:02:33.879> in<00:02:34.090> between<00:02:34.420> them<00:02:34.629> in

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
Xcode and paste in between them in

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.979 
Xcode and paste in between them in
between<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:36.340> quotation<00:02:36.670> works<00:02:37.090> now<00:02:37.720> as<00:02:37.900> you

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
between the quotation works now as you

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.320 
between the quotation works now as you
can<00:02:38.080> see<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:39.069> code<00:02:39.340> has<00:02:39.580> some<00:02:39.790> quotation

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
can see the code has some quotation

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.059 
can see the code has some quotation
marks<00:02:40.569> in<00:02:40.750> there<00:02:40.930> it's<00:02:41.050> like<00:02:41.140> never<00:02:41.800> right

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
marks in there it's like never right

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.850 
marks in there it's like never right
here<00:02:42.280> so<00:02:43.269> this<00:02:43.510> error<00:02:43.780> is<00:02:44.080> saying<00:02:44.590> that

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
here so this error is saying that

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.059 
here so this error is saying that
because<00:02:45.370> like<00:02:45.760> um<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.930> know<00:02:47.080> computers<00:02:47.980> are

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
because like um you know computers are

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.070 
because like um you know computers are
dumb<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:49.420> they're<00:02:49.599> just<00:02:49.690> gonna<00:02:49.810> think

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
dumb and so they're just gonna think

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.199 
dumb and so they're just gonna think
okay<00:02:50.560> this<00:02:50.799> is<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.069> first<00:02:51.250> quotation<00:02:51.610> mark<00:02:51.940> so

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
okay this is the first quotation mark so

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.170 
okay this is the first quotation mark so
this<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.599> where<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.900> starts<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.739> then<00:02:54.640> it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
this is where it starts and then it

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.789 
this is where it starts and then it
keeps<00:02:55.299> reading<00:02:55.660> reading<00:02:55.900> reading<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.590> so<00:02:56.680> it

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
keeps reading reading reading and so it

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:57.839 
keeps reading reading reading and so it
gets<00:02:56.950> here<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.340> it's<00:02:57.459> it's<00:02:57.580> another

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
gets here and it's it's another

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.880 
gets here and it's it's another
quotation<00:02:58.180> mark<00:02:58.569> so<00:02:59.110> it's<00:02:59.319> gonna<00:02:59.410> think<00:02:59.709> this

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
quotation mark so it's gonna think this

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.430 
quotation mark so it's gonna think this
is<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.130> end<00:03:00.510> but<00:03:01.510> then<00:03:01.750> there's<00:03:01.989> another<00:03:02.049> one

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
is the end but then there's another one

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.660 
is the end but then there's another one
right<00:03:02.590> here<00:03:02.799> and<00:03:03.010> another<00:03:03.250> one<00:03:03.340> right<00:03:03.549> here

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
right here and another one right here

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.059 
right here and another one right here
and<00:03:03.880> there's<00:03:04.090> like<00:03:04.269> things<00:03:04.569> in<00:03:04.810> between

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
and there's like things in between

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.259 
and there's like things in between
numbers<00:03:06.069> in<00:03:06.160> between<00:03:06.459> it's<00:03:06.730> like<00:03:06.940> what<00:03:07.120> the

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
numbers in between it's like what the

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.569 
numbers in between it's like what the
heck<00:03:07.480> is<00:03:07.660> this<00:03:07.810> right<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:08.769> what<00:03:09.069> we<00:03:09.160> got<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.459> do

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
heck is this right so what we got to do

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.569 
heck is this right so what we got to do
is<00:03:09.790> tell<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.209> computer<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:11.230> this<00:03:12.069> quotation

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
is tell the computer that this quotation

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.280 
is tell the computer that this quotation
marks<00:03:12.849> it's<00:03:13.329> not<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.660> doesn't<00:03:13.690> mean<00:03:14.079> that's

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
marks it's not it doesn't mean that's

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.860 
marks it's not it doesn't mean that's
the<00:03:14.410> end<00:03:14.500> it's<00:03:15.130> just<00:03:15.400> part<00:03:15.670> of<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.940> embed<00:03:16.840> code

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870
