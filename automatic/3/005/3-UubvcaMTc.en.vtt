 luck they are loading all this line 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.710
 that I'm going to read the prices because the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.990
 advantage that I had some agreement all of 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.840
 memory we start with the 75- inch 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.070
 that comes out 200 thousand Argentine pesos and is 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.420
 a lot of money for a large TV set of 5 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.460
 inch comes with a freezer 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.770
 gift and then also with an owner 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.510
 four gifts because we continue with 65 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.330
 inches that also comes with a guayo 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.880
 4 and it comes out 76 thousand Argentine pesos and this one 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.830
 we're still a little smaller 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.110
 actively not so small 49 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.650
 inches also with a watson 4 of 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.510
 gift to 33 thousand Argentine pesos and can 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.940
 wear one that is the super super lens 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.320
 recontra finita that came out in itself is that is 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.790
 It is very new 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.250
 is going to be argentina i have no idea 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.570
 price I really do not know when it's going to be 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.770
 it is assumed that all these three models 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.300
 what I said at the beginning will be 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.550
 available from next month 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.870
 in all the honest ones of the country I do not know if 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.220
 they will win first by federal capital 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.450
 after all good air and after 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.329
 I suppose of everything 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.070
 so here also what I have to 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.320
 back we're going to show you how it works 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.450
 come all with lollipop they said that 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.090
 then they will update all to android 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.920
 I suppose 6.0 or android mo when they say 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.960
 the name will update it so 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.479
 very good part of sony start 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.950
 with the demo things very well so far 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.569
 we have a control that has everything 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.640
 touchpad here that also has buttons 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.259
 we press in the center clicks and 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.369
 then we have several buttons where 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.869
 It goes that we also have to change 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.159
 channel logically and change the volume 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.360
 so let's see how it works I'm not going 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.189
 to show how I'm moving it 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.259
 they simply leave what happens in 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.640
 screen here basically we are 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.649
 with all the applications that are 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.530
 installed some suggested as videos 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.780
 of youtube for is the trailer of suaita 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.399
 d'esquadra with the new show 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.569
 starred by jared leto if we go 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.250
 down we have some apps 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.640
 highlighted after all the impulse be 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.840
 hdmi s-video etcetera etcetera 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.310
 then more applications if we want 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.869
 we can enter the play store 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.280
 there we are going to center and let's see 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.899
 that we have applications to be able 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.069
 download all the ball that is not 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.470
 I show you because you can imagine how 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.819
 it works and if we go down once 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.619
 more there we have good games 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.590
 after the configuration we go to the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.209
 settings 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.220
 and we are going to see that we are indeed 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.190
 the only thing running about 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.660
 these lollipop rhythms and know that this 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.640
 you can play with the interest of 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.560
 lollipop age notice that we can 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.420
 enter this work visit to 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.670
 Olympus and they can play in a kind of 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.830
 lollipop the pivb was possible 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.239
 completely impossible to play I can not 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.489
 do one I just can not make one 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.560
 I could never do one I think the maximum 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.420
 generates a phone was 2 good until no 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.010
 I can not be more, so let's go 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.420
 back but good as I said is 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.680
 all settings here so 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.840
 basically android but one against 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.519
 gigantic or is it the same as already 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.170
 we know but how should it be like 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.480
 I said at the beginning and on a TV and not 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.769
 with proprietary operating systems and 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.299

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.040

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.800

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.870

 basically android but on a TV 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.640
