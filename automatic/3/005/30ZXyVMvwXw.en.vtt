00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:28.410
 it's how to have the sound of the microphone with 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.730
 hit who has a big problem if that 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.349
 not walk directly so I you 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.800
 advise to test as soon as you have it 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:39.290
 crack so we'll see so I'll 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.610
 go into typing 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.059
 I like to be like before so we come 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.969
 right here 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.180
 so you have external record aline put 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.640
 so input until also begins that 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.670
 general aps movie you go in movie 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.219
 recorde external to the inpi from where the coachman 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.300
 when if you choose the few 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.710
 it's your microphone we leave that aside 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:07.619
 and if it works does not affect the facts top 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:11.010
 weight on the little are there down made 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.540
 recording devices otherwise 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.070
 there is another technique you are going good 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.750

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:22.229
 panel setup the salad a little 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:24.030
 we no configuration and old 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.189
 tubes you go into hardware and audio 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.150
 are and you will have the same one so hop and 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.979
