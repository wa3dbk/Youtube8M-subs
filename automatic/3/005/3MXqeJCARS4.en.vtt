00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150

that<00:00:15.599> we<00:00:15.809> rely<00:00:16.139> on<00:00:16.170> both<00:00:16.590> for<00:00:16.859> D<00:00:17.100> X<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.580> FX

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150

for<00:01:45.869> either<00:01:46.049> sensor<00:01:46.590> format<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.759> was<00:01:47.850> smart

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
for either sensor format so it was smart
