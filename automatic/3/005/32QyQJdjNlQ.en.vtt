00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.810
 two race cars that Indians 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.080
 circuits in the 50's 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.580
 two models full of new ideas all 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.320
 To win 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.050
 the main evidence in Europe in the hands 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.399
 of street manuel fangio the greatest champions 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.579
 of formula 1 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.040
 the wheel of 24 made beautiful in tests 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.290
 long-term to earn 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.260
 aerodynamic the hitchhiker was 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.200
 closed and the model had other details 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.920
 for example two electric pumps of 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.309
 aircraft were part of the engine 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.690
 the angel won several races between 53 and 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.690
 54 with this template 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.449
 the car has a motor of 245 horses 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.670
 will be 300 s and are 230 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.030
 but at the final speed they tie 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:14.340
 about 260 kilometers per hour 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.340
 already thought without seat belt 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.479
 but in this circuit that bears the name of the 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.680
 Argentine pilot the rule is do not run 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.490
 understandable after all are two 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.729
 to other rules is that only 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.009
 the mechanics can send the people stay 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.210
 looking for the design differences of the 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.190
 two cars 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.920
 the steering wheel bets on an area entrance 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.380
 exclusive to cool the brakes a 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.060
 keratitis use a heat sink to 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.690
 do the same function 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.399
 there is one thing in common for low breezes 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.350
 or any dirt any stone that 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.110
 has on the front ends up flying 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.799
 ends up hitting you too the year in 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.920
 what kind of sensations do you feel driving 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.379
 a car like that pt and with the ninth 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.899
 place like this in the same power 

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:07.179
 but without the same security 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.700
 You have to drive the whole machine and 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.599
 not just the single volume but the machine 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.599
 that what 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.140
 Just get in a car like that. 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.040
 just to observe the flying details 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.040
 panels 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.400
 we wonder how many of these 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.860
 ideas inspired models that came 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.680
 later and are still a reference for 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.269
 many designers as well as 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.269
 fan determination
