00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.690
 ladies and gentlemen this time 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.730
 I want to share an application so that 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.580
 can customize their taskbar 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.890
 the application is already well known 7 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.470
 with fierce and this will help them change 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.160
 the icons that are anchored in their 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.529
 taskbar good I'll be you 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.539
 leaving a file rar you what 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.450
 will do it will be download it then what 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.630
 decompress and they will have a folder 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.040
 the folder is this 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.040
 now we open it 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.930
 here what we will do is start the 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:50.180
 application we give a right click on 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.180
 she and we execute her as administrator 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.450
 and this is the application how can you 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.400
 give account brings packs of icons touch 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.260
 in some colors that yes no more 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.440
 I remember some and brought by 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.020
 defect and good to apply a pack 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.540
 any of these icons simply 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.140
 we choose the one we want we click 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.870
 right about it and we're going to apply 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.060
 here in this option we should have it 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.310
 marked so that we can change the 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.930
 icons that we have anchored in the bar 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.869
 of tasks 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.030
 now if we mark this option to be 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.390
 menu we will change the icons that 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.670
 we have in the start menu but good to 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.860
 I do not like to change them so the 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.380
 uncheck and 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.550
 and then we are in applying 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.100
 then to accept 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.590
 and ready we will have changed our 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.630
 icons and if they were fixed we have been 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.940
 changed immediately without 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.480
 restart us the explorer what is it 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.880
 they make other versions of this application 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.310
 another way to change them is by giving double 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.000
 click on the icons and we do the same 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.700
 from before or also by choosing the icons 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.230
 and clicking here above to apply and 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.230
 here we do what we already know 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.040
 now to create a pack of icons we give 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.950
 a right click here where are the 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.300
 icons we go down here in create and 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.300
 we choke on this option 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.830
 here we put a name for the new 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.170
 pair of icons that subsequently 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.970
 we will create 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.670
 now we go to the option of icons 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.130
 to replace any we give double 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.000
 click on any and here we go to the 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.790
 Bronze option in this new window 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.590
 we must look for the icon or icons that 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.590
 we will replace in the place of the others 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.270
 remind them that these should be in 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.170
 format and ccoo 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.990
 as soon as they try so so so 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.580
 when we find it we choose it and click 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.500
 in April 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.500
 then we give in salt 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.980
 and so we must change them all from 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.980
 the same way 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.270
 wait I do it quickie 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:26.819
 so so so so 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:29.819
 already after changing we give them in salt and 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:33.629
 ready we'll have them created now 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:37.260
 to look for them we just went down a bit and 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:39.629
 look here we have them now we're just going 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.819
 to apply the ones in the way 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:49.410
 We learned how you see, we have already been 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:51.239
 changed now let's see another point if 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.700
 then they want to eliminate one of these 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:57.380
 icons just right click on the 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.380
 who want to remove dan a vÃ©lez 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:04.230
 here they confirm giving in and ready like this 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.230
 they will have been eliminated 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.880
 now if we want to return our 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.940
 icons to normal we're just going to 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.570
 everyone click here to restore 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.570
 factories 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.310
 we accept 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.490
 and here we go a click on restore 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.760
 and it will be that simple to return our 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.130
 icons to as they come by default 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.280
 I will leave applied the ones I had to 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.280

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.850
 and so we have finished as you see the 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.680
