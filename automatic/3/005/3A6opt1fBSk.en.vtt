00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
science all good scientist you dream of

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.630 
science all good scientist you dream of
an<00:05:06.900> idea<00:05:07.260> and<00:05:07.530> then<00:05:07.710> you<00:05:07.830> hope<00:05:08.100> that<00:05:08.370> one<00:05:08.610> day

an idea and then you hope that one day

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.870 
an idea and then you hope that one day
this<00:05:09.150> will<00:05:09.420> bear<00:05:09.780> fruit<00:05:09.870> and<00:05:10.800> I<00:05:11.190> must<00:05:11.580> wanted

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
this will bear fruit and I must wanted

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.520 
this will bear fruit and I must wanted
to<00:05:12.000> see<00:05:12.180> at<00:05:12.270> that<00:05:12.480> time<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:12.960> interest<00:05:13.290> was

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
to see at that time the interest was

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.200 
to see at that time the interest was
there<00:05:13.890> at<00:05:14.100> least<00:05:14.310> that<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:14.670> thoughts<00:05:14.910> for

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
there at least that the thoughts for

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.300 
there at least that the thoughts for
their<00:05:15.360> that<00:05:15.660> stem<00:05:15.930> cells<00:05:16.200> may<00:05:16.440> be<00:05:16.500> useful<00:05:17.100> but

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
their that stem cells may be useful but

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.910 
their that stem cells may be useful but
I<00:05:17.850> never<00:05:18.270> ever<00:05:18.450> dreamed<00:05:18.690> that<00:05:18.900> it'll<00:05:19.260> draw<00:05:19.500> so

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
I never ever dreamed that it'll draw so

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.610 
I never ever dreamed that it'll draw so
much<00:05:20.130> of<00:05:20.370> interest<00:05:20.700> right<00:05:21.210> now<00:05:21.480> and<00:05:21.780> so<00:05:22.470> many

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
much of interest right now and so many

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.650 
much of interest right now and so many
people<00:05:22.860> excited<00:05:23.370> it's<00:05:23.760> a<00:05:23.880> buzz<00:05:24.060> word<00:05:24.270> today

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.460 
people excited it's a buzz word today
stem<00:05:25.230> cells<00:05:25.670> and<00:05:26.670> so<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.840> race<00:05:28.020> to<00:05:28.200> create

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
stem cells and so the race to create

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.800 
stem cells and so the race to create
life<00:05:28.680> in<00:05:28.890> a<00:05:28.950> test<00:05:29.220> tube<00:05:29.310> has<00:05:30.090> led<00:05:30.300> us<00:05:30.420> into<00:05:30.600> the

brave new world of building body parts

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.870 
brave new world of building body parts
on<00:05:32.820> demand<00:05:33.180> and<00:05:33.530> it's<00:05:34.530> hoped<00:05:34.770> one<00:05:35.670> in<00:05:35.790> which
