00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.320
 Hi everyone, I'm here with young 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.020
 baptist excavation 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.880
 I read on the flyer tsb systems tai chi 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.490
 stands at def 5a and c 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.140
 published by personnel as it is possible is 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.200
 absolutely possible 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.450
 a job that is certainly complex is 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.270
 possible because the tc first of all 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.580
 born as a martial art is an art 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.890
 martial complex and sophisticated what 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.180
 it is complex it is not said that it is 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.790
 impossible it is made possible with 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.110
 a job focused on the characteristics of 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.630
 firstly, targeted work must be carried out 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.790
 sincerity in genital practice la 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.980
 practice means trying to create a 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.559
 a situation in self-defense 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.530
 as real as possible is an investigation 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.329
 as sincere as possible in the 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.870
 correct the flaws of your own 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.239
 movement the concept is to not 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.039
 to oppose force is to not give 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.069
 to the opponent's strength a point up 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:09.020
 to apply this is the fulcrum and juice 

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:11.329
 of self-defense apply it is 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.700
 certainly not difficult is not easy is not 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.579
 immediate however it is possible therefore in two 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.990
 words personal principles 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.990
 on the opponent to exploit the force 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.659
 of the opponent but even more so 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.029
 becoming the opponent's strength is the 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.880
 my only strength and therefore manage 

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:30.530
 this one strength as if it were mine 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.509
 to be able to do this is not one 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.299
 technical issue is absolutely one 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.640
 mental question if I'm not relaxed 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.100
 I am not present if I am not present 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.710
 I can't connect to the opponent 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.950
 I can't accept his strength when 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.600
 an evaluation is created where I take it 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.360
 of strong blows this happens because I 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.140
 I resist because I do not accept force 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.090
 opponent 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.520
 the key to making sure that strength 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.280
 I ca n't intervene on me 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.700
 accept it by accepting it I find that 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.679
 that mental and physical centering that 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.390
 it allows me to be lucid and therefore 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.179
 really react as you do in one 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.789
 technique in the gym because on the street and 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.549
 so the component is different from us 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.980
 mental is absolutely important there 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.650
 can do it from some application 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.079
 absolutely in the speech of I was not 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.959
 to strength and there is so much talk 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.970
 cultural when for example the 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.450
 classical aggression did not make the 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.640
 slap 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.860
 usually the natural reaction is 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.660
 this one must try not to 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.260
 allow the slap to express itself 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.510
 completely 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.530
 for example in this way then me 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.930
 shortens the distance 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.410
 instead of making her let us get here 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.180
 such that I 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.730
 I go forward not allowing the slap 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.650
 to express itself in its potential for 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.200
 to do this I must be very relaxed 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.700
 because if not even if I'm used to 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.840
 do this exercise when one arrives 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.730
 slap first I will report then it will come 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.880
 the movement is then on this for 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.880
 example 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.310
 it's not enough just to react as soon as he does 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.040
 moves 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.360
 you have to be continuous because I go 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.000
 on the hull piece the action in two 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.910
 cast a plaster for him two gestures 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.910
 make a gesture together he does 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.560
 it's a farm gesture until you do 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.900
 arrives on the ground and be a single chalk 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.700
 continuity is given by circularity 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.650
 which is another specific feature 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.260
 smaller children less strong 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.000
 when someone like you could get by and 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.980
 depends on so many things 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.470
 these are answers that are not easy 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.060
 because reality is made up of circumstances 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.430
 from individuals 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.410
 we are definitely there again 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.680
 potential the possibility for one 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.500
 girl with a right workout and with 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.990
 of real skills to counter 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.330
 the aggression of a heavier person 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.190
 it is stronger than this is absolutely 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.480
 however, it does not mean that it is easy 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.880
 this does not mean that it is the standard 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.860
 is whether the heaviest person 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.390
 equally prepared of course yes 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.500
 assumes that those who attack me do not 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.650
 have my preparation 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.630
 because if not then surely the 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.060
 self-defense in girls at one 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.740
 very important component 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.870
 whoever attacks a woman does not expect 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.520
 a reaction to which we have to work a lot 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.110
 on the initial reaction 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.240
 the perspective of personal defense 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.280
 female and to get to safety 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.470
 not to neutralize one's own 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.900
 attackers do n't even try it because one 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.140
 risk and therefore I will always try to 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.200
 astound 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.970
 the aggressor with a lesson also 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.030
 bloody even with a coup testicles with 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.980
 a glance with painful techniques 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.880
 and immediate but allow me to 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.900
 to run away 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.900
 thanks to you you understand it then
