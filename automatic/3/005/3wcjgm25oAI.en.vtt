00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 there were one hundred and forty-eight people 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.890
 on board the conditions of the accident which 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.170
 are not yet elucidated leaves 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:16.080
 think there would be no survivors 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.279
 I want to first express to families who 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.880
 have just been touched by this tragedy 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.890
 which happened in France 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:27.080
 all our solidarity do not know 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.080
 still the identity of the victims 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.180
 I spoke immediately with 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.890
 the prime minister the minister of 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.559
 the interior bernard cazeneuve surrenders 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.180
 immediately on the spot a cell of 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.710
 crisis has just been formed and we 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.960
 will have all the information 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.360
 in a few minutes 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.219
 by then we make every effort 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.980
 so that there is no consequence of 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.079
 the accident and I will have interviews and 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.109
 with Chancellor Merkel because he is 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.100
 likely that there are many 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.199
 German victims 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.550
 and of course with the King of Spain who 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.080
 visit us 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.810
 today it's a tragedy a 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.760
 new aerial tragedy 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.430
 we will also have to know all the 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.009
 causes of what happened and we 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.040
 of course we will give them to 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.310
 concerned authorities as well Spanish 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.080
 German and the families of 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.860
 victims 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.479
 it is a mourning we must experience 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:36.150
 because it's a tragedy that has 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:38.850
 produced on our soil and finally I have the 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.680
 would also know if there would be 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.790
 no other consequences of 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.950
 the accident occurred in an area 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.180
 particularly difficult to access I do not 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.600
 do not know if there are any dwellings 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.259
 concerned we will be in the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.710
 next hours 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.659
 in the tent it's first the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.860
 solidarity that must be our first 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.860
 feeling thanks
