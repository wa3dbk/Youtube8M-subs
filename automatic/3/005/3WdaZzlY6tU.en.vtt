the balance area so after rolling up and

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.499 
the balance area so after rolling up and
down<00:01:19.860> through<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> feet<00:01:20.549> get<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.210> middle

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
down through the feet get that middle

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.999 
down through the feet get that middle
area<00:01:21.659> where<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.869> feel<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.229> I'm<00:01:22.439> standing<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.950> a

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
area where I feel like I'm standing on a

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.580 
area where I feel like I'm standing on a
seesaw<00:01:23.640> or<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.030> teeter-totter<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.380> from<00:01:25.530> that

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
seesaw or a teeter-totter and from that

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.760 
seesaw or a teeter-totter and from that
position<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.400> can<00:01:26.580> just<00:01:26.759> squish<00:01:27.180> from<00:01:27.450> one

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
position I can just squish from one

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.289 
position I can just squish from one
valence<00:01:28.770> area<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.549> other<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.180> this

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
valence area to the other and this

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.410 
valence area to the other and this
really<00:01:30.659> helps<00:01:30.990> open<00:01:31.140> my<00:01:31.500> lower<00:01:31.710> back<00:01:32.040> a

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
really helps open my lower back a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.760 
really helps open my lower back a
variation<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.659> if<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.380> go<00:01:34.500> with<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
variation on that if I can go with the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.010 
variation on that if I can go with the
maasai<00:01:35.159> sensor<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.030> sends<00:01:36.479> even<00:01:36.689> more<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.960> a

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
maasai sensor and sends even more of a

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.890 
maasai sensor and sends even more of a
lengthening<00:01:37.530> through<00:01:38.159> my<00:01:38.369> calf<00:01:38.640> muscles<00:01:39.240> and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
lengthening through my calf muscles and

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.530 
lengthening through my calf muscles and
then<00:01:40.049> finally<00:01:40.680> well<00:01:41.610> not<00:01:41.790> too<00:01:42.000> many<00:01:42.180> people

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
then finally well not too many people

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.210 
then finally well not too many people
watching<00:01:42.810> as<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.409> like<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.710> bring<00:01:43.799> my<00:01:43.860> hands
