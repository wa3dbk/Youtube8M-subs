Motorola<00:00:22.850> was<00:00:23.030> smart<00:00:23.510> they<00:00:23.750> left<00:00:23.960> these

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
Motorola was smart they left these

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.230 
Motorola was smart they left these
little<00:00:24.500> holes<00:00:24.740> here<00:00:24.980> on<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.310> front<00:00:25.610> where<00:00:26.210> you

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
little holes here on the front where you

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.020 
little holes here on the front where you
could<00:00:26.510> still<00:00:26.750> wake<00:00:26.960> up<00:00:27.020> the<00:00:27.350> device<00:00:27.820> if<00:00:28.820> it's

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.030 
could still wake up the device if it's

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.790 
could still wake up the device if it's
lined<00:00:29.480> up<00:00:29.750> correctly<00:00:30.170> I<00:00:30.320> don't<00:00:30.530> know<00:00:30.590> if<00:00:30.710> it

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
lined up correctly I don't know if it

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.700 
lined up correctly I don't know if it
actually<00:00:30.830> works<00:00:31.419> I'll<00:00:32.419> see<00:00:32.540> if<00:00:32.630> we<00:00:32.689> get<00:00:32.810> it

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
actually works I'll see if we get it

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.040 
actually works I'll see if we get it
doesn't<00:00:34.010> look<00:00:34.130> like<00:00:34.250> it<00:00:34.370> does<00:00:34.780> but<00:00:35.780> it's<00:00:35.900> kind

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
doesn't look like it does but it's kind

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.160 
doesn't look like it does but it's kind
of<00:00:36.080> cool<00:00:36.230> they<00:00:36.500> tried<00:00:36.680> to<00:00:36.710> set<00:00:36.980> that<00:00:37.130> in<00:00:37.280> there

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
of cool they tried to set that in there

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.840 
of cool they tried to set that in there
they<00:00:39.170> also<00:00:39.350> have<00:00:39.560> the<00:00:39.680> holes<00:00:40.340> here<00:00:40.700> in<00:00:40.760> the

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
they also have the holes here in the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.950 
they also have the holes here in the
back<00:00:41.030> which<00:00:41.240> I<00:00:41.329> don't<00:00:41.390> know<00:00:41.600> what<00:00:41.690> purpose

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
back which I don't know what purpose

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.090 
back which I don't know what purpose
those<00:00:42.290> serve<00:00:42.500> I<00:00:42.680> guess<00:00:42.860> those<00:00:43.040> are

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
those serve I guess those are

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
those serve I guess those are
microphones<00:00:44.060> so<00:00:44.840> there<00:00:44.989> is<00:00:45.110> that<00:00:45.970> my<00:00:46.970> opinion

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
microphones so there is that my opinion

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.940 
microphones so there is that my opinion
I<00:00:47.600> really<00:00:47.930> like<00:00:48.170> this<00:00:48.380> case<00:00:48.620> it's<00:00:48.860> like

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
I really like this case it's like

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.120 
I really like this case it's like
genuine<00:00:49.489> leather<00:00:50.079> it's<00:00:51.079> not<00:00:51.350> cheap<00:00:51.710> by<00:00:51.950> any

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
genuine leather it's not cheap by any

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.069 
genuine leather it's not cheap by any
means<00:00:52.399> I<00:00:52.640> believe<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.180> case<00:00:53.360> is<00:00:53.720> $59.99<00:00:56.079> if

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
means I believe the case is $59.99 if

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.479 
means I believe the case is $59.99 if
you<00:00:57.260> buy<00:00:57.500> it<00:00:57.560> from<00:00:59.020> Motorola<00:01:00.020> or<00:01:00.770> as<00:01:01.010> it<00:01:01.130> is<00:01:01.309> if

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
you buy it from Motorola or as it is if

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.270 
you buy it from Motorola or as it is if
it<00:01:01.610> might<00:01:02.059> be<00:01:02.120> $59.99<00:01:03.020> I<00:01:03.230> got<00:01:03.470> this<00:01:03.649> I<00:01:03.829> got<00:01:03.920> this

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
it might be $59.99 I got this I got this

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.039 
it might be $59.99 I got this I got this
one<00:01:04.489> directly<00:01:06.189> from<00:01:07.189> the<00:01:07.479> Verizon<00:01:08.479> Wireless

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
one directly from the Verizon Wireless

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.620 
one directly from the Verizon Wireless
retail<00:01:09.499> store<00:01:09.740> where<00:01:09.889> we<00:01:09.920> bought<00:01:10.069> this<00:01:10.520> in<00:01:11.450> New

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
retail store where we bought this in New

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.410 
retail store where we bought this in New
York<00:01:11.749> City<00:01:12.109> so<00:01:12.710> it<00:01:13.219> may<00:01:13.429> be<00:01:13.460> more<00:01:13.579> it<00:01:14.210> may<00:01:14.359> be

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
York City so it may be more it may be

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.090 
York City so it may be more it may be
cheaper<00:01:14.780> to<00:01:14.810> buy<00:01:15.020> it<00:01:15.079> from<00:01:15.289> Motorola<00:01:15.709> I<00:01:15.920> don't
