see my process in tidying books and
papers<00:04:17.209> to<00:04:17.450> be<00:04:17.959> honest<00:04:18.320> closed<00:04:18.709> was<00:04:19.010> probably

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
papers to be honest closed was probably

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.100 
papers to be honest closed was probably
the<00:04:19.580> most<00:04:19.760> difficult<00:04:20.060> category<00:04:20.840> for<00:04:21.080> me

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.110 
the most difficult category for me

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.370 
the most difficult category for me
because<00:04:21.470> I<00:04:21.500> had<00:04:21.830> so<00:04:22.610> many<00:04:22.850> clothes<00:04:23.150> and<00:04:23.480> I<00:04:24.050> just

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
because I had so many clothes and I just

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.330 
because I had so many clothes and I just
don't<00:04:24.980> like<00:04:25.160> to<00:04:25.930> discard<00:04:26.930> my<00:04:27.290> personal<00:04:28.040> things

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
don't like to discard my personal things

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.760 
don't like to discard my personal things
clothes<00:04:28.760> feel<00:04:29.000> very<00:04:29.330> personal<00:04:29.510> to<00:04:29.960> me<00:04:29.990> but

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
clothes feel very personal to me but

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.040 
clothes feel very personal to me but
books<00:04:31.130> and<00:04:31.370> papers<00:04:31.730> were<00:04:31.760> easier<00:04:32.600> to<00:04:32.720> get

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
books and papers were easier to get

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.560 
books and papers were easier to get
through<00:04:33.260> I<00:04:33.590> feel<00:04:34.160> like<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.760> rest<00:04:35.360> of<00:04:35.480> the

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
through I feel like the rest of the

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.750 
through I feel like the rest of the
categories<00:04:36.110> are<00:04:36.260> a<00:04:36.290> little<00:04:36.500> bit<00:04:36.710> easier<00:04:37.100> until

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
categories are a little bit easier until

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.150 
categories are a little bit easier until
you<00:04:37.910> get<00:04:38.060> to<00:04:38.210> mementos<00:04:38.750> at<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:39.200> end<00:04:39.350> so

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
you get to mementos at the end so

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.880 
you get to mementos at the end so
hopefully<00:04:40.820> by<00:04:40.970> mementos<00:04:41.600> your<00:04:42.170> intuition<00:04:42.770> is

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
hopefully by mementos your intuition is

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.980 
hopefully by mementos your intuition is
strong<00:04:43.310> enough<00:04:43.550> that<00:04:43.610> you<00:04:43.970> know<00:04:44.330> what<00:04:44.870> you

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
strong enough that you know what you

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.270 
strong enough that you know what you
want<00:04:45.170> to<00:04:45.260> keep<00:04:45.410> and<00:04:45.650> what<00:04:45.680> you<00:04:45.830> don't<00:04:45.980> want<00:04:46.190> to

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
want to keep and what you don't want to

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.250 
want to keep and what you don't want to
keep<00:04:46.430> I<00:04:47.210> will<00:04:47.600> let<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:47.870> know<00:04:47.990> when<00:04:48.140> I<00:04:48.170> get

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260
