00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
it's in our control so and we're in the

it's in our control so and we're in the
FA<00:05:24.720> Cup<00:05:24.750> again<00:05:25.139> but<00:05:25.350> I<00:05:25.440> don't<00:05:25.500> want<00:05:25.770> our<00:05:25.860> season

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
FA Cup again but I don't want our season

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.680 
FA Cup again but I don't want our season
to<00:05:26.250> be<00:05:26.370> judged<00:05:26.580> on<00:05:26.729> that<00:05:26.850> FA<00:05:27.090> Cup<00:05:27.300> fund<00:05:27.510> so<00:05:27.660> it

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
to be judged on that FA Cup fund so it

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.390 
to be judged on that FA Cup fund so it
can<00:05:27.810> go<00:05:27.930> either<00:05:28.139> way<00:05:28.260> but<00:05:28.530> in<00:05:28.680> my<00:05:28.860> mind<00:05:29.130> we<00:05:29.250> have

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
can go either way but in my mind we have

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.400 
can go either way but in my mind we have
made<00:05:29.610> massive<00:05:30.210> progress<00:05:30.450> this<00:05:30.750> season<00:05:31.110> you

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
made massive progress this season you

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.500 
made massive progress this season you
consider<00:05:31.710> where<00:05:31.890> we've<00:05:32.039> come<00:05:32.250> from<00:05:32.280> and<00:05:32.729> we

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
consider where we've come from and we

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.080 
consider where we've come from and we
won<00:05:33.750> two<00:05:34.169> out<00:05:34.410> of<00:05:34.500> our<00:05:34.620> first<00:05:34.830> eight<00:05:35.160> games<00:05:35.190> and

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
won two out of our first eight games and

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.210 
won two out of our first eight games and
so<00:05:36.840> we've<00:05:37.020> effectively<00:05:37.560> been<00:05:37.770> the<00:05:37.890> best<00:05:38.070> team

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
so we've effectively been the best team

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.100 
so we've effectively been the best team
in<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:38.370> league<00:05:38.460> since<00:05:38.940> after<00:05:39.780> those<00:05:39.930> eight

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
in the league since after those eight

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.800 
in the league since after those eight
games<00:05:40.380> and<00:05:40.770> it's<00:05:41.280> not<00:05:41.460> just<00:05:41.700> the<00:05:42.300> league<00:05:42.479> table

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
games and it's not just the league table

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.270 
games and it's not just the league table
that<00:05:42.930> shows<00:05:43.110> how<00:05:43.320> far<00:05:43.530> we've<00:05:43.740> progressed<00:05:44.070> it's

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
that shows how far we've progressed it's

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.310 
that shows how far we've progressed it's
also<00:05:44.400> just<00:05:45.240> tactically<00:05:45.840> as<00:05:45.930> well<00:05:46.140> I<00:05:46.169> think

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
also just tactically as well I think

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.960 
also just tactically as well I think
we're<00:05:46.860> winning<00:05:46.979> those<00:05:47.220> big<00:05:47.460> games<00:05:47.640> now<00:05:47.910> we

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
we're winning those big games now we

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.909 
we're winning those big games now we
know<00:05:48.210> how<00:05:48.360> to<00:05:48.419> play<00:05:48.600> and<00:05:48.870> our<00:05:49.260> players<00:05:49.650> have

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
know how to play and our players have

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.150 
know how to play and our players have
improved<00:05:50.340> we've<00:05:50.520> got<00:05:50.669> Sanchez<00:05:51.240> and<00:05:51.830> I<00:05:52.830> just

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
improved we've got Sanchez and I just

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.010 
improved we've got Sanchez and I just
think<00:05:53.280> were<00:05:53.490> a<00:05:53.700> much<00:05:53.970> better<00:05:54.240> equip<00:05:54.660> team<00:05:54.870> to

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
think were a much better equip team to

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.960 
think were a much better equip team to
go<00:05:55.140> and<00:05:55.169> win<00:05:55.470> Tata<00:05:55.740> but<00:05:55.950> just<00:05:56.100> want<00:05:56.580> to<00:05:56.610> say<00:05:56.789> one
