00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
comparison and back and this is my

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.320

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.070 

so<00:01:36.770> doesn't<00:01:37.770> really<00:01:37.920> seem<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.310> different

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
so doesn't really seem that different

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.560 
so doesn't really seem that different
size<00:01:40.080> seems<00:01:41.659> almost<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:43.020> same<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.100> little

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
size seems almost the same it's a little

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.969 
size seems almost the same it's a little
little<00:01:45.570> longer<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.490> little<00:01:47.490> bit<00:01:47.900> as<00:01:48.900> far<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.260> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
little longer a little bit as far as the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.650 
little longer a little bit as far as the
whip<00:01:50.130> goes<00:01:50.400> it's<00:01:50.610> actually<00:01:50.940> a<00:01:50.970> little<00:01:51.270> lesser

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
whip goes it's actually a little lesser

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.630 
whip goes it's actually a little lesser
because<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.650> is<00:01:52.800> 16<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.700> Galaxy<00:01:54.180> Note<00:01:54.450> 2's

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
because this is 16 the Galaxy Note 2's

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.420 
because this is 16 the Galaxy Note 2's
16<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.759> 2<00:01:56.880> 9<00:01:57.140> aspect<00:01:58.140> ratio<00:01:58.590> whereas<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
16 is 2 9 aspect ratio whereas the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.520 
16 is 2 9 aspect ratio whereas the
original<00:01:59.790> Galaxy<00:01:59.970> Note<00:02:00.300> was<00:02:00.590> 16<00:02:01.590> by<00:02:01.770> 10<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:03.530> 16

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
original Galaxy Note was 16 by 10 so 16

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.800 
original Galaxy Note was 16 by 10 so 16
by<00:02:04.650> 9<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.100> 16<00:02:05.310> by<00:02:05.520> 10<00:02:05.670> which<00:02:05.909> means<00:02:05.940> that<00:02:06.450> it's

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
by 9 and 16 by 10 which means that it's

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.880 
by 9 and 16 by 10 which means that it's
a<00:02:06.990> little<00:02:07.020> narrower

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
a little narrower

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.229 
a little narrower
I<00:02:08.539> know<00:02:09.539> rod<00:02:09.869> weighs<00:02:10.170> about<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.500> same<00:02:11.030> as<00:02:12.030> per
