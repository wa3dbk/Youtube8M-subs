00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.139
 we are essentially spirit and the lord 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.139
 Jesus every day will have a link 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.040
 spiritual with your eternal part and this 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.100
 it will affect your whole being spirit mind and 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.980
 body we declare that you will receive a 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.900
 spiritual refreshment that will renew you 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.340
 to move on and beat all 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.620
 amÃ©n difficulty 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.460
 the bible says in first of 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:41.330
 Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 23 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.120
 may God himself the god of peace make them 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:47.629
 you are perfectly holy and you 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.930
 keep all your being spirit soul and 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.720
 body without any defect for the coming 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.120
 of our Lord Jesus Christ the more 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.540
 without being and constant be our devotion 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.860
 to God more we will receive from his power 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.570
 eternal and we can live with strength 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:09.920
 enjoying the eternal benefits 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:13.100
 here and now it is not right to think that 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.180
 eternal things are for the future 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:21.290
 because the eternal affects us every day to 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.539
 every step jesus taught I have come for 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.250
 that have life and have it in 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.430
 abundance 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.300
 and I express it in present tense said 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.720
 so that they have this is now so 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.370
 while we do all the things 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.030
 according to the word of God the 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.400
 benefits will be temporary and eternal 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.830
 because the spiritual is superimposed on everything 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.479
 what is visible in the book of Colossians 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.360
 chapter 3 verse 1 and 2 says search 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.720
 the things above where is Christ 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.119
 sitting to the right of God put the 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.710
 look at the things of heaven and not in the 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.670
 from the earth 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.179
 let's pray in this way sir jesus 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.429
 thank you for your sacrifice on the cross 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:13.400
 because your blood opened the door and 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.830
 what separated us from your kingdom now you 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.280
 I ask to experience your presence in me 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.430
 heart at every moment and I open 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.860
 doors to the holy spirit to all 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.580
 areas of my life in the name of Jesus 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.490
 Amen 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.550
