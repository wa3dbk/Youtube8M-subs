Patriots<00:00:53.579> was<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> number<00:00:54.600> one<00:00:54.629> kicker<00:00:55.020> last

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
Patriots was the number one kicker last

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.959 
Patriots was the number one kicker last
year<00:00:55.620> his<00:00:56.070> weekly<00:00:56.640> point<00:00:57.360> differential<00:00:58.020> was

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969

year his weekly point differential was
1.76<00:00:59.969> points<00:01:00.780> better<00:01:01.320> than<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.859> number<00:01:02.100> 10

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
1.76 points better than the number 10

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.729 
1.76 points better than the number 10
kicker<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.049> spread<00:01:04.320> out<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.589> you're

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
kicker so and that spread out so you're

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.980 
kicker so and that spread out so you're
like<00:01:04.920> okay<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.250> two<00:01:05.580> points<00:01:05.970> quite<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> bit<00:01:06.540> so

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
like okay it's two points quite a bit so

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.050 
like okay it's two points quite a bit so
let's<00:01:07.200> look<00:01:07.380> into<00:01:07.590> number<00:01:08.010> let's<00:01:08.670> look<00:01:08.820> at<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
let's look into number let's look at the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.460 
let's look into number let's look at the
number<00:01:09.330> three<00:01:09.570> kicker<00:01:09.780> now<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> number

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
number three kicker now so the number

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.990 
number three kicker now so the number
three<00:01:10.650> compared<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> number<00:01:11.189> ten<00:01:11.549> had<00:01:11.970> a

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
three compared to the number ten had a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.780 
three compared to the number ten had a
point<00:01:12.420> 76<00:01:13.380> difference<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.010> weekly<00:01:14.310> basis

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
point 76 difference on a weekly basis

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.120 
point 76 difference on a weekly basis
and<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.509> get<00:01:15.659> down<00:01:15.810> three<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.350> ten<00:01:16.560> you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
and as you get down three to ten you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.219 
and as you get down three to ten you
know<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.430> goes<00:01:17.610> from<00:01:17.909> point<00:01:18.540> six<00:01:18.840> point<00:01:19.110> five

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
know it goes from point six point five

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.200 
know it goes from point six point five
point<00:01:19.290> four<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.490> most<00:01:20.729> you're<00:01:20.909> getting<00:01:21.119> is

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
point four so the most you're getting is

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.450 
point four so the most you're getting is
a<00:01:21.240> 2-point<00:01:21.659> difference<00:01:21.840> probably<00:01:22.710> at<00:01:23.040> best

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
a 2-point difference probably at best

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.469 
a 2-point difference probably at best
maybe<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.150> half<00:01:25.040> 2.75<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.150> know<00:01:27.240> some

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
maybe a half 2.75 so you know some

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.700 
maybe a half 2.75 so you know some
people<00:01:27.659> I'd<00:01:27.750> say<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:27.900> really<00:01:28.140> want<00:01:28.409> those<00:01:28.560> two

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
people I'd say I really want those two

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.740 
people I'd say I really want those two
points<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:29.430> what<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.670> did<00:01:29.970> was<00:01:30.509> looked

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
points so then what I did was looked

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.929 
points so then what I did was looked
back<00:01:30.960> at<00:01:31.170> last<00:01:31.470> year's<00:01:31.799> projected<00:01:32.460> top<00:01:32.670> ten
