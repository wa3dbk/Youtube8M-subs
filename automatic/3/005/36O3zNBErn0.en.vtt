00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
deal for about 40 bucks so let's do a

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:59.880 
deal for about 40 bucks so let's do a
cut<00:03:51.260> test<00:03:52.390> we'll<00:03:53.390> do<00:03:53.540> some<00:03:53.720> computer<00:03:54.500> paper

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.230 

very<00:04:00.890> nice<00:04:01.780> as<00:04:02.780> a<00:04:02.840> matter<00:04:03.140> of<00:04:03.260> fact

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
very nice as a matter of fact

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.420 
very nice as a matter of fact
I<00:04:05.410> just<00:04:06.410> might<00:04:06.590> have<00:04:06.620> to<00:04:06.770> send<00:04:07.070> this<00:04:07.190> back

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
I just might have to send this back

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
I just might have to send this back
because<00:04:07.790> it's<00:04:07.970> too<00:04:08.120> sharp<00:04:10.120> so<00:04:11.120> that<00:04:11.150> is<00:04:11.420> a

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
because it's too sharp so that is a

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.270 
because it's too sharp so that is a
first<00:04:11.750> look<00:04:11.840> at<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.260> Kershaw<00:04:12.800> link<00:04:13.690> and<00:04:15.160> it<00:04:16.160> is

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
first look at the Kershaw link and it is

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.270 
first look at the Kershaw link and it is
definitely<00:04:16.489> made<00:04:16.910> in<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.150> USA<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:21.280> it

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
definitely made in the USA and it

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:30.940 
definitely made in the USA and it
deserves<00:04:22.580> a<00:04:22.700> little<00:04:22.820> cowbell<00:04:27.790> knuckle<00:04:28.790> balm
