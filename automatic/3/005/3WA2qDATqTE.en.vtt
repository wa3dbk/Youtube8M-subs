00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.179
 perhaps 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.179
 how 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.150
 welcome to another show today 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.610
 I cook where we are going to be doing 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.380
 a recipe that surely everyone is going to 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.450
 want to perform at home because it's very 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.400
 simple and they will also be able to use 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.080
 ingredients that have already been 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.689
 other preparations this is something very 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.779
 useful that they will be able to apply the day of 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.779
 today 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.000
 let's move on to the first part of the 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.250
 recipe that is the dough the cake dough 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.100
 you are going to find many recipes 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.840
 on the internet or in recipe books and today 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.840
 I 'm going to give you the most classic one 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.920
 call 321 us at this time we are going 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.050
 to have 300 grams of common flour 40 and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.660
 We are going to incorporate 200 grams of 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.590
 butter the butter has to be cold 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.239
 already if you saw the program 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.890
 lemon pay stimuli are going to have 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.410
 mind that the butter when we do 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.510
 Cakes always have to be cold 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.420
 this because it was because we want 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.369
 achieve a brittle mass and not a dough 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.830
 it lasts when we eat our cake 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.630
 then what we are going to achieve with this 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.190
 which is a corner or if not at home 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.830
 they can do it with their hands 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.070
 we're going to quietly sandblast 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.960
 This sandblasting is going to help us 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.119
 waterproof the flour then the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.979
 flour does not develop gluten and we 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.380
 makes the dough brittle 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.259
 exactly what we want to achieve 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.119
 if you want to make a recipe that 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.060
 do not be with butter because they have 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.610
 problems maybe high cholesterol or not 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.189
 they want to consume animal fat can 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.340
 do it replacing the 200 grams of 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.560
 butter for approximately 150 grams 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.600
 of sunflower oil or olive oil 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.700
 you prefer well once 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.399
 we have achieved this sandblasting 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.530
 who see here so it is that the flour already 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.649
 It is waterproofed with our 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.869
 butter we will be able to incorporate 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.939
 egg in this case is the same as them 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.310
 I said before if you do not want 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.590
 incorporate for example buds because 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.690
 have cholesterol problems can 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.480
 do it only with egg whites and 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:17.380
 a little bit of water if what we're going to 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.630
 do is then incorporate the egg 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.960
 for this recipe as we said that it 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.930
 flame 321 let's incorporate an egg 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.320
 then they will be 300 grams of flour 200 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.800
 of butter and an egg at this time 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.620
 let's incorporate the salt and if they want 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.320
 can use pepper that's at ease 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.510
 of each one for this recipe are going to 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.370
 use approximately 5 grams 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.590
 of salt not much more because we are 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.340
 using butter and butter already 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.520
 it's salty, well, we're forming our 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.300
 mass and we 're going to help with the region 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.570
 of the hand that was called loom sector and 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.750
 then without kneading we go forming 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.030
 our mass 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:08.080
 always remember to make it more fascinating 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.020
 knead always let's press and nothing 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.840
 more until we form a mass if 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.420
 you see that the flour needs more 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.819
 hydration can continue to incorporate 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.220
 eggs or be able to incorporate a little 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.620
 water that will also help us see 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.040
 that in this case I'm going to need what 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.890
 what was left of the egg 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.960
 all right 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.819
 when we talk about the stuffing that is what 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.550
 what are we going to do now when 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.530
 we finished our mass I told them 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.380
 that you are surely going to want 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.140
 make this recipe since they will be able to 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.670
 use previous preparations what do you want 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.430
 say this that's why you 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.320
 they made some baked chicken at home or 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.510
 grilled chicken and they were left some 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.310
 chicken dish that after nobody in 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.380
 house wants to eat it because nobody wants 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.270
 eat the good reheated food today 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.459
 let's make a recipe for esther or 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.220
 something new that is going to have a flavor 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.140
 totally different and that you are 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.810
 to be able to add to this recipe and 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.239
 surprise your family or friends well 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.730
 once we achieve this mass 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.739
 you 're going to look like you're untidy 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.900
 but this is how it has to be if you 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.870
 we give more kneaded after we're going to have 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.049
 a very hard mass then once 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.120
 we have this mass we are going to bag 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.040
 and we're going to take it to the cold because 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.270
 you need to rest 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.960
 and we're going to take a little bag and we're going to 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.030
 take to the cold 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.770
 good for our stuffing then 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.780
 we have notice that I have in this 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.300
 case a supreme chicken that is the 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.160
 breast that what we are going to do is already 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.680
 cooked may have stayed with you 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.660
 at home as I mentioned before 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.120
 we are going to cut into tiny cubes 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.130
 because because I'm going to use a mold of 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.780
 cake today that is guys and you in 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.180
 house they are going to make the big cake is not 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.280
 it is necessary for them to cut them so small and 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.349
 in the case that some do not like it 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.090
 too much to feel the chicken cubes 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.889
 You can also have a mixer or a 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.610
 processor what are we going to do 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:09.699
 then it is to cut small cubes 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:13.000
 and we're going to mix it with our green or 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:15.370
 I already I have previously sauteed that 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.439
 you are going to see it here I used the 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.229
 green nothing more than green or so that 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:22.750
 be so heavy sometimes happens that the green 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.939
 or we fall a little heavy or we repeat it 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.560
 So what we do is use only 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:31.400
 the green to make it a little softer 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:34.940
 let's unite the chicken with the green or 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.530
 and what we are going to do now is what 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.500
 that will give us the possibility and the 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:42.680
 leader of our cake that is this is 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.930
 egg and it's cream this in gastronomy we 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.940
 we call bond or link as I said 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.400
 previously also a recipe that already 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:52.220
 it is stipulated that it is one egg per hundred 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.550
 cubic centimeters of cream then what 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:06:00.370
 what we are going to do is break the league 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.370
 egg and unify with the cream 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.759
 we incorporate the ingredients the same 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:07.860
 I repeat again if you do not want 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.259
 Ingesting cream can replace it with 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.820
 milk they put an egg more because 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.910
 Milk is lighter and if not it will not 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.680
 coagulate the cake and use milk 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.460
 which can be skimmed or whole milk 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:24.110
 also to this we are going to incorporate salt 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.110
 and a little pepper 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:29.830
 once we have our leader 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.410
 we beat it only for 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.140
 incorporate salt and pepper and what 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.860
 we unite with our stuffing that already 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.199
 we had here 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.050
 to this you can incorporate that 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:44.819
 this can add the ingredients 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.500
 that they like it same they can do it with 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:49.650
 ham and cheese and also a little bit of 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.479
 green or add tomato that is going to 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.789
 see you at home when you experience 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:55.409
 the recipe well once we have the 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:57.210
 now only remains for us to fill 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:59.610
 wait for it to cool a little bit more 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.469
 our mass to be able to shape it and 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.289
 we are going to see the tips of the neighbors 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:06.569
 let's see what they want to tell us hello 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:08.539
 I am Nestor of Espeleta my advice for 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:11.639
 that the baked potatoes do not stick is 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:13.919
 preheat the oven first after 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:15.560
 a bowl put the potatoes with the seasoning 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:19.340
 they want 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:22.160
 and oil stir and once it's 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.260
 well hot the source put the potatoes 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.060
 and do not touch them until you notice that 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.460
 are well golden or the 6 nicolás 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.380
 neighbor thanks and the secret so that the 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.810
 fried egg come out well redondito is 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:37.270
 put it with the cold oil and it will start to 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.270
 cook it with medium heat 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.820
 do not 

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.180
 to 

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:48.270
 i 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.270
 we're back with more today things
