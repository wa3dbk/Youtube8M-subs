00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
have just used protection and then they

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.410 
have just used protection and then they
could<00:00:21.900> have<00:00:22.020> still<00:00:22.170> come<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.410> Europe<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.420> but

that the cars are on the other side of

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.010 
that the cars are on the other side of
the<00:01:22.939> road<00:01:23.119> like<00:01:23.329> it's<00:01:23.479> not<00:01:23.570> my<00:01:23.750> first<00:01:23.930> rodeo

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
the road like it's not my first rodeo

the road like it's not my first rodeo
but<00:01:24.500> I<00:01:24.649> just<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.460> seems<00:01:25.820> like<00:01:25.970> they<00:01:26.090> come<00:01:26.299> from

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
but I just it seems like they come from

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.090 
but I just it seems like they come from
every<00:01:26.780> direction<00:01:26.929> and<00:01:27.500> then<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.710> cars<00:01:27.920> don't

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
every direction and then the cars don't

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.410 
every direction and then the cars don't
seem<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.429> be<00:01:28.549> parked<00:01:28.789> in<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.090> right<00:01:29.240> direction

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.899 
seem to be parked in the right direction
I<00:01:29.750> just<00:01:29.929> it's<00:01:30.110> confusing<00:01:30.530> as<00:01:30.740> hell<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.159> I<00:01:31.460> just
