00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
game which is great and I always

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.210 
game which is great and I always

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
original game because it just kind of

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.179 
original game because it just kind of
made<00:03:33.659> sense<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.109> me<00:03:34.260> all<00:03:34.620> right<00:03:34.769> so<00:03:34.859> after<00:03:34.979> an

walls<00:03:47.069> they're<00:03:47.310> all<00:03:47.430> lined<00:03:47.669> with<00:03:47.849> shelves

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
walls they're all lined with shelves

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.879 
walls they're all lined with shelves
even<00:03:48.509> though<00:03:48.599> they<00:03:48.750> only<00:03:48.959> seem<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.379> contain<00:03:49.680> a

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
even though they only seem to contain a

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.439 
even though they only seem to contain a
couple<00:03:50.189> of<00:03:50.280> coins<00:03:50.519> and<00:03:50.729> like<00:03:50.849> some<00:03:51.030> books<00:03:51.269> or

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
couple of coins and like some books or

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:52.819 
couple of coins and like some books or
something<00:03:51.629> but<00:03:52.199> you'll<00:03:52.319> notice<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.590> there's

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
something but you'll notice that there's

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.439 
something but you'll notice that there's
no<00:03:52.949> expensive<00:03:53.400> items<00:03:53.759> for<00:03:53.970> sale<00:03:54.000> there's<00:03:54.299> only

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
no expensive items for sale there's only

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.360 
no expensive items for sale there's only
a<00:03:54.540> five<00:03:54.750> cent<00:03:54.989> key<00:03:55.169> no<00:03:55.229> five<00:03:55.439> cents<00:03:55.709> purified<00:03:56.159> I

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
a five cent key no five cents purified I

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.830 
a five cent key no five cents purified I
think<00:03:56.879> that<00:03:56.970> has<00:03:57.120> something<00:03:57.299> to<00:03:57.449> do<00:03:57.629> with<00:03:57.720> the

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
think that has something to do with the

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.689 
think that has something to do with the
donation<00:03:58.319> machine<00:03:58.590> in<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.829> top-left<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.549> way

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
donation machine in the top-left the way

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.039 
donation machine in the top-left the way
the<00:03:59.849> donation<00:04:00.239> machine<00:04:00.449> works<00:04:00.659> is<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.900> can

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
the donation machine works is you can

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.300 
the donation machine works is you can
donate<00:04:01.319> money<00:04:01.379> to<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:01.739> over<00:04:01.859> multiple

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
donate money to it over multiple

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.589 
donate money to it over multiple
playthroughs<00:04:02.579> you'll<00:04:02.939> notice<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.269> started

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
playthroughs you'll notice it started

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:04.999 
playthroughs you'll notice it started
out<00:04:03.720> of<00:04:03.870> five<00:04:04.079> in<00:04:04.259> this<00:04:04.349> video<00:04:04.620> even<00:04:04.859> though

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:05.009 
out of five in this video even though

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:06.319 
out of five in this video even though
this<00:04:05.220> is<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.489> first<00:04:05.699> shop<00:04:05.909> this<00:04:06.090> playthrough

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
this is the first shop this playthrough

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.749 
this is the first shop this playthrough
so<00:04:06.930> as<00:04:07.109> you<00:04:07.259> donate<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.799> it<00:04:07.949> the<00:04:08.099> coin<00:04:08.370> counter

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:08.759 
so as you donate to it the coin counter

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:10.309 
so as you donate to it the coin counter
on<00:04:08.879> it<00:04:08.970> gets<00:04:09.120> higher<00:04:09.329> and<00:04:09.599> you<00:04:09.959> unlock<00:04:10.290> new

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
on it gets higher and you unlock new

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.110 
on it gets higher and you unlock new
items<00:04:10.919> and<00:04:11.129> can<00:04:11.250> increase<00:04:11.430> the<00:04:11.669> chance<00:04:11.879> for

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
items and can increase the chance for

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.729 
items and can increase the chance for
more<00:04:12.299> items<00:04:12.479> to<00:04:12.689> be<00:04:12.840> available<00:04:13.049> in<00:04:13.349> the<00:04:13.409> shop

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
more items to be available in the shop

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.499 
more items to be available in the shop
the<00:04:13.919> higher<00:04:14.099> this<00:04:14.280> counter<00:04:14.609> gets<00:04:14.849> so<00:04:15.209> even

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:15.509 
the higher this counter gets so even

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:16.370 
the higher this counter gets so even
though<00:04:15.599> the<00:04:15.750> counter<00:04:15.959> is<00:04:16.049> low<00:04:16.169> right<00:04:16.349> now

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
though the counter is low right now

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.749 
though the counter is low right now
there's<00:04:16.709> still<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:16.889> chance<00:04:17.099> that<00:04:17.370> four<00:04:17.549> or<00:04:17.609> five

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 
there's still a chance that four or five

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.039 
there's still a chance that four or five
items<00:04:17.909> could<00:04:18.209> be<00:04:18.299> available<00:04:18.479> in<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.840> shop

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
items could be available in the shop

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.749 
items could be available in the shop
it's<00:04:19.470> just<00:04:19.739> more<00:04:19.949> likely<00:04:20.220> that<00:04:20.489> that<00:04:20.639> many

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:20.759 
it's just more likely that that many

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.339 
it's just more likely that that many
items<00:04:20.880> will<00:04:21.180> be<00:04:21.209> available<00:04:21.329> once<00:04:22.109> you<00:04:22.229> get

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
items will be available once you get

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.540 
items will be available once you get
that<00:04:22.440> camera<00:04:22.650> higher<00:04:22.919> as<00:04:23.159> far<00:04:23.370> as<00:04:23.460> my

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
that camera higher as far as my

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.080 
that camera higher as far as my
understanding<00:04:23.669> goes<00:04:24.300> of<00:04:24.599> the<00:04:24.810> donor

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
understanding goes of the donor

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.150 
understanding goes of the donor
machine<00:04:25.480> anyway<00:04:25.810> so<00:04:26.199> next<00:04:26.380> up<00:04:26.530> Daniele<00:04:26.889> enters

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
machine anyway so next up Daniele enters

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.379 
machine anyway so next up Daniele enters
the<00:04:27.310> boss<00:04:27.460> room<00:04:27.639> and<00:04:27.820> she's<00:04:27.940> up<00:04:28.060> against

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
the boss room and she's up against

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:29.730 
the boss room and she's up against
Engels<00:04:28.750> so<00:04:28.870> we<00:04:28.960> can't<00:04:29.110> assume<00:04:29.290> that<00:04:29.350> Dingell

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
Engels so we can't assume that Dingell

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.680 
Engels so we can't assume that Dingell
is<00:04:29.830> a<00:04:29.889> basement<00:04:30.400> boss<00:04:30.580> we<00:04:31.030> have<00:04:31.060> seen<00:04:31.419> this<00:04:31.510> guy

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
and he could spawn littler enemies I

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.810 
and he could spawn littler enemies I
believe<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:47.860> littler<00:04:48.190> enemies<00:04:48.520> are<00:04:48.639> called

one or two at a time also I did notice

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.400 
one or two at a time also I did notice
that<00:04:52.270> dingo<00:04:52.660> seems<00:04:52.870> to<00:04:52.990> be<00:04:53.080> completely

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
that dingo seems to be completely

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.140 
that dingo seems to be completely
unaffected<00:04:53.800> by<00:04:54.040> concussive<00:04:54.460> shots<00:04:54.820> he<00:04:54.970> gets

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
unaffected by concussive shots he gets

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.850 
unaffected by concussive shots he gets
hit<00:04:55.449> by<00:04:55.479> a<00:04:55.570> number<00:04:55.810> of<00:04:55.960> them<00:04:56.110> and<00:04:56.260> even<00:04:56.770> though

hit by a number of them and even though

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.740 
hit by a number of them and even though
the<00:04:56.979> little<00:04:57.250> dips<00:04:57.430> are<00:04:57.580> getting<00:04:57.850> confused<00:04:58.360> he
