00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.950
 already then no makeup tutorial this 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.119
 once inspired by a trick I saw 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:23.060
 during the world this year was 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.650
 ten days ago it is worn by 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.539
 celine and commerce no during 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.920
 the exhibition but on the red carpet 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.410
 during the evening but it doesn't last 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.260
 transmission I believe he has it 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.790
 we changed it a little then the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.909
 makeup with this very strong eyeliner 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.489
 I liked the stretched pink lips 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:49.830
 really very much because not there 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.890
 he wants so much is certainly effective but 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.129
 at the same time it is not is not complicated 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.330
 it doesn't take so many products 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.019
 there were several tricks that I have 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:04.559
 struck also want was very velino 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.909
 but I have this probably among all 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.720
 those I saw this was that 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.060
 which I like best was a little more 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.670
 particular compared to the others 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:20.369
 yes she very pretty then purchase 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.619
 this perfect round face but usually 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.380
 the sky is perfect I find it to be 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.380
 really really very very nice 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.170
 beautiful and very young so I find it 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.180
 I find it very nice even during 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.909
 the exhibition was very nice 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.369
 trick that is the trick that is at stake 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.820
 wore it as usual you will find it 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.090
 list of all products used on 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.090
 blog 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.549
 so now I leave you to the tutorial 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.549
 first thing he did 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.010
 I begin to understand the dark circles this is 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.490
 the 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:04.590
 no with seeler doctor's advice 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:09.750
 perricone and after I apply a base she has 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:12.360
 the face the opaque base but then I stretched out 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.110
 an informative that I remain paco of course 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:20.510
 then I walked the face is fixed the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.510
 base with powdered cane powder 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.959
 to get an eyeliner line of 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.819
 straight pencil to do it the most way 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.720
 fast and easy as possible 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:50.370
 use a piece of cardboard a 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.319
 business card a scotch 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.069
 preferably the paper tape e 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:03:00.250
 go and use maybe try first 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:03.010
 and then lai laner or la 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.870
 pencil and a pencil I chose one 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.150
 rather soft pencil also because it is 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.150
 simple and easy to estimate 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.690
 on the eyelid or applied a 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.690
 very simple matt black eyeshadow 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.370
 to get an effect a line more 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.460
 pointy I used the l from 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.190
 liquid the important to eliminate well 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:15.140
 excess is staying as usual a lot 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:20.150
 be careful if you want you can use one 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.410
 pencil a little more rigid than that 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.840
 used until now I said e 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:28.300
 soft so a little more rigid is good 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.300
 pointy, of course, don't get hurt 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:24.940
 I use the duo's bronzer 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.920
 with touring del elf I use it 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.950
 to do some with turin obviously 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.260
 she has a darker complexion has one 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.020
 olive complexion also blush ago 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.540
 part of the same spoon and is a 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.889
 I also apply blush very much 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:46.400
 Delicate is a peach-pink blush 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:51.699
 the lipstick is pink and above applied a 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.699
 gloss of the same very shiny color 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.990
 and it's all as usual I hope there is 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.990
 liked a kiss bye
