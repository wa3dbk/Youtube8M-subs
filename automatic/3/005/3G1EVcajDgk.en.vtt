00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.090
 in the back legs are made 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.040
 exactly the same as those of crawl 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.380
 exactly the same only if in the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.660
 key we said that the kick is given here 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.330
 down on the back obviously the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.430
 kicks we are giving them upwards 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.580
 to review quickly we look at the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.130
 kick 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.130
 instead of very broad 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.679
 small little amplitude many frequencies 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.910
 and the legs would go is to pull towards a 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.260
 shovel 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.260
 they will not be so 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.610
 not only be able to do it 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.080
 without getting out 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.810
 but from below we go 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.000
 with quite frequent 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.000
 time for public you know 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.510
 in the leg they go a little bit he pulls me towards 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.270
 inside Colombian because because if I 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.460
 I'm usually kicking the trend of 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.490
 foot is make a small movement 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.010
 external rotation and the water is going to come down 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.660
 a splash I tell you Asians different 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.790
 I would have been exaggerating what would a psaltery 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.190
 for here and another for yard one makes 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.790
 the victim even for that reason it took a 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.790
 little in 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.049
 here I am talking too much about the 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.790
 knee but we remember with control that 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.409
 the kick is given with the race and the 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.409
 knees are populated passively 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.439
 also the leg is turned away from me 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.210
 just like in the chlorine and the kick there 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.039
 an ankle hyperextension but that 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.740
 is what characterizes more to the back 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.479
 is the extension 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.330
 if we imagine that when 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.580
 we have our backs the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.970
 good here comes the table we have 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.330
 include the surface 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.450
 when I cry the kick 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.850
 the leg knew because I know that the foot 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.400
 exceeds the surface of the water but the 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.680
 leg the knee does not get to contact 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.090
 with a table 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.190
 that although it gives a little surface 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.230
 of water penalty I give the katana and the 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.470
 foot goes out in the leg stays with him 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.240
 so that's why the first exercise that 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.610
 let's practice for after throwing the 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.760
 back leg kick is a bar no 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.590
 face up with relaxed arms 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.150
 table that we will take it like this with this 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.310
 grip with the arms stretched not 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.739
 stretched like that here relaxed so 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.200
 that the table you want on top of 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.769
 knee and so when we go giving the 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.450
 back legs like 'the fixing that 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.510
 the leg splashes the foot in saltillo 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.450
 but the knee is not hitting the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.159
 table that this would be what we would be 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.690
 we carry like this when we go back 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.670
 backward 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.580
 so we would have pain and all 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.540
 the wrong table the bad thing as it 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.819
 should 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.310
 when we see the kick 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.730
 if it is on the surface of the water the 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.730
 table 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.319
 for my appeal 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.800
 it's wrong this would be fine with the feet 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:37.300
 a little in adduction inwards to 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.300
 create just one jump and do not go there 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.820
 so that I go 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.640
 they do not have to do that with the 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.640
 navy skin 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.969
 to call 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.969
 in the leg together of the highest load 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.010
 and the chicks 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:18.320
 criteria and continue on the page 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.320
 but we go 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.419
 so that the table is on top of 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.800
 knees for now and just as there was 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.800
 time legs of spain
