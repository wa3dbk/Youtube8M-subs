00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
game we're going to look at a game

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000 
game we're going to look at a game
pretty<00:00:14.210> much<00:00:14.300> every<00:00:14.750> single<00:00:15.080> day<00:00:15.260> through<00:00:15.620> III

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
pretty much every single day through III

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.070 
pretty much every single day through III
a<00:00:16.250> game<00:00:16.760> that<00:00:16.939> just<00:00:17.390> goes<00:00:17.630> out<00:00:17.810> there<00:00:17.869> and

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
a game that just goes out there and

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.990 
a game that just goes out there and
maybe<00:00:18.679> shows<00:00:18.949> us<00:00:19.130> something<00:00:19.340> that<00:00:19.490> we<00:00:19.640> didn't

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
maybe shows us something that we didn't

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.340 
maybe shows us something that we didn't
expect<00:00:20.300> or<00:00:20.510> just<00:00:20.690> something<00:00:20.840> we're<00:00:21.080> super

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
expect or just something we're super

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.019 
expect or just something we're super
excited<00:00:21.410> for<00:00:21.860> and<00:00:22.070> I<00:00:22.100> think<00:00:22.130> right<00:00:22.520> now<00:00:22.760> that

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
excited for and I think right now that

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.660 
excited for and I think right now that
there<00:00:23.210> is<00:00:23.420> a<00:00:23.660> game<00:00:24.140> whose<00:00:24.500> its<00:00:24.949> reflections

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
there is a game whose its reflections

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.000 
there is a game whose its reflections
are<00:00:25.850> sort<00:00:26.090> of<00:00:26.210> mirrored<00:00:26.960> in<00:00:27.080> the<00:00:27.109> tired<00:00:27.710> eyes

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
are sort of mirrored in the tired eyes

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.849 
are sort of mirrored in the tired eyes
of<00:00:28.220> e<00:00:28.310> three<00:00:28.340> journalists<00:00:29.180> everywhere<00:00:29.600> and

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
mixture of just the lighting engine that

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.419 
mixture of just the lighting engine that
dice<00:01:07.069> has<00:01:07.459> basically<00:01:08.709> gently<00:01:09.709> massaged<00:01:10.130> and

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:37.669 
occlusion and what looks like PBR

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:40.989 
occlusion and what looks like PBR
lighting<00:01:38.240> there<00:01:38.929> is<00:01:39.200> some<00:01:39.499> next-level<00:01:39.999> shit

quality<00:03:31.830> at<00:03:32.310> times<00:03:32.700> made<00:03:33.060> me<00:03:33.239> think<00:03:33.570> that<00:03:33.660> that

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
quality at times made me think that that

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
quality at times made me think that that
was<00:03:33.989> probably<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:35.540> pc<00:03:36.540> being<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:37.440> know<00:03:37.530> you're

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
was probably a pc being you know you're

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.680 
was probably a pc being you know you're
running<00:03:38.340> those<00:03:38.489> levels<00:03:38.850> however<00:03:39.030> at<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.660> same

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
running those levels however at the same

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.800 
running those levels however at the same
time<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.770> way<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:41.040> game<00:03:41.280> is<00:03:41.310> set<00:03:41.730> up<00:03:42.000> much<00:03:42.780> of

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
time the way the game is set up much of

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.660 
time the way the game is set up much of
the<00:03:43.080> battles<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.830> where<00:03:44.100> you're<00:03:44.280> doing<00:03:44.550> it

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
the battles and where you're doing it

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.800 
the battles and where you're doing it
and<00:03:44.730> how<00:03:44.880> you're<00:03:45.090> doing<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.450> is<00:03:45.540> sort<00:03:45.750> of

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
and how you're doing it is sort of

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.140 
and how you're doing it is sort of
closed<00:03:46.230> off<00:03:46.620> especially<00:03:46.950> in<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.940> one

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
closed off especially in that one

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.880 
closed off especially in that one
particular<00:03:48.270> in<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.900> snow<00:03:49.140> level<00:03:49.380> that's

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
particular in the snow level that's

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.010 
particular in the snow level that's
probably<00:03:50.489> console<00:03:51.150> looking<00:03:51.570> i<00:03:51.750> would<00:03:51.900> assume

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
probably console looking i would assume

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.590 
probably console looking i would assume
that<00:03:52.260> consoles<00:03:52.830> can<00:03:53.010> can<00:03:53.459> probably<00:03:54.030> get<00:03:54.239> close

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
that consoles can can probably get close

that<00:04:29.430> they

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
that they

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.250 
that they
really<00:04:30.180> know<00:04:30.390> what<00:04:30.570> they're<00:04:30.660> doing<00:04:30.990> and<00:04:31.110> I
