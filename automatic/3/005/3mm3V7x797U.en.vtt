00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:11.309
 Good evening everyone, today I want 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.500
 demonstrate how to sharpen a knife in 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.699
 In this case, the kitchens and roots are short 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.869
 amidst the length 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.270
 state of sharpness 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.730
 today we will test it on 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:32.340
 hair will cut the hair of course here 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:35.850
 that's all I'll explain on what I sharpen 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.719
 tool want to draw your attention i 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.460
 do not use 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.980
 super large abrasive materials 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:48.239
 here it is corundum don't take it off 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.579
 you can see an example of the condition of the eyes it is grain 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:57.020
 if you translate into a waterproof skin there 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:01:00.420
 grid ah about 800 grit better longer and 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:04.350
 slower but cleaner surface 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.790
 corundum burrs I brought to 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:13.439
 aluminum oxide stone visible metal 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.509
 aluminum oxide shines such a grain in it 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:22.740
 I do not know here on the box that's all 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:25.380
 written sharpening sharp and stone 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.540
 aluminum oxide unity she here 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.750
 nine seconds on it 9 seconds what is this 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.909
 grain I do not know the whole and offhand 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.369
 to the touch 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:44.520
 Well , somewhere and a half thousand will be new to 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.180
 deburring but qualitatively 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.000
 further here this one i don't know it 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.700
 and in the previous video I said that 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.790
 stayed from the test for cats bombed in 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.670
 it's in the summer kitchen lying on the windowsill 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.479
 Well, the grain is very small so to speak 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.210
 offhand I can not somewhere 1000 door 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.479
 maybe 2 and a half maximum 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.000
 and straightening razor that's clean 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.319
 black is also slightly shown here on 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:22.510
 this surface, I brought well no more 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:27.360
 three and a half thousand by grain if 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:32.380
 you can zoom football well 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:36.940
 in the light you can see yes well three and a half 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:41.230
 Thousands will be no more, and then I Maslow 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.390
 little by little here belt me 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.450
 light green comprehended and there is no 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.880
 only this is green 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.500
 very little I have not sold where not 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:57.730
 and black and green 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:01.830
 belts here it is black green this me 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.930
 a lot and it is sold in the markets 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.410
 light green no that's just green and 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.860
 all long well, probably honed knife, I 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:15.730
 it is not strong tupil well on the new lifted 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.489
 skinned burr removed and straightened and 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.329
 Now let's see here and keep hair 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:27.010
 hands did not want to lose already started cutting 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:32.019
 in response to the edge bent over to 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:35.890
 you can see how he cuts his hair is now dark 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:39.730
 so you have to look at the light not 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.570
 On the daytime I can see perfectly I am a little bit 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.570
 move 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:51.140
 visible on a little bit move 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:04.569
 you can see what is done with the hair 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.840
 can somehow carriers see well ok and 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:13.150
 which is great and now let's try 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:17.650
 now we no longer chopped the voice of his film 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:22.800
 we cut as sausage only firm and very 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:30.630
 thin cornea went it by itself 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:30.630
 firmly here is the kind of cut along the hair 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:38.910
 Now we will suffer further from the floor 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:47.370
 one 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:54.060
 see yes here 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:54.060
 zigzag turned on 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:08.620
 here still cut grows here still 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:15.060
 perepalo vinyl let's cut it even 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.060
 along went see can be seen along went 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:24.999
 just fucked even here's another slice 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:28.860
 took off now you will see now you all 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:34.300
 see here well and the last 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:36.719
 Here chips chips remove it though 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.860
 for all that I don't have 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:40.770
 devices can not show me 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.330
 there is a right to doubt 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.750
 for sharpening knives 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:50.129
 homemade there are some whether there is no branded 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:54.849
 i have japanese water stones 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:57.300
 small and super small but if a person has 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:01.439
 have patience you can achieve everything 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:04.800
 neatness and patience to hand was 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:07.919
 clear that's who drinks 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.930
 never to the extent that no sharpening 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:13.810
 those pens will shake and 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:18.580
 those who smoke well this thing is an amateur 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:24.460
 just judging by myself if the hands go stand 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:28.960
 clear and smooth movements 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:32.050
 everything will turn out so that if anyone 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.629
 need such sharp knives 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.539
 yes for such a knife is very expensive 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:42.819
 because it is manual labor it 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:44.310
 hard work here and have 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:50.500
 to tinker 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:52.029
 on homemade grinders there 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.939
 on the internet is putting a lot now 

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:57.939
 people do good work if 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:07:01.810
 how Kulibin's head thinks and hands 

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:04.389
 Well done workshops well maybe I 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.269
 time with the mass, too, is not there 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:09.879
 one person liked 

00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:12.849
 how do i show but i will 

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:13.959
 train there girlfriends manifest 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:16.599
 do by hand 

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:20.649
 Well, you see the quality if you can 

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:27.449
 the box itself is the angle of sharpening 

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:34.419
 not as big somewhere around 24 degrees 25 

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:35.789
 behind . 24 25 degrees that no less braid 

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:40.959
 hair 

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:42.549
 if I sharpen the razor, I will not 

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:46.319
 even advise someone to shave 

00:07:42.549 --> 00:07:51.729
 Who needs such sharp knives? 

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:54.459
 down below I will give comments but I do 

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:56.349
 I live in Crimea, I sit, then I will change everything 

00:07:54.459 --> 00:07:57.639
 if it is not enough the place changes 

00:07:56.349 --> 00:07:59.739
 good luck to all of you 

00:07:57.639 --> 00:08:02.489
 thank you for watching goodbye to everyone 

00:07:59.739 --> 00:08:02.489
 road
