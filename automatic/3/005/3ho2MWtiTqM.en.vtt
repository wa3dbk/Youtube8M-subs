 state of são paulo to achieve the 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.750
 the student needs to have good grades 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.329

 opportunity this year more than 500 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.430
 students and teachers do not have the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.490
 opportunity to exchange information and 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.700
 for the United States or England 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.549
 new zealand beyond students without 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.900
 teachers will also be able to travel to 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.030
 study English 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.430
 the project started three years ago and already 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.130
 the trip for a thousand students and 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.860
 200 teachers in addition to the possibility of 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.140
 to travel and learn the exchange can be 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.930
 a professional passport because today 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.090
 days who knows English at least 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.220
 basic you enter the market of 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.990
 job 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.630
 in the cultural newspaper website you 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.909
 informs on the selective process of 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.600
 Technical schools in the state of são paulo 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.869
 the address is the most com dot com 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.540
 culture newspaper bar in the first game 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.969
 of the new selection led by Felipão 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.100
 against a team of tradition like the 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.820
 until the draw was not a 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.310
 bad result 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.710
 the selection scored first in porto nismo 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.880
 fred who kicked a volley a leftover 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.880
 of ball and made 1 to 0 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.510
 still in the first half Brazil arrived 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.819
 the second goal when neymar led 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.370
 defender to the left and came back 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.540
 for oscar coming in on the right 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.280
 a beautiful goal 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.280
 brazil 2 and italy 0 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.489
 result somewhat misleading by the domain 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.400
 Italian 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.280
 in the second half everything changed at eight 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.670
 minutes of rossi touched the corner at fault 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.670
 of defense 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.160
 and three minutes later balotelli the 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.740
 moody 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:04.130
 with a beautiful kick from outside the area 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:06.020
 after all brazil 2 and italy of bon jovi 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.240
 arriving here at the end of our newspaper 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.680
 I would like to have a quick time here. 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.680
 We want to talk about it, joão. 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.350
 speaks so that it is unsustainable or 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.060
 the situation if the feliciano will fall that is 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.950
 that Member who took over the 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.590
 human rights and I would like to 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.990
 put it here for you if this situation 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.250
 of the national congress that we see 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.170
 more and more as the ovary says here 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.200
 in the newspaper are with their backs to the 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.630
 society, and so on if this lack of 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.340
 representativeness that we have 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.320
 if this in any way threatens the 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.940
 our democratic state 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.890
 then certainly a distortion in the 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.080
 representation of the congress by the fact 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.510
 that we have a political system of 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.269
 high permeability of economic power 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.830
 already so that you can choose one 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.170
 congressman today a federal deputy 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.420
 for less than R $ 5 million is 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.400
 completely impossible then I see who 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.370
 has R $ 5 million for the campaign 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.500
 whether you open a process of 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.230
 permeability of power interference 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.150
 produces profound distortions 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.970
 for example at the beginning of the new 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.860
 Republic or 86 for example is still 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.510
 campaigns may not have been 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.700
 so expensive you can find in the 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.410
 trade union congress you can 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.330
 meet the teachers in the forest 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.700
 fernandes was a federal deputy 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.070
 today you are completely impossible is 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.800
 completely impossible then be you 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.169
 has a situation where there is a 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.300
 imperfect democracy of Brazil coming from 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.220
 its deep permeability of power 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.169
 and that this lack of 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.180
 representativeness we feel that 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.400
 these are those people there 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.070
 parliamentarians they do not speak to our 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.660
 Favors are not our door I'm up to 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.940
 I wanted to make a suggestion for this 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.470
 the issue of human rights because 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.540
 once again homosexuals are 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.979
 becoming hostages of both attacks 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.780
 when issues 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.620
 fundamental homophobia within this 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.960
 Shepherd 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.460
 I would suggest homosexuals what they 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.720
 clearly demonstrate what is your strength 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.970
 politics 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.970
 they vote for homosexual candidates 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.430
 a bench is created to show 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.140
 that parties can not negotiate 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.040
 can transform these and the entire population 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:18.530
 and hostage from panic to conservative follies 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.370
 of certain parts of society 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.440
 Brazilian 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.090
 thank you very much for the presence and 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.010
 the subject has come to an end here yet 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.540
 Give cloth to mango, we can talk. 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.310
 much about it 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.740
 Let's end by saying that 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.430
 after the surprises in the newsroom 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.200
 the inep the research institute 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.720
 educational programs responsible for the 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.270
 suggests that you should void the 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.400
 and leave the topic proposed in the 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.070
 last enem was candidate wrote 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.170
 instant noodle recipe and hymn 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.720
 of the palm trees in the middle of the 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.300
 so they had enough mark to 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.740
 To be approved, our good night goes to 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.940
 The one who takes the teaching follows her until tomorrow in 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.669
 portuguese class 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.220
 I was five years old or maybe 16 I started 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.590
 I learned to write after the spelling 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.320
 essays for our teacher joy 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.720
 in the morning 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.690
 It took me a while to choose a theme but 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.520
 I used to travel and on those trips 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:17.490
 character arose thought felt that 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.860
 They would cry and smile around me. 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.580
 you release a birthday machine 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.380
 write 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.730
 I felt like a good journalist before 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.730
 that neither my mother
