back there now this Nash Nalu 11:6 has a

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.109 
back there now this Nash Nalu 11:6 has a
lot<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.680> what<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:29.010> call<00:00:29.039> rocker<00:00:29.550> that's<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
lot of what we call rocker that's the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.640 
lot of what we call rocker that's the
amount<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.390> bend<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.080> bottom<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
amount of bend in the bottom of the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.680 
amount of bend in the bottom of the
board<00:00:31.890> or<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.070> natural<00:00:32.520> curve<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.390> can<00:00:33.510> see

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
board or the natural curve you can see

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.090 
board or the natural curve you can see
towards<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> back<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> board<00:00:34.770> how<00:00:34.980> it

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
towards the back of the board how it

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.370 
towards the back of the board how it
rises<00:00:35.640> pretty<00:00:35.940> far<00:00:36.270> up<00:00:36.510> off<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.840> grass<00:00:37.050> there

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
rises pretty far up off the grass there

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.959 
rises pretty far up off the grass there
that<00:00:37.829> means<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> board<00:00:38.489> has<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> lot<00:00:38.850> of

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
that means that the board has a lot of

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.610 
that means that the board has a lot of
tail<00:00:39.210> rocker<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.930> that's<00:00:40.170> really<00:00:40.379> going<00:00:40.559> to

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
tail rocker and that's really going to

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.080 
tail rocker and that's really going to
help<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> board<00:00:41.160> turn<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> surf

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
help the board turn in the surf

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.779 
help the board turn in the surf
situation<00:00:42.840> overall<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.219> board<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.579> flat

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
situation overall the board is flat

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.160 
situation overall the board is flat
towards<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> middle<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> board<00:00:46.020> which

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
towards the middle of the board which

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.260 
towards the middle of the board which
makes<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.500> great<00:00:46.770> for<00:00:46.829> flat<00:00:47.280> water<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:48.120> going

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
makes it great for flat water it's going

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.940 
makes it great for flat water it's going
to<00:00:48.329> give<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> board<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.899> lot<00:00:49.079> more<00:00:49.350> Glide

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
to give the board a lot more Glide

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.770 
to give the board a lot more Glide
but<00:00:50.340> as<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.789> come<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> nose<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.600> board

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
but as you come to the nose of the board

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.810 
but as you come to the nose of the board
you<00:00:52.320> do<00:00:52.500> see<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> generous<00:00:53.250> amount<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.640> what<00:00:53.789> we

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
you do see a generous amount of what we

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.970 
you do see a generous amount of what we
call<00:00:53.940> nose<00:00:54.420> rocker<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.079> again<00:00:55.620> that's<00:00:55.829> going

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
call nose rocker and again that's going

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.950 
call nose rocker and again that's going
to<00:00:56.039> help<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.640> surf<00:00:56.879> situation<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.809> way

to help you in a surf situation that way

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.599 
to help you in a surf situation that way
the<00:00:58.109> nose<00:00:58.320> doesn't<00:00:58.649> dive<00:00:58.920> into<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.309> water<00:01:01.609> so

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
the nose doesn't dive into the water so

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.340 
the nose doesn't dive into the water so
just<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.969> all<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.449> Nash<00:01:03.629> boards<00:01:04.140> the

okay so here we are at the vehicle and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.679 
okay so here we are at the vehicle and
on<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.070> model<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> car<00:01:24.000> we<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
on this model of the car we have the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.710 
on this model of the car we have the
thule<00:01:25.140> aero<00:01:25.409> bar<00:01:25.830> system<00:01:26.159> which<00:01:26.820> reduces<00:01:27.360> drag

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
thule aero bar system which reduces drag

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.510 
thule aero bar system which reduces drag
on<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> highway<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.560> also<00:01:28.770> reduces<00:01:29.009> noise

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
on the highway and it also reduces noise

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.890 
on the highway and it also reduces noise
which<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.820> great<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.360> you're<00:01:30.479> doing<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.720> lot<00:01:30.869> of

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
which is great if you're doing a lot of

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.780 
which is great if you're doing a lot of
highway<00:01:31.320> driving<00:01:31.619> especially<00:01:32.549> when<00:01:32.670> you

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
highway driving especially when you

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.670 
highway driving especially when you
don't<00:01:33.000> have<00:01:33.150> boards<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.630> top<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:34.290> allows<00:01:34.530> you

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
don't have boards on top it allows you

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.800 
don't have boards on top it allows you
to<00:01:34.799> keep<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.100> rack<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.970> roof<00:01:36.150> without<00:01:36.630> it

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
to keep the rack on the roof without it

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.870 
to keep the rack on the roof without it
being<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.110> nuisance<00:01:37.290> ur<00:01:37.740> just<00:01:38.250> making<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.700> lot<00:01:38.850> of

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.149 
being a nuisance ur just making a lot of
noise<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.900> when<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.170> purchase<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.650> system<00:01:41.009> like

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
noise so when you purchase a system like

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.800 
noise so when you purchase a system like
this<00:01:41.400> you'll<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.670> looking<00:01:42.060> for<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.329> Aero<00:01:42.540> bar

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
on the arrow bar system as you can see

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.520 
on the arrow bar system as you can see
from<00:02:01.790> our<00:02:01.880> setup<00:02:02.300> here<00:02:02.330> we<00:02:02.690> just<00:02:02.870> have<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.290> kind

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
from our setup here we just have to kind

arrow pads on top of our bar setup and
that's<00:02:06.170> going<00:02:06.320> to<00:02:06.410> be<00:02:06.530> more<00:02:06.770> than<00:02:06.979> sufficient

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
that's going to be more than sufficient

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.850 
that's going to be more than sufficient
for<00:02:07.670> most<00:02:07.970> of<00:02:08.119> our<00:02:08.209> carrying<00:02:08.660> needs<00:02:08.959> tool<00:02:09.619> it

does manufacture an SUV carrying system

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.949 
does manufacture an SUV carrying system
which<00:02:13.280> works<00:02:13.580> great<00:02:13.760> but<00:02:14.480> if<00:02:14.570> you're<00:02:14.690> looking

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
which works great but if you're looking

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.480 
which works great but if you're looking
to<00:02:15.110> save<00:02:15.320> money<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.890> you're<00:02:16.010> looking<00:02:16.310> for

simplicity just to put the pads on top
of<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.310> bar<00:02:19.520> is<00:02:19.760> probably<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.480> system<00:02:20.840> for

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
of the bar is probably the system for

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.590 
of the bar is probably the system for
you<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:21.800> there's<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.490> whole<00:02:22.700> bunch<00:02:22.730> of<00:02:23.090> rumors

you so there's a whole bunch of rumors
and<00:02:24.140> ideas<00:02:24.890> on<00:02:25.100> what's<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.459> most<00:02:25.640> aerodynamic

way to mount an SUV on top of the roof

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.760 
way to mount an SUV on top of the roof
but<00:02:29.120> generally<00:02:29.900> speaking<00:02:29.930> if<00:02:30.380> you<00:02:30.470> put<00:02:30.650> the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
but generally speaking if you put the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.860 
but generally speaking if you put the
board<00:02:30.980> upside<00:02:31.489> down<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.390> thin<00:02:32.630> box

board upside down and the thin box

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.750 
board upside down and the thin box
towards<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.410> back<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.920> car<00:02:34.190> you're<00:02:34.610> going

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
towards the back of the car you're going

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
towards the back of the car you're going
to<00:02:34.850> get<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.180> decent<00:02:35.750> enough<00:02:36.170> gas<00:02:36.440> mileage<00:02:36.980> so

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
to get a decent enough gas mileage so

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.030 
to get a decent enough gas mileage so
I'll<00:02:38.780> go<00:02:38.900> ahead<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.230> just<00:02:39.260> slip<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.680> board<00:02:39.890> up

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
I'll go ahead and just slip the board up

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.699 
I'll go ahead and just slip the board up
on<00:02:40.220> its<00:02:40.400> back<00:02:43.720> I'm<00:02:44.720> gonna<00:02:44.900> rest<00:02:45.110> it<00:02:45.230> on<00:02:45.350> top<00:02:45.530> of

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
on its back I'm gonna rest it on top of

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.790 
on its back I'm gonna rest it on top of
the<00:02:45.800> bars<00:02:46.040> here<00:02:48.130> Center<00:02:49.130> it

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.160 

okay<00:02:52.520> so<00:02:52.610> now<00:02:52.850> you<00:02:52.910> may<00:02:53.150> be<00:02:53.180> wondering<00:02:53.360> where

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
okay so now you may be wondering where

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.260 
okay so now you may be wondering where
along<00:02:54.710> the<00:02:55.010> car<00:02:55.250> do<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:55.430> line<00:02:55.700> up<00:02:55.730> this<00:02:55.970> board

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
along the car do I line up this board

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.480 
along the car do I line up this board
for<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.540> best<00:02:56.720> balance<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.890> way<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.100> test

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
for the best balance and the way to test

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.460 
for the best balance and the way to test
that<00:02:58.730> is<00:02:59.240> really<00:02:59.540> just<00:02:59.720> walk<00:02:59.960> towards<00:03:00.350> the

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
that is really just walk towards the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.860 
that is really just walk towards the
back<00:03:00.680> of<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.950> board<00:03:01.160> on<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.430> car<00:03:01.840> make<00:03:02.840> sure

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
back of the board on the car make sure

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.860 
back of the board on the car make sure
that<00:03:03.110> it's<00:03:03.200> lined<00:03:03.350> up<00:03:03.470> straight<00:03:04.750> down<00:03:05.750> the

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
that it's lined up straight down the

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.340 
that it's lined up straight down the
antenna<00:03:06.170> here<00:03:07.510> line<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.660> board<00:03:08.870> up<00:03:08.990> straight

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
antenna here line the board up straight

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.170 
antenna here line the board up straight
and<00:03:09.560> see<00:03:09.770> how<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:09.950> board<00:03:10.280> balance<00:03:10.670> is<00:03:10.820> on<00:03:10.910> top

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
and see how the board balance is on top

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.290 
and see how the board balance is on top
of<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.420> roof<00:03:11.630> if<00:03:12.110> I<00:03:12.260> can<00:03:12.470> pick<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.710> up<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:13.610> push

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
of the roof if I can pick it up and push

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.110 
of the roof if I can pick it up and push
it<00:03:14.450> down<00:03:14.480> with<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.620> same<00:03:15.860> amount<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.340> weight

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
it down with the same amount of weight

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.360 
it down with the same amount of weight
the<00:03:17.570> board's<00:03:17.900> generally<00:03:18.410> balanced<00:03:18.890> so<00:03:19.310> I'm

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
the board's generally balanced so I'm

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.130 
the board's generally balanced so I'm
going<00:03:19.520> to<00:03:19.580> grab<00:03:19.760> some<00:03:19.790> two<00:03:20.180> kind<00:03:20.480> straps<00:03:20.930> from

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
going to grab some two kind straps from

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.710 
going to grab some two kind straps from
the<00:03:21.320> back<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.740> car<00:03:21.950> here<00:03:25.150> we<00:03:26.150> use<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.450> kind

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
the back of the car here we use the kind
