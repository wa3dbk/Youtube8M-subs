00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.020
 the municipality of arroio of the rats to 50 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.510
 kilometers of porto alegre is one of the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.679
 major producers of watermelon 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.019
 state 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.929
 the area planted is 400 hectares and 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.900
 production is 12 thousand tons this year 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.050
 we are experiencing a crop failure in 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.330
 around 50% so today estimates second 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.730
 choose six thousand tons until the end 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.179
 of the year at harvest and what are the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.079
 crop break is basically aa 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.420
 drought this December we have a 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.329
 very strong heat and who or fruit before 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.950
 even a teenager 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.870
 even with the fall in the harvest some 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.840
 producers are harvesting well. 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.879
 one of them is your fernando abreu left 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.649
 Now, here's your new one with the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.879
 Watermelon area that you cultivate 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.219
 each harvest 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.320
 there are some 88 hectares but the moment is 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.140
 certainty and when the average production 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.619
 You take the average per hectare thus 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.270
 history has no basis in teaching 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.820
 I think we're in the 10 truck 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.110
 That's the 10 way in the net area. 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.570
 in the whole area 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.530
 each truck carries an average of 15 thousand 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.009
 pounds 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.020
 then Fernando and his partner will reap 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:25.619
 150 tons of watermelon 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.080
 some with an extraordinary weight in this 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.960
 we find two 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.040
 enormous watermelons and fernando to the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.040
 weight of each 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.220
 this same basin that we are seeing 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.229
 on here 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.610
 what is the estimated weight of what you 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.700
 think she can weigh 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.369
 I think she only 55 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.680
 because that's when the fruit was heavy 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.729
 practically confirmed the estimate of the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.600
 farmer right staff brought the balance 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.420
 here for farming as a person 52 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.630
 then you have practically hit 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.640
 need not bring these 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.700
 fruits will be featured at the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.310
 rats watermelon from rats 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.830
 The party happens from the 7th to the 9th of 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.720
 June 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.300
 is in a coal museum is expected a 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.390
 audience of 10-15 thousand participants 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.200
 There we will have all the latest 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.400
 milan in exhibition products 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.680
 agriculture and livestock 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.230
 the big watermelons stay on the farm 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.500
 for a few days until the party 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.130
 the fear of the farmer is that the boars and 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.200
 the smiles attack and do damage 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.600
 we will hope that everything will 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.460
 right because besides beautiful 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.460
 the fruits are delicious
