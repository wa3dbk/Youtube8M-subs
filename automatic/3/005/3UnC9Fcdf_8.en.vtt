00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.160
 ah 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.810
 hello welcome again to s 101 tv 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.919
 I'm javier bonet today I'm going to show you the 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.509
 amplifier storm mf 100 r is a 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.700
 100 watt amplifier we 're going to 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.199
 try with this guitar the people in 34 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.480
 characteristics of this amplifier 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.980
 It has many characteristics that I do not 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.290
 I've seen in other amplifiers in the 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.629
 market let's start with the basics is 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.790
 a 100 watt amplifier two channels 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.860
 obviously a clean channel a channel 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.820
 distortion in the distortion channel 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.260
 we have many options such as the 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.320
 cuts of media 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.210
 and a button that says moore drive that 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.859
 connect the signal so that it serves is very 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.390
 interesting for you who are going to 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.940
 start buying your guitar equipment 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.670
 and suddenly the budget does not 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.629
 enough to buy the amplifier the 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.210
 guitar 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.759
 200 effect pedals this is a very 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.320
 good option to start because they have 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.180
 a canal channel clean channel 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.549
 distortion and a channel with even more 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.259
 distortion that you can select from 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.259
 the selector that we have here 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.060
 let's start by showing them the sound 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.830
 which is what I think they are interested in 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.830
 all this is the clean channel 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.920
 and 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.350
 the 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.240
 the bass the bass with deep 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.770
 obviously I like the equalization 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.840
 for a little less serious I like that 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.110
 see that it has a little more nuance 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:57.729
 sound but thanks to the two speakers 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:59.590
 12 inches the bass is the sound 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.330
 let's move on with channel removal 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.369
 clean there's not much to explain we have 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.369
 three - band equalizer and volume 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.649
 very good now we go to the channel 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.319
 distortion that is believed to be 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.810
 waiting for all 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.420
 we have two levels of distortion one 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.730
 distortion sees you more blue 0 na and a 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:26.159
 distortion plus charge we like everyone and 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.569
 select from the same fut switch 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.569
 well in conjunction with the amplifier 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.650
 and 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.099
 let's activate the drive 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.020
 Y 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.240
 it's a bit heavier distortion a 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.770
 little more than English amp and the 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.770
 another is more American 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.970
 then this option is very interesting 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.790
 because you can only buy the 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.490
 amplifier and the guitar and start 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.770
 play the bar that you like the most with your 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.750
 friends because they have practically everything 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.570
 what they need and then they can 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.840
 add the effects they want what 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.989
 we are missing 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.540
 the media curve that is also a 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.420
 option for when they need do not want 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:51.180
 move both the equalization to give 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.180
 base with distortion is simply 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.120
 and in this way it cuts 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.390
 medium frequencies and within a band 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.160
 that means that the guitar is going to 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.200
 Be behind the voice behind 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.180
 of everything and it's going to mix better the 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.580
 music and the vocalist is not going to complain 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.030
 that is very important but when 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.030
 is coming out 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.430
 back to normal 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.120
 and play again 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.120
 strong 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.810
 and 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.440
 do not settle we finally have the knob 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.740
 of drinking the rower affects the two 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.740
 channels 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.710
 Y 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.110
 and 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:00.789
 finally the entrance of the sub suite that 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:03.849
 is with which we are controlling the 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:05.930
 channel changes and we shipments and 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:10.400
 effect returns 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.440
 this works to integrate all your 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.539
 effect pedals as if they were part 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.460
 from the same preamp without having to 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.710
 bridge and without affecting both the 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.360
 sound when pressing a pedal or 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.729
 another then you can simply 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.280
 connect your guitar here and you owe 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.040
 to connect it 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.690
 for the bio to return it and simply 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.360
 they handle two penalties like the 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.130
 regular will sound different yes but 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.200
 you can try it both ways to see 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.020
 which one do you like the most because I think it was 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.820
 everything maybe some of you have more 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.350
 doubts can write in the section of 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.940
