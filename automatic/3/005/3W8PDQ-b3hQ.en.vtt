00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
with your exercise so a good way to

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.969 
with your exercise so a good way to
approach<00:01:34.710> your<00:01:35.070> exercise<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.570> plan

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
approach your exercise is to plan

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.440 
approach your exercise is to plan
beforehand<00:01:37.979> everything<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.060> will<00:01:39.240> do

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
beforehand everything that you will do

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.950 
beforehand everything that you will do
and<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:40.380> plan<00:01:40.710> where<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.700> will<00:01:41.880> stop<00:01:42.360> even

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and to plan where you will stop even

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.130 
and to plan where you will stop even
before<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.619> start<00:01:44.210> your<00:01:45.210> exercise<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.930> even

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
before you start your exercise so even

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.749 
before you start your exercise so even
before<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.560> do<00:01:46.710> your<00:01:46.860> course<00:01:47.159> end<00:01:47.490> even

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
before you do your course end even

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.539 
before you do your course end even
before<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.180> take<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.509> first<00:01:48.840> step<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:50.100> start

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
before you take the first step you start

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.880 
before you take the first step you start
you<00:01:51.180> plan<00:01:51.479> where<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.930> are<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.350> stop<00:01:52.619> and

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
you plan where you are going to stop and

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.460 
you plan where you are going to stop and
another<00:01:53.490> very<00:01:53.880> gross<00:01:54.360> way<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.780> knowing<00:01:55.229> where

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
another very gross way of knowing where

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.139 
another very gross way of knowing where
to<00:01:55.500> stop<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.700> if<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.939> have<00:01:57.030> been

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
to stop is that if you have been

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.410 
to stop is that if you have been
exercising<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:57.869> 45<00:01:58.710> minutes<00:01:59.219> then<00:01:59.850> just<00:02:00.149> stop

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
exercising for 45 minutes then just stop

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.319

that<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.200> my<00:02:19.800> other<00:02:20.010> question<00:02:20.250> would<00:02:20.610> be<00:02:20.670> that

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
that and my other question would be that

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.800 
that and my other question would be that
how<00:02:22.190> effective<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.490> concept<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.120> it

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
how effective is the concept of it

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.780 
how effective is the concept of it
because<00:02:25.230> logically<00:02:25.740> sounds<00:02:26.400> very<00:02:26.520> appealing

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
practices is very very effective but

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.090 
practices is very very effective but
just<00:03:23.459> picking<00:03:23.910> up<00:03:24.060> one<00:03:24.450> nutrient<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.470> saying

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
just picking up one nutrient and saying

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.000 
just picking up one nutrient and saying
that<00:03:26.370> this<00:03:26.550> is<00:03:26.760> full<00:03:27.000> of<00:03:27.120> antioxidants<00:03:27.510> is<00:03:28.290> a

that this is full of antioxidants is a

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.729 
that this is full of antioxidants is a
very<00:03:29.400> narrow<00:03:29.790> view<00:03:30.030> because<00:03:31.019> five<00:03:31.380> years

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
very narrow view because five years

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.470 
very narrow view because five years
later<00:03:32.100> they<00:03:32.700> come<00:03:32.910> up<00:03:33.060> with<00:03:33.209> something

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
later they come up with something

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.000 
later they come up with something
totally<00:03:33.900> new<00:03:34.380> which<00:03:34.620> is<00:03:34.650> full<00:03:34.980> of

totally new which is full of

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.670 
totally new which is full of
antioxidants<00:03:35.720> another<00:03:36.720> five<00:03:37.080> years<00:03:37.410> later

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
antioxidants another five years later

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.020 
antioxidants another five years later
they<00:03:37.950> tell<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.310> that<00:03:38.519> what<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:38.880> were<00:03:39.000> eating

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
10 years ago for being full of axud

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.540 
10 years ago for being full of axud
antioxidants<00:03:42.630> is<00:03:42.780> actually<00:03:43.550> carcinogenic

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
antioxidants is actually carcinogenic

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.410 
antioxidants is actually carcinogenic
okay<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:46.019> they<00:03:46.470> just<00:03:46.739> keep<00:03:47.070> moving<00:03:47.850> everything

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
okay so they just keep moving everything

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.080 
okay so they just keep moving everything
around<00:03:48.660> in<00:03:49.080> cycles<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:50.100> best<00:03:50.340> thing<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.670> do<00:03:50.940> is

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.190 
around in cycles the best thing to do is
to<00:03:51.330> eat<00:03:51.680> local
