some of the features if they're offering
on<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.550> motherboard<00:00:41.850> they<00:00:42.780> offer<00:00:42.989> their

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
on this motherboard they offer their

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.440 
on this motherboard they offer their
thermal<00:00:43.920> armor<00:00:44.280> which<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.520> total<00:00:44.969> air<00:00:45.149> for

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
thermal armor which is total air for

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.170 
thermal armor which is total air for
boosting<00:00:46.050> heat<00:00:46.469> dissipation<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.730> has<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.090> do

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
boosting heat dissipation this has to do

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.520 
boosting heat dissipation this has to do
with<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.390> design<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.899> motherboard<00:00:49.379> and

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
with the design of the motherboard and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.380 
with the design of the motherboard and
allows<00:00:50.070> for<00:00:50.340> all<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.670> air<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.910> being<00:00:51.090> blown

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
allows for all the air is being blown

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.090 
allows for all the air is being blown
across<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.809> board<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.230> go<00:00:52.350> across<00:00:52.620> all<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
across the board to go across all the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.740 
across the board to go across all the
components<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.850> cool<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.300> motherboard

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
components and cool the motherboard

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.990 
components and cool the motherboard
we've<00:00:55.230> also<00:00:55.410> got<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.920> thermal<00:00:56.370> radar<00:00:56.820> which

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
we've also got the thermal radar which

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.360 
we've also got the thermal radar which
is<00:00:57.149> real<00:00:57.390> time<00:00:57.690> temp<00:00:58.410> detection<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.100> heat

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
is real time temp detection and heat

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.130 
is real time temp detection and heat
removal<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.390> basically<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.960> radar

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
removal so basically you have a radar

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.599 
removal so basically you have a radar
that<00:01:01.260> goes<00:01:01.500> out<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.890> seeks<00:01:02.160> where<00:01:02.309> your<00:01:02.430> board

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
that goes out and seeks where your board

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.189 
that goes out and seeks where your board
is<00:01:02.730> hot<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.180> then<00:01:03.539> tries<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.930> send<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
is hot and then tries to send the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.750 
is hot and then tries to send the
appropriate<00:01:04.320> cooling<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.610> actually

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
appropriate cooling to that to actually

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.060 
appropriate cooling to that to actually
cool<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.390> motherboard<00:01:06.869> pretty<00:01:07.350> cool<00:01:07.590> stuff

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
cool the motherboard pretty cool stuff

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.800 
cool the motherboard pretty cool stuff

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
entirely so we've got there ESP he has

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.440 
entirely so we've got there ESP he has
so<00:02:08.700> guards<00:02:09.179> SATA<00:02:09.840> 6<00:02:10.110> gigabit<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:11.280> AI<00:02:11.670> suite<00:02:12.180> -

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
area I have to say that right now this

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.010 
area I have to say that right now this
whole<00:05:02.520> big<00:05:02.789> old<00:05:02.940> heat<00:05:03.120> shield<00:05:03.419> that's<00:05:03.569> on<00:05:03.719> here

whole big old heat shield that's on here

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.809 
whole big old heat shield that's on here
this<00:05:04.680> may<00:05:04.860> become<00:05:05.129> a<00:05:05.159> problem<00:05:05.400> in<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.639> ZIF

this may become a problem in the ZIF
socket<00:05:05.879> because<00:05:06.449> some<00:05:07.199> of<00:05:07.349> the<00:05:07.440> ones<00:05:07.590> that<00:05:07.800> you

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
socket because some of the ones that you

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.920 
socket because some of the ones that you
get<00:05:08.069> are<00:05:08.250> big<00:05:08.669> and<00:05:08.969> they<00:05:09.060> may<00:05:09.330> run<00:05:09.569> into<00:05:09.750> this

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
get are big and they may run into this

get are big and they may run into this
so<00:05:10.199> that<00:05:10.229> may<00:05:10.650> be<00:05:10.680> a<00:05:10.860> problem<00:05:11.659> that's<00:05:12.659> the<00:05:12.810> only

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
so that may be a problem that's the only

I can see right off the bat beyond that
you<00:05:14.879> can<00:05:14.909> see<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.270> thermal<00:05:15.599> solutions

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
you can see the thermal solutions

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.749 
you can see the thermal solutions
covering<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:16.710> entire<00:05:16.830> top<00:05:17.520> of<00:05:17.669> the

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
covering the entire top of the

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:19.760 
covering the entire top of the
motherboard<00:05:18.060> so<00:05:18.719> this<00:05:18.930> allows<00:05:19.229> for<00:05:19.259> the<00:05:19.469> fans

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
motherboard so this allows for the fans

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.260 
motherboard so this allows for the fans
everything<00:05:20.039> here<00:05:20.340> to<00:05:20.520> dissipate<00:05:20.909> all<00:05:21.150> the

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
everything here to dissipate all the

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.360 
everything here to dissipate all the
heat<00:05:21.449> and<00:05:21.599> just<00:05:21.780> push<00:05:22.020> it<00:05:22.199> out<00:05:22.349> pretty<00:05:23.009> cool

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
heat and just push it out pretty cool

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.040 
heat and just push it out pretty cool
I'm<00:05:24.180> going<00:05:24.330> to<00:05:24.389> go<00:05:24.449> ahead<00:05:24.509> just<00:05:24.719> flip<00:05:24.900> it<00:05:24.930> up

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
I'm going to go ahead just flip it up

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.809 
I'm going to go ahead just flip it up
just<00:05:25.259> real<00:05:25.440> quick<00:05:25.650> let<00:05:26.099> you<00:05:26.219> guys<00:05:26.370> take<00:05:26.610> a<00:05:26.669> look
