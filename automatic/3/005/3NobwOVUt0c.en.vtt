this american life about if you had to
choose<00:00:24.180> between<00:00:24.859> i<00:00:26.420> should<00:00:27.420> fly<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.260> i'm

choose between i should fly and i'm

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.919 
choose between i should fly and i'm
having<00:00:29.369> x-ray<00:00:29.880> vision<00:00:30.300> which<00:00:30.539> one<00:00:30.720> would<00:00:30.869> it

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
having x-ray vision which one would it

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.350 
having x-ray vision which one would it
be<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.700> deciding

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
be in it and it is that and deciding

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.150 
be in it and it is that and deciding
between<00:00:33.450> those<00:00:33.960> two<00:00:34.290> things<00:00:34.500> actually<00:00:34.770> says<00:00:35.130> a

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
between those two things actually says a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.850 
between those two things actually says a
lot<00:00:35.309> about<00:00:35.370> your<00:00:35.670> character<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:37.530> i<00:00:37.800> think

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
lot about your character and so i think

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.819 
lot about your character and so i think
most<00:00:38.340> people<00:00:38.760> choose<00:00:39.260> wanting<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.350> fly<00:00:40.500> first

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
most people choose wanting to fly first

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.740 
most people choose wanting to fly first
because<00:00:41.219> x-ray<00:00:41.700> vision<00:00:41.969> would<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:42.149> used<00:00:42.480> for

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
because x-ray vision would be used for

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.330 
because x-ray vision would be used for
bad<00:00:42.899> things<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.500> would<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.860> know<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.219> so

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
bad things it would you know and so

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.340 
bad things it would you know and so
people<00:00:44.550> automatically<00:00:45.210> pick<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.110> flying

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
people automatically pick the flying

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.810 
people automatically pick the flying
would<00:00:46.559> because<00:00:46.739> they<00:00:46.829> feel<00:00:47.070> afraid<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.489> pick

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
would because they feel afraid to pick

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.979 
would because they feel afraid to pick
the<00:00:48.000> x-ray<00:00:48.300> only<00:00:48.420> because<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.750> would<00:00:48.870> say

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the x-ray only because that would say

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.840 
the x-ray only because that would say
something<00:00:49.170> bad<00:00:49.469> about<00:00:49.500> who<00:00:50.399> they<00:00:50.550> were<00:00:50.610> as

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
something bad about who they were as

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.490 
something bad about who they were as
people<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> truth<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.110> probably

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
people but the truth is that probably

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.529 
people but the truth is that probably
most<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.829> us<00:00:52.949> would<00:00:53.100> actually<00:00:53.579> more

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
most of us would actually more

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.270 
most of us would actually more
effectively<00:00:54.989> be<00:00:55.230> able<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.590> capitalize<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.129> an

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
effectively be able to capitalize on an

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.130 
effectively be able to capitalize on an
x-ray<00:00:56.699> vision<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.329> would<00:00:57.449> be<00:00:57.480> able<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.840> fly

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
x-ray vision and we would be able to fly

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.650 
x-ray vision and we would be able to fly
like<00:00:58.530> that's<00:00:58.829> ridiculous<00:00:59.640> what<00:00:59.820> if<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.090> were

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
like that's ridiculous what if you were

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.540 
like that's ridiculous what if you were
somewhere<00:01:00.899> cold<00:01:01.170> not<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.430> look

somewhere cold not just you just look
weird<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.120> uses<00:01:03.510> are<00:01:03.629> creative<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.650> mean<00:01:05.280> x-ray

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
weird and uses are creative I mean x-ray

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.960 
weird and uses are creative I mean x-ray

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.139 
eight mainly and and then we started
playing<00:01:52.979> guitar<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.429> both<00:01:53.610> started<00:01:53.850> writing

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
playing guitar we both started writing

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.029 
playing guitar we both started writing
songs<00:01:54.350> independent<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.410> each<00:01:55.500> other<00:01:55.649> didn't

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
songs independent of each other didn't

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.800

know that the other was doing that and
then<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.259> then<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:58.830> found<00:01:59.070> out<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.729> we're<00:01:59.910> all

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030
