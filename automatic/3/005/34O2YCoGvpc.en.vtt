00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.640 
waiting for them to you know to get back
to<00:01:40.240> you<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:41.140> that's<00:01:41.320> quite<00:01:41.380> challenging

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
to you and that's quite challenging

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.340 
to you and that's quite challenging
because<00:01:41.980> you<00:01:42.400> get<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.790> see<00:01:42.820> you<00:01:43.270> know<00:01:43.390> your

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
because you get to see you know your

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.010 
because you get to see you know your
your<00:01:45.040> valuable<00:01:45.550> in<00:01:45.700> these<00:01:45.910> systems<00:01:46.060> it<00:01:46.810> could

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
your valuable in these systems it could

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.150 
your valuable in these systems it could
be<00:01:47.140> considered<00:01:47.380> as<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.680> learning<00:01:47.860> process

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
be considered as a learning process

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.100 
be considered as a learning process
because<00:01:48.910> you<00:01:49.180> know<00:01:49.300> when<00:01:49.540> when<00:01:49.810> you<00:01:49.870> do<00:01:49.990> your

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
because you know when when you do your

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.750 
because you know when when you do your
first<00:01:50.140> application<00:01:50.860> I<00:01:50.950> think<00:01:51.130> that<00:01:51.280> you<00:01:51.670> know

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
first application I think that you know

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.550 
first application I think that you know
you<00:01:51.820> kind<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.300> develop<00:01:52.570> your<00:01:52.990> skills<00:01:53.320> while

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
you kind of develop your skills while

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.500 
you kind of develop your skills while
you<00:01:53.830> are<00:01:53.980> actually<00:01:54.490> going<00:01:54.880> back<00:01:55.120> and<00:01:55.330> sing

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
you are actually going back and sing

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.670 
you are actually going back and sing
then<00:01:55.660> you're<00:01:55.840> like<00:01:55.990> oh<00:01:56.140> no<00:01:56.260> I<00:01:56.290> didn't<00:01:56.530> do<00:01:56.650> that

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
then you're like oh no I didn't do that

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.230 
then you're like oh no I didn't do that
Loretta<00:01:57.040> in<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.340> next<00:01:57.550> university<00:01:58.000> I'm<00:01:58.060> going

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
Loretta in the next university I'm going

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.450 
Loretta in the next university I'm going
to<00:01:58.300> do<00:01:58.360> it<00:01:58.420> better<00:01:58.630> so<00:01:59.380> yeah<00:02:00.010> it's<00:02:00.190> a<00:02:00.250> learning

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
to do it better so yeah it's a learning

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.810 
to do it better so yeah it's a learning
process<00:02:00.700> like<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.450> know<00:02:01.570> broadly<00:02:01.870> defined

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
process like you know broadly defined

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.910 
process like you know broadly defined
yeah<00:02:03.820> but<00:02:04.030> but<00:02:04.479> I<00:02:04.510> mean<00:02:04.840> it's<00:02:05.020> it's<00:02:05.650> also

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
yeah but but I mean it's it's also

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.469 
yeah but but I mean it's it's also
process<00:02:06.190> that<00:02:06.310> leads<00:02:06.520> like<00:02:06.700> to<00:02:06.820> maturity<00:02:07.330> when

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
process that leads like to maturity when

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.240 
process that leads like to maturity when
it<00:02:07.570> comes<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.440> know<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.830> importance

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
it comes to you know to the importance

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.690 
it comes to you know to the importance
of<00:02:09.399> doing<00:02:09.640> that<00:02:09.790> so<00:02:11.070> if<00:02:12.070> you<00:02:12.160> are<00:02:12.220> convinced

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
of doing that so if you are convinced

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.670 
of doing that so if you are convinced
about<00:02:12.790> doing<00:02:13.150> that<00:02:13.300> then<00:02:13.660> you're<00:02:14.020> definitely

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
about doing that then you're definitely

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.380 
about doing that then you're definitely
have<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.160> learn<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.310> lot<00:02:15.459> of<00:02:15.520> things<00:02:15.790> when<00:02:16.300> it

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
have to learn a lot of things when it

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.940 
have to learn a lot of things when it
comes<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.750> applications<00:02:17.260> basically<00:02:17.770> what

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
comes to the applications basically what

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.620 
comes to the applications basically what
why<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.340> have<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.700> do<00:02:18.820> for<00:02:19.030> when<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:19.420> apply

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
why you have to do for when you apply

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.030 
why you have to do for when you apply
for<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.930> American<00:02:20.260> University<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.740> take<00:02:20.860> the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
for the American University to take the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.910 
for the American University to take the
TOEFL<00:02:21.400> exam<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.720> mean<00:02:23.080> depending<00:02:23.680> on<00:02:23.830> the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
TOEFL exam and you mean depending on the

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.830 
TOEFL exam and you mean depending on the
university<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.520> actually<00:02:24.850> have<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.209> you<00:02:25.720> know

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
university you actually have to you know

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.160 
university you actually have to you know
to<00:02:25.900> achieve<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.410> particular<00:02:26.890> score<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:28.810> did

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
to achieve a particular score so I did

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.860 
to achieve a particular score so I did
that<00:02:29.320> you<00:02:29.620> know<00:02:30.150> follow<00:02:31.150> this<00:02:31.300> procedure<00:02:31.600> and

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
that you know follow this procedure and

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.030 
that you know follow this procedure and
yeah

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.920 

I<00:02:37.069> mean<00:02:37.730> I<00:02:37.760> think<00:02:37.909> I<00:02:38.180> think<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:38.540> think<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.780> most

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
I mean I think I think I think the most

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.160 
I mean I think I think I think the most
important<00:02:39.290> thing<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.620> used<00:02:39.799> I<00:02:40.989> usually<00:02:41.989> tell<00:02:42.140> my

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
important thing I used I usually tell my

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.410 
important thing I used I usually tell my
friends<00:02:42.650> when<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.519> comes<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.939> my<00:02:44.060> experience

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
friends when it comes to my experience

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.300 
friends when it comes to my experience
to<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.569> states<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:45.319> it<00:02:45.680> changes<00:02:46.220> your

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
to the states is that it changes your

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.979 
to the states is that it changes your
way<00:02:46.459> of<00:02:46.610> thinking<00:02:46.760> because<00:02:47.659> you<00:02:47.810> know<00:02:47.930> you

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
way of thinking because you know you

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.880 
way of thinking because you know you
come<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:49.700> far<00:02:49.939> away<00:02:50.030> from<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:50.870> then<00:02:51.079> you<00:02:51.200> go

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
come so far away from and then you go

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.520 
come so far away from and then you go

that's actually that's actually quite
challenging<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:11.870> it's<00:03:11.959> very<00:03:12.140> difficult<00:03:12.319> in

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
challenging and it's very difficult in

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.759 
challenging and it's very difficult in
the<00:03:12.620> beginning<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:13.420> as<00:03:14.420> as<00:03:14.840> as<00:03:15.230> soon<00:03:15.470> as<00:03:15.620> you

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
the beginning and as as as soon as you

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.589 
the beginning and as as as soon as you
learn<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.010> play<00:03:16.609> the<00:03:16.790> game<00:03:16.970> to<00:03:17.180> play<00:03:17.269> with<00:03:17.480> the

learn to play the game to play with the

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.119 
learn to play the game to play with the
rules<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.959> game<00:03:18.139> then<00:03:18.379> you<00:03:18.769> change<00:03:19.040> the

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.129 
rules of the game then you change the

you<00:05:08.820> know<00:05:08.880> in<00:05:09.060> a<00:05:09.720> broadly<00:05:10.020> in<00:05:10.680> a<00:05:11.220> non<00:05:11.370> broadly

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
you know in a broadly in a non broadly

you know in a broadly in a non broadly
defined<00:05:12.060> society<00:05:12.720> so<00:05:12.840> I<00:05:12.870> didn't<00:05:13.169> get<00:05:13.440> to

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
defined society so I didn't get to

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.080 
defined society so I didn't get to

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
actually live like you know and going to

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:16.909 
actually live like you know and going to
work<00:05:15.300> in<00:05:15.419> the<00:05:15.509> States<00:05:15.750> but<00:05:16.199> still<00:05:16.500> it's<00:05:16.740> it's

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
work in the States but still it's it's

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.290 
work in the States but still it's it's
really<00:05:17.130> important<00:05:17.550> because<00:05:17.669> me<00:05:18.060> you<00:05:18.180> know

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
really important because me you know

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.969 
really important because me you know
it's<00:05:18.479> it's<00:05:18.720> very<00:05:18.810> it's<00:05:19.289> very<00:05:19.349> difficult<00:05:19.860> like

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
it's it's very it's very difficult like

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.089 
it's it's very it's very difficult like
Greece<00:05:20.280> is<00:05:20.400> so<00:05:20.520> far<00:05:20.729> away<00:05:20.819> and<00:05:21.740> there<00:05:22.740> are<00:05:22.949> many

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
Greece is so far away and there are many

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:26.990 
Greece is so far away and there are many
common<00:05:23.310> things<00:05:23.400> and<00:05:23.759> I<00:05:23.820> mean<00:05:24.000> I<00:05:24.710> think<00:05:26.000> there

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
common things and I mean I think there

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.420 
common things and I mean I think there
is<00:05:27.120> you<00:05:27.449> know<00:05:27.479> an<00:05:27.919> interrelated<00:05:28.919> influence

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
is you know an interrelated influence

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.499 
is you know an interrelated influence
between<00:05:29.580> the<00:05:29.820> two<00:05:29.940> countries

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:30.509 
between the two countries

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:33.050 
between the two countries
so<00:05:31.020> of<00:05:31.710> course<00:05:32.099> drinks<00:05:32.490> are<00:05:32.610> influenced<00:05:33.000> you

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
so of course drinks are influenced you

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
know not only because of the cinema but

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.620 
know not only because of the cinema but
because<00:05:34.650> of<00:05:34.680> politics<00:05:35.099> because<00:05:35.400> of<00:05:35.630> huge
