00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
demonstrate once it opens yes I didn't

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.569 
demonstrate once it opens yes I didn't
open<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.510> didn't<00:00:43.020> make<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.680> start<00:00:44.160> with<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.550> a

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
open I didn't make it start with like a

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.520 
open I didn't make it start with like a
news<00:00:45.239> webpage<00:00:45.840> because<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.260> would<00:00:46.350> take

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
news webpage because that would take

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.250 
news webpage because that would take
even<00:00:46.739> longer<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.430> load<00:00:47.690> and<00:00:48.690> instead<00:00:49.110> I've

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
even longer to load and instead I've

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.200 
even longer to load and instead I've
added<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.800> which<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.250> could<00:00:50.430> update<00:00:50.579> anytime

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
added this which I could update anytime

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.470 
added this which I could update anytime
without<00:00:51.390> updating<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.170> program<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.480> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
without updating the program and the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.990 
without updating the program and the
only<00:00:54.780> problem<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.760> to

the<00:04:38.310> card<00:04:38.520> properly<00:04:39.740> I've<00:04:40.740> tested<00:04:41.220> this<00:04:41.310> on<00:04:41.520> an

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
the card properly I've tested this on an

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.540 
the card properly I've tested this on an

gigahertz<00:04:44.910> I<00:04:45.380> don't<00:04:46.380> know<00:04:46.440> if<00:04:46.560> any<00:04:46.740> low<00:04:46.980> will

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
gigahertz I don't know if any low will

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.010 
gigahertz I don't know if any low will
work<00:04:47.400> but<00:04:47.640> uh<00:04:47.700> I<00:04:47.970> recommend<00:04:48.570> dual-core

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
work but uh I recommend dual-core

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.440 
work but uh I recommend dual-core
because<00:04:49.790> even<00:04:50.790> on<00:04:50.880> mine

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
because even on mine

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.270 
because even on mine
this<00:04:51.600> lagging<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:52.230> I<00:04:52.320> have<00:04:52.440> an<00:04:52.590> Intel<00:04:52.920> Core<00:04:53.220> 2

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
this lagging and I have an Intel Core 2

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.440 
this lagging and I have an Intel Core 2
Duo<00:04:55.520> see<00:04:56.520> it<00:04:56.760> takes<00:04:57.030> forever<00:04:57.300> to<00:04:57.600> load<00:04:57.920> and<00:04:59.450> if

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
Duo see it takes forever to load and if

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.410 
Duo see it takes forever to load and if
you<00:05:00.570> drag<00:05:00.810> it<00:05:00.930> around<00:05:01.020> like<00:05:01.920> it<00:05:02.220> acts<00:05:03.120> weird

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
you drag it around like it acts weird

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.970 
you drag it around like it acts weird
it's<00:05:04.200> not<00:05:04.380> very<00:05:04.590> smooth

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.230 

so<00:05:07.980> therefore<00:05:09.230> yeah<00:05:10.230> I<00:05:10.260> recommend<00:05:10.800> a<00:05:11.240> stronger

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
so therefore yeah I recommend a stronger

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.050 
so therefore yeah I recommend a stronger
processor<00:05:12.830> 10<00:05:13.830> megabytes<00:05:14.250> is<00:05:14.430> actually<00:05:14.760> 12

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
processor 10 megabytes is actually 12

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.020 
processor 10 megabytes is actually 12
but<00:05:15.710> whatever<00:05:19.400> it's<00:05:20.400> not<00:05:20.490> really<00:05:20.850> a<00:05:20.880> lot

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
but whatever it's not really a lot

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.610 
but whatever it's not really a lot
everyone<00:05:21.330> has<00:05:21.480> 10<00:05:21.720> megabytes

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
everyone has 10 megabytes

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.780 
everyone has 10 megabytes
I<00:05:22.650> recommend<00:05:23.430> around<00:05:24.120> 1.5<00:05:24.810> gigs<00:05:25.140> of<00:05:25.320> RAM<00:05:25.790> you

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
I recommend around 1.5 gigs of RAM you

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.780 
I recommend around 1.5 gigs of RAM you
need<00:05:26.970> Microsoft<00:05:27.390> net<00:05:27.870> framework<00:05:28.140> for<00:05:28.890> 4.5<00:05:29.520> or

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
need Microsoft net framework for 4.5 or

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.940 
need Microsoft net framework for 4.5 or
the<00:05:29.910> program<00:05:30.300> won't<00:05:30.480> work<00:05:30.600> at<00:05:30.900> all<00:05:30.990> you<00:05:31.830> need

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
the program won't work at all you need

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.070 
the program won't work at all you need
to<00:05:32.100> internet<00:05:32.430> connection<00:05:32.910> for<00:05:33.180> update

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
to internet connection for update

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
to internet connection for update
checking<00:05:34.470> and<00:05:34.620> news

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
checking and news

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.920
