00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.410
 this is the first home game of 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.430
 Gentleman, therefore, we are very happy 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.840
 important to win here 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.580
 To show our fans too we are 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.050
 again at the start we had now 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.580
 lost two games in hamburg 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.560
 neutral place in bremen immediately 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.960
 So we get 21 and we want that 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.060
 balance and want to be here next year 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.060
 then invite again and then it is 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.920
 passed by 32 then and then for 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.310
 you finally have and then you should too 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.310
 the cup 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.580
 That's right for the matter 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.140
 So I 'm the game but right 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.850
 on the high level but we have 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.960
 of course also trumped but if 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.820
 you look what kind of players meanwhile 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:04.869
 there are somehow watts at the start 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.070
 We have twice there in my old 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.170
 then drops the still more difficult 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.810
 you do not do any sports then one is 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.060
 already clap nice 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.950
 they are more likely to have the fuss in the neck 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.970
 flat half-time I needed one 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.600
 yes so that now in the second 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.600
 half-time 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:53.430
 interim balance how does the game work? 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:55.670
 you score goals and achieve it 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.800
 not so easy to score but 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.190
 Nevertheless, the spectators see many gates 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.710
 what happens is there first 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.080
 quite juicy approach because the 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.030
 some are running around as if just out of the 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.649
 vacation come and it can not 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.020
 some do not have themselves 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.650
 we can prepare that in a familiar way 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.650
 just do not let it stand 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.950
 besides a fun and the sense too 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.630
 Let's take that very seriously because 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.780
 usually in the benefit game something like 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.160
 76 already for a while and a 14 16 and you 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.360
 Take a ball up when you have a on 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.360
 station takes would have gotten off 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.870
 I thought that was very remarkable 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.239
 I have never had such a tension 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.530
 really experienced coach has heard 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.720
 we said we play with eleven men today 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.910
 and I think then everything was said that way 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.400
 So then it was actually clear how it is 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.780
 you're more likely to look rangy 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.500
 or honor magath i think i am from 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.680
 They are not really what I am 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.680
 a star 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:54.780
 today i just tell subway who knows 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.319
 address of siri and is a button already 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.060
 in the 9th 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.980
 he is our trainer that's why there is 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.599
 Of course, a tactic, it goes the 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.090
 team you can see that we too 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:07.980
 play all defend really 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:10.260
 defensively and then www we sting 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.080
 out front and make the goal 14 would be 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:24.540
 the love with our and our 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:26.100
 easygroup definitely like it 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.400
 music somehow but there are still 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.330
 other things are walking very clear 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.650
 Instinctive footballers are in the right place 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.960
 so to speak he did not quite get it 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.430
 perfectly served today at two passes the 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.500
 actually have to come directly to him 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.370
 so we still have to fall now though 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.050
 you can see he did not 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.340
 Have all the other ones replaced 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.229
 no one seen so far played through 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.449
 that shows in any case that is 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:48.479
 highly motivated to the extreme yes me 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:51.240
 I'm in the storm left foot that makes quite good 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:54.080
 Hold the balls and I'm with his 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.990
 player takes you in the game 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:01.349
 as a musician just world class 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.470
 score 2 1 in the end will be 42 for 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:07.310
 us what pleases me come more and more 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.310
 people to the games 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.970
 heinz's experience sustains this interview 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.110
 heinz has become the gate then 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.970
 distracted and then that fell 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.560
 I have the decisive goal 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:38.980
 seen as not happen with us because 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:41.560
 I double you have no official 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.480
 statistics ball possession statistics 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.560
 get the half-time pure 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.890
 unfortunately we did not want me 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.890
 approximately 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.780
 the game summarized in two sentences 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.770
 Pretty shitty point of the absolute 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.820
 winner is not found yet i know 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.290
 but not what we should do 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.700
 have indeed today with seven former 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:36.570
 professionals started and was not enough 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.110
 something we have to think again 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.110
 for the next time
