00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
other Garmin watches let's say like the

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.030 
other Garmin watches let's say like the
forerunner<00:05:21.790> 60<00:05:22.420> it's<00:05:23.140> definitely<00:05:23.920> a<00:05:23.950> more

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
forerunner 60 it's definitely a more

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.970 
forerunner 60 it's definitely a more
superior<00:05:24.640> device<00:05:25.120> because<00:05:25.540> of<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:25.720> GPS

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
superior device because of the GPS

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.220 
superior device because of the GPS
capabilities<00:05:26.980> the<00:05:27.550> GPS<00:05:28.000> capabilities<00:05:28.780> of

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
capabilities the GPS capabilities of

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.680 
capabilities the GPS capabilities of
recording<00:05:29.920> your<00:05:30.040> distance<00:05:30.610> and<00:05:30.910> speed<00:05:31.300> are

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
recording your distance and speed are

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.080 
recording your distance and speed are
going<00:05:31.930> to<00:05:31.990> get<00:05:32.080> you<00:05:32.200> more<00:05:32.410> accurate<00:05:33.090> info

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
going to get you more accurate info

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.040 
going to get you more accurate info
about<00:05:34.330> your<00:05:34.810> runs<00:05:35.110> and<00:05:35.410> your<00:05:35.500> training

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
about your runs and your training

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.310 
about your runs and your training
however<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.710> forerunner<00:05:39.370> 60<00:05:40.240> being<00:05:41.020> a<00:05:41.140> non

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
however the forerunner 60 being a non

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.000 
however the forerunner 60 being a non
GPS<00:05:41.980> is<00:05:42.340> a<00:05:42.850> little<00:05:43.390> smaller<00:05:43.960> so<00:05:44.230> some<00:05:44.890> people

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
GPS is a little smaller so some people

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.620 
GPS is a little smaller so some people
like<00:05:45.190> it<00:05:45.520> because<00:05:45.700> it<00:05:45.820> goes<00:05:46.000> on<00:05:46.180> the<00:05:46.300> wrist<00:05:46.510> a

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
like it because it goes on the wrist a

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.420 
like it because it goes on the wrist a
little<00:05:46.780> better<00:05:47.110> but<00:05:47.410> the<00:05:47.560> data<00:05:47.830> collected

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
little better but the data collected

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.960 
little better but the data collected
won't<00:05:48.730> be<00:05:48.910> as<00:05:49.000> accurate<00:05:50.340> Garmin<00:05:51.340> has<00:05:51.490> the<00:05:51.790> new

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
won't be as accurate Garmin has the new

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.710 
won't be as accurate Garmin has the new
410<00:05:52.810> and<00:05:53.650> when<00:05:54.130> you<00:05:54.220> compare<00:05:54.580> it<00:05:54.610> to<00:05:54.850> the<00:05:54.970> 410

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
410 and when you compare it to the 410

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.750 
410 and when you compare it to the 410
you'll<00:05:56.230> notice<00:05:56.620> that<00:05:56.770> the<00:05:56.919> 10<00:05:57.190> is<00:05:57.370> a<00:05:57.400> very

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
you'll notice that the 10 is a very

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.760 
you'll notice that the 10 is a very
basic<00:05:58.030> unit<00:05:58.630> in<00:05:58.750> comparison<00:05:59.380> because<00:05:59.650> it

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
basic unit in comparison because it

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.730 
basic unit in comparison because it
doesn't<00:06:00.100> have<00:06:00.250> wireless<00:06:00.720> like<00:06:01.720> the<00:06:01.960> 410<00:06:02.470> does

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
doesn't have wireless like the 410 does

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.409 
doesn't have wireless like the 410 does
and<00:06:03.010> it<00:06:03.490> has<00:06:03.760> about<00:06:04.510> I<00:06:04.810> don't<00:06:05.290> know<00:06:05.500> a<00:06:06.240> tenth<00:06:07.240> of

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
and it has about I don't know a tenth of

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.840 
and it has about I don't know a tenth of
the<00:06:07.480> features<00:06:08.160> when<00:06:09.160> you're<00:06:09.310> setting<00:06:09.669> up<00:06:09.820> your

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
both units are easy to use but you do

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.760 
both units are easy to use but you do
