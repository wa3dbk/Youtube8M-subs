00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.389
 well it her whole world seneca 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.860
 case and we find ourselves today as 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.260
 you can see it right behind me 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.570
 with a map hunger games so that's 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.170
 a mc map forgiveness hunger games are 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.400
 unpublished 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:29.070
 she was sent to me by roman b 777 and 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.920
 said xxxxx so said xxxx you have 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.090
 already seen one of these maps and you in 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.399
 will see other sites because I read 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.989
 to send others, is it so? 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.000
 have realized this one with two and they me 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.379
 have sent me and send all 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.809
 simply by mail so I remind him 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.280
 if you also want to send 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.110
 send me maps you have the link of 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.969
 mail in the description of each of the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.860
 videos is so valid that we will 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.149
 also find out if it's a hunger map 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.719
 games so as I wanted 10 may a 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.489
 map based on star wars universe 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.660
 it's more precisely the rock village 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.440
 for those who know a little bit 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.820
 the star wars universe 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.680
 as you can see also behind 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.149
 me there is a big one big stuffed 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.070
 and we would have a big teddy bear to me 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.439
 would be impressive elsewhere and 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.600
 so they based this map hunger games 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.860
 on this universe 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.689
 listen we'll visit that right now 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.540
 so here is the map on which you 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.890
 go you will dispute your games 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.630
 so it's already beautiful especially from 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.820
 night with all these little effects of 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.840
 light we can see like that it's 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.400
 for that besides that I record the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.979
 night because they had ben 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.000
 advised but it's true that that 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.950
 makes it pretty good and it's true 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.170
 only with small lighting effects 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.740
 like that it's rather it's rather 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.720
 magnificent 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.430
 so here is my pub games you go 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.829
 appear here this with the spawn of 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.049
 departure so we just do not have the name 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.720
 creators of the map and with the help 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.860
 of saïd cycle xxx so you have to know 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.270
 as at the base it was a map 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.250
 totally flat and they have 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.229
 fully but completely covered 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.939
 of water when if you visit a little bit 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.310
 further on when we go there a little 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.899
 little like that by flying you can see 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.130
 that it is completely covered with water 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.750
 these guys are completely crazy 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.610
 maybe completely crazy guys 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.280
 because frankly it's the past of the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.299
 time to fill this mc do and so they 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.530
 covered it with water they have everything 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.290
 builds themselves so all that is 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.750
 here was been done not reviewed the map 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.039
 was flat at the base so as I you 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.560
 just say it before it's going to be the 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.330
 starting spawn is down 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.810
 each takes place there were eight places 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.880
 for him players each takes place in 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.000
 one of those little holes I want 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.770
 to say is good against having 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.450
 this sequel but during the fall 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.020
 stay well in place do not touch 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.550
 your controller 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.900
 he advised me to tell you because 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.569
 that otherwise you will die enough 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.769
 quickly it's really it's stack 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.900
 in fact this is where you go 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.010
 drop my guy you 're going to see that 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.900
 anyway because there is no 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.180
 something else to see these two is the 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.319
 beginning of the map the listening spawn is going 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.670
 snap that lever and then you go 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.519
 to see that we will have to really not move 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.950
 during the fall for for just do not 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.540
 not die very quickly she is 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.019
 we're going to do this little 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.760
 fall 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.230
 see it really happening here at 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.489
 millimeter was planning in the small hole 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.989
 I passed it's a bit like that for 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.959
 everyone so you really do not have to 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.390
 not to touch the map the map the joystick 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.860
 forgiveness during the fall so there was 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.200
 the starting chests as in every 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.250
 eagle games and bah listen we're going 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.630
 visit is a little bit this map 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.010
 so you'll see she's not very 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:17.159
 great how to say in width in 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.659
 its surface I think that it says 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.060
 is not very big against her and 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.500
 she is all verticality in fact he 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.670
 is not where there are a lot of steps you 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.340
 will be able to climb everywhere 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.409
 you will be able to walk while 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.920
 height it's really a map that holds 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:34.019
 its particularity in its verticality 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.040
 that is, but I succeeded and it is 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.569
 what makes her so original and 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.549
 more and more normally you do not have it 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.480
 find it on no other channel 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.299
 simply because he sent me 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.890
 game behind I really thank them 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.319
 not to have kept this map this map 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.340
 unpublished and on all maps better 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.530
 game I know we ask a lot 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.150
 and that I do not do much because 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.859
 ba people do not get much and then 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.680
 I find in I find a little bit 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.359
 but there is always the little time of 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.400
 translation to do it's true that I have 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.690
 not had enough time to do that and that 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.250
 it misses a little it missed a little the 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.370
 last month we had one I hope 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.629
 that this month there will be more in all 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.489
 case this one is really but really 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.549
 sordid and then in addition as I wanted 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.319
 says she's new to the channel so 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:16.680
 so again a big thank you to you saïdi 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.239
 that it's Roman 777 really do not know 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.489
 this really great what simply 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.780
 so here I am walking a little bit could 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.830
 see a little bit how it's 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.660
 happening you have bridges a little bit of 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.780
 everywhere you have several floors see 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.479
 it goes up like that down again 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.030
 verticality simply 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.740
 and here is to enjoy a maple of rgam 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.910
 a classic anyway this is the 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.610
 ring game principle you have some cov 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.039
 spread everywhere you have what you 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.449
 equip what you hide too 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.000
 especially this sum since h is 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.500
 really really well hide with 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.770
 all the vegetation that put him on the 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.740
 maps 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.270
 and we can climb from everywhere 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.349
 really finally it's really sublime 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.630
 I find it really beautiful this 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.090
 that they did I do not know how many 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.260
 time it took them to do all this 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.240
 because there is really a lot of 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.620
 work on it anyway I'm already 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.810
 come here i believe yes i had to make a 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.949
 little trick actually but listen we'll get 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.870
 gather we will make them a story 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.960
 a little bit higher just for you 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.310
 show a little bit a little bit 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.720
 others how is it going in 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.130
 what do we have small houses said 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.330
 wak also a little bit everywhere sailboats 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.840
 little mushrooms like that they are 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.970
 small houses 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.220
 we have houses directly digging 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.460
 in the trees then one is a little to one 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.900
 empty chest 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.190
 we have houses yes a little hollow in 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.680
 the trees there as can be seen in 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.770
 all wood not wood but it's from 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.389
 go like this to go and visit that and 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.069
 so that's after bass and a war 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.660
 classic anyway you have to 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:36.680
 equipment a little everywhere who you 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.849
 was diamond here correctly 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.150
 remember if I'm doing some of 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:42.380
 sugar but still serve and so that's it 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.110
 it's a classic gungame machine 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.000
 so just the peculiarity pardon it's 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.889
 not to move during the fall to 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.919
 redo a little visual above the top 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:54.229
 in the daytime it is rising 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.310
 forgiveness is true that it's a bit it's 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.210
 not a little less pretty caezar is 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.680
 always beautiful but it's true 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.949
 that with the light effects at night it 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.990
 are there really and makes a touching 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:04.280
 rather nice so you can see 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.650
 like that a little bit more so that she 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:11.180
 is really not very wide in width 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.830
 the nas but is not very wide 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.630
 on the other hand at height there are really 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.520
 a lot of things to a lot of visit 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.830
 things to see so 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.150
 So here I am really great 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.210
 happy who sent it to me I'm super 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.349
 glad to present it to you too and 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.460
 well listen and here I am not going to say 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:27.500
 the more I let you discover it I you 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.090
 let it download but download 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.099
 there really because it's a very 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.599
 good way anyway look at me 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:35.060
 that like all the work that has been 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:36.740
 done and well listen to me I'll go 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.960
 leave here with my little i not worked 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.389
 my little one who is five six times my 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.770
 size easily so not so small 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:45.020
 in any case I will leave you here 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.729
 I hope that the map will have pleased you 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.550
