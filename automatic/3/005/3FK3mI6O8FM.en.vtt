okay<00:00:01.560> I've<00:00:01.800> just<00:00:02.159> completed<00:00:02.580> doing<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.060> tack

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
okay I've just completed doing the tack

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.710 
okay I've just completed doing the tack
wire<00:00:03.750> in<00:00:04.140> this<00:00:04.529> Toyota<00:00:04.950> now<00:00:05.910> to<00:00:05.970> grab<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.450> tack

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
wire in this Toyota now to grab you tack

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.200 
wire in this Toyota now to grab you tack
wire<00:00:06.990> you<00:00:07.259> could<00:00:07.410> always<00:00:07.589> go<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.010> being<00:00:08.519> one<00:00:09.179> of

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
wire you could always go to being one of

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.509 
wire you could always go to being one of
these<00:00:09.360> injectors<00:00:09.929> which<00:00:10.139> my<00:00:11.010> opinion<00:00:11.429> a

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
these injectors which my opinion a

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.970 
these injectors which my opinion a
little<00:00:11.730> easier<00:00:12.120> on<00:00:12.840> all<00:00:13.170> these<00:00:13.440> injectors

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
little easier on all these injectors

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.589 
little easier on all these injectors
like<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.549> six<00:00:14.790> cylinder<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.420> see

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
like this is a six cylinder so you see

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.529 
like this is a six cylinder so you see
there's<00:00:15.780> an<00:00:15.870> injector<00:00:16.289> there<00:00:16.500> there<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.539> we

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
there's an injector there there and we

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.660 
there's an injector there there and we
hard<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.930> show<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.140> but<00:00:19.710> now<00:00:19.980> there<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.369> this

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
hard to show you but now there is this

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.450 
hard to show you but now there is this
three<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.119> those<00:00:21.210> guys<00:00:21.449> right<00:00:21.720> there<00:00:22.130> in<00:00:23.130> there

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
three of those guys right there in there

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.029 
three of those guys right there in there
in<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.000> particular<00:00:24.390> car<00:00:24.900> there's<00:00:25.710> four

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
in this particular car there's four

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.300 
in this particular car there's four
wires<00:00:26.599> is<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.779> heavy<00:00:28.019> one<00:00:28.289> here<00:00:28.619> another<00:00:28.890> one

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
wires is this heavy one here another one

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.519 
wires is this heavy one here another one
and<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:30.119> guys<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.449> third<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.109> fourth<00:00:31.349> wire

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
and you guys the third and fourth wire

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.010 
and you guys the third and fourth wire
it<00:00:31.740> doesn't<00:00:32.520> really<00:00:32.610> make<00:00:32.850> much<00:00:33.480> sense<00:00:33.750> on

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
it doesn't really make much sense on

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.500 
it doesn't really make much sense on
cars<00:00:34.350> or<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> order<00:00:35.160> but<00:00:35.460> some<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.450> these

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
cars or the order but some of these

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.569 
cars or the order but some of these
injectors<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.230> two<00:00:37.500> wires<00:00:37.770> some<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.309> three

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
injectors have two wires some have three

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.209 
injectors have two wires some have three
and<00:00:38.790> some<00:00:38.969> have<00:00:39.149> four<00:00:39.739> even<00:00:40.739> though<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:40.860> can't

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
and some have four even though I can't

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.209 
and some have four even though I can't
really<00:00:41.370> show<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.059> other<00:00:42.270> injector<00:00:42.809> wire

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
really show you the other injector wire

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.260 
really show you the other injector wire
it's<00:00:44.219> going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.489> take<00:00:44.670> my<00:00:44.789> word<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.030> it

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
it's going to take my word for it

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.900 
it's going to take my word for it
there's<00:00:45.690> black<00:00:46.140> there's<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.649> white<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.730> one

one I grab then is that white black on
all<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.530> these<00:00:52.680> injectors<00:00:53.190> there's<00:00:53.340> going<00:00:53.460> to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
all of these injectors there's going to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.799 
all of these injectors there's going to
be<00:00:53.579> three<00:00:53.850> wires<00:00:54.090> what<00:00:54.360> you're<00:00:54.539> going<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.719> be

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
be three wires what you're going to be

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.779 
be three wires what you're going to be
common<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.559> one<00:00:55.770> that's<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.160> odd<00:00:56.309> man<00:00:56.550> out<00:00:56.730> on

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
common the one that's the odd man out on

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.400 
common the one that's the odd man out on
each<00:00:57.210> one<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.449> these<00:00:57.510> injectors<00:00:58.020> that's<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
each one of these injectors that's the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.660 
each one of these injectors that's the
one<00:00:58.559> that's<00:00:58.680> going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.949> give<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.190> your<00:00:59.370> tax

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
one that's going to give you your tax

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.760 
one that's going to give you your tax
signal<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.600> any<00:01:00.809> one<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.079> those<00:01:01.199> four<00:01:01.530> bites

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
signal so any one of those four bites

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.709 
signal so any one of those four bites
you<00:01:02.309> go<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.550> any<00:01:02.730> injector<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.359> doesn't<00:01:03.600> really

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
you go to any injector it doesn't really

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.450 
you go to any injector it doesn't really
matter<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.229> since<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.589> engines<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.189> tight

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
matter but since this engines so tight

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.969 
matter but since this engines so tight
that's<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.909> one<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> chose<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.420> use<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:07.770> once

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that's the one I chose to use so once

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.969 
that's the one I chose to use so once
you<00:01:08.070> make<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.250> connection<00:01:08.610> get<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.920> tie<00:01:10.920> it

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
you make a connection get it in tie it

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.010
