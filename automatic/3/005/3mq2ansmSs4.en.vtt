00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.180
 software more 'recovery' on a samsung 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:14.660
 galaxy s and the model 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.930
 it's an X to take a different recovery 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.240
 which is installed on the 5830 model and 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.490
 because if we install the one that is installed 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.070
 at number 58 30 and cause we will make a 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.720
 brick to our phone 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.420
 I leave the download link in the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.090
 description and good let's start the process 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:36.730
 for this we need to indicate in mode 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.730
 recovery so we turn off the phone 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.399
 once off we will start in mode 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:01.089
 recovery with the volume key up 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.089
 Pressed menu key and power key 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.370
 would be perez carmen a single green 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:28.710
 Once inside we will leave this menu 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.690
 and we'll have to go to play that is 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.030

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.830

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.350
 for this to move and this for 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.830
 to accept 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.090
 we use the last name to typhoons edecan and 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.490
 we look for the file that we have already 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.350
 downloaded that is called cloud world 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.350
 match recover 5830 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.340
 we execute 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.970
 and we will be in the record in the club 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:01.240
 world recovery is version 5 point 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.190
 2.6 the file we will not be able to eliminate 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.650
 of the sd since 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.960
 every time we have to want 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.460
 enter the recovery we will have to go back 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.480
 the initial one once we get out of here 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.909
 we will be back 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.739
 to the normal phone and we will enter the 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.010
 serial recovery where we were 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.230
 before 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.079
 and to re-enter we will have to 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.760
 again to formica widows and would have 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:33.360

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:37.770
