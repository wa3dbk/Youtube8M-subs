00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.649
 out of curiosity in the knit section with the excellent symphonic musicians 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.640
 and the favorites 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.650
 and if the modifications that the fmi had made would force it to do so 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.360
 also physical and just in time it seems to me that there side the algorithm for 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.760
 make analysts friends that there is still no algorithm to make 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.279
 friends let's listen to him if he really has something we will put a position in the 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.099
 comic fair and we armed rich arias 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.659
 but it is my initial approach that there are the same deficiencies that 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.690
 Cockatoo looked like he cried when he came to the zoo abbot 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.630
 the cockatoo denounced 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.270
 If you are new to this, winning is a great book that would have expired. 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.270
 select a simple flow diagram that mediates in this process 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.820
 we never thought about putting a cage in when you leave the apartment 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.390
 with the crisis 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.010
 If this is Don Cooper, I thought that you have not returned any of my 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.480
 numerous calls because I did not offer any suggestions to continue 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.390
 our friendship 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.710
 in Singer 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.710
 we could both eat something together 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.720
 I understand then maybe I'll have time here 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.100
 an alcohol rate the options of snte coffee and cocoa 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.560
 that they understand or not can not favor 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.430
 how about a recreational activity I bet we do have interests 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.690
 common of something that interests you 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.920
 seriously 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.400
 Real horses win 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.740
 I came another thing that interests you I'm sorry I do not want to get in the water until 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.300
 that is absolutely necessary also something else that I have got stuck in a 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.700
 infinite loop I'll fix it 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.260
 dance first is interesting but ventriloquism is not by definition a 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.950
 solo activity 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.950
 or anything else that interests you 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.350
 by chance you like the monkeys carayÃ¡ can it happen with you to all the 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.810
 Canarian world 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.060
 wait for it to eclipse 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.710
 a cycle counter 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.609
 if a departure towards the less acceptable activity play is bright sanaa 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:09.849
 I'm surprised it's yours 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:10.650
 go 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.340
 because you will do the compass open on Saturday so he could have said 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.070
 it seems a little more acceptable I would propose the queen if I 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.070
 let's do together 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.079
 and I pay for the morning several means 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:31.039
 this time to learn to climb 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:32.069
 true
