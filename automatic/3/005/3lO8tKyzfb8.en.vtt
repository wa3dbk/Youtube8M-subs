out<00:05:13.360> you<00:05:13.450> don't<00:05:13.510> need<00:05:13.690> to<00:05:13.750> listen<00:05:13.990> to<00:05:14.050> the

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:14.139 
out you don't need to listen to the

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:15.810 
out you don't need to listen to the
whole<00:05:14.260> thing<00:05:14.290> there<00:05:14.650> but<00:05:14.860> I<00:05:15.190> think<00:05:15.550> that<00:05:15.669> gives

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
whole thing there but I think that gives

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.400 
whole thing there but I think that gives
you<00:05:15.910> the<00:05:16.030> idea<00:05:16.060> it's<00:05:16.419> pretty<00:05:16.630> easy<00:05:16.750> to<00:05:16.870> use<00:05:16.960> and

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
you the idea it's pretty easy to use and

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.440 
you the idea it's pretty easy to use and
makes<00:05:17.889> a<00:05:17.950> real<00:05:18.100> nice<00:05:18.190> recording<00:05:18.639> see<00:05:19.240> I<00:05:19.270> told

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450
