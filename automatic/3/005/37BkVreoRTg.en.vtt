easy<00:00:00.539> to<00:00:00.719> drift<00:00:00.870> is<00:00:01.199> a<00:00:01.530> new<00:00:01.979> concept<00:00:02.220> and<00:00:02.820> it's

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
easy to drift is a new concept and it's

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.800 
easy to drift is a new concept and it's
actually<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.540> ring<00:00:03.899> made<00:00:04.740> out<00:00:04.890> of<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.069> special

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:05.810 
actually a ring made out of a special

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.379 
actually a ring made out of a special
polymer<00:00:07.429> that<00:00:08.429> fits<00:00:08.700> over<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.889> tire<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:12.059> a

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
polymer that fits over the tire of of a

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.049 
polymer that fits over the tire of of a
car<00:00:12.660> or<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.950> know<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.099> could<00:00:14.219> pick<00:00:14.490> up<00:00:14.519> do<00:00:15.030> it

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
car or you know you could pick up do it

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.730 
car or you know you could pick up do it
on<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.269> truck<00:00:15.599> right<00:00:15.870> now<00:00:15.900> we're<00:00:16.199> doing<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.590> on

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
on a truck right now we're doing it on

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.340 
on a truck right now we're doing it on
the<00:00:17.270> sheriff<00:00:18.270> training<00:00:19.260> cars<00:00:19.500> li<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:21.350> takes

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
the sheriff training cars li it takes

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.650 
the sheriff training cars li it takes
away<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.070> adherence<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.850> ground<00:00:24.180> because

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
away the adherence to the ground because

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.210 
away the adherence to the ground because
you're<00:00:24.869> covering<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.380> tire<00:00:25.650> meaning<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
you're covering the tire meaning the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.220 
you're covering the tire meaning the
rubber<00:00:26.430> part<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:27.410> you<00:00:28.410> now<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.460> hard

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
rubber part and you now have a hard

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.260 
rubber part and you now have a hard

atmosphere everybody that has done this
has<00:00:45.390> driven<00:00:45.660> better<00:00:46.430> halfway<00:00:47.430> through<00:00:47.610> the

has driven better halfway through the

has driven better halfway through the
course<00:00:48.090> than<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.300> did<00:00:48.420> at<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> beginning<00:00:48.660> so

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
course than you did at the beginning so

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.029 
course than you did at the beginning so
that<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.230> mean<00:00:49.350> that's<00:00:49.440> how<00:00:49.590> fast<00:00:49.829> they're

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
that I mean that's how fast they're

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.180 
that I mean that's how fast they're
picking<00:00:50.460> up<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.530> it's<00:00:52.530> nothing<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.039> it

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
picking up on it so it's nothing to it

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:03.430 
picking up on it so it's nothing to it
all<00:00:53.940> right<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:55.079> ready<00:00:55.230> I'm<00:00:55.620> ready<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.219> ready

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.710 

it's<00:01:04.440> gonna<00:01:04.650> be<00:01:04.800> fun

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
this is just like it's good bad exactly

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:31.240 
this is just like it's good bad exactly
like<00:01:11.540> it

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:50.560 

it's<00:01:32.250> kind<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.549> cool

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.350 

wow<00:01:52.369> so<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.640> where<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> three-point

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
wow so this is where the three-point

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.080 
wow so this is where the three-point
turns<00:01:54.600> come<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.079> yeah<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.640> may<00:01:56.790> want<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:56.970> get

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
turns come in yeah you may want to get

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.240 
turns come in yeah you may want to get
straightening<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.750> then<00:01:57.960> take<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.829> gun<00:01:58.979> in

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
straightening it then take the gun in

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.749 
straightening it then take the gun in
pick<00:01:59.579> up<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.820> cones<00:02:00.060> there<00:02:01.520> don't<00:02:02.520> come

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
pick up the cones there don't come

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:03.980 
pick up the cones there don't come
through<00:02:03.000> there<00:02:03.149> Jan<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.509> brakes<00:02:03.720> on<00:02:03.840> right

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
through there Jan the brakes on right

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.899 
through there Jan the brakes on right
here<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.259> turn<00:02:04.380> towards<00:02:04.799> us<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.610> car<00:02:05.820> is

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
here and turn towards us the car is

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.359 
here and turn towards us the car is
going<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.060> do<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.500> go<00:02:07.500> see<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.190> make<00:02:08.340> a

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
going to do this go see that and make a

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.729 
going to do this go see that and make a
big<00:02:08.640> loop<00:02:08.880> out<00:02:09.090> there<00:02:09.300> slow<00:02:09.599> down<00:02:09.810> whether

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
big loop out there slow down whether

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.020 
big loop out there slow down whether
it's<00:02:10.890> me<00:02:10.979> or<00:02:11.009> sergeant<00:02:11.459> Hanson<00:02:11.580> in<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.849> car

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
it's me or sergeant Hanson in the car

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.580 
it's me or sergeant Hanson in the car
were<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.360> if<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.870> roll<00:02:13.080> through<00:02:13.290> there<00:02:13.500> and

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
were you if you roll through there and

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.559 
were you if you roll through there and
turn<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.950> wheel<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.370> you're<00:02:14.640> doing<00:02:14.880> like<00:02:14.970> 17

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
turn the wheel and you're doing like 17

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.259 
turn the wheel and you're doing like 17
by<00:02:16.290> it's<00:02:17.069> neat<00:02:17.280> it's<00:02:17.310> fun<00:02:17.730> but<00:02:17.970> you're<00:02:18.120> just

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
by it's neat it's fun but you're just

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.050 
by it's neat it's fun but you're just
going<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.480> spend<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.720> sir<00:02:18.890> so<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.489> just<00:02:20.700> set<00:02:20.910> up

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
going to spend it sir so you just set up

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.509 
going to spend it sir so you just set up
remember<00:02:21.690> what<00:02:21.840> your<00:02:21.959> car<00:02:22.140> will<00:02:22.350> won't<00:02:22.620> do<00:02:22.799> you

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
remember what your car will won't do you

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.770 
remember what your car will won't do you
don't<00:02:23.700> want<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:23.910> break<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.239> a<00:02:24.330> corner<00:02:24.660> you
