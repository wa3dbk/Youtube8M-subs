for what it is i think you can certainly
make<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.400> argument<00:03:07.579> that<00:03:07.849> it's<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.090> tabletop

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
make the argument that it's a tabletop

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.059

campaign length one night a month a

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.300 
campaign length one night a month a
decade<00:05:45.730> this<00:05:46.730> is<00:05:46.820> a<00:05:46.850> tough<00:05:47.090> one<00:05:47.120> I<00:05:47.560> think<00:05:48.560> for

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
decade this is a tough one I think for

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.810 
decade this is a tough one I think for
it<00:05:49.430> I<00:05:50.080> really<00:05:51.080> like<00:05:51.290> the<00:05:51.650> idea<00:05:51.680> of<00:05:52.070> playing<00:05:52.550> a

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
it I really like the idea of playing a

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.330 
it I really like the idea of playing a
game<00:05:53.030> for<00:05:53.270> a<00:05:53.300> decade<00:05:53.630> I<00:05:53.990> think<00:05:54.710> Dungeons<00:05:55.220> and

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
game for a decade I think Dungeons and

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.530 
game for a decade I think Dungeons and
Dragons<00:05:55.370> could<00:05:55.910> do<00:05:56.090> that<00:05:56.210> for<00:05:56.270> me<00:05:56.450> I'm

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
Dragons could do that for me I'm

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.850 
Dragons could do that for me I'm
actually<00:05:56.690> relatively<00:05:57.140> new<00:05:57.410> to<00:05:57.560> role-playing

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
actually relatively new to role-playing

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.640 
actually relatively new to role-playing

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.850 
i think is an absolute blast to plan a

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
that one and that one a campaign should

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.080 
that one and that one a campaign should
last<00:06:42.710> probably<00:06:43.220> about<00:06:43.310> a<00:06:43.370> month<00:06:43.430> like<00:06:43.940> you

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090

kind<00:06:44.510> of<00:06:44.540> want<00:06:44.720> your<00:06:44.810> characters<00:06:45.140> to<00:06:45.290> die<00:06:45.410> it's

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
kind of want your characters to die it's

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.770 
kind of want your characters to die it's
not<00:06:45.910> about<00:06:46.910> you<00:06:47.420> know

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
not about you know

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.020 
not about you know
leveling<00:06:48.440> up<00:06:48.620> and<00:06:48.980> learning<00:06:49.580> new<00:06:49.880> skills

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
leveling up and learning new skills

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.910 
leveling up and learning new skills
inside<00:06:50.510> which<00:06:50.660> is<00:06:50.810> kind<00:06:51.200> of<00:06:51.260> about<00:06:51.380> not<00:06:51.650> dying

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:51.920 
inside which is kind of about not dying

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.500 
inside which is kind of about not dying
so<00:06:52.250> i<00:06:52.460> think<00:06:52.820> you<00:06:52.910> know<00:06:53.030> three<00:06:53.330> or<00:06:53.360> four

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.510 
so i think you know three or four

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.910 
so i think you know three or four
sessions<00:06:53.870> would<00:06:54.020> be<00:06:54.110> great<00:06:54.380> lengths<00:06:54.560> for<00:06:54.710> that

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:54.920 
sessions would be great lengths for that

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.560 
sessions would be great lengths for that
game<00:06:55.130> so<00:06:55.310> it<00:06:55.400> does<00:06:55.730> kind<00:06:56.030> of<00:06:56.060> depend<00:06:56.330> on<00:06:56.450> the

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:56.570 
game so it does kind of depend on the

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.220 
game so it does kind of depend on the
game<00:06:57.310> but<00:06:58.310> yeah<00:06:58.820> so<00:06:59.090> all<00:06:59.330> of<00:06:59.389> them<00:06:59.780> in

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:00.230 
game but yeah so all of them in

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.780 
game but yeah so all of them in
different<00:07:00.440> ways<00:07:00.740> for<00:07:01.070> different<00:07:01.130> games<00:07:01.520> I

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:01.790 
different ways for different games I

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.850 
different ways for different games I
guess<00:07:02.090> is<00:07:03.080> my<00:07:03.290> answer<00:07:03.440> to<00:07:03.560> that<00:07:03.650> question

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:03.860 
guess is my answer to that question

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.350 
guess is my answer to that question
