should they should do new things they

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.920 
should they should do new things they
should<00:00:42.840> add<00:00:42.989> natural<00:00:43.290> disaster<00:00:44.280> DLC<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.629> like

earthquakes yeah and floods and fires

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.189 
earthquakes yeah and floods and fires
cause<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.789> would<00:00:51.120> hate<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.329> get<00:00:51.600> flooded<00:00:51.930> one

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
cause I would hate to get flooded one

calling<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.710> my<00:00:52.770> lodestar<00:00:53.399> something<00:00:53.879> like

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
calling in my lodestar something like

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.060 
calling in my lodestar something like
that<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.079> think<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:55.530> they<00:00:55.680> would

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that but I think because they would

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.099 
that but I think because they would
alter<00:00:56.460> everybody<00:00:57.059> for<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> whole<00:00:57.660> map<00:00:57.930> I

alter everybody for the whole map I

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.479 
alter everybody for the whole map I

random throwback grenades yeah yeah so
what<00:01:27.299> do<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.450> think<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.659> think<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.960> would

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
create more interest I think that would

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.340 
create more interest I think that would
make<00:01:29.939> people<00:01:29.970> want<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.479> purchase<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.990> DLC

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
make people want to purchase the DLC

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.319 
make people want to purchase the DLC
especially<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.220> they<00:01:32.340> made<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.579> free<00:01:33.060> that

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
especially if they made it free that

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.640 
especially if they made it free that
would<00:01:33.450> make<00:01:33.570> me<00:01:33.720> play<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.049> game<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> lot<00:01:34.439> more

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
would make me play the game a lot more

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.840 
would make me play the game a lot more
just<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.979> be<00:01:35.070> able<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.280> figure<00:01:35.430> out<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.640> new

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.890 
little bit interesting yeah and she
poured<00:05:44.830> it<00:05:45.010> on<00:05:45.160> the<00:05:45.370> snake<00:05:45.610> okay<00:05:46.540> then<00:05:46.750> she

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
poured it on the snake okay then she

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.920 
poured it on the snake okay then she
eventually<00:05:47.170> dragged<00:05:47.740> a<00:05:47.890> little<00:05:48.130> trail<00:05:48.430> of<00:05:48.670> gas

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
think so oh my gosh that would just be

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.210 
think so oh my gosh that would just be
terrible<00:06:34.810> yeah<00:06:35.230> I<00:06:35.260> think<00:06:35.530> with<00:06:35.860> that<00:06:35.890> kind<00:06:36.160> of

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
terrible yeah I think with that kind of

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.500 
terrible yeah I think with that kind of
like<00:06:36.400> fire<00:06:36.700> like<00:06:36.730> I<00:06:37.090> know<00:06:37.180> you<00:06:37.240> can<00:06:37.420> get

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:37.510 
like fire like I know you can get

like fire like I know you can get
insurance<00:06:37.780> for<00:06:37.990> your<00:06:38.080> like<00:06:38.260> how

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:38.529 
insurance for your like how

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:40.319 
insurance for your like how
burning<00:06:38.829> down<00:06:38.949> or<00:06:39.129> whatever<00:06:39.309> that<00:06:39.549> count<00:06:40.209> is

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:40.329 
burning down or whatever that count is

00:06:40.329 --> 00:06:41.939 
burning down or whatever that count is
your<00:06:40.449> house<00:06:40.569> burning<00:06:40.869> down<00:06:40.959> I<00:06:41.289> think<00:06:41.709> it<00:06:41.829> would

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:41.949 
your house burning down I think it would

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:44.039 
your house burning down I think it would
if<00:06:42.459> it's<00:06:42.699> if<00:06:42.879> insurance<00:06:43.209> companies<00:06:43.659> work<00:06:43.929> the

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:44.049 
if it's if insurance companies work the

00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:45.299 
if it's if insurance companies work the
way<00:06:44.169> I<00:06:44.199> think<00:06:44.469> they<00:06:44.589> work<00:06:44.769> they<00:06:44.919> would<00:06:45.039> find<00:06:45.219> a

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:45.309 
way I think they work they would find a

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:47.699 
way I think they work they would find a
clause<00:06:45.519> that<00:06:45.569> counts<00:06:46.569> her<00:06:47.199> out<00:06:47.439> of<00:06:47.619> getting

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:47.709 
clause that counts her out of getting

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:49.859 
clause that counts her out of getting
any<00:06:47.979> money<00:06:48.189> because<00:06:48.369> it's<00:06:48.879> she<00:06:49.179> basically<00:06:49.539> let

00:06:49.859 --> 00:06:49.869 
any money because it's she basically let

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:51.299 
any money because it's she basically let
her<00:06:50.019> own<00:06:50.139> house<00:06:50.349> on<00:06:50.559> fire<00:06:50.739> yeah<00:06:51.129> it's<00:06:51.279> a

00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:51.309 
her own house on fire yeah it's a

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:53.249 
her own house on fire yeah it's a
stupidity<00:06:51.609> clause<00:06:51.969> i<00:06:52.149> think<00:06:52.389> yeah<00:06:52.479> i<00:06:52.869> don't

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:53.259 
stupidity clause i think yeah i don't

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:54.509 
stupidity clause i think yeah i don't
think<00:06:53.409> they<00:06:53.499> have<00:06:53.619> insurance<00:06:53.949> for<00:06:54.039> stupidity

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:54.519 
think they have insurance for stupidity

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:56.729 
think they have insurance for stupidity
