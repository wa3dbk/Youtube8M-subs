00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.700 
I'm going to show you how the
introduction<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.720> dive<00:01:36.930> bomber<00:01:37.200> goes<00:01:37.470> and

introduction to dive bomber goes and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.090 
introduction to dive bomber goes and
actually<00:01:37.829> might<00:01:38.070> cover<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.610> future<00:01:38.880> lesson

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
actually might cover in a future lesson

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.319 
actually might cover in a future lesson
it's<00:01:41.100> very<00:01:41.340> simple<00:01:41.729> but<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.909> think<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.210> been

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
it's very simple but I think it's been

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.730 
it's very simple but I think it's been
effective<00:01:42.810> can<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.049> get<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.259> both<00:01:43.439> hands

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
effective can you get in both hands

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:58.500 
effective can you get in both hands
there<00:01:44.009> okay

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.270 

okay<00:01:59.230> so<00:01:59.350> that's<00:01:59.620> the<00:01:59.740> introduction<00:02:00.040> I'll

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
okay so that's the introduction I'll

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.350 
okay so that's the introduction I'll
just<00:02:00.430> do<00:02:00.550> it<00:02:00.580> again<00:02:00.790> because<00:02:01.060> that's<00:02:01.120> all<00:02:01.300> I

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
just do it again because that's all I

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.360 
just do it again because that's all I
want<00:02:01.540> to<00:02:01.630> share<00:02:01.840> with<00:02:01.960> you<00:02:02.050> today<00:02:02.340> because<00:02:03.340> I

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
want to share with you today because I

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.200 
want to share with you today because I
think<00:02:03.460> dive-bomber

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
think dive-bomber

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.510 
think dive-bomber
deserves<00:02:04.900> a<00:02:05.080> few<00:02:05.260> videos<00:02:05.560> by<00:02:05.800> itself<00:02:06.220> which<00:02:06.400> we

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
deserves a few videos by itself which we

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.950 
deserves a few videos by itself which we
might<00:02:06.640> do<00:02:06.850> another<00:02:07.120> time<00:02:07.390> but<00:02:07.840> the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
might do another time but the

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.000 
might do another time but the
introduction<00:02:08.290> is<00:02:08.530> quite<00:02:09.460> simple<00:02:09.820> to<00:02:13.920> get<00:02:14.920> in

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
introduction is quite simple to get in

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.140 
introduction is quite simple to get in
both<00:02:15.160> hands

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.850
