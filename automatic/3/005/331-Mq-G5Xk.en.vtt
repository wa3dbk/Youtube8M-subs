00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
okay this is just a quick tip on

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.570 
okay this is just a quick tip on
steeping<00:00:08.790> your<00:00:08.910> grains<00:00:10.040> I've<00:00:11.040> did<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.370> video

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
steeping your grains I've did a video

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.160 
steeping your grains I've did a video
between<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.240> difference<00:00:12.540> between<00:00:12.690> mashing

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
between the difference between mashing

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.950 
between the difference between mashing
and<00:00:13.290> steeping<00:00:13.620> before<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.540> spoken<00:00:15.540> about<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
and steeping before and spoken about the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.990 
and steeping before and spoken about the
steeping<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.410> lot<00:00:16.529> before<00:00:16.859> but<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.490> still<00:00:17.820> get

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
steeping a lot before but I still get

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.439 
steeping a lot before but I still get
asked<00:00:18.359> every<00:00:18.449> week<00:00:19.020> at<00:00:19.170> least<00:00:19.380> once<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.800> week

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
asked every week at least once a week

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.670 
asked every week at least once a week
about<00:00:21.449> steeping<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.410> correct

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
about steeping and the correct

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.570 
about steeping and the correct
temperatures<00:00:23.570> and<00:00:24.570> all<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:24.930> sort<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.170> thing

temperatures and all that sort of thing

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.650 
temperatures and all that sort of thing
anyway<00:00:26.580> Stephen<00:00:27.090> if<00:00:27.180> you're<00:00:27.300> steeping<00:00:27.630> for

anyway Stephen if you're steeping for

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.359 
anyway Stephen if you're steeping for
grains<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.199> know<00:00:28.320> you're<00:00:28.680> making<00:00:28.980> an<00:00:29.039> extract

steep<00:00:42.510> some<00:00:42.899> greens<00:00:43.170> usually<00:00:43.710> only<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> couple

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
steep some greens usually only a couple

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.950 
steep some greens usually only a couple
of<00:00:44.250> hundred<00:00:44.309> grams<00:00:45.289> of<00:00:46.289> gramley<00:00:46.860> at<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.980> time

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
of hundred grams of gramley at a time

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
of hundred grams of gramley at a time
I've<00:00:48.960> got<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> hundred<00:00:49.350> grams<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.829> chocolate

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
I've got a hundred grams of chocolate

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.810 
I've got a hundred grams of chocolate
love<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.570> it's<00:00:51.570> already<00:00:51.750> been<00:00:51.989> cracked

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
love you it's already been cracked

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.340 
love you it's already been cracked
actually<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> bit<00:00:54.000> too<00:00:54.149> fine<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.809> dark

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
actually a bit too fine but this dark

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.869 
actually a bit too fine but this dark
chocolate<00:00:55.739> mode<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.010> really<00:00:56.039> really<00:00:56.579> brittle

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
chocolate mode is really really brittle

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.049 
chocolate mode is really really brittle
and<00:00:57.270> when<00:00:57.390> they<00:00:57.480> crack<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.870> tends<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.010> break<00:00:59.850> up

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
and when they crack it tends to break up

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.939 
and when they crack it tends to break up
into<00:01:00.239> bits

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
into bits

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.009 
into bits
okay<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.129> temperature<00:01:02.730> isn't<00:01:03.180> important

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
okay the temperature isn't important

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.440 
okay the temperature isn't important
really<00:01:04.650> steeping<00:01:06.799> people<00:01:07.799> say<00:01:08.010> don't<00:01:08.400> go<00:01:08.880> over

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
really steeping people say don't go over

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.320 
really steeping people say don't go over
the<00:01:09.900> around<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.560> 75<00:01:11.369> 80<00:01:11.640> degree<00:01:12.030> Celsius

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the around this 75 80 degree Celsius

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.410 
the around this 75 80 degree Celsius
mark<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.290> that's<00:01:14.220> only<00:01:14.430> because<00:01:14.729> you've<00:01:15.240> got

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
mark and that's only because you've got

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.270 
mark and that's only because you've got
a<00:01:15.450> chance<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.990> releasing<00:01:16.409> some<00:01:16.560> tenants<00:01:16.890> may

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
a chance of releasing some tenants may

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.820 
a chance of releasing some tenants may
be<00:01:17.610> small<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.119> small<00:01:18.450> amount<00:01:18.619> but<00:01:19.619> that's

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
be small in that small amount but that's

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.859 
be small in that small amount but that's
what<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:21.240> don't<00:01:21.509> want<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.780> go

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
what it is that you don't want to go

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.710 
what it is that you don't want to go
over<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> 80<00:01:22.259> degree<00:01:22.470> bar<00:01:23.509> anywhere<00:01:24.509> below

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
over the 80 degree bar anywhere below

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.719 
over the 80 degree bar anywhere below
that<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.259> fine<00:01:25.490> you<00:01:26.490> don't<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.090> put<00:01:28.020> those

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
that is fine you don't have to put those

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.280 
that is fine you don't have to put those
grains<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:30.030> water<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.420> stove<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.170> it

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
grains in water on the stove and have it

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.100 
grains in water on the stove and have it
heating<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.310> keeping<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.820> at<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:34.020> know

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
heating and keeping it at that you know

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.899 
heating and keeping it at that you know
a<00:01:34.140> 70<00:01:34.530> degree<00:01:34.619> temperature<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.549> half<00:01:35.729> an

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
a 70 degree temperature for that half an

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.510 
a 70 degree temperature for that half an
hour<00:01:36.030> that's<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.630> not<00:01:36.780> necessary<00:01:37.520> people

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
hour that's just not necessary people

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.969 
hour that's just not necessary people
see<00:01:38.820> how<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.000> used<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.780> do<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:41.810> boiling<00:01:42.810> water<00:01:43.170> 75

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
see how I used to do it boiling water 75

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.550 
see how I used to do it boiling water 75
degrees<00:01:44.340> 70<00:01:44.640> degrees<00:01:44.939> pouring<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> grain<00:01:46.170> mix

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
degrees 70 degrees pouring the grain mix

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.020 
degrees 70 degrees pouring the grain mix
it<00:01:46.680> up<00:01:46.799> put<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> lid<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.549> let<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.759> sit<00:01:48.000> for

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
it up put a lid on it and let it sit for

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.480 
it up put a lid on it and let it sit for
half<00:01:48.180> now<00:01:48.479> that's<00:01:48.899> all<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.320> have<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.619> do<00:01:49.770> but

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
half now that's all you have to do but

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.950 
half now that's all you have to do but
there's<00:01:50.700> an<00:01:50.790> even<00:01:50.880> easier<00:01:51.090> way<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.479> do<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.840> than

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
there's an even easier way to do it than

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.780 
there's an even easier way to do it than
that<00:01:52.130> and<00:01:53.130> that's<00:01:53.280> what<00:01:53.369> I'm<00:01:53.460> going<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.670> show

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
that and that's what I'm going to show

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.280 
that and that's what I'm going to show
you<00:01:53.850> today<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.360> called<00:01:54.479> cold<00:01:54.750> sleeping

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
you today it's called cold sleeping

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.289 
you today it's called cold sleeping
that's<00:01:55.920> how<00:01:56.100> unimportant<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.909> temperature

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
that's how unimportant the temperature

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.600 
that's how unimportant the temperature
is<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.689> steeping<00:01:58.110> your<00:01:58.710> air<00:01:58.920> specialty<00:01:59.490> but

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
is in steeping your air specialty but
