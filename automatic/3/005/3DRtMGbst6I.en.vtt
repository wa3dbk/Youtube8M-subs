00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.560
 something nice I am now living as a 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.860
 I do not know sleep times I always want 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.580

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.920
 I chizo and interested in myself I did everything to

 that for me to be here and well that 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.380
 was what what also happened and I'm 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.929
 happy because it would be something that 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.380
 I always longed for and that always from good 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.550
 is drunk for the first time a moment 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.619
 historic not being in santiago 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.869
 bernabéu 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.640
 surrounded by Colombians but above all 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.350
 of Madridistas who have clothed 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.659
 very much how has this feeling of 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.120
 jump towards is that for the first time that 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:47.420
 it's something unique is a day that I 'm never going to 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.780
 to forget is not something that always goes to 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.760
 keep in mind in me and well I hope that 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.130
 can give many joys to all the 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.980
 madridismo down the stairs when the 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.530
 box that feels when all the 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.460
 bernabéu 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.760
 approximately sixty thousand people who 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:09.140
 they had created is not something unique min that 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.170
 It also makes me happy because it 's something that 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.090
 I always dreamed and that I always yearned 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.990
 Since I am a child, I always want to be 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.960
 here in this great stadium a state 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.110
 historical and that for me is something big and 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.230
 I hope he plays here many matches 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.030
 good has lived a historical moment 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.040
 side of a stadium that is used to 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.830
 to get great things the last one that 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.380
 we have achieved here the real madrid has 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.140
 been the tenth as he has lived it because 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.240
 he was tucking the team in this 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.310
 way to the 'tenth' in the stadium and 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.520
 also very for example I was 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.630
 there 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.950
 I had the opportunity to be there with them 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.879
 and I really thought that 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.180
 someday I would be there not good to be 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.459
 here is a club that already has history 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.890
 who also wins title always and good 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.480
 I think I'm ready for this 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.060

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.610

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.890
 admirer of Christian ronaldo and also 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.870
 of Christian ronaldo who is his friend 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.660

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.239
 what does that mean I admire him a lot 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.799
 it is not not only him but everyone 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.349

 They long for what we all want too 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.670
 they have many challenges ahead 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.830
 many virtues we have seen their faults 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.260
 we have seen his goals but he wants 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.230

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.090

 well I can contribute the game I can 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.940
 provide passes I can contribute game but 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.190
 no I'm just a 1 more here I just want 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.270
 help for the team to get 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.820
 triumphs and why not titles has also 

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.870
 talked about being columbia madridista in 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.510
 your country there are many followers 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.460
 Madridistas also driven by the 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.320
 work of the foundation of Real Madrid 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.510
 there is the country where more schools 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.280
 of the foundation there are schools 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.950
 sociodeportives that reach the most 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.080
 disadvantaged how how will you feel your 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.870
 country the presence of a Colombian does not 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.420
 obviously they were always from here and 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.750
 now more than I am here surely 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:47.500
 they are going to support a lot here in madrid and 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.080
 surely now that they are 45 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.360
 million are going to be a Madridista insurance 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.160
 also a little by the figure of alfredo 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.010
 di stéfano that has already been remembered 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.270
 also in his presentation that he played in 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.360
 millionaires one of the great teams 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.280
 of your country like how you live in Colombia 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.580
 the figure of alfredo di stéfano is not 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:11.650
 something unique as well as here 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:14.140
 I think he did and his story already and good 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.050
 here and it's a big one that I think never 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.390
 let's forget you are able to take 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.790
 great challenges debuted in 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.950
 a country in the first division with 14 years 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.950
 also with 17 years give him a tournament 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.170
 opening in Argentina in strong buttock has 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.210
 lived many things and now has the 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.890
 challenge to bring the day of real madrid to 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.990
 the back but this afternoon accustomed 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:38.050
 to the great challenges if to me always 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.390
 like challenges I always like to win and I 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:44.020
 I think I'm in the ideal club 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:46.870
 to always win have a mentality 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.080
 winner I also have ambition for 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.480
 win always I think that that never goes 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.620
 to change a winning mentality that 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.050
 has also of course the real 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.450
 madrid has been signing in the room 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.210
 together your contract and you could see 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.310
 sure these ten European cups and the 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.280
 tournament is the trophy for the best club in 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.610
 20th century that tells you all this 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.830
 trophy collection not since I saw 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.470
 I knew that the club has 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.690
 history has also pressure for 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.120
 it is always always also win and 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.610
 when I saw all that I said I am in the in 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.129
 the ideal club 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.759
 to always win titles no and I 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:29.039
 I think I'm here to help and 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:30.389
 get titles also and after 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:32.759
 got this tenth cup that has been 

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.780
 the last one that has been incorporated of that 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:36.180
 row 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.889
 people already ask for the eleventh month if it is 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.379
 normal is normal because you are in a club 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:42.139
 who always wants to win and good to the 

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:45.379
 that this year 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:48.860
 we can win it and also league-cup 

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:50.300
 also to win everything when it has 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.980
 put on the shirt for the first time 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:56.120
 real madrid that has felt 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:07:00.560
 unique feeling that I will never forget 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:03.330
 I always dreamed of being there and well I 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.260
 I think this does not 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.830
 finish here 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:11.830
