hey there everyone this joel from jog

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.440 
hey there everyone this joel from jog
mining<00:00:15.560> just<00:00:16.560> wanted<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.920> show<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.190> my<00:00:17.550> latest

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
mining just wanted to show you my latest

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.450 
mining just wanted to show you my latest
machine<00:00:19.080> with<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> few<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.770> modifications

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
machine with a few of the modifications

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.750 
machine with a few of the modifications
that<00:00:20.550> I've<00:00:20.730> done<00:00:21.830> made<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.860> reversible<00:00:23.369> sluice

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
that I've done made a reversible sluice

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.240 
that I've done made a reversible sluice
box<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:25.020> it<00:00:25.170> will<00:00:25.260> actually<00:00:25.470> go<00:00:25.800> from<00:00:25.950> side<00:00:26.220> to

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
box so it will actually go from side to

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.390 
box so it will actually go from side to
side<00:00:28.369> changed<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.520> from<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.119> Keene<00:00:31.400> extension

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
side changed it from the Keene extension

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.720 
side changed it from the Keene extension
box<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> actual<00:00:33.600> Keene<00:00:33.900> 173<00:00:34.800> LS<00:00:35.220> which<00:00:35.520> is

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
box to the actual Keene 173 LS which is

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.830 
box to the actual Keene 173 LS which is
the<00:00:35.880> actual<00:00:36.360> upper<00:00:36.750> box<00:00:37.730> for<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.850> high

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the actual upper box for the high

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.650 
the actual upper box for the high
bankers<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.380> you<00:00:40.500> would<00:00:40.649> get<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.660> I

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
bankers that you would get and I

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.700 
bankers that you would get and I
actually<00:00:42.930> prefer<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.590> one<00:00:43.710> much<00:00:43.860> better

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
actually prefer this one much better

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.790 
actually prefer this one much better
anyway

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.530 

I've<00:00:49.800> swapped<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.490> sluice<00:00:50.760> box<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.240> it'll<00:00:51.420> go

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
I've swapped the sluice box so it'll go

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.620 
I've swapped the sluice box so it'll go
both<00:00:51.750> ways<00:00:52.520> got<00:00:53.520> rid<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.790> the<00:00:53.910> tailings<00:00:54.360> chute

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
both ways got rid of the tailings chute

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.740 
both ways got rid of the tailings chute
because<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.620> was<00:00:55.740> always<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.130> the<00:00:56.160> way<00:00:56.370> and

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
because it was always in the way and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.120 
because it was always in the way and
just<00:00:57.750> extended<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.260> cylinder<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.740> couple<00:00:59.040> of

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
just extended the cylinder a couple of

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.770 
just extended the cylinder a couple of
inches<00:00:59.280> which<00:00:59.580> actually<00:01:00.060> gave<00:01:00.330> me<00:01:00.360> the<00:01:00.630> same

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
inches which actually gave me the same

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.960 
inches which actually gave me the same
effect<00:01:02.540> also<00:01:03.540> changed<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> PVC<00:01:05.220> sprayer<00:01:05.700> in

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
effect also changed to a PVC sprayer in

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.630 
effect also changed to a PVC sprayer in
the<00:01:06.299> hopper<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:09.500> so<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.530> will<00:01:11.009> show<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.340> how

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the hopper and so I will show you how

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.330 
the hopper and so I will show you how
the<00:01:11.700> sluice<00:01:12.090> box<00:01:12.530> flips<00:01:13.530> from<00:01:13.710> side<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:13.979> side

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the sluice box flips from side to side

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.680 
the sluice box flips from side to side
and<00:01:14.520> then<00:01:14.640> I'll<00:01:14.760> take<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.030> camera<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.510> show

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
and then I'll take the camera and show

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.140 
and then I'll take the camera and show
you<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.900> hopper<00:01:16.260> just<00:01:16.850> looking<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:18.000> some

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
you the hopper just looking for some

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.980 
you the hopper just looking for some
feedback<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:20.030> get<00:01:21.030> everybody's<00:01:21.450> input<00:01:21.480> and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
feedback and get everybody's input and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:44.740 
feedback and get everybody's input and
see<00:01:22.140> what<00:01:22.290> they<00:01:22.380> think<00:01:22.440> of<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.830> okay

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.999 

I<00:01:44.780> don't<00:01:45.259> think<00:01:45.439> you're<00:01:45.560> going<00:01:45.680> to<00:01:45.740> get<00:01:45.860> it

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
I don't think you're going to get it

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.420 
I don't think you're going to get it
much<00:01:46.159> easier<00:01:46.369> than<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:48.130> takes<00:01:49.130> just<00:01:49.340> a

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
much easier than that takes just a

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.010 
much easier than that takes just a
matter<00:01:49.610> of<00:01:49.700> seconds<00:01:50.149> to<00:01:50.299> swap<00:01:50.539> it<00:01:50.689> from<00:01:50.840> side

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
matter of seconds to swap it from side

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.340 
matter of seconds to swap it from side
to<00:01:51.079> side<00:01:52.390> last<00:01:53.390> year<00:01:53.689> I<00:01:53.720> was<00:01:53.960> in<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.170> situation

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
to side last year I was in a situation

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.730 
to side last year I was in a situation
where<00:01:54.950> we<00:01:55.130> were<00:01:55.310> in<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:55.460> really<00:01:56.439> tight<00:01:57.439> quarters

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
where we were in a really tight quarters

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.249 
where we were in a really tight quarters
with<00:01:58.039> the<00:01:58.159> Machine<00:01:58.460> I<00:01:58.610> guess<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.780> we<00:01:59.810> had<00:02:00.229> a

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
with the Machine I guess and we had a

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.469 
with the Machine I guess and we had a
big<00:02:00.469> rock<00:02:00.710> that<00:02:01.039> was<00:02:01.820> interfering<00:02:02.329> with<00:02:02.450> our

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
big rock that was interfering with our

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.309 
big rock that was interfering with our
sluice<00:02:02.720> box<00:02:03.610> so<00:02:04.610> this<00:02:04.850> way<00:02:05.090> makes<00:02:06.049> it<00:02:06.170> really

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
sluice box so this way makes it really

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.960 
sluice box so this way makes it really
nice<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:06.860> give<00:02:07.009> you<00:02:07.130> a<00:02:07.189> little<00:02:07.250> bit<00:02:07.490> of<00:02:07.610> option

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
nice you give you a little bit of option

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.820 
nice you give you a little bit of option
to<00:02:08.090> go<00:02:08.239> either<00:02:08.420> way<00:02:08.539> let<00:02:09.440> me<00:02:09.470> show<00:02:09.679> you<00:02:09.769> that

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
to go either way let me show you that

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.930 
to go either way let me show you that
sprayer<00:02:10.250> in<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.489> hopper

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.979 

this<00:02:13.940> is<00:02:14.090> something<00:02:14.420> different<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.780> I'm

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
this is something different that I'm

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.630 
this is something different that I'm
trying<00:02:15.880> get<00:02:16.880> everybody's<00:02:17.860> input<00:02:18.860> on<00:02:19.220> it<00:02:19.250> see

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
trying get everybody's input on it see

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.710 
trying get everybody's input on it see
what<00:02:19.760> they<00:02:19.880> think<00:02:19.940> it's<00:02:20.360> pretty<00:02:20.569> well

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
what they think it's pretty well

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.850 
what they think it's pretty well
protected<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.470> hidden<00:02:23.410> so<00:02:24.410> there's<00:02:24.680> no

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
protected and hidden so there's no

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.199 
protected and hidden so there's no
chance<00:02:25.160> really<00:02:25.519> of<00:02:25.670> hitting<00:02:25.940> it<00:02:26.030> with

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
chance really of hitting it with

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.990 
chance really of hitting it with
anything<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.920> if<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.099> look<00:02:28.280> down<00:02:28.459> on<00:02:28.670> top<00:02:28.880> of

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
anything and if you look down on top of

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.070 
anything and if you look down on top of
the<00:02:29.060> hopper<00:02:30.190> it's<00:02:31.190> pretty<00:02:31.430> much<00:02:31.580> enclosed

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.410 

made<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.770> chain<00:02:38.040> guard<00:02:38.340> here<00:02:38.640> removable<00:02:39.240> this

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
made the chain guard here removable this

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.650 
made the chain guard here removable this
time<00:02:39.660> instead<00:02:40.020> of<00:02:41.060> just<00:02:42.060> flipping<00:02:42.270> up<00:02:42.510> and

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
time instead of just flipping up and

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.880 
time instead of just flipping up and
having<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.900> put<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.140> back<00:02:43.260> down<00:02:43.500> because

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
having to put it back down because

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.800 
having to put it back down because
sometimes<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.520> would<00:02:44.610> get<00:02:44.820> in<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.000> way<00:02:45.150> when

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
sometimes that would get in the way when

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.660 
sometimes that would get in the way when
you're<00:02:45.870> taking<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.530> apart<00:02:46.770> and<00:02:46.980> transporting

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
you're taking it apart and transporting
