00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.170
 in 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.540
 but 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.100
 and 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.320
 so I actually said that the 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.210
 last was my last dakar 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.160
 this year I'm leaving again so it was a 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.410
 little bit complicated even personally 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.059
 to come back a little on this decision 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.590
 it was the last then not because 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.970
 that I wanted to stop just because 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.570
 that I just find the imec at one time 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.980
 had to stop 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.540
 I was lucky to be able to recover 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.860
 a great motorcycle so it had 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.809
 been difficult to say no so that's it 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.519
 so there this year yes I got the 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.989
 bike motorcycle serial loans so 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.519
 a very very good bike is what 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.710
 it's almost a machined motorcycle we're going 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.940
 say so yeah that's a chance 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.010
 extraordinary to have a bike like that 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.449
 this year actually it's not beautiful 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.489
 recel on the bike is a new 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.739
 partner is the company baudin 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.930
 window lands does it since being 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.759
 dorcel so it's both simple and 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.500
 a little bit complicated it's just 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.720
 that I have a very good relationship and 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.220
 grégory rigaud razer the one who is afraid 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.300
 when I'm on the bike who's scared of 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.000
 to condone the fact that it's happening to me 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.289
 something and so like the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.729
 last were to be my last the 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:18.259
 condition this year actually it was 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.789
 one followed if I did not get on the bike 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.020
 I also took care of a team and so 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.670
 as I was leaving I was obliged to 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.720
 search for new partners and 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.030
 then so I had the chance to 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.649
 meet hervé bertrand mougins and 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.390
 so do it is done it seems I have 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.160
 a majority of my partners who me 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.560
 have been following since my first dakar 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.060
 as slovakia and that besides been 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.920
 my first sponsor for my first 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.509
 dakar so is always present at my 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.490
 sides and then new ones every year 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.990
 since actually there we grow a 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.659
 little bit with our assistance with 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.060
 all this so there are new ones from old 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.500
 and a final it's a nice family 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.700
 so this year I'm leaving in the 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.380
 same conditions as last year if 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.000
 had direct 4.4 assistance my 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.140
 mechanic and then my friend's back for 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.390
 take care of the whole communication part 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.040
 communication sané will happen a 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.990
 little bit like last year actually 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.180
 for us it will be on our site 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.560
 internet and on our facebook and that's 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.149
 also elements that we will bring 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.829
 to the maujean company that will communicate 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.810
 within their employees or people 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.489
 who wants to share the adventurous 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.720
 with ludovic so he will be in the 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.310
 assistance vehicle throughout the 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.110
 course that will film make the accounts 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.300
 day renderings so there should be 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.830
 have a very nice follow up as the year 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.230
 last I think my godfather it's 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.520
 always my us from Wednesday 8 and my 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.069
 godmother is always of course anna 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.810
 polina who was the muse of conceal my 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.310
 goals this year is to do 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.330
 better than what I could do so there 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.370
 now actually I'm more in 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.590
 bad motorcycle so I'm in category 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.930
 normal let's say last year I 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.400
 do 31st so this year I'd like 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.920
 to get into the 25 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.069
 so if I can get into the 25 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.630
 is that the declares will be well spent I 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.549
 would be very happy the dates to remember 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.500
 maintenance and 21 boarding of 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.910
 4.4 motorcycle vehicles for the harbor 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.410
 direction buenos aires there are three 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.150
 crossing weeks so its part m 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.690
 a little month before the departure of the 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.550
 race we take off 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.230
 around the 26th of December 27th for the 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.580
 start of the local rally january as 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.160

 last year I 'm leaving this year 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.390
 so I'm not going to say it's my last 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.560
 dakar maybe maybe not or can 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.460

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.180
 the 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.180
