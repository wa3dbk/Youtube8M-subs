the stores you'll find pre-made food you

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.620 
the stores you'll find pre-made food you
basically<00:01:15.189> just<00:01:15.280> add<00:01:15.640> water<00:01:16.000> to<00:01:16.299> it<00:01:16.329> it's

basically just add water to it it's

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.929 
basically just add water to it it's
generally<00:01:17.110> read<00:01:17.350> you<00:01:17.770> don't<00:01:18.070> have<00:01:18.399> to<00:01:18.610> do<00:01:18.759> that

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
generally read you don't have to do that

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.270 
generally read you don't have to do that
however<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.750> basic<00:01:20.200> recipe<00:01:20.649> that<00:01:20.860> I<00:01:20.890> find

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
however the basic recipe that I find

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.370 
however the basic recipe that I find
works<00:01:21.490> real<00:01:21.789> well<00:01:21.819> is<00:01:22.329> a<00:01:22.569> quarter<00:01:23.109> cup<00:01:23.289> of

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
works real well is a quarter cup of

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.279 
works real well is a quarter cup of
sugar<00:01:23.439> -<00:01:24.189> 1<00:01:24.219> cup<00:01:24.490> of<00:01:24.880> water<00:01:25.179> what<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:25.869> do<00:01:26.140> is

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
sugar - 1 cup of water what you do is

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:27.870 
sugar - 1 cup of water what you do is
you<00:01:26.380> put<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.590> quarter<00:01:26.860> cup<00:01:27.009> of<00:01:27.130> sugar<00:01:27.250> in<00:01:27.520> with

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
you put the quarter cup of sugar in with

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.840 
you put the quarter cup of sugar in with
the<00:01:27.939> cup<00:01:28.179> of<00:01:28.299> water<00:01:28.539> you<00:01:29.229> boil<00:01:29.590> it<00:01:29.829> up<00:01:29.950> just<00:01:30.700> to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
the cup of water you boil it up just to

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.059 
the cup of water you boil it up just to
the<00:01:30.939> boiling<00:01:31.179> point<00:01:31.390> you<00:01:32.200> let<00:01:32.350> it<00:01:32.500> cool<00:01:32.709> and

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
the boiling point you let it cool and

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:34.020 
the boiling point you let it cool and
then<00:01:33.250> you<00:01:33.429> put<00:01:33.579> it<00:01:33.700> in<00:01:33.789> the<00:01:33.880> hummingbird

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
then you put it in the hummingbird

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.630 
then you put it in the hummingbird
feeder<00:01:34.619> another<00:01:35.619> important<00:01:36.039> aspect<00:01:36.369> is<00:01:36.520> to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
feeder another important aspect is to

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.219 
feeder another important aspect is to
clean<00:01:36.909> the<00:01:37.030> hummingbird<00:01:37.420> feeders<00:01:37.750> each<00:01:37.929> time

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
clean the hummingbird feeders each time

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.539 
clean the hummingbird feeders each time
they<00:01:38.409> will<00:01:38.590> tend<00:01:38.829> to<00:01:38.950> get<00:01:39.039> a<00:01:39.100> little<00:01:39.340> bit<00:01:39.459> of

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
they will tend to get a little bit of

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.059 
they will tend to get a little bit of
mold<00:01:39.819> going<00:01:40.329> because<00:01:40.780> of<00:01:40.929> all<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.349> sugar<00:01:41.380> be
