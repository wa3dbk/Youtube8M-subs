00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
banned so I'm just going to enter see

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.240 
banned so I'm just going to enter see
there<00:01:50.960> under<00:01:51.960> 20,000<00:01:52.500> right<00:01:52.619> anything

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
there under 20,000 right anything

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.280 
there under 20,000 right anything
anything<00:01:54.060> under<00:01:54.360> 20,000<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:57.020> that's<00:01:58.020> under

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
anything under 20,000 so that's under

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.600 
anything under 20,000 so that's under
20,000<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.890> guess<00:01:59.070> and

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610
