00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
now it's one I'm going to be making up

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.460 
now it's one I'm going to be making up
some<00:00:01.890> strawberry<00:00:02.820> cheesecakes<00:00:03.629> now<00:00:04.230> these

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
some strawberry cheesecakes now these

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.440 
some strawberry cheesecakes now these
are<00:00:04.680> really<00:00:04.859> quick<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.310> simple<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:06.089> reason<00:00:06.390> I

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
are really quick and simple the reason I

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.150 
are really quick and simple the reason I
say<00:00:06.629> that<00:00:06.660> quick<00:00:07.049> is<00:00:07.440> because<00:00:07.830> there<00:00:08.010> is<00:00:08.040> no

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
say that quick is because there is no

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.430 
say that quick is because there is no
cooking<00:00:08.880> involved<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.719> just<00:00:10.110> put<00:00:10.320> them

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
cooking involved so you just put them

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.589 
cooking involved so you just put them
together<00:00:10.559> pop<00:00:11.340> them<00:00:11.490> in<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.670> fridge<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.389> when

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
together pop them in the fridge and when

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.379 
together pop them in the fridge and when
you<00:00:12.690> want<00:00:12.870> one<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.049> these<00:00:13.170> water<00:00:13.710> delish<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:14.940> if

grams<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:25.439> one<00:00:25.740> I've<00:00:25.920> chosen<00:00:26.220> use<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.720> 0%<00:00:27.720> fat

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
grams this one I've chosen use a 0% fat

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.650 
grams this one I've chosen use a 0% fat
so<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.560> want<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.949> keep<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> fat<00:00:29.369> content<00:00:29.670> down

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
so you want to keep the fat content down

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.590 
so you want to keep the fat content down
a<00:00:30.689> little<00:00:30.929> bit<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.679> can<00:00:31.920> use<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.610> 0%<00:00:33.329> fat

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
a little bit you can use the 0% fat

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.549 
a little bit you can use the 0% fat
version<00:00:34.640> Philadelphia<00:00:35.640> cheese<00:00:35.969> 180<00:00:36.870> grams<00:00:37.290> of

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
that again I sort of chose the lion

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.630 
that again I sort of chose the lion
version<00:00:40.379> because<00:00:40.620> we're<00:00:41.070> gonna<00:00:41.160> mix<00:00:41.399> these

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
version because we're gonna mix these

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.250 
version because we're gonna mix these
together<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.239> it's<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.719> little<00:00:42.930> bit<00:00:43.050> less

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
together and it's just a little bit less

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.369 
together and it's just a little bit less
fat<00:00:43.530> unless<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.219> need<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.430> now<00:00:44.820> also<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
fat unless you need it now also the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.549 
fat unless you need it now also the
vanilla<00:00:46.710> extract<00:00:47.270> roughly<00:00:48.270> about<00:00:48.390> 1<00:00:48.870> teaspoon

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
vanilla extract roughly about 1 teaspoon

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.160 
vanilla extract roughly about 1 teaspoon
of<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.950> now<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:50.910> do<00:00:51.180> need<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.539> sweeten<00:00:52.020> this

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
of that now we do need to sweeten this

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.680 
of that now we do need to sweeten this
so<00:00:52.500> I'm<00:00:52.590> going<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.829> use<00:00:52.949> 50<00:00:53.520> grams<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.210> caster

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
so I'm going to use 50 grams of caster

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.930 
so I'm going to use 50 grams of caster
sugar<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.890> we're<00:00:56.070> gonna<00:00:56.160> mix<00:00:56.430> those<00:00:56.699> together

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
sugar so we're gonna mix those together

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.970 
sugar so we're gonna mix those together
beat<00:00:57.449> them<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.719> little<00:00:57.960> bit<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.320> get<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> mixed

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
beat them a little bit and get a mixed

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.619 
beat them a little bit and get a mixed
up<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.609> that's<00:00:59.820> going<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.510> your

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
up and that's going to be one of your

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.770 
up and that's going to be one of your
layers<00:01:00.840> now<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.890> base<00:01:02.190> layer<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.940> gonna<00:01:03.510> be

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
layers now the base layer is gonna be

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.190 
layers now the base layer is gonna be
ginger<00:01:04.710> biscuits<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.640> could<00:01:06.420> use<00:01:06.630> digest

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
ginger biscuits you could use digest

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.050 
ginger biscuits you could use digest
this<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.740> think<00:01:07.830> ginger<00:01:08.400> biscuits<00:01:08.880> are

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
this but I think ginger biscuits are

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.210 
this but I think ginger biscuits are
really<00:01:09.420> nice<00:01:09.600> as<00:01:09.960> sort<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.320> base<00:01:10.530> layer<00:01:10.920> and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
really nice as sort of base layer and

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.520 
really nice as sort of base layer and
also<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.760> might<00:01:11.970> sprinkle<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.869> few<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.260> top

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
also I might sprinkle just a few on top

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.520 
also I might sprinkle just a few on top
as<00:01:13.710> well<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.970> know<00:01:15.060> I've<00:01:15.330> got<00:01:15.509> about<00:01:15.630> 100

those<00:01:21.840> up<00:01:21.869> we're<00:01:22.320> gonna<00:01:22.409> put<00:01:22.650> them<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.890> bag

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
those up we're gonna put them in a bag

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.760 
those up we're gonna put them in a bag
bash<00:01:23.759> them<00:01:23.970> down<00:01:24.210> get<00:01:24.869> them<00:01:24.930> into<00:01:25.229> crumbs<00:01:25.500> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
bash them down get them into crumbs and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.830 
bash them down get them into crumbs and
that<00:01:25.890> will<00:01:26.009> be<00:01:26.130> one<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> layers<00:01:26.759> now<00:01:27.750> I've

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that will be one of the layers now I've

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.100 
that will be one of the layers now I've
also<00:01:27.990> got<00:01:28.380> some<00:01:28.820> really<00:01:29.820> nice<00:01:30.299> strawberry<00:01:30.869> jam

strawberries I'm gonna you know just
slice<00:01:43.590> these<00:01:43.890> down<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.490> that's<00:01:44.700> gonna<00:01:44.909> be<00:01:45.090> one

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
slice these down and that's gonna be one

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.910 
slice these down and that's gonna be one
of<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.540> layers<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.140> you've<00:01:46.290> got<00:01:46.439> different

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
of the layers so you've got different

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.289

wits there and just give that a good

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.940 
wits there and just give that a good
thorough<00:03:08.079> mix<00:03:09.000> try<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.120> get<00:03:10.209> it<00:03:10.329> all<00:03:10.510> solve

thorough mix try and get it all solve
together<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.230> think<00:03:14.260> we<00:03:14.560> can<00:03:14.739> that<00:03:14.859> make

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069
