00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.030
 t6 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.030
 We are currently in the process of updating . 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.800
 Let's find out what changed. 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.800
 Of course I know everything. 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.039
 I 'm installing updates first. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.390
 I'm installing it. It's installed. 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.390
 I know this. 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.040
 It's more than build Six . 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.580

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.150
 Leave the options. 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:17.570
 First, let's listen to the server this time. 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:21.770
 I've made these items and I'm wondering what happened. 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:25.910
 Let's make a stick first. 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.070
 What's really good about this update is that we can combine 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:32.060
 The items are on top . 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:36.860
 I would always go down from the school all the time and go straight down. 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.869
 It is really nice to have a fair look at the top that floats on top 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.900
 You have a lot of work to do. 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.900
 Ah 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.080
 Well, that's how it's done. 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.830
 The shining Redstone would have been answered not loud. 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.470
 Oh, now I'm going to write this . 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.549
 Now, with this power rail 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.770
 I can make it . 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:12.530
 Power Ray 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.530

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.090

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:02.739
 And it's not security. No, no. 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:02.739
 If you do this in the cart, you get a normal output. 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.709
 This has been fixed What 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:17.200
