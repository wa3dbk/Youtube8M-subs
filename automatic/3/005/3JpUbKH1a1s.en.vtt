00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.640
 also kneading 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.280
 on the comments from the songs that I already 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.739
 previously showed 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.100
 here we only have to screw 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.769
 in the left hand 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.769
 we start with the fifth fifth with fifth strings 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:03.990
 like that, then rhythmic 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.990
 drawing then there are two free blows down 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:13.920
 two are muffled as you see here is limited 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.920
 on its gasoline let's say 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.619
 This is our first chord of inter with 5 strings 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:20.619
 on the fifth fret 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.780
 filter 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.200
 sister really 6 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.200
 first meal 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.550
 Yurik will 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.550
 head of 2 muffled blows 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.670
 then 4 open 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.670
 oyster bower 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.970
 hereafter again two muffled yet 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.420
 once! 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.420
 shovels 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.200
 can play like this here 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.200
 muffled 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.290
 I will 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.689
 but probably 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.400
 here is station 2 muffled gave flywheel 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.400
 30 species 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:32.760
 art class 1 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:35.159
 22 loose needles muffled yes not 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.859
 will go to the screw if when it was 6 of 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.480
 format is the sixth string with 1 ha 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:43.069
 we will finish the fourth window 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.069
 blade with 5 strings of 3 frets 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.270
 mighty ends 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.270
 but at first it was 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.840
 communication urge you straight so clearly 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.170
 it follows there are two muffled two 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.150
 free kick is never needed because 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.030
 that even the bands themselves play 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.049
 these songs are live performance on stage on 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.700
 concert they are always variational from 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.860
 performance that is somewhere so collect 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.209
 somewhere else the main basis 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.549
 you can add as you 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.680
 feel if you have some kind of extra gift 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.900
 played and not played which is not at all 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.239
 has no one why, because if a 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.510
 music itself sounds pictures and so clear and 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.319
 some little things they can just 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:34.609
 a little bit there are some shades 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.609
 add the main thing is what rhythm 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.930
 great blow you can not 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.930
 dance of choice 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.420
 let's go the main thing to remember 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.860
 so the first period with 5 string is 5 your 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.420
 that EU countries had 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.420
 36 per watt 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.560
 servant book with 5 string 3
