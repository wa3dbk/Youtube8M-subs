00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.900
 well the whole clear whole carlen 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.310
 Thought what we actually too 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.920
 we want to express finally 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.450
 also with red chili from the beginning on ours 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.100
 philosophy of life we climb with 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.070
 connect also to express 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.380
 a small camera sees and that was 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.809
 our slogan with us even today 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:05.790
 working idea actually came after the 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.610
 cap invest have us stuck 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.650
 physical mass taste 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.180
 actually the perfect ones 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.180
 climbing shoes in view had in ours 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.259
 head and graffiti 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.030
 we need our own now 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.920
 theater school means that we need 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.900
 So that's my name 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.630
 that was me creative part with that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.340
 The philosophies are stacked 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.170
 the same remains today 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.270
 We grew to become malsch 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.920
 to get some staff 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.950
 we still have the same place 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.380
 klein is run holegau and have her there 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.320
 in the house of your own workshop and the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.330
 school to develop everything and beside 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.729
 300 guests can with different 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.409
 climbers there are different ones 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.960
 opinions and so on 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.909
 welcome possible in 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.470
 my empire is the development 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.229
 workshop the prototype workshop of 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.540
 Rachel here all shoes are catching everyone 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.680
 models all the ideas we have come 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.240
 first of all here 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.940
 We have all our machines 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.640
 Here we work first on the 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.840
 make next to the prototype 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.840
 we make the pattern 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.910
 Patterns determine the whole 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.299
 the title of the sewing of the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.519
 the leather goes out of this pattern 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.810
 It then next to the sewing machine 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.299
 then I sew from the leather or 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.790
 imitation leather i put the shoe together 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.769
 From there, now consider the rubber 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.110
 remuneration which find sole he gets what 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.970
 for a building he gets that happens 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.660
 then here at the press there are the 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.340
 covers glued and pressed then goes 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.960
 Continue to the grinder of the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.880
 Here you will get the 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.060
 its fine with it so the still 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.860
 once perfectly sanded and then goes 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.130
 yes already tested outside with the a4 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.130
 avant 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.200
 now he's got to say is that 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.330
 our employees also climb themselves 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.280
 So we're testing ourselves 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.920
 develop ourselves and we get 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.860
 almost through the whole shoe because 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.240
 that still fascinates us again 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.440
 as I said next to me now 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.450
 already we have others 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.540
 product groups developed accessories 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.540
 But also for two years clothing 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.940
 introduced and those with the clothing 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:24.390
 we express actually also from what 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:27.240
 we for climbing, I think 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.730
 personally neither since 85 competitions or 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.490
 competitions climbed and I am by 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.650
 also profiteed climbers profited 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.180
 of which I am still but then 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.960
 I have more of my own goals again 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.570
 tracked 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.560
 not some place outside in nature 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.670
 with this world and it was still 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.570
 good is actually the gray eminence 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.280
 behind Richie about this this 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.370
 mutual fertilization is actually 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.210
 perfect without light and without me 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.210
 probably not
