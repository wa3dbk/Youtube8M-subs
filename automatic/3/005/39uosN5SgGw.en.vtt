00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
and are very detrimental to a team's

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.070 
and are very detrimental to a team's
play<00:00:10.980> it's<00:00:11.820> possible<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.540> there<00:00:12.719> are<00:00:12.840> more

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080

good<00:01:07.890> estimates<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.490> use<00:01:08.640> would<00:01:08.790> be<00:01:08.820> about<00:01:09.090> six

good estimates to use would be about six

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.700 
good estimates to use would be about six
seconds<00:01:09.780> with<00:01:09.900> HomeGuard<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.409> get<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
seconds with HomeGuard to get to the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.039 
seconds with HomeGuard to get to the
inner<00:01:10.860> towers<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.430> about<00:01:11.610> 25<00:01:12.360> seconds<00:01:12.810> or<00:01:12.900> so

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
inner towers and about 25 seconds or so

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.899 
inner towers and about 25 seconds or so
to<00:01:13.320> get<00:01:13.409> from<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.710> base<00:01:13.920> back<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.400> lane<00:01:14.610> and

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
to get from the base back to lane and

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.719 
to get from the base back to lane and
remember<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:15.869> okay<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.619> back<00:01:17.009> it's

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
remember that it's okay to back it's

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.640 
remember that it's okay to back it's
very<00:01:18.210> risky<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.780> stay<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.110> lane<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> long

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650

fighting 5v5 you have a teammate missing
for<00:01:36.119> whatever<00:01:36.299> reason<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.020> people<00:01:37.290> don't

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
for whatever reason and people don't

notice and they fight for v5 this can
simply<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.290> fixed<00:01:40.680> by<00:01:40.860> always<00:01:41.009> checking<00:01:41.579> your

simply be fixed by always checking your
mini-map<00:01:42.060> before<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> fight<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:43.500> most<00:01:43.740> often

mini-map before a fight but most often

mini-map before a fight but most often
what<00:01:44.280> happens<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.060> get<00:01:45.180> engaged<00:01:45.630> on

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
what happens is that you get engaged on

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.830 
what happens is that you get engaged on
4v5<00:01:46.649> getting<00:01:47.490> engaged<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.180> almost<00:01:48.450> always

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
4v5 getting engaged on is almost always

4v5 getting engaged on is almost always
the<00:01:49.020> worst<00:01:49.350> way<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.619> fight<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.159> even<00:01:50.399> more<00:01:50.579> so

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
the worst way to fight and even more so

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.880 
the worst way to fight and even more so
when<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.000> 45<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.320> need<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.649> back

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
when it's 45 so you just need to back

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.609 
when it's 45 so you just need to back
off<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.490> play<00:01:53.790> safe<00:01:54.180> even<00:01:55.140> if<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.409> have<00:01:55.500> to

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
off and play safe even if you have to

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.830 
off and play safe even if you have to
forfeit<00:01:55.979> objectives<00:01:56.520> fighting<00:01:57.000> 45<00:01:57.540> unless

forfeit objectives fighting 45 unless
you<00:01:57.990> have<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> significant<00:01:58.890> advantage<00:01:59.040> or<00:01:59.880> you

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
you have a significant advantage or you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.370 
you have a significant advantage or you
have<00:02:00.149> something<00:02:00.450> such<00:02:00.630> as<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.780> tower<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.140> help

you<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.680> fight<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.070> always<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.909> bad<00:02:03.180> idea<00:02:03.210> as

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
you in the fight is always a bad idea as

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.959 
you in the fight is always a bad idea as
the<00:02:04.170> fight<00:02:04.439> will<00:02:04.649> likely<00:02:04.890> cost<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.490> much<00:02:05.670> more

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
the fight will likely cost you much more

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.300 
the fight will likely cost you much more
than<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.240> giving<00:02:06.630> up<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.840> objective<00:02:07.350> avoid

the engage simply by playing safe until

in correlation with the last one the

in correlation with the last one the
fourth<00:02:14.239> mistake<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.719> people<00:02:14.840> make<00:02:15.019> is

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
fourth mistake that people make is

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.509 
fourth mistake that people make is
trying<00:02:15.409> to<00:02:15.590> take<00:02:15.680> objectives<00:02:16.250> when<00:02:16.430> you

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
trying to take objectives when you

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.910 
trying to take objectives when you
should<00:02:16.670> be<00:02:16.790> elsewhere<00:02:17.329> this<00:02:18.109> is<00:02:18.319> probably<00:02:18.739> the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
should be elsewhere this is probably the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.949 
should be elsewhere this is probably the
one<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.099> bothers<00:02:19.310> me<00:02:19.549> the<00:02:19.700> most<00:02:19.819> people<00:02:20.719> take

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
one that bothers me the most people take

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.479 
one that bothers me the most people take
an<00:02:21.109> inhibitor<00:02:21.560> when<00:02:21.709> their<00:02:21.829> team<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.159> left<00:02:22.370> to

an inhibitor when their team is left to

an inhibitor when their team is left to
fight<00:02:22.670> for<00:02:22.700> v5<00:02:23.239> which<00:02:23.480> they<00:02:23.629> would<00:02:23.780> have

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
fight for v5 which they would have

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.110 
fight for v5 which they would have
easily<00:02:24.260> won<00:02:24.650> if<00:02:24.829> you<00:02:24.920> were<00:02:25.069> there<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.489> then

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
easily won if you were there and then

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.940 
easily won if you were there and then
the<00:02:26.209> enemy<00:02:26.480> team<00:02:26.689> just<00:02:26.900> pushes<00:02:27.290> for<00:02:27.500> game<00:02:27.680> if

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
the enemy team just pushes for game if

would have faced the enemy team and then

would have faced the enemy team and then
gone<00:02:31.250> on<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.519> kill<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.790> Nexus<00:02:32.180> right

teamfights is almost always a terrible
idea<00:04:35.020> unless<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.620> enemy<00:04:35.980> carries<00:04:36.400> are<00:04:36.550> out<00:04:36.670> of

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
idea unless the enemy carries are out of

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.540 
idea unless the enemy carries are out of
position<00:04:37.080> you<00:04:38.080> simply<00:04:38.500> just<00:04:38.680> jump<00:04:39.010> in<00:04:39.190> and<00:04:39.400> get

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
position you simply just jump in and get

bursted<00:04:40.030> instantly<00:04:40.600> and<00:04:40.840> maybe<00:04:41.290> if<00:04:41.410> you're

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
bursted instantly and maybe if you're

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.110 
bursted instantly and maybe if you're
lucky<00:04:41.590> you<00:04:41.980> take<00:04:42.190> down<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.370> target<00:04:42.760> or<00:04:42.820> two<00:04:42.910> but

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
most of the time the enemy team will

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.470 
most of the time the enemy team will
just<00:04:44.830> 5v1<00:04:45.370> you<00:04:45.760> while<00:04:45.970> your<00:04:46.150> team<00:04:46.360> is

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480

jumped in so far away from them because

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.560 
jumped in so far away from them because
