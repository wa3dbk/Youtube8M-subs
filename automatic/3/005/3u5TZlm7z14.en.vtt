you're above that level because you'll

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.900

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
above a level for a location it lowers

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.290 
above a level for a location it lowers
you<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.859> maximum<00:01:02.250> level<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:02.940> allowed

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
you to the maximum level that is allowed

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.960 
to be in that area I guess you could say
so<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.549> area<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.450> level<00:01:09.869> 3<00:01:10.409> 4<00:01:10.950> &amp;<00:01:11.250> 6<00:01:11.670> at

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970
