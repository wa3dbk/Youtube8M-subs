00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.860
 and there personal on the kleberson figure 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.269
 lÃ©o and neymar 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.450
 and today I will answer the question of 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.190
 guilherme silva which is the following hello 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.070
 I wanted to know if the best way to play 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.359
 guitar is with reeds in vane he 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.640
 This question does not have an answer. 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.949
 direct can not really get there and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.750
 talking about attending is better or worse 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.570
 the choice of playing with a pick does not go 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.640
 depend on some things eg the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.079
 style of music that we play let's go 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.070
 suppose you want to change a sambinha 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.020
 on guitar 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.120
 in this case the best option is to play without 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.680
 toothpick because using all the fingers 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.670
 people have more features than using 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.770
 your pick 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.170
 now if you're going to play a pop song 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.640
 rock usually has those full chords 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.640
 loose strings that sound good to 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.980
 Damn guitar is cooler zabaleta 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.870
 in fact I think the coolest is a 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.520
 thing that makes the difference of face when 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.449
 we play with a pickle just the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.399
 guitar timbre 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.930
 This is another factor that has to be 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.049
 taken into account before we choose 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.610
 if you will play with or without reed repairs 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.920
 that completes the guitar's timbre is 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.820
 sharpest, this is going to 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.530
 I like everyone 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.689
 there are people who prefer the most acute team 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.100
 even installed but there are people who 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.200
 prefers the most closed team 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.140
 Another important factor is the difficulty 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.670
 technique for example some fingering 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.830
 which are much more practical if people 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.780
 play without a paddle and at the same time has 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.640
 soils that are much more practical if 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.470
 people use the palette mainly if they 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.740
 is a faster solo 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.810
 summarizing overall play with jacket or 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.979
 it will not depend on the style of music 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.770
 or the timbre that people are looking for 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.270
 instrument and the technical difficulty and 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.170
 people can find depending on what 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.299
 will be played 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.369
 if you have difficulty choosing 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.930
 between one way and another, just try 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.299
 there is no mystery 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.850
 picks up a song you play using the 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.130
 then touch the way you 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.659
 feel more comfortable probably 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.390
 It will be the best way to play. 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.680
 beauty is this I hope these tips have 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.119
 helped a little and whoever has more 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.890
 any doubt about it 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.469
 leave a comment here as soon as 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.710
 give us a hug and responds to 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.710
 next
