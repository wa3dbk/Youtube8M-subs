00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
this I think from the in this Disney

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.369 
this I think from the in this Disney
cartoon<00:03:13.250> vision<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:13.939> think<00:03:14.599> that<00:03:14.840> this<00:03:15.109> is<00:03:15.349> a

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
cartoon vision I think that this is a

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.250 
cartoon vision I think that this is a
fantastic<00:03:16.069> scene<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.699> a<00:03:16.730> croquet<00:03:17.659> plane<00:03:18.019> with

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
fantastic scene the a croquet plane with

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.679 
fantastic scene the a croquet plane with
hedgehogs<00:03:18.739> and<00:03:18.949> flamingos<00:03:19.579> and<00:03:20.329> when<00:03:20.509> she's

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:20.689 
hedgehogs and flamingos and when she's

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:22.780 
hedgehogs and flamingos and when she's
going<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:20.959> get<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.109> Flamingo<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:21.680> say<00:03:21.979> to<00:03:22.549> stay

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
going to get the Flamingo to say to stay

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.349 
going to get the Flamingo to say to stay
straight<00:03:23.269> but<00:03:24.229> once<00:03:24.620> again<00:03:27.430> just<00:03:28.430> great<00:03:28.970> stuff

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
straight but once again just great stuff

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.439 
straight but once again just great stuff
I<00:03:29.599> think<00:03:30.530> that<00:03:30.829> this<00:03:31.040> this<00:03:31.340> is<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.970> trial

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:32.449 
I think that this this is the trial

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.259 
I think that this this is the trial
scene<00:03:32.810> at<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.079> end<00:03:33.199> of<00:03:33.409> the<00:03:33.620> book<00:03:34.030> think<00:03:35.030> that

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
scene at the end of the book think that

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.379 
scene at the end of the book think that
this<00:03:35.509> just<00:03:36.109> as<00:03:36.349> a<00:03:36.379> general<00:03:36.859> pop-up<00:03:37.579> piece<00:03:37.819> even

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
this just as a general pop-up piece even

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:39.939 
this just as a general pop-up piece even
though<00:03:38.569> it's<00:03:38.750> not<00:03:38.900> as<00:03:39.079> the<00:03:39.199> library<00:03:39.590> as<00:03:39.739> some

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:39.949 
though it's not as the library as some

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:41.520 
though it's not as the library as some
of<00:03:40.069> the<00:03:40.159> ones<00:03:40.310> that<00:03:40.729> we've<00:03:40.909> seen<00:03:41.120> previously

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
of the ones that we've seen previously

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.649 
of the ones that we've seen previously
this<00:03:42.530> is<00:03:42.919> just<00:03:43.400> it's<00:03:43.669> a<00:03:43.819> beautiful<00:03:44.389> scene

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
this is just it's a beautiful scene

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.689 
this is just it's a beautiful scene
somehow<00:03:45.079> I<00:03:45.259> think<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.889> way<00:03:46.009> that<00:03:46.250> there's<00:03:46.489> so

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:46.699 
somehow I think the way that there's so

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:48.429 
somehow I think the way that there's so
many<00:03:46.879> cards<00:03:47.389> sticking<00:03:47.750> at<00:03:47.870> all<00:03:47.989> sorts<00:03:48.379> of

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
many cards sticking at all sorts of

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.369 
many cards sticking at all sorts of
angles<00:03:48.759> not<00:03:49.759> just<00:03:50.060> on<00:03:50.389> like<00:03:50.629> sort<00:03:51.019> of<00:03:51.049> layers

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
angles not just on like sort of layers

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:52.929 
angles not just on like sort of layers
of<00:03:51.530> these<00:03:51.949> are<00:03:52.159> in<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.340> front<00:03:52.549> these<00:03:52.699> are<00:03:52.849> at

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:52.939 
of these are in the front these are at

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:54.580 
of these are in the front these are at
the<00:03:53.000> back<00:03:53.150> you<00:03:53.299> got<00:03:53.449> them<00:03:53.810> sticking<00:03:54.290> out<00:03:54.409> and

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
the back you got them sticking out and

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.099 
the back you got them sticking out and
literally<00:03:55.040> 45<00:03:55.430> degree<00:03:55.909> angles<00:03:56.329> 30<00:03:56.659> degree

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
literally 45 degree angles 30 degree

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.530 
literally 45 degree angles 30 degree
angles<00:03:57.530> straight<00:03:58.340> out<00:03:58.549> forward<00:03:59.150> straight

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
angles straight out forward straight

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.259 
angles straight out forward straight
upwards<00:04:00.019> it's<00:04:00.680> just<00:04:01.009> another<00:04:01.489> great<00:04:01.879> little

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
upwards it's just another great little

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.170 
upwards it's just another great little
piece<00:04:02.509> that<00:04:02.870> it<00:04:03.319> really<00:04:03.889> looks<00:04:04.129> somehow<00:04:04.639> more

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
piece that it really looks somehow more

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.020 
piece that it really looks somehow more
3d<00:04:05.810> than<00:04:06.109> it<00:04:06.259> should<00:04:06.530> do<00:04:06.680> so<00:04:06.709> I<00:04:07.310> think<00:04:07.669> this<00:04:07.969> is

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
3d than it should do so I think this is

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.490 
3d than it should do so I think this is
the<00:04:08.209> sort<00:04:08.449> of<00:04:08.479> thing<00:04:08.689> you<00:04:08.870> can<00:04:08.989> see<00:04:09.199> a<00:04:09.229> picture

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
the sort of thing you can see a picture

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.279 
the sort of thing you can see a picture
of<00:04:09.739> on<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.310> internet<00:04:10.819> and<00:04:11.419> it<00:04:11.780> wouldn't<00:04:12.049> quite

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:12.289 
of on the internet and it wouldn't quite

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:15.039 
of on the internet and it wouldn't quite
look<00:04:12.560> real<00:04:12.799> that<00:04:13.129> sort<00:04:13.400> of<00:04:13.519> a<00:04:13.759> level<00:04:14.479> of<00:04:14.569> 3d

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
look real that sort of a level of 3d

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.399 
look real that sort of a level of 3d
effect<00:04:15.849> right<00:04:16.849> we'll<00:04:17.599> have<00:04:17.750> a<00:04:17.780> quick<00:04:18.079> look<00:04:18.289> at

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:18.409 
effect right we'll have a quick look at

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:20.560 
effect right we'll have a quick look at
some<00:04:18.440> of<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.829> scenes<00:04:19.070> here<00:04:19.549> fold<00:04:20.120> out<00:04:20.329> from
