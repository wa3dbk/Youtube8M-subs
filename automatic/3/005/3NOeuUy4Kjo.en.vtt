spread<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.229> out<00:01:54.229> right<00:01:55.229> up<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.560> whether

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
spread it out right up to whether

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.359 
spread it out right up to whether
sausages<00:01:58.310> do<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.490> with<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.700> rest<00:01:59.850> of<00:02:00.000> them

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
sausages do that with the rest of them

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.709 
sausages do that with the rest of them
so<00:02:02.369> I've<00:02:02.460> got<00:02:02.640> all<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.850> fillings<00:02:03.180> spread<00:02:03.540> out

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
so I've got all the fillings spread out

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.950 
so I've got all the fillings spread out
so<00:02:04.110> that's<00:02:04.820> already<00:02:05.820> now<00:02:06.570> what<00:02:06.689> I'm<00:02:06.780> going<00:02:06.930> to

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
so that's already now what I'm going to

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.719 
so that's already now what I'm going to
use<00:02:07.140> here<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.439> I've<00:02:07.590> got<00:02:07.619> some<00:02:07.920> beaten<00:02:08.340> egg<00:02:08.459> and

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
use here is I've got some beaten egg and

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.200 
use here is I've got some beaten egg and
what<00:02:09.239> we're<00:02:09.330> gonna<00:02:09.390> do<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.690> run

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
what we're gonna do is just run

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.660 
what we're gonna do is just run
along<00:02:10.450> there<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:10.930> this<00:02:11.590> helps<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.100> Sealy<00:02:12.490> out

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
along there and this helps the Sealy out

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.120 
along there and this helps the Sealy out
after<00:02:13.210> you've<00:02:13.330> rolled<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.690> up<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.890> I'm<00:02:14.980> just

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
after you've rolled it up so I'm just

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.360 
after you've rolled it up so I'm just
going<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.370> do<00:02:15.490> that<00:02:15.700> for<00:02:15.970> all<00:02:16.210> of<00:02:16.240> those<00:02:17.370> we're

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
going to do that for all of those we're

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.240 
going to do that for all of those we're
going<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:18.610> put<00:02:18.760> this<00:02:19.170> same<00:02:20.170> beat<00:02:20.410> an<00:02:20.590> egg<00:02:20.740> we're

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
going to put this same beat an egg we're

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.980 
going to put this same beat an egg we're
going<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.490> put<00:02:21.820> that<00:02:21.940> on<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.180> outside<00:02:22.330> once

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
going to put that on the outside once

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.680 
going to put that on the outside once
it's<00:02:23.200> been<00:02:23.410> rolled<00:02:23.650> up<00:02:24.240> I'm<00:02:25.240> just<00:02:25.480> going<00:02:25.630> to

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
it's been rolled up I'm just going to

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.140 
it's been rolled up I'm just going to
roll<00:02:25.840> these<00:02:26.050> arm<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:27.400> you<00:02:27.460> literally<00:02:27.880> just

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
roll these arm so you literally just

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.050 
roll these arm so you literally just
roll<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.870> around<00:02:28.960> if<00:02:29.860> there's<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.130> bit<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.400> stuff

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
roll it around if there's a bit of stuff

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.480 
roll it around if there's a bit of stuff
oozing<00:02:31.240> out<00:02:31.630> then<00:02:31.870> just<00:02:32.680> squeeze<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.130> back<00:02:33.250> in

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
oozing out then just squeeze it back in

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.980 
oozing out then just squeeze it back in
because<00:02:33.820> you<00:02:33.910> want<00:02:34.030> plenty<00:02:34.270> of<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.630> fill<00:02:34.840> in

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
because you want plenty of the fill in

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:46.650 
because you want plenty of the fill in
there<00:02:37.950> just<00:02:38.950> roll<00:02:39.130> that<00:02:39.280> round<00:02:39.550> so<00:02:45.480> again<00:02:46.480> for

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
there just roll that round so again for

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.510 
there just roll that round so again for
this<00:02:46.780> one<00:02:46.990> I<00:02:47.170> mean<00:02:47.890> obviously<00:02:48.040> when<00:02:48.370> you're

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
this one I mean obviously when you're

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.700 
this one I mean obviously when you're
cutting<00:02:48.760> your<00:02:48.940> pastry<00:02:49.570> do<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.170> make<00:02:50.350> sure

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
cutting your pastry do you make sure

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.310 
cutting your pastry do you make sure
that<00:02:50.740> there's<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.250> little<00:02:51.400> bit<00:02:51.580> extra<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:53.260> you

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
that there's a little bit extra so you

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.530 
that there's a little bit extra so you
can<00:02:55.110> make<00:02:56.110> it<00:02:56.350> wrap<00:02:56.650> over<00:02:57.070> itself<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:57.730> I'll

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
can make it wrap over itself so I'll

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.880 
can make it wrap over itself so I'll
just<00:02:58.720> carry<00:02:58.930> on<00:02:59.080> for<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.350> rest<00:02:59.440> of<00:02:59.800> those

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
just carry on for the rest of those

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.280 
just carry on for the rest of those
don't<00:03:00.340> worry<00:03:00.550> about<00:03:00.700> using<00:03:01.270> out<00:03:01.420> as<00:03:01.690> it's<00:03:02.170> all

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
don't worry about using out as it's all

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.440 
don't worry about using out as it's all
the<00:03:02.410> flavors<00:03:02.860> there<00:03:03.010> so<00:03:03.880> I've<00:03:03.940> got<00:03:04.120> those<00:03:04.270> all

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
the flavors there so I've got those all

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.210 
the flavors there so I've got those all
finished<00:03:04.870> there's<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.260> little<00:03:05.470> join<00:03:05.680> there<00:03:05.980> and

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
finished there's a little join there and

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.220 
finished there's a little join there and
the<00:03:06.370> obviously<00:03:07.000> seals<00:03:07.240> it<00:03:07.420> up<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:08.020> can<00:03:08.140> always

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
the obviously seals it up you can always

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.230 
the obviously seals it up you can always
squash<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.770> end<00:03:08.920> up<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.610> that's<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:10.000> side

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
squash the end up and that's the side

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.790 
squash the end up and that's the side
we're<00:03:10.480> going<00:03:10.570> to<00:03:10.630> put<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:10.930> down<00:03:11.050> on<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.350> baking

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
we're going to put it down on the baking

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.280 
we're going to put it down on the baking
tray<00:03:11.980> so<00:03:12.730> I'm<00:03:13.030> going<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.180> transfer<00:03:13.660> these<00:03:13.900> onto

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
tray so I'm going to transfer these onto

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.380 
tray so I'm going to transfer these onto
a<00:03:14.320> baking<00:03:14.560> tray<00:03:14.830> next<00:03:15.430> just<00:03:15.850> before<00:03:16.180> I<00:03:16.210> put

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
a baking tray next just before I put

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.150 
a baking tray next just before I put
them<00:03:16.450> onto<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.780> baking<00:03:16.960> tray<00:03:17.320> I'm<00:03:18.010> actually

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
them onto the baking tray I'm actually

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.840 
them onto the baking tray I'm actually
going<00:03:18.550> to<00:03:18.640> chop<00:03:19.510> them<00:03:19.660> into<00:03:19.960> three<00:03:20.550> so<00:03:21.550> I'll<00:03:21.700> do

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
going to chop them into three so I'll do

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.850 
going to chop them into three so I'll do
that<00:03:22.060> for<00:03:22.300> all<00:03:22.390> of<00:03:22.600> those<00:03:22.750> now<00:03:23.560> I've<00:03:23.650> laid<00:03:23.800> my

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
that for all of those now I've laid my

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.310 
that for all of those now I've laid my
sausage<00:03:24.580> rolls<00:03:24.850> on<00:03:25.240> some<00:03:25.660> greaseproof<00:03:25.990> paper

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
sausage rolls on some greaseproof paper

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.470 
sausage rolls on some greaseproof paper
and<00:03:27.100> there's<00:03:27.460> a<00:03:27.490> baking<00:03:27.910> tray<00:03:28.090> underneath

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
and there's a baking tray underneath

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.600 
and there's a baking tray underneath
because<00:03:29.260> I<00:03:29.350> think<00:03:29.530> using<00:03:29.770> the<00:03:29.950> grease<00:03:30.340> proof

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
because I think using the grease proof

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.970 
because I think using the grease proof
paper<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:31.750> helps<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.410> prevent<00:03:32.740> them<00:03:32.950> from

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
paper it helps to prevent them from

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.090 
paper it helps to prevent them from
sticking<00:03:33.250> so<00:03:33.730> much<00:03:34.500> so<00:03:35.500> I've<00:03:35.590> got<00:03:35.770> me<00:03:35.890> beaten

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
sticking so much so I've got me beaten

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.580 
sticking so much so I've got me beaten
egg<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:37.360> I'm<00:03:37.480> just<00:03:37.630> going<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.870> put<00:03:38.080> that<00:03:38.110> on

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
egg and I'm just going to put that on

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
egg and I'm just going to put that on
the<00:03:38.710> outside<00:03:39.420> of<00:03:40.420> all<00:03:40.600> the<00:03:40.750> sausage<00:03:41.110> rolls

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
the outside of all the sausage rolls

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.720 
the outside of all the sausage rolls
it's<00:03:42.610> helps<00:03:42.940> to<00:03:43.030> give<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.270> a<00:03:43.330> nice<00:03:43.480> shine<00:03:43.870> and

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
it's helps to give it a nice shine and

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.210 
it's helps to give it a nice shine and
beer<00:03:45.730> color<00:03:46.320> so<00:03:47.320> I'm<00:03:47.410> just<00:03:47.560> going<00:03:47.740> to<00:03:47.770> continue

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
beer color so I'm just going to continue

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.730
