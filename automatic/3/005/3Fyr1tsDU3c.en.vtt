00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
I've been playing my very first lesson

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.039

was<00:01:45.720> March<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.409> fourth<00:01:46.790> so<00:01:47.810> that's<00:01:48.810> why<00:01:49.020> I

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
was March the fourth so that's why I

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.800 
was March the fourth so that's why I
took<00:01:49.229> all<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.710> nails<00:01:49.890> down<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.450> am<00:01:51.600> getting

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
took all the nails down and I am getting

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.510 
took all the nails down and I am getting
adjusted<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:54.210> saxophone<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.520> they're

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
adjusted to the saxophone so they're

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.990 
adjusted to the saxophone so they're
growing<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.450> my<00:01:57.780> nails<00:01:57.990> are<00:01:58.140> growing<00:01:58.259> back

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
growing so my nails are growing back

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.280 
growing so my nails are growing back
yeah<00:02:00.000> but<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.540> needed<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.899> take<00:02:01.049> them<00:02:01.259> down

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
yeah but I just needed to take them down

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.550 
yeah but I just needed to take them down
just<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.130> can<00:02:02.250> learn<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.670> play<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.850> sex

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
just so I can learn to play the sex

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.280 
just so I can learn to play the sex
because<00:02:04.560> I've<00:02:04.710> never<00:02:04.920> played<00:02:05.130> before<00:02:05.479> so<00:02:06.479> it's

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
because I've never played before so it's

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.749

something<00:02:07.619> I've<00:02:07.740> always<00:02:07.860> wanted<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.369> do<00:02:08.520> so

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
something I've always wanted to do so

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.670 
something I've always wanted to do so
I've<00:02:08.879> just<00:02:09.060> gone<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.629> taken<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.739> plunge

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
I've just gone and taken the plunge
