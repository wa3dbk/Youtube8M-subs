okay<00:00:00.510> so<00:00:00.570> this<00:00:00.690> is<00:00:00.780> basically<00:00:00.900> my<00:00:01.140> analysis<00:00:02.070> of

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
okay so this is basically my analysis of

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.949 
okay so this is basically my analysis of
the<00:00:02.460> new<00:00:02.730> nether<00:00:03.149> reacts<00:00:03.540> call<00:00:03.689> this<00:00:03.780> going<00:00:03.929> to

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
the new nether reacts call this going to

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.440 
the new nether reacts call this going to
be<00:00:04.080> added<00:00:04.380> in<00:00:04.560> northpoint<00:00:05.339> 5.0<00:00:05.910> so<00:00:06.089> Jay<00:00:06.270> burn

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
be added in northpoint 5.0 so Jay burn

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.480 
be added in northpoint 5.0 so Jay burn
hartson<00:00:06.930> basically<00:00:07.379> live<00:00:07.589> streamed<00:00:07.919> this

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
hartson basically live streamed this

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.520 
hartson basically live streamed this
some<00:00:08.760> video<00:00:09.090> that<00:00:09.150> I'm<00:00:09.360> analyzing<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:10.139> he

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
some video that I'm analyzing and he

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.070 
some video that I'm analyzing and he
shows<00:00:10.800> us<00:00:11.010> how<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.280> craft<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.450> uses<00:00:12.660> six

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
shows us how to craft it and it uses six

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.870 
shows us how to craft it and it uses six
iron<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.679> three<00:00:14.009> diamonds<00:00:14.429> craft<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.849> i

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
iron and three diamonds craft and i

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.460 
iron and three diamonds craft and i
believe<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.210> going<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.389> be<00:00:15.509> in<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:16.080> kind<00:00:16.320> of

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
believe is going to be in this kind of

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.769 
believe is going to be in this kind of
crafting<00:00:16.920> pattern<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.760> through<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.630> top

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
crafting pattern so through the top

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:19.760 
crafting pattern so through the top
three<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.109> middle<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.470> three<00:00:19.650> at<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
three in the middle and three at the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.160 
three in the middle and three at the
bottom<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.160> then<00:00:20.760> he's<00:00:20.970> also<00:00:21.150> we<00:00:21.660> also<00:00:21.810> need

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
bottom and then he's also we also need

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.779 
bottom and then he's also we also need
um<00:00:22.439> for<00:00:22.710> gold<00:00:22.920> blocks<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.430> create<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
um for gold blocks to create the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.189 
um for gold blocks to create the
structure<00:00:24.029> around<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.660> actual<00:00:25.050> nether

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
structure around the actual nether

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.859 
structure around the actual nether
reactor<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.430> that's<00:00:26.580> actually<00:00:26.849> 36<00:00:27.539> gold

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
reactor so that's actually 36 gold

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.500 
reactor so that's actually 36 gold
ingots<00:00:28.320> which<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.890> quite<00:00:29.160> crazy<00:00:29.580> how<00:00:30.210> if<00:00:30.420> you

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
ingots which is quite crazy how if you

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.209 
ingots which is quite crazy how if you
had<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> big<00:00:31.019> mind<00:00:31.289> that'd<00:00:31.619> be<00:00:31.710> quite<00:00:31.830> cool<00:00:32.070> by

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
had a big mind that'd be quite cool by

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.100 
had a big mind that'd be quite cool by
like<00:00:32.399> how<00:00:32.550> its<00:00:32.700> end<00:00:32.910> game<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.719> if<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:33.899> just

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
like how its end game so if we just

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.630 
like how its end game so if we just
started<00:00:34.530> off<00:00:34.760> we<00:00:35.760> can<00:00:36.000> see<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.960> basically

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
started off we can see that basically

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.430 
started off we can see that basically
glowstone<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.910> actually<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.379> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
glowstone is actually in the in the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.190 
glowstone is actually in the in the
inventory<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.820> crafting<00:00:42.390> imagery<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.170> I

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
inventory on the crafting imagery so I

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.299 
inventory on the crafting imagery so I
believe<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.620> going<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.800> be<00:00:43.860> using<00:00:44.040> for

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
believe is going to be using for

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.490 
believe is going to be using for
glowstone<00:00:45.030> dust<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.989> believe<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.469> should

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
glowstone dust and I believe it should

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.139 
glowstone dust and I believe it should
be<00:00:46.829> able<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.039> be<00:00:47.100> crafted<00:00:47.489> without<00:00:47.670> crafting

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
be able to be crafted without crafting

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.170 
be able to be crafted without crafting
bench<00:00:48.270> i'm<00:00:48.570> like<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.440> pc<00:00:49.950> version<00:00:49.980> yeah<00:00:50.910> so

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
bench i'm like in the pc version yeah so

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.100 
bench i'm like in the pc version yeah so
i<00:00:51.210> think<00:00:51.360> that's<00:00:51.539> quite<00:00:51.690> cool<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.079> can

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
i think that's quite cool and you can

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.720 
i think that's quite cool and you can
also<00:00:52.289> see<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> nether<00:00:52.680> reactor<00:00:52.860> below<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.520> um

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
also see the nether reactor below it um

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.880 
also see the nether reactor below it um
and<00:00:54.539> then<00:00:54.690> we're<00:00:54.870> also<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.559> watch<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
and then we're also going to watch the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.560 
and then we're also going to watch the
dev<00:00:56.070> dub<00:00:56.309> around<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.789> bit<00:00:56.940> while<00:00:57.149> look<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
dev dub around a bit while look with the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.680 
dev dub around a bit while look with the
gold<00:00:57.780> block<00:00:58.579> yeah<00:00:59.579> he<00:00:59.910> ducks<00:01:00.210> around<00:01:00.329> then<00:01:00.629> he

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
gold block yeah he ducks around then he

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.209 
gold block yeah he ducks around then he
finally<00:01:00.840> file<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.500> finds<00:01:01.680> at<00:01:01.800> me<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:01.949> there<00:01:02.100> is

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
finally file and finds at me on there is

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.070 
finally file and finds at me on there is
so<00:01:02.789> then<00:01:02.969> basically<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.329> also<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
so then basically you also see that the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.740 
so then basically you also see that the
eaters<00:01:04.439> mood<00:01:04.710> from<00:01:05.220> above<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.030> thingamajig

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
eaters mood from above the thingamajig

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.230 
eaters mood from above the thingamajig
to<00:01:06.900> above<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.250> top<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.490> screen<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.210> i

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
to above it to a the top of screen so i

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.330 
to above it to a the top of screen so i
think<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.750> because<00:01:10.080> I'm<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.710> was<00:01:10.890> your

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
think this is because I'm it was your

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.530 
think this is because I'm it was your
fingers<00:01:11.729> were<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> way<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.510> sometimes

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
fingers were in the way of it sometimes

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.690 
fingers were in the way of it sometimes
if<00:01:13.020> using<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.380> d-pad<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.280> think<00:01:14.490> that's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
if using the d-pad so I think that's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.460 
if using the d-pad so I think that's
quite<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.060> good<00:01:15.240> change<00:01:15.450> hopefully<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:16.409> were

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
quite a good change hopefully we were

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.320 
quite a good change hopefully we were
able<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.680> customize<00:01:17.159> where<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.880> then

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
able to customize where it is and then

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.940 
able to customize where it is and then
in<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.630> chess<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.350> see<00:01:19.470> there's<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.770> new

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
in this chess we can see there's a new

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.740 
in this chess we can see there's a new
item<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.729> saw<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.939> two<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.390> believe<00:01:21.450> that's

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
item and it saw the two I believe that's

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.170 
item and it saw the two I believe that's
lava<00:01:22.020> however<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.950> could<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.700> something<00:01:24.000> like

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
lava however it could be something like

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.999 
lava however it could be something like
invisible<00:01:24.540> bedrock<00:01:24.990> something<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.799> think

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
invisible bedrock something and I think

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.289 
invisible bedrock something and I think
we<00:01:26.130> should<00:01:26.159> ignore<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:27.000> he<00:01:27.119> probably

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
we should ignore this as he probably

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.390 
we should ignore this as he probably
hacked<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.689> into<00:01:27.900> test<00:01:28.080> around<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.500> lava<00:01:28.710> for

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
hacked it into test around with lava for

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.850 
hacked it into test around with lava for
a<00:01:29.430> new<00:01:29.729> update<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> future<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.740> think

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
a new update in the future so I think

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.710 
a new update in the future so I think
that's<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:32.610> he's<00:01:32.700> basically<00:01:33.060> doing<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.600> it

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
that's what he's basically doing with it

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.050 
that's what he's basically doing with it
um<00:01:33.869> i<00:01:34.409> don't<00:01:34.740> i'm<00:01:34.920> not<00:01:34.950> certain<00:01:35.280> or<00:01:35.610> not<00:01:35.759> but

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
um i don't i'm not certain or not but

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.270 
um i don't i'm not certain or not but
just<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.840> go<00:01:37.049> with<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.380> guess<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.100> if<00:01:38.220> we

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
just like go with that I guess so if we

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.560 
just like go with that I guess so if we
just<00:01:38.430> carry<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:38.880> he's<00:01:39.060> gonna<00:01:39.150> get<00:01:39.299> on<00:01:39.420> some

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
just carry on he's gonna get on some

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.149 
just carry on he's gonna get on some
iron<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.020> actually<00:01:40.290> build<00:01:40.439> them<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.740> reactor

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
iron to actually build them to reactor

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.920 
iron to actually build them to reactor
so<00:01:41.670> we're<00:01:41.850> gonna<00:01:41.970> skip<00:01:42.090> here<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.600> watch<00:01:42.750> him

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
so we're gonna skip here to watch him

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.649 
so we're gonna skip here to watch him
build<00:01:43.170> director<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.970> nether<00:01:44.970> reactor<00:01:45.149> it

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
build director and the nether reactor it

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.050 
build director and the nether reactor it
doesn't<00:01:46.500> if<00:01:47.250> he<00:01:47.280> actually<00:01:47.430> kicks<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.850> doesn't

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
doesn't if he actually kicks it doesn't

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.490 
doesn't if he actually kicks it doesn't
really<00:01:48.180> have<00:01:48.420> much<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.750> description<00:01:49.110> it's

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
really have much of a description it's

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.230 
really have much of a description it's
basically<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.159> core<00:01:50.430> with<00:01:50.610> another<00:01:50.850> reactor

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
basically the core with another reactor

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.050 
basically the core with another reactor
but<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.899> like<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.590> crafting<00:01:53.250> recipe<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:53.970> I

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
but I like the crafting recipe for I

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.300 
but I like the crafting recipe for I
think<00:01:54.240> that's<00:01:54.360> quite<00:01:54.540> cool<00:01:55.009> so<00:01:56.009> then<00:01:56.219> he

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
think that's quite cool so then he

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.590 
think that's quite cool so then he
finally<00:01:56.520> crafts<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.329> then<00:01:57.420> we're<00:01:57.570> just

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
finally crafts it and then we're just

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.380 
finally crafts it and then we're just
going<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.869> go<00:01:57.990> through<00:01:58.310> we<00:01:59.310> also<00:01:59.490> see<00:01:59.820> mushroom

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
going to go through we also see mushroom

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.330 
going to go through we also see mushroom
spread<00:02:00.689> here<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.469> really<00:02:01.799> noticeable<00:02:02.189> I

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
spread here and it's really noticeable I

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.100 
spread here and it's really noticeable I
think<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.700> spawn<00:02:03.000> rate<00:02:03.270> all<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.689> grow<00:02:03.840> rate

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
think the spawn rate all the grow rate

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.020 
think the spawn rate all the grow rate
or<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.710> spread<00:02:05.009> rate<00:02:05.189> was<00:02:05.340> way<00:02:05.490> too<00:02:05.549> high<00:02:05.850> for

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
or the spread rate was way too high for

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.639 
or the spread rate was way too high for
this<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.329> think<00:02:06.570> he<00:02:06.750> probably<00:02:06.780> nerfed<00:02:07.320> and

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
this so I think he probably nerfed and

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.380 
this so I think he probably nerfed and
he<00:02:07.710> did<00:02:07.860> say<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.550> video<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.910> was<00:02:09.000> corrupt

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
he did say in the video that was corrupt

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.260 
he did say in the video that was corrupt
so<00:02:09.629> hopefully<00:02:10.140> he<00:02:10.259> did<00:02:10.470> do<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.849> we<00:02:11.849> also<00:02:12.000> see

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
so hopefully he did do that we also see

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.880 
so hopefully he did do that we also see
this<00:02:12.540> new<00:02:12.870> little<00:02:13.110> basically

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
this new little basically

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.610 
this new little basically
item<00:02:14.550> description<00:02:15.090> or<00:02:15.390> out<00:02:15.569> naming<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.260> it's

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
item description or out naming and it's

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.740 
item description or out naming and it's
when<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:16.830> change<00:02:17.100> an<00:02:17.220> item<00:02:17.610> up<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.510> brand

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
when you change an item up this is brand

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.449 
when you change an item up this is brand
new<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:18.990> this<00:02:19.350> looks<00:02:19.500> quite<00:02:19.709> cool<00:02:19.740> by<00:02:20.220> things

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
new and this looks quite cool by things

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.040 
new and this looks quite cool by things
going<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.670> get<00:02:20.790> bit<00:02:21.000> annoying<00:02:21.240> so<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.930> hope

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
going to get bit annoying so I hope

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.470 
going to get bit annoying so I hope
there's<00:02:22.230> an<00:02:22.290> option<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.590> turn<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.490> off<00:02:23.640> but<00:02:24.330> um

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
there's an option to turn it off but um

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.809 
there's an option to turn it off but um
this<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.959> basically<00:02:25.410> because<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:26.040> pc<00:02:26.430> we<00:02:26.670> could

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
this is basically because in pc we could

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.240 
this is basically because in pc we could
hover<00:02:27.000> over<00:02:27.420> items<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:28.380> see<00:02:28.560> their<00:02:28.740> name<00:02:28.920> so

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
hover over items to see their name so

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.040 
hover over items to see their name so
this<00:02:29.400> won't<00:02:29.610> Phylly<00:02:29.910> help<00:02:30.330> people<00:02:30.930> who<00:02:31.020> are

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
this won't Phylly help people who are

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.810 
this won't Phylly help people who are
new<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.440> game<00:02:31.620> learn<00:02:32.250> what<00:02:32.280> they<00:02:32.640> are<00:02:32.790> I

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
new to the game learn what they are I

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.840 
new to the game learn what they are I
guess<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.780> if<00:02:33.870> we<00:02:33.900> just<00:02:34.110> carry<00:02:34.320> on<00:02:34.640> now<00:02:35.640> this<00:02:35.790> is

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
guess so if we just carry on now this is

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.030 
guess so if we just carry on now this is
him<00:02:36.090> building<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.720> actual<00:02:37.050> reactor<00:02:37.320> so<00:02:37.740> uses

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
him building the actual reactor so uses

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.449 
him building the actual reactor so uses
for<00:02:38.700> gold<00:02:39.270> blocks<00:02:40.170> which<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.560> quite<00:02:40.830> crazy<00:02:41.100> did

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
for gold blocks which is quite crazy did

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.160 
for gold blocks which is quite crazy did
mess<00:02:41.760> up<00:02:41.790> right<00:02:41.970> then<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.900> if<00:02:42.959> we<00:02:43.050> just

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
mess up right then so if we just

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.660 
mess up right then so if we just
switched<00:02:43.380> his<00:02:43.530> diamond<00:02:43.830> pickaxe<00:02:44.160> as<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.459> says

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
switched his diamond pickaxe as it says

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.600 
switched his diamond pickaxe as it says
so<00:02:45.270> it's<00:02:45.540> quite<00:02:45.810> crazy<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.560> actually<00:02:46.890> use

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
so it's quite crazy to actually use

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.090 
so it's quite crazy to actually use
basically<00:02:48.239> I<00:02:48.390> think<00:02:48.750> it's<00:02:49.440> gonna<00:02:49.560> be<00:02:49.709> pretty

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
basically I think it's gonna be pretty

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.550 
basically I think it's gonna be pretty
insane<00:02:50.820> except<00:02:51.780> I'm<00:02:51.959> it<00:02:52.080> does<00:02:52.230> give<00:02:52.410> some

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
insane except I'm it does give some

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.100 
insane except I'm it does give some
endgame<00:02:53.160> like<00:02:53.820> objectives<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.660> actual

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
endgame like objectives to the actual

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.930 
endgame like objectives to the actual
game<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.680> think<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.070> quite<00:02:56.400> cool<00:02:56.760> and

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
game so I think that is quite cool and

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.930 
game so I think that is quite cool and
then<00:02:57.570> he<00:02:57.930> um<00:02:58.170> he's<00:02:58.620> all<00:02:58.739> like<00:02:58.860> stops<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.580> bit<00:02:59.790> and

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
then he um he's all like stops a bit and

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.190 
then he um he's all like stops a bit and
he<00:03:00.060> just<00:03:00.239> looks<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.510> screen<00:03:00.780> for<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:01.050> few

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
he just looks the screen for a few

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.440 
he just looks the screen for a few
minutes<00:03:01.350> but<00:03:01.980> then<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.550> skipped<00:03:03.090> something<00:03:03.239> out

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
minutes but then I skipped something out

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.240 
minutes but then I skipped something out
then<00:03:03.720> he<00:03:03.810> uses<00:03:04.140> some<00:03:04.290> cobblestone<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:05.040> build

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
then he uses some cobblestone to build

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.850 
then he uses some cobblestone to build
the<00:03:05.790> actual<00:03:06.180> frame<00:03:06.510> around<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.230> reactor<00:03:07.709> I'm

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
the actual frame around the reactor I'm

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.199 
the actual frame around the reactor I'm
not<00:03:08.070> sure<00:03:08.130> if<00:03:08.400> you're<00:03:08.519> able<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.850> use<00:03:09.000> a

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
not sure if you're able to use a

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.850 
not sure if you're able to use a
different<00:03:09.720> item<00:03:09.840> but<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.230> think<00:03:10.440> cobblestone

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
different item but I think cobblestone

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.070 
different item but I think cobblestone
looks<00:03:11.100> cool<00:03:11.370> with<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.820> it<00:03:12.239> used<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.540> be<00:03:12.660> iron

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
looks cool with it it used to be iron

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.680 
looks cool with it it used to be iron
blocks<00:03:13.470> which<00:03:13.769> I<00:03:13.890> thought<00:03:14.070> was<00:03:14.220> pretty

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
blocks which I thought was pretty

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.690 
blocks which I thought was pretty
extreme<00:03:15.690> so<00:03:16.320> thankfully<00:03:16.860> he<00:03:16.950> changed<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.459> and

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
extreme so thankfully he changed it and

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.949 
extreme so thankfully he changed it and
I<00:03:17.760> was<00:03:17.850> going<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.030> put<00:03:18.180> down<00:03:18.329> the<00:03:18.480> reactor<00:03:18.810> and

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
I was going to put down the reactor and

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.539 
I was going to put down the reactor and
you<00:03:19.079> see<00:03:19.410> you<00:03:19.799> put<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.100> in<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.250> middle<00:03:20.400> and

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
you see you put it in the middle and

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.210 
you see you put it in the middle and
then<00:03:21.390> you<00:03:21.480> put<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.959> cobblestone<00:03:22.769> on<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.040> gold

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
then you put the cobblestone on the gold

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.060 
then you put the cobblestone on the gold
blocks<00:03:23.519> around<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:24.150> like<00:03:24.360> so<00:03:24.769> so<00:03:25.769> I<00:03:25.799> think<00:03:25.890> this

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
blocks around it like so so I think this

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.060 
blocks around it like so so I think this
is<00:03:26.130> quite<00:03:26.280> cool<00:03:26.579> bassy<00:03:27.120> frame<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:27.930> it's<00:03:28.410> it's

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
is quite cool bassy frame and it's it's

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.190 
is quite cool bassy frame and it's it's
much<00:03:29.340> more<00:03:29.519> different<00:03:29.700> 2<00:03:30.000> pc<00:03:30.450> so<00:03:30.720> this<00:03:30.840> is<00:03:30.959> sort

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
much more different 2 pc so this is sort

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.860 
much more different 2 pc so this is sort
of<00:03:31.230> PE<00:03:32.010> exclusive<00:03:32.820> which<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:33.030> quite<00:03:33.180> cool<00:03:33.360> then

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
of PE exclusive which is quite cool then

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.630 
of PE exclusive which is quite cool then
he<00:03:33.959> clicks<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:35.040> says<00:03:35.220> not<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.489> correct

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
he clicks it and it says not the correct

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.039 
he clicks it and it says not the correct
pattern<00:03:35.880> that's<00:03:36.239> because<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.510> frame<00:03:36.750> wasn't

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
pattern that's because the frame wasn't

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.870 
pattern that's because the frame wasn't
in<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.170> right<00:03:37.290> area<00:03:37.739> around<00:03:38.430> her<00:03:38.670> so<00:03:38.790> I<00:03:38.820> think

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
in the right area around her so I think

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.850 
in the right area around her so I think
it's<00:03:39.060> quite<00:03:39.120> like<00:03:39.570> it's<00:03:40.019> amazing<00:03:40.410> how<00:03:40.739> he's

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
it's quite like it's amazing how he's

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.130 
it's quite like it's amazing how he's
done<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.040> so<00:03:41.790> this<00:03:42.209> also<00:03:42.390> shows<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.780> you

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
done it so this also shows that you

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.810 
done it so this also shows that you
don't<00:03:43.350> have<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.650> like<00:03:43.799> hit<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.130> with<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.340> certain

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
don't have to like hit it with a certain

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.610 
don't have to like hit it with a certain
block<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.180> activator<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.660> just<00:03:45.870> punch<00:03:46.380> it

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
block to activator you just punch it

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.490 
block to activator you just punch it
basically<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.640> then<00:03:47.850> he<00:03:48.269> gets<00:03:48.989> out<00:03:49.140> his<00:03:49.290> sword

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
basically so then he gets out his sword

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.340 
basically so then he gets out his sword
ready<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:50.100> punch<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:50.840> it's<00:03:51.840> gonna<00:03:52.230> be

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
ready to punch it and it's gonna be

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.479 
ready to punch it and it's gonna be
quite<00:03:52.500> shocking<00:03:52.860> it<00:03:52.980> hadn't<00:03:53.190> seen<00:03:53.370> this

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
quite shocking it hadn't seen this

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.460 
quite shocking it hadn't seen this
before<00:03:53.640> because<00:03:53.910> it's<00:03:54.120> quite<00:03:54.299> an<00:03:54.420> egg<00:03:54.900> like<00:03:55.230> I

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
before because it's quite an egg like I

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.770 
before because it's quite an egg like I
was<00:03:56.010> not<00:03:56.160> expecting<00:03:56.310> this<00:03:56.610> so<00:03:57.390> he<00:03:57.480> punched

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
was not expecting this so he punched

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.539 
was not expecting this so he punched
then<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.019> says<00:03:58.140> active<00:03:58.650> client<00:03:59.130> messages<00:03:59.430> so<00:03:59.489> I

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
then it says active client messages so I

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.560 
then it says active client messages so I
think<00:03:59.640> we're<00:03:59.790> gonna<00:03:59.880> see<00:04:00.090> a<00:04:00.120> few<00:04:00.329> more<00:04:00.450> of

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
think we're gonna see a few more of

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.810 
think we're gonna see a few more of
those<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.690> in<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.440> box<00:04:01.650> sort<00:04:01.920> of<00:04:01.980> they<00:04:02.489> they

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
those and in the box sort of they they

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.360 
those and in the box sort of they they
spread<00:04:03.239> into<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:03.840> weird<00:04:04.260> kind<00:04:04.769> of<00:04:04.890> new<00:04:05.070> block

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
spread into this weird kind of new block

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.670 
spread into this weird kind of new block
and<00:04:05.579> it<00:04:05.880> gives<00:04:06.030> on<00:04:06.150> ritalin<00:04:06.540> like<00:04:06.690> effects<00:04:07.380> so

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
and it gives on ritalin like effects so

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.229 
and it gives on ritalin like effects so
then<00:04:07.829> all<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.130> zombie<00:04:08.370> pigmen<00:04:08.670> spawned<00:04:09.000> they

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
then all the zombie pigmen spawned they

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.759 
then all the zombie pigmen spawned they
finally<00:04:09.570> notice<00:04:09.900> him<00:04:10.049> they<00:04:10.530> go<00:04:10.650> around

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
finally notice him they go around

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.620 
finally notice him they go around
attacking<00:04:11.010> him<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.459> this<00:04:11.820> block<00:04:12.180> actually

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
attacking him and this block actually

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.330 
attacking him and this block actually
made<00:04:12.750> me<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:12.870> bit<00:04:12.959> confused<00:04:13.380> it<00:04:13.590> looks<00:04:14.250> like

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
made me a bit confused it looks like

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.250 
made me a bit confused it looks like
invisible<00:04:14.790> bedrock<00:04:15.450> because<00:04:16.019> that's<00:04:16.200> what

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
invisible bedrock because that's what

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.630 
invisible bedrock because that's what
invisible<00:04:16.739> bird<00:04:16.829> where<00:04:17.010> it<00:04:17.070> looks<00:04:17.250> like<00:04:17.340> if

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
invisible bird where it looks like if

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.400 
invisible bird where it looks like if
you<00:04:17.760> mind<00:04:18.030> it<00:04:18.209> however<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:18.870> do<00:04:18.930> actually

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
you mind it however I do actually

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.199 
you mind it however I do actually
believe<00:04:19.979> it's<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.250> painting<00:04:20.489> just<00:04:20.789> if<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:21.060> did

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
believe it's a painting just if you did

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.300 
believe it's a painting just if you did
see<00:04:21.419> it<00:04:21.539> it<00:04:21.810> is<00:04:22.140> definitely<00:04:22.349> not<00:04:22.650> like<00:04:22.890> am

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
see it it is definitely not like am

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.409 
see it it is definitely not like am
actual<00:04:23.669> block<00:04:23.849> because<00:04:24.030> it's<00:04:24.180> not<00:04:24.270> in<00:04:24.330> a

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
actual block because it's not in a

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.060 
actual block because it's not in a
square<00:04:24.690> it's<00:04:25.140> not<00:04:25.289> a<00:04:25.320> cube<00:04:25.650> even<00:04:25.890> it's<00:04:26.010> a

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
square it's not a cube even it's a

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.800 
square it's not a cube even it's a
square<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:26.760> that's<00:04:26.970> a<00:04:27.030> painting<00:04:27.450> just<00:04:27.539> in<00:04:27.690> case

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
square so that's a painting just in case

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.980

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
video the next one and basically it

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.249

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:47.930 
creates this huge obelisk in the actual
world<00:04:46.349> so<00:04:46.860> it's<00:04:46.979> a<00:04:47.069> bit<00:04:47.280> of<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.370> grief<00:04:47.610> thing<00:04:47.819> it
