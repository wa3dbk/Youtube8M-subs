00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.250
 Please admit that you have the 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.470
 mountaineer reinhold messner not 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.059
 believed when he told of the yeti 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.210
 but it really exists since then 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.860
 trekking from 1965, the yeti is the first 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.779
 off-road vehicle from the house skoda 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.670
 despite familial similarity with the 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.510
 roomster agrees with this only 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.760
 interior concept match 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.740
 he is more comfortable than athletic 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.720
 Designed to be designed chassis 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.550
 as solid and the steering is clean 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.469
 Voted despite higher emphasis 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.289
 He also masters fleet turns 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.359
 without noticeable lateral tilt after getting 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.690
 the yeti hides from the world for so long 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:43.609
 he now appears even in several 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.559
 equipment lines active vision and 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.889
 experience is part of the basic equipment 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.149
 among other things seven airbags abs esp 

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:53.659
 Anti-skid control and a 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.309
 electronic differential lock in the 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.539
 civilization makes the yeti quite 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.879
 not a bad figure 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.039
 the figure of the fast-paced savage 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.070
 presents itself with model dimensions of four 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.829
 meter 22 length and 1 meter 69 height 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.340
 the engine range of the yeti includes five 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:12.289
 four-cylinder engines from 105 to 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.500
 170 hp are available for selection 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.090
 petrol and three diesel units in the 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.700
 strongest execution the two-liter 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.250
 common rail tdi accelerates the yeti in 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.990
 8.4 seconds from zero to 100 km h and 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.950
 reaches a top speed of 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.570
 just over 200 quite cultivated shows 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.060
 the yeti at the gas station of 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.979
 the strongest diesel should average 6.1 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.609
 liters of fuel at 100 kilometers 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.609
 consume 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:40.130
 the actual domain of an yetis lies 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:42.409
 off the beaten track 18 cm 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.119
 Ground clearance short overhangs and one 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.780
 solid floor cladding protect him 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.329
 from underneath 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.920
 The optional Haldex coupling is distributed 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.319
 the driving forces on the wheels with the 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.240
 each cheapest ground contact if 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.549
 The terrain becomes too adventurous 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.409
 provides the optional offroad 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.700
 Function for that the driving fun 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.079
 preserved 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.969
 the button pressure changes 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.979
 parameters of gas acceptance and 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.570
 anti - lock system so can the 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.610
 driver completely on the steering 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.500
 concentrate during the yeti in 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.599
 own direction the steep departure 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.610
 mastered the basic version with 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:17.720
 front-wheel drive costs in Germany 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.690
 18,000 euros for 22 1690 euros there is the 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.730
 cheapest four-wheel variant it gives it 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.040
 So actually the yeti and everyone can 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:33.300
 met him now
