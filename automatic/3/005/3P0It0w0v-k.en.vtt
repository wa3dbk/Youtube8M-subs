00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:08.210
 Good people, this is a Corsican 1.4 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.419
 He is a guy 2011 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:16.309
 I've got him since he shot the agency again. 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:18.860
 I always tried to keep in peace with the 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:23.750
 maintenance on days nÃ© 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:26.270
 is he is now with 47 thousand 650 falling 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.490
 This is the last review I did not 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.600
 was 30 thousand from the concessionaire and 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.180
 had expired the warranty period 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.000
 You get why you're not doing so well. 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.800
 constantly in the concessionaire and not 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.740
 different from many people out there 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.820
 I also like working a fiddle 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:47.510
 little in the mechanics or is enthusiastic 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.820
 well and good but just come on the 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.739
 car trouble is my problem o 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.880
 problem of that car that give a 30 days 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.790
 Here he started that boy. 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.660
 epic losing strength 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.059
 probably a problem of part 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.140
 electrical 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.100
 identifying here as candles and 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.130
 sales cables 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.469
 So we start the car and 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.549
 he demonstrates himself in a way 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:17.090
 irregular 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:21.520
 different from his conventional maybe 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.049
 No video will not catch but he 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.229
 he's overdosing on 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:32.749
 fuel and thus pruning a 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:34.819
 vibration very well even identify 

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:38.149
 This problem I already have with the pieces 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:40.520
 here purchased and disassemble and start 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:44.539
 make the service simple is not practical 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.459
 has the pretension of arguing 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.920
 question any mechanic I'm not 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:51.200
 mechanic is this maintenance this 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.829
 The intervention I do in my car is 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.020
 at own risk my then so but 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.450
 thing is often so simple to 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.310
 who likes to play and has a minimum of 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.619
 ability with the minimum of tools is 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.049
 You can do it at home and I'll 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.340
 demonstrate this here 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.729
 Now we'll see when I open the 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.129
 light car moves in front 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.560
 Good people, I'm already here with the front of the 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:21.260
 open car is the engine safe is is a 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.430
 relatively simple process 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.040
 so by the mileage of the car 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.040
 still original candle set 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.099
 the sail cables are also original 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.530
 that came in the vehicle but as already 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.360
 The car is already three years old and I'm going to do it. 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.540
 this intervention now I will opt 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.250
 at that time by changing the set of 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.780
 candle cables and the actual candles 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.390
 said 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.910
 It is to make this release of the 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.730
 People need to be careful in 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.030
 time to pull this dog here to 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:00.220
 he did not not break do not release more 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.220
 It already came easy, right? 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:06.709
 to facilitate the service 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:11.720
 I'm going to apply a little wd 40 in the 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:16.549
 the base of the candle to take any 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:19.959
 thing that is safe in the favela beyond 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:24.109
 touch required to release it 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.329
 ball and I continue good video when 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.859
 Can you repair the already released here? 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:32.750
 Only from the candles I have already identified that 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:35.239
 in the candles were from here to 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.000
 sign opens then I really believe 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.160
 the detected cylinder to the cylinder that 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.419
 is compromised that probably already 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.849
 is identified 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:47.290
 it is a simple job to replace the 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.290
 cases we just have to follow the sequence 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:55.069
 in the installation and at the end will give everything 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:58.240
 Okay, I'll apply here a little bit 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:05.290
 from wd 40 to facilitate 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:08.020
 the extraction in the beautiful to only the electrical part 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.790
 which candle conference candle cables is 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.930
 always good it is recommended that people 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.330
 accompanies this every 10,000 kilometers 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.450
 I confess to you that I really do not 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.380
 I gave the real attention to this in this 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.220
 situation 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.720
 and has now 47 thousand and 800 m 600 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.390
 kilometers we will make the exchange of 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.920
 candles then the car will definitely go 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:36.880
 return to its operating state 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:41.470
 normal the player staff that almost with 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.370
 candles taken out of the pack may 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.940
 observe 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:51.670
 there has been a marked 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:53.890
 electrodes and of these electrodes 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.960
 out 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:00.250
 then surely it is already well beyond 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:03.580
 of the specification which is 0.8 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.000
 a new candle here to have 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.000
 a comparison 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.140
 here you can see she's fine 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:17.410
 comes very different from the candle that 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.480
 has been withdrawn with certainty the car will 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:24.610
 greatly improve the performance of 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:27.010
 consumption and also the resumption of 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.760
 I'm already here with the 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.919
 new cables placed the old ones are 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.389
 on here 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.389
 resected already with 11 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.970
 is for you to properly install the 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.070
 People candles are very important that 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.060
 take care of the threads 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:51.220
 do not allow the spark plug between 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.770
 spoiling the threads and is 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.560
 It is also imperative that you apply 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.360
 the correct touch and we have several 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.570
 ways to do this either through 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.870
 a torque wrench of several 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:07.150
 options you have there or also without odor 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.390
 chemical is it possible we can apply the 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:15.580
 angular touch the angular touch is made of 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:21.250
 the way you put the candle in the 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:23.080
 block her hockey calmly if i can 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:27.130
 do it here with one hand 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:31.420
 but it will not have problem is not with you 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:34.890
 ross key until she in khost 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.890
 when she touches 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:45.560
 that is pulled from the moment 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:48.440
 she will put the key in 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:52.820
 angle of 180 degrees 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:55.670
 in parallel with an imaginary line that 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:07:01.850
 with the block and you will bump that halo 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:08.720
 until he gets into the fourth of this 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:11.990
 back to integrate the 180graus between 45 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.360
 at 35 degrees is enough that's the tone 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.540
 correct on this screen and is what 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.530
 We 'll do it now. 

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:22.490
 Good people, this is it. 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:24.420
 the mayor car has been healed them new 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:28.040
 new cars 

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.040
 providing a perfect
