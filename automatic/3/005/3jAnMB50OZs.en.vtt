00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.330 
die anytime soon I don't even see a sign
let's<00:02:26.970> see<00:02:27.269> I<00:02:27.510> don't<00:02:28.410> even<00:02:28.470> know<00:02:28.799> there's<00:02:29.250> a

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
let's see I don't even know there's a

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.680 
let's see I don't even know there's a
couple<00:02:29.519> people<00:02:29.819> would<00:02:30.090> have<00:02:30.209> done<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.510> what

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
couple people would have done it what

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.240 
couple people would have done it what
key<00:02:30.840> would<00:02:30.989> have<00:02:31.110> done<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.410> because<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:31.920> did<00:02:32.099> his

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
key would have done it because I did his

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.759 
key would have done it because I did his
online<00:02:32.879> pranking<00:02:33.629> Prezi<00:02:34.290> could<00:02:34.470> have<00:02:34.590> done<00:02:34.739> it

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
online pranking Prezi could have done it

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.130 
online pranking Prezi could have done it
I<00:02:35.099> don't<00:02:35.970> think<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.299> was<00:02:36.360> Aaron<00:02:36.810> because<00:02:37.019> he

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
I don't think it was Aaron because he

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.770 
I don't think it was Aaron because he
has<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.290> no<00:02:37.500> vendetta<00:02:38.239> but<00:02:39.239> it<00:02:39.360> could<00:02:39.540> have<00:02:39.660> been

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
has a no vendetta but it could have been

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.680 
has a no vendetta but it could have been
now<00:02:40.379> these<00:02:40.920> these<00:02:41.519> are<00:02:41.580> not<00:02:41.849> easy<00:02:41.879> to<00:02:42.209> clean<00:02:42.480> up

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
now these these are not easy to clean up

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.089 
now these these are not easy to clean up
because<00:02:43.549> they<00:02:44.549> teleport<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:46.560> technically<00:02:46.980> I

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
because they teleport so technically I

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.160 
because they teleport so technically I
could<00:02:47.310> hit<00:02:47.519> them<00:02:47.760> but<00:02:48.540> I'm<00:02:48.630> pretty<00:02:48.780> sure<00:02:48.900> they

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
could hit them but I'm pretty sure they

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.839 
could hit them but I'm pretty sure they
all<00:02:49.349> would<00:02:49.650> just<00:02:51.260> I'll<00:02:52.260> end<00:02:52.650> up<00:02:53.430> appearing

pranking episode with him and I didn't
go<00:03:57.810> over<00:03:58.109> well<00:03:58.139> so<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:58.590> actually<00:03:58.769> didn't<00:03:59.160> think

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
go over well so I actually didn't think

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.360 
go over well so I actually didn't think
he<00:03:59.489> would<00:03:59.639> be<00:03:59.819> trying<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.150> get<00:04:00.359> me<00:04:00.510> back<00:04:00.540> but

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
he would be trying to get me back but

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.550 
he would be trying to get me back but
apparently<00:04:02.370> he<00:04:02.579> did<00:04:02.930> duplicated<00:04:03.930> some<00:04:04.109> dragon

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
apparently he did duplicated some dragon

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.640 
apparently he did duplicated some dragon
eggs<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:05.790> guess<00:04:05.880> I<00:04:06.120> deserved<00:04:06.510> this<00:04:06.810> wonder

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
eggs so I guess I deserved this wonder

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.159 
eggs so I guess I deserved this wonder
if<00:04:07.709> I<00:04:07.769> can<00:04:07.889> just<00:04:08.010> like<00:04:08.130> beat<00:04:08.430> them<00:04:08.549> all<00:04:08.730> away

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.169 
if I can just like beat them all away

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:15.099 
if I can just like beat them all away
what<00:04:12.019> no<00:04:13.019> cuz<00:04:13.290> I<00:04:13.380> don't<00:04:13.440> teleport<00:04:13.829> far<00:04:14.250> away

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
what no cuz I don't teleport far away

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:18.050 
what no cuz I don't teleport far away
haha<00:04:16.109> so<00:04:16.919> basically<00:04:17.250> to<00:04:17.400> break<00:04:17.609> these<00:04:17.789> I'm

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
haha so basically to break these I'm

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.180 
haha so basically to break these I'm
going<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.780> have<00:04:19.049> to<00:04:20.419> get<00:04:21.419> a<00:04:21.479> piston<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.260> push

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
going to have to get a piston and push

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.190 
going to have to get a piston and push
them<00:04:23.370> all<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:23.849> think<00:04:24.510> that's<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.810> only<00:04:24.840> way

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
them all I think that's the only way

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.910 
them all I think that's the only way
I'll<00:04:25.650> have<00:04:25.710> to

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
I'll have to

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.940 
I'll have to
look<00:04:26.100> on<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.280> wiki<00:04:26.670> or<00:04:26.820> I<00:04:27.240> could<00:04:27.450> just<00:04:27.480> like

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
look on the wiki or I could just like

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.970 
look on the wiki or I could just like
they<00:04:28.950> go<00:04:30.080> keep<00:04:31.080> beating<00:04:31.440> them<00:04:31.560> until<00:04:31.860> they're

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
they go keep beating them until they're

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.410 
they go keep beating them until they're
far<00:04:32.160> enough<00:04:32.280> away<00:04:32.520> that<00:04:32.850> they<00:04:33.060> don't<00:04:33.240> bother

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
far enough away that they don't bother

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.040 
far enough away that they don't bother
me<00:04:33.720> again<00:04:34.310> but<00:04:35.310> anyway<00:04:35.640> well<00:04:36.150> played<00:04:36.570> Prezi

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
me again but anyway well played Prezi
