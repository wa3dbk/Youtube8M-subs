00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.240 

okay<00:00:00.870> so<00:00:00.930> I<00:00:01.079> restarted<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.580> whole<00:00:02.850> thing<00:00:03.230> and

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.250 
okay so I restarted the whole thing and

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.160 
okay so I restarted the whole thing and
hopefully<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.430> should<00:00:05.580> fix<00:00:06.029> it<00:00:06.270> at<00:00:06.420> least<00:00:06.720> for<00:00:07.140> a

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
hopefully I should fix it at least for a

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.879 
hopefully I should fix it at least for a
little<00:00:07.230> bit<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.189> have<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:09.000> theory<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.929> the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
little bit I have a theory that the the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.580 
little bit I have a theory that the the
iPad<00:00:11.550> just<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:12.090> just<00:00:12.360> quits<00:00:12.840> after<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.290> certain

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
iPad just it just quits after a certain

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.770 
iPad just it just quits after a certain
amount<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:14.190> time<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.549> like<00:00:14.700> yeah<00:00:14.940> I'm<00:00:15.089> done<00:00:15.389> I

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
amount of time is like yeah I'm done I

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.050 
amount of time is like yeah I'm done I
already<00:00:16.410> put<00:00:16.560> enough<00:00:16.800> work<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.670> know<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.850> can

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
already put enough work you know you can

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.090 
already put enough work you know you can
deal<00:00:18.240> with<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.170> think<00:00:19.560> that's<00:00:19.949> what

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
deal with it so I think that's what

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.620 
deal with it so I think that's what
happens<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:20.520> got<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.880> restart<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.449> to

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
happens you just got to restart it to

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.970 
happens you just got to restart it to
get<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.930> going<00:00:22.109> again<00:00:22.460> but<00:00:23.460> I'm<00:00:23.550> gonna<00:00:23.730> do<00:00:23.850> some

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
difficult to figure out this is kind of

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.020 
difficult to figure out this is kind of
like<00:02:46.050> that<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:46.350> mean<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:47.280> can<00:02:47.459> kind<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.790> tell

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
like that I mean you can kind of tell

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.120 
like that I mean you can kind of tell
but<00:02:48.480> but<00:02:48.840> it's<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.620> gives<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:49.950> some

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
but but it's it gives you some

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.130 
but but it's it gives you some
indication<00:02:50.280> like<00:02:50.820> when<00:02:51.330> your<00:02:51.450> enemies<00:02:51.930> are

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
indication like when your enemies are

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.020 
indication like when your enemies are
just<00:02:52.350> moving<00:02:52.590> into<00:02:53.010> walls<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.610> just<00:02:53.850> don't

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
just moving into walls and just don't

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.840 
just moving into walls and just don't
care<00:02:54.770> when<00:02:55.770> your<00:02:55.920> teammates<00:02:56.310> are<00:02:56.459> standing

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
care when your teammates are standing

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.580 
care when your teammates are standing
still<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.390> they<00:02:57.510> keep<00:02:57.840> using<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.470> know

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
still and they keep using you know

they're done

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.510 
they're done
just<00:03:00.020> spamming<00:03:00.500> ammo<00:03:00.740> everywhere<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.370> not

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
just spamming ammo everywhere and not

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.760 
just spamming ammo everywhere and not
moving<00:03:01.760> it's<00:03:02.060> like<00:03:02.120> yes<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:03.260> tell<00:03:03.500> but<00:03:03.740> I

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
moving it's like yes you tell but I

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.260 
moving it's like yes you tell but I
would<00:03:04.010> love<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.310> if<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.520> game<00:03:04.700> just<00:03:04.880> put<00:03:05.150> in

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
would love it if the game just put in

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.970 
would love it if the game just put in
like<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.570> I<00:03:05.810> don't<00:03:05.990> like<00:03:06.260> it<00:03:06.380> just<00:03:06.560> a<00:03:06.740> ping

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
like a I don't like it just a ping

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.870 
like a I don't like it just a ping
indicator<00:03:07.490> somewhere<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:09.260> let<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:09.560> know<00:03:09.880> that

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
indicator somewhere to let you know that

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.200 
indicator somewhere to let you know that
you<00:03:11.120> are<00:03:11.180> lagging<00:03:11.450> out<00:03:11.750> because<00:03:12.850> why<00:03:13.850> should<00:03:13.880> I

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
you are lagging out because why should I

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.790 
you are lagging out because why should I
take<00:03:14.330> that<00:03:14.480> back<00:03:14.630> I'd<00:03:14.840> rather<00:03:15.020> they<00:03:15.260> just<00:03:15.530> fix

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
take that back I'd rather they just fix

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.700 
take that back I'd rather they just fix
it<00:03:15.950> entirely<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:17.210> just<00:03:17.540> never<00:03:18.140> like<00:03:18.380> out<00:03:18.560> to

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
it entirely and just never like out to

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.030 
it entirely and just never like out to
begin<00:03:18.860> with<00:03:19.010> that'd<00:03:19.250> be<00:03:19.430> great<00:03:19.760> but<00:03:21.040> that

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
begin with that'd be great but that

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.010 
begin with that'd be great but that
would<00:03:22.400> be<00:03:22.520> kind<00:03:22.730> of<00:03:22.820> a<00:03:22.970> tall<00:03:23.390> order<00:03:23.660> that

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
would be kind of a tall order that

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.160 
would be kind of a tall order that
wouldn't<00:03:24.560> probably<00:03:24.830> happen<00:03:25.400> at<00:03:25.520> all<00:03:25.670> so<00:03:26.210> in

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
wouldn't probably happen at all so in

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.050 
wouldn't probably happen at all so in
which<00:03:27.350> case<00:03:27.380> I<00:03:27.800> will<00:03:27.950> settle<00:03:28.190> for<00:03:28.340> just<00:03:28.760> like<00:03:28.940> a

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
which case I will settle for just like a

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.760 
which case I will settle for just like a
like<00:03:29.300> a<00:03:29.330> ping<00:03:29.600> indicator<00:03:30.110> somewhere<00:03:30.620> that'd

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
like a ping indicator somewhere that'd

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.760 
like a ping indicator somewhere that'd
be<00:03:30.920> excellent

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.070 

to<00:03:36.610> just<00:03:36.850> you<00:03:37.120> know<00:03:37.150> have<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.510> numbers<00:03:37.870> or

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
to just you know have the numbers or

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.220 
to just you know have the numbers or
even<00:03:38.200> just<00:03:38.530> a<00:03:38.620> color<00:03:38.950> just<00:03:39.850> be<00:03:39.940> like<00:03:40.120> yeah<00:03:40.390> you

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
even just a color just be like yeah you

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.290 
even just a color just be like yeah you
have<00:03:41.260> red<00:03:41.680> you're<00:03:42.520> here<00:03:42.700> in<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:42.880> red<00:03:43.060> right

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
have red you're here in the red right

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.730 
have red you're here in the red right
now<00:03:43.330> I<00:03:43.600> know<00:03:43.660> they<00:03:43.990> have<00:03:44.200> those<00:03:44.410> meters

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
now I know they have those meters

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.040 
now I know they have those meters
because<00:03:45.160> they<00:03:45.700> show<00:03:46.000> up<00:03:46.180> on<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.510> multiplayer

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
because they show up on the multiplayer

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.980 
because they show up on the multiplayer
maps<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.910> I<00:03:48.970> mean<00:03:49.210> if<00:03:49.330> only<00:03:49.540> they<00:03:49.660> would<00:03:49.810> have

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
maps so I mean if only they would have

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.860 
maps so I mean if only they would have
that<00:03:50.170> show<00:03:50.590> up<00:03:50.710> on<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:50.980> UI<00:03:51.190> in<00:03:51.820> Akina<00:03:52.300> like<00:03:52.750> in

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
that show up on the UI in Akina like in

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.600 
that show up on the UI in Akina like in
the<00:03:52.930> game<00:03:53.170> that'd<00:03:53.470> be<00:03:53.590> great

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
the game that'd be great

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.110 
the game that'd be great
I<00:03:55.260> would<00:03:56.260> love<00:03:56.410> it<00:03:56.560> but<00:03:56.770> they<00:03:57.670> don't<00:03:57.850> have<00:03:58.000> that

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
I would love it but they don't have that

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.210 
I would love it but they don't have that
so<00:03:58.600> that<00:03:58.810> makes<00:03:58.960> me<00:03:59.050> kind<00:03:59.230> of<00:03:59.290> sad<00:04:02.100> makes<00:04:03.100> me

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
so that makes me kind of sad makes me

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.620 
so that makes me kind of sad makes me
really<00:04:03.400> sad

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:14.400 

oh<00:04:10.680> dude<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:11.770> totally<00:04:11.980> chewed<00:04:12.340> that<00:04:13.350> die<00:04:14.350> jerk

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
oh dude I totally chewed that die jerk

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.330 
oh dude I totally chewed that die jerk
