so here's second gear 20 let's call it

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:12.160 
so here's second gear 20 let's call it
3000<00:01:04.580> rpm<00:01:04.970> flat<00:01:05.330> down<00:01:05.570> ready<00:01:05.930> set

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:20.109 

right<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.369> ground<00:01:14.580> speed<00:01:14.820> this

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.880 

that's<00:01:20.540> starting<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:20.840> feel<00:01:21.020> faster<00:01:21.619> than<00:01:21.770> the

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
that's starting to feel faster than the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.399 
that's starting to feel faster than the
old<00:01:22.040> turbo<00:01:22.399> there<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:23.180> tell<00:01:24.049> you<00:01:24.140> when<00:01:24.290> you

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
old turbo there and tell you when you

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.109 
old turbo there and tell you when you
get<00:01:24.500> it<00:01:24.619> to<00:01:24.649> hookup<00:01:25.070> obviously<00:01:25.579> it's<00:01:25.700> 25

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
get it to hookup obviously it's 25

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.630 
get it to hookup obviously it's 25
degrees<00:01:26.659> there's<00:01:27.649> a<00:01:27.740> limit<00:01:28.040> to<00:01:28.070> how<00:01:28.430> much

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
degrees there's a limit to how much

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.050 
degrees there's a limit to how much
fraction<00:01:29.180> there's<00:01:29.329> going<00:01:29.479> to<00:01:29.600> be

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
fraction there's going to be

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.310 
fraction there's going to be
but<00:01:32.060> that<00:01:32.210> said<00:01:32.510> this<00:01:32.690> thing<00:01:32.870> would<00:01:33.050> really

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
but that said this thing would really

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.010 
but that said this thing would really
run<00:01:33.710> so<00:01:33.980> I'm<00:01:34.040> going<00:01:34.160> to<00:01:34.220> go<00:01:34.340> ahead<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:34.900> spin<00:01:35.900> it

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
run so I'm going to go ahead and spin it

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.810 
run so I'm going to go ahead and spin it
around<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:36.500> just<00:01:36.620> go<00:01:36.740> home<00:01:36.980> my<00:01:37.220> goal<00:01:37.460> was<00:01:37.610> not

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
around and just go home my goal was not
