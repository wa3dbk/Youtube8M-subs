00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.030
 today is a day where is it 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.010
 we are preparing many things for the 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.140
 journey of things advance 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.850
 tonight during the match I see 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.100
 continue to prepare to go away 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.900
 and then after the market when we go 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.270
 really there get going not for 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.410
 leave the place and there is his ally the 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.920
 as soon as possible because we have 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.440
 badly we bring everything that the players have 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.320
 of need therefore sneakers and 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.760
 underwear sweaters from 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.650
 the equipment all logically that of 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.800
 need sticks all that we did a 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.960
 preparation yesterday and today for that 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.250
 do not tell your every player everything 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.710
 logically that they will play with this 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.330
 evening we're going on a truck 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.460
 then on the plane to go to 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.409
 fight for tomorrow's match 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.970
 washers to endow all are 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.890
 specific each time so a lot 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.690
 of small details things more than 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.729
 details take you there I find it 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.190
 quite surprising as it comes a very 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.930
 little we forget something in all 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.510
 the years that we and lolo it happened 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.080
 very seldom happily do we read them 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.060
 the clip that receives us if we ever 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.770
 had something major that we 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.530
 had forgotten or what we miss who 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.810
 broke us in hair or something 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.789
 they will help us people who are doing 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.500
 our job in all the clubs they 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.270
 are there we are here to help each other 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.969
 the competition is on the ice 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.450
 was not as much as people thought 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:45.130
 there are a lot of nights going on 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.090
 to pass we will travel after the matches 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.890
 after the game 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.469
 compact equipment after the match 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.630
 for example we were talking about Florida 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.830
 so we joined jumpers I believe that 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.900
 it's just 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.360

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.660

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.540
 in the afternoon we see a little time 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.879
 full afternoon in Tampa Bay but me 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.019
 personally I feel limited because 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.420
 that I just slept four hours 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.310
 of boredom there so we'll have some 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.989
 good prices and always but we did not 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.310
 not as much as the world thinks or the 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.980
 produce a lot of people spend 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.620
 a lot of time on the plane at the hotel 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.750
 and then at the meeting but when 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.750
