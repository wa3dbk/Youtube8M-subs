 antioxidant properties and therefore a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.369
 excellent ally against cancer 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.130

 anti-inflammatory and cicatrizant use

 topical diuretic there are other properties 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.340
 not contrasted but that have been 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.200
 attributed as its aphrodisiac power the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.850
 tomatoes constitute a food 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.000
 excellent for those who want 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.680
 adopt a healthy life present in 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.719
 its composition a series of elements 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.940
 which are very suitable for 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.400
 detoxify the organism and prevent 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.650
 appearance of many diseases 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.010
 consume tomato reduces and fights the 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.960
 cancer however what has most interest 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.120
 awakened among scientists all 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.890
 the world is the capacity of lycopene 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.400
 to prevent and even combat 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.220
 Cancer 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.990
 after analyzing 72 studies on 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.000
 relationship between this substance and 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.070
 cancer a team of researchers 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.310
 British and North Americans checked 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.350
 that in 57 of them the relationship between a 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.420
 lower risk of cancer and the intake of 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.960
 lycopene was completely safe and in 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.880
 35 significant this finding allowed 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.440
 to the scientists to conclude that this 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.900
 substance is a powerful antioxidant 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.850
 that prevents the appearance of various 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.390
 cancers especially of 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.450
 prostate lung and stomach the list does not 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.160
 However, the coordinator could be greater 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.530
 of the research team the doctor 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.810
 ihuatzio vanucci from the faculty of 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.000
 Harvard medicine in Boston was 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.040
 few months ago in pamplona spain 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.930
 where he confirmed that the data suggest 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.759
 that the habitual consumption of tomato 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.850
 also prevents esophageal cancer 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.280
 pancreas breast and oral colorectal 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.180
 cervical tomatoes are rich in 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.910
 substances 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.860
 with anti-cancer properties that 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.810
 lead to the formation of kart in oid 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.820
 it's like the lycopene compounds that 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.750
 protect cells from the effects of 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.190
 the oxidation 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.340
 as explained by the scientist 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.410
 American job andux and already had 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.810
 chance to check the properties of the 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.100
 tomato in previous studies carried out in 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.200
 your university 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.240
 well he found that men who never 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.280
 they have taken tomato sauce they have more 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.990
 chances of developing cancer 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.450
 prostate cancer than those who do several 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.030
 times a week according to this expert 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.130
 ingest tomato sauce once to the 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.410
 week reduces the risk of suffering this 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.540
 tumor type 10 or 15 percent 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.030
 while the possibilities go down in 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.850
 30 or 35 percent if you make two 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.590
 times a week if men should 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.360
 have a good supply of 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.310
 tomatoes in your fridge to prevent the 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.680
 prostate cancer the most tumor 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.720
 frequent in men, women must 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.030
 Do the same to avoid cancer more 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.010
 usual in her sex the breast after 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.350
 analyze the levels of lycopene and 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.690
 other carotenoids in 109 women of 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.459
 Boston the scientists of the university 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.300
 from harvard came to the conclusion of 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.760
 who loves 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.620
 concentration the risk of cancer was 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.840
 lower lycopene capacity for 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.180
 delay the oxidation of cells and 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.760
 in this way its multiplication guarantees 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.650
 its preventive capacity the next 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.960
 step was to check if these properties 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.570
 they had an application in the healing of 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.610
 the tumors in the last congress of the 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.370
 association for the investigation against 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.170
 the cancer of the USA that is considered 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.570
 as the forum on major cancer 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.670
 prestige in the world were presented the 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.860
 results of a study conducted by the 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.960
 doctor omar cook from university 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.750
 Wayne in Detroit who ventures a 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.000
 promising future in this regard the 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.860
 specialists subjected 12 patients 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.990
 patients with prostate cancer to a 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.880
 regime based on a daily ration of 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.910
 this pigment during the three weeks 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.710
 precedents to his surgical intervention 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.780
 after the operation the authors of the 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.910
 study found that tumors do not 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.610
 had spread to other tissues in 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.290
 most of the cases 67 percent 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.780
 while in the group there was not 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.639
 participated in the cancer regimen 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.799
 had spread in 56% of cases 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.139
 also the researchers checked 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.969
 that 84 percent of patients 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.949
 who had benefited 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:26.779
 lycopene treatment had tumors 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.749
 of a size smaller than 4 

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:31.729
 cubic centimeters versus 55 per cent 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:34.370
 percent in those operated patients 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.020
 who had not followed the regime these 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.300
 results suggest that lycopene 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.610
 modulates the molecules responsible for 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.650
 regulation of the cell cycle and cause a 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.870
 regression of cancerous lesions of 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.800
 the prostate in man as they claimed 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.800
 the authors of the study
