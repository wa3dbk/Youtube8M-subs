00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:14.899
 but these 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:15.889
 60 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.380
 emagrecentro collection of informative videos 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.300
 biggest in the world 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.919
 nutritional education 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:24.329
 lecture in milan 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:27.329
 nutritional education 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.659
 my name is just a death 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.300
 I'm responsible for weight loss 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.300
 the most recent proposal to stage a crisis in a correct way 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.490
 and definitive 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.740
 removing the mistakes that made him unmotivated in the past 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.990
 that lack of encouragement and discouragement that accompanied him with each new regime 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.050
 will be replaced by the 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.080
 of our clinic 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.570
 who will demonstrate how to eat to lose weight in a healthy way 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.370
 with disposition and satisfaction 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.590
 from this initial step it is essential to participate in the 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.340
 occasion the objectives 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.590
 initially 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.830
 stop being martyred with the typical phrases I can not 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.860
 I need do not need 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.290
 substitute these questions for wanting not to want 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.100
 At the end you want to model the bordeaux from there 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.010
 of your will not because of obligation and opposition is that you will 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.390
 behave like a thin person 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.490
 your line of thinking from now on will be 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.570
 I'm thin and acted as such. 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.450
 and above all appreciate yourself you have the power over the food and not vice versa 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.369
 so from now replace the sentences I can not eat that cake 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.259
 because I do not want to eat that rumor I need to eat the salad 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.810
 because I want to eat the salad 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.060
 and finally peace and of your mind 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.969
 I can, I can not 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.020
 I need I do not need to replace why I want 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.210
 I do not want 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.610
 The diet plan of our method consists of a balanced diet 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.610
 balanced because there is a calorie control 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.330
 amount of food you will ingest 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.330
 and the quality of the types of risk you will get 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:14.409
 usually when we get when we prepare for a 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.619
 meal who establishes the amount of clouds do not leave the eyes 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.249
 is a resident of the region who will establish the amount 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.840
 if the food has been well made if it is nice 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.819
 the fact is that it will help in this quantity 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.349
 usually this quantity is always more than the body needs 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:37.389
 because food represents for the body a need is the source of energy 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.270
 for the body to function normally 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.430
 and if the more than generally the people with the friend the body has followed much mechanism 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.419
 intelligent 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.319
 he thinks as follows 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.419
 if I'm getting more food I'll sign and in time we'll be creating 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:54.869
 of this food surplus 

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:59.209
 the way the body waits for the body stores this accident is a form of 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.479
 body fat 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:04.209
 there comes a point where we begin to visualize these deposits 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.630
 and when 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.240
 suddenly the belly begins to ride 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.240
 when we put on clothes and she does not look so good anymore 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.109
 so the body will start to use this energy 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.620
 as fuel to meet daily needs 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:23.829
 with this you will begin to feel the process of slimming visually or 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:24.489
 be 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.599
 each time you climb the scale you will see that your saucer is 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:29.369
 decreasing 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:33.679
 this is nothing more than this simple mechanism of energy utilization of 

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:34.479
 reservation 

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:37.129
 because it fed the states 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:38.539
 an amount 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:39.529
 attention 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:44.169
 exercising your diet the rate of fat deposits in your body 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.449
 to be human 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:49.169
 live with discipline 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:53.079
 quality of food by making balanced meals and 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:54.389
 balanced 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.190
 paying attention to the type 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.169
 and how to prepare food 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.729
 avoiding fatty foods 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:04.209
 fry and sweets and soft drinks 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.469
 respect the quantity of food neither more nor less 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.709
 also respect the variety in foods 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.139
 from now on think so 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:17.989
 I am thin and acted as such to improve your nutritional education we suggest 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.519
 three rules for the seven days of the week 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.799
 rule number one 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.799
 commit to diet for seven consecutive days 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.490
 rule number 2 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.969
 commit herself she began the mind when she feels hungry 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:35.289
 rule number 3 disregard the temptations and comments of others 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.289
 disregard the temptations and comments of others 

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:42.650
 means having will power in your new military proposal 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.949
 adopting a conscious attitude 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.689
 objective and determined 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:52.270
 our body has operating standards that we must respect and it is 

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:55.449
 from them is that we can have balance 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.419
 we own a biological hunger watch 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.050
 this biological clock 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.039
 It's what drives our appetite. 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.159
 our will to eat 'and when we really feel the need 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:07.830
 to eat or is 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.729
 when a food becomes a necessity for the body 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.789
 where it will be passing energy from the body 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.919
 so it is very important 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.379
 you adjust your biological clock to your real needs 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.770
 and to your rhythm of life 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.629
 exercises the lectures 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:27.629
 how to adjust the biological clock to your needs 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:31.409
 make a survey of your habits in the day to day 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.439
 When you get up here rush I eat breakfast 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:35.790
 the morning snack 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.419
 lunch the afternoon snack dinner and so solve 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:44.330
 the important thing is that you record the schedules and types of food 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.240
 remember you are regulating the rhythm of your body 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.520
 this biological clock of hunger 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.689
 has to be adjusted to your 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:53.849
 activities 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:55.639
 to your new rhythm 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.439
 The important thing is that you from now on 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:00.979
 you have to learn to eat right 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:01.919
 attention 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:07.139
 watch this lecture again and again until it is well understood 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:09.039
 etched in your mind
