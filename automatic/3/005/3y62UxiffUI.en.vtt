so<00:01:47.240> we<00:01:47.509> can't<00:01:47.900> do<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.170> base<00:01:48.619> coat<00:01:48.979> for<00:01:49.340> this

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
so we can't do a base coat for this

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.340 
so we can't do a base coat for this
design<00:01:49.909> just<00:01:50.119> because<00:01:50.240> when<00:01:50.720> we<00:01:50.810> put<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.110> tape

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
design just because when we put the tape

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.710 
design just because when we put the tape
with<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.280> base<00:01:52.460> coat<00:01:52.729> underneath<00:01:53.150> it<00:01:53.420> won't

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
with the base coat underneath it won't

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.020 
with the base coat underneath it won't
work<00:01:54.140> properly<00:01:54.200> like<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.130> colors<00:01:55.460> will<00:01:55.729> bleed

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
work properly like the colors will bleed

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.230 
work properly like the colors will bleed
and<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.390> tape<00:01:56.630> will<00:01:56.869> stick<00:01:57.560> to<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.189> base<00:01:58.850> coat

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
and the tape will stick to the base coat

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.499 
and the tape will stick to the base coat
and<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.840> won't<00:02:00.049> work<00:02:00.140> properly<00:02:00.619> so<00:02:01.420> for<00:02:02.420> this

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
and it won't work properly so for this

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.240 
and it won't work properly so for this
design<00:02:02.689> we're<00:02:03.079> not<00:02:03.259> gonna<00:02:03.409> have<00:02:03.619> a<00:02:03.650> base<00:02:03.920> coat

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
design we're not gonna have a base coat

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.050 
design we're not gonna have a base coat
unless<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:04.909> want<00:02:05.119> to<00:02:05.180> go<00:02:05.299> ahead<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:05.630> do<00:02:06.049> it<00:02:06.229> um

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
tape to create this line because now it

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.690 
tape to create this line because now it

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
leaves a straight edge for the pink to

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.300 
leaves a straight edge for the pink to
sit<00:03:29.970> perfectly<00:03:30.420> against<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:31.230> white<00:03:31.440> in<00:03:31.739> a

sit perfectly against the white in a
straight<00:03:32.610> line<00:03:32.640> so<00:03:33.060> we're<00:03:33.420> just<00:03:33.450> gonna<00:03:33.690> take

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
straight line so we're just gonna take

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.470

sometimes when applying a top coat it
will<00:04:26.200> smudge<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:26.770> black<00:04:27.010> into<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.550> white<00:04:27.790> and

the<00:04:35.780> next<00:04:36.020> step<00:04:36.139> I'm<00:04:36.260> going<00:04:36.410> to<00:04:36.470> do<00:04:36.650> using<00:04:37.040> my

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
the next step I'm going to do using my

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.780 
the next step I'm going to do using my
black<00:04:37.430> thin<00:04:37.880> tip<00:04:38.350> nail<00:04:39.350> polish<00:04:39.800> is<00:04:40.010> I'm<00:04:40.520> just

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
black thin tip nail polish is I'm just

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.719 
black thin tip nail polish is I'm just
gonna<00:04:41.030> draw<00:04:41.810> a<00:04:41.990> line<00:04:42.260> to<00:04:42.740> separate<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.250> white

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
gonna draw a line to separate the white

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:58.200 
gonna draw a line to separate the white
and<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.180> pink

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.450 

I<00:04:58.270> feel<00:04:58.960> this<00:04:59.080> line<00:04:59.410> just<00:04:59.710> adds<00:04:59.979> more<00:05:00.340> of<00:05:00.400> a

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
I feel this line just adds more of a

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.659 
I feel this line just adds more of a
contrast<00:05:01.000> between<00:05:01.240> the<00:05:01.810> pink<00:05:02.080> and<00:05:02.259> the<00:05:02.470> white

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
contrast between the pink and the white

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.920 
contrast between the pink and the white
next<00:05:03.669> this<00:05:03.819> movie<00:05:04.120> needs<00:05:04.330> to<00:05:04.449> get<00:05:04.569> really

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
next this movie needs to get really

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.510 
next this movie needs to get really
creative<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:05.710> we're<00:05:05.889> going<00:05:06.009> to<00:05:06.039> add<00:05:06.250> the

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
creative and we're going to add the

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.540 
creative and we're going to add the
final<00:05:06.729> touch<00:05:07.090> of<00:05:07.330> the<00:05:07.509> zebra<00:05:07.720> stripes<00:05:08.160> so<00:05:09.160> each

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
final touch of the zebra stripes so each

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.249 
final touch of the zebra stripes so each
nail<00:05:09.910> is<00:05:10.120> going<00:05:10.300> to<00:05:10.360> be<00:05:10.479> very<00:05:10.690> unique<00:05:11.080> and

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
nail is going to be very unique and

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.529 
nail is going to be very unique and
different<00:05:11.349> and<00:05:11.889> no<00:05:12.520> two<00:05:12.759> nails<00:05:12.940> are<00:05:13.180> the<00:05:13.210> same

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
different and no two nails are the same

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.740 
different and no two nails are the same
so<00:05:14.440> we<00:05:15.190> just<00:05:15.550> need<00:05:15.699> to<00:05:15.759> get<00:05:16.000> creative<00:05:16.300> making

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
so we just need to get creative making

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.960 
so we just need to get creative making
squiggly<00:05:17.620> lines<00:05:17.860> and<00:05:18.130> opposite<00:05:18.639> directions

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
squiggly lines and opposite directions

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.830 
squiggly lines and opposite directions
and<00:05:20.669> that's<00:05:21.669> how<00:05:21.880> we<00:05:21.940> create<00:05:22.210> our<00:05:22.539> zebra

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
and that's how we create our zebra

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.050 
and that's how we create our zebra
design<00:05:23.349> so<00:05:24.039> I'm<00:05:24.190> just<00:05:24.400> going<00:05:24.550> to<00:05:24.580> start<00:05:24.880> here

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
design so I'm just going to start here

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.219 
design so I'm just going to start here
at<00:05:25.120> the<00:05:25.210> top<00:05:26.220> and<00:05:27.220> you<00:05:27.789> can<00:05:28.000> kind<00:05:28.509> of<00:05:28.569> squiggle

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
at the top and you can kind of squiggle

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:42.290 
at the top and you can kind of squiggle
it<00:05:33.599> and<00:05:34.599> I'm<00:05:34.690> just<00:05:34.930> going<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.080> alternate<00:05:36.240> sides

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.510 

they<00:05:43.300> don't<00:05:43.479> have<00:05:43.599> to<00:05:43.720> start<00:05:44.080> all<00:05:44.320> the<00:05:44.530> way<00:05:44.680> at

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
they don't have to start all the way at

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.150 
they don't have to start all the way at
the<00:05:45.580> edge<00:05:45.880> of<00:05:46.030> the<00:05:46.180> nail<00:05:46.330> you<00:05:46.509> can<00:05:46.979> start<00:05:47.979> them

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
the edge of the nail you can start them

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.310 
the edge of the nail you can start them
towards<00:05:48.550> the<00:05:48.669> middle<00:05:49.060> like<00:05:49.270> this<00:05:49.509> one<00:05:49.750> here

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
towards the middle like this one here

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.439 
towards the middle like this one here
just<00:05:51.210> fill<00:05:52.210> in<00:05:52.389> the<00:05:52.419> nail<00:05:53.909> you<00:05:54.909> can<00:05:55.120> be<00:05:55.330> the
