00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
assembly is very easy to install just a

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.540 
assembly is very easy to install just a
couple<00:00:22.410> screws<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.010> pops<00:00:23.189> right<00:00:23.279> out<00:00:23.430> of

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
couple screws and it pops right out of

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.150 
couple screws and it pops right out of
the<00:00:23.670> cassette<00:00:24.029> array<00:00:24.529> but<00:00:25.529> if<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.740> choose<00:00:26.010> to

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
the cassette array but if you choose to

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.679 
the cassette array but if you choose to
get<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.369> insert<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.090> how<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:27.539> it

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
get the insert this is how you do it

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.779 
get the insert this is how you do it
basically<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.590> just<00:00:28.619> take<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.099> metal<00:00:29.490> plate

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
basically you just take this metal plate

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.359 
basically you just take this metal plate
and<00:00:30.060> lift<00:00:30.750> up<00:00:30.900> on<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.050> backside<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:32.099> just

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
and lift up on the backside of it just

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.900 
and lift up on the backside of it just
like<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.059> slide<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.600> plate<00:00:33.870> off<00:00:34.910> just

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
like that and slide this plate off just

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.520 
like that and slide this plate off just
like<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.570> then<00:00:36.870> what<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.200> want<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.440> do

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
like that and then what you want to do

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.380 
like that and then what you want to do
is<00:00:37.649> pick<00:00:37.860> up<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.160> one<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.520> opposing<00:00:39.030> ends

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
is pick up on one of the opposing ends

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.350 
is pick up on one of the opposing ends
on<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:41.070> i'll<00:00:41.340> choose<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.790> side<00:00:42.090> and

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
on this and i'll choose this side and

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.880 
on this and i'll choose this side and
then<00:00:42.600> just<00:00:42.809> kind<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.050> lift<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.379> up<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.680> get

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
then just kind of lift it up and get

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.069 
then just kind of lift it up and get
that<00:00:43.920> little<00:00:44.190> black<00:00:44.910> plastic<00:00:45.300> nipple<00:00:45.870> out<00:00:45.989> of

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
that little black plastic nipple out of

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.720 
that little black plastic nipple out of
its<00:00:46.230> socket<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.950> then<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> white

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
its socket and then you have a white

its socket and then you have a white
clip<00:00:48.090> right<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.110> center<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.920> have

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
clip right in the center that you have

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.950 
clip right in the center that you have
to<00:00:50.129> kind<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.399> pop<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.850> out<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.719> that

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
to kind of pop it out of just like that

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.680 
to kind of pop it out of just like that
in<00:00:52.489> what<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.579> want<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.000> take<00:00:54.180> your<00:00:54.300> your

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
little hook to it and it's right here

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.359 
little hook to it and it's right here
and<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.119> can't<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.439> pad<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.830> go<00:01:07.920> back<00:01:08.159> at

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
and you can't get this pad to go back at

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.060 
and you can't get this pad to go back at
an<00:01:08.490> angle<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:09.119> actually<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.900> do<00:01:10.830> this

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
an angle you actually have to do this

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.620 
an angle you actually have to do this
kind<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.090> at<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:13.790> you<00:01:14.790> got<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.030> kind<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.240> put<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
little bit of a hook in it and it

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.280 
little bit of a hook in it and it
doesn't<00:01:17.880> give<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> lot<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.299> room<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.780> then

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
just snap it back into its socket like

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.390 
just snap it back into its socket like
that<00:01:21.570> they're<00:01:21.900> just<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.950> then

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
that they're just like that and then

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.249

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
buoyancy to the pad after you're done go

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.330 
buoyancy to the pad after you're done go
ahead<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.380> reinstall<00:01:28.590> your<00:01:28.860> plate<00:01:29.189> after

ahead and reinstall your plate after

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.780 
ahead and reinstall your plate after
that<00:01:29.689> and<00:01:31.100> just<00:01:32.100> start<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.400> off<00:01:32.520> make<00:01:32.759> sure

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
that and just start it off make sure

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.340 
that and just start it off make sure

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
that both the left and the right sides

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.380 
that both the left and the right sides
get<00:01:34.560> underneath<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.009> plastic<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.640> then<00:01:36.180> just

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
get underneath the plastic and then just
