00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.229 
because you'll actually be going through
the<00:02:27.540> beads<00:02:27.900> themselves<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.550> need<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.120> be

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
the beads themselves so you need to be

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.240 
the beads themselves so you need to be
able<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.569> fit<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.989> crochet<00:02:31.350> hook<00:02:31.590> through<00:02:32.010> the

bead in order to grab your yarn and pull

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.670 
bead in order to grab your yarn and pull
it<00:02:34.950> through<00:02:35.360> now<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.390> if<00:02:36.989> you're<00:02:37.170> using<00:02:37.350> the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
it through now the if you're using the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.270 
it through now the if you're using the
smaller<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.180> taught<00:02:39.540> seed<00:02:40.170> beads<00:02:40.500> you'll

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
smaller that a taught seed beads you'll

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.160 
smaller that a taught seed beads you'll
want<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.640> use<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:42.000> point<00:02:42.510> seven<00:02:42.930> five

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
want to use a point seven five

want to use a point seven five
millimeter<00:02:43.920> crochet<00:02:44.370> hook<00:02:44.640> if<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.600> have

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
millimeter crochet hook if you have

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.270 
millimeter crochet hook if you have
anything<00:02:46.050> larger<00:02:46.709> than<00:02:46.739> that

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
anything larger than that

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.360 
anything larger than that
it's<00:02:47.700> going<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.090> actually<00:02:48.500> not<00:02:49.500> fit<00:02:49.890> through

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
it's going to actually not fit through

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.910 
it's going to actually not fit through
the<00:02:50.670> seed<00:02:50.880> bead<00:02:50.910> itself<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:52.650> if<00:02:52.769> you're

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
the seed bead itself and if you're

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.699 
the seed bead itself and if you're
working<00:02:53.190> with<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.610> larger<00:02:54.150> six<00:02:54.630> seed<00:02:55.380> beads

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
working with the larger six seed beads

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.240 
working with the larger six seed beads
you'll<00:02:56.430> want<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.910> use<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.630> 1.3<00:02:58.530> millimeter

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
you'll want to use of 1.3 millimeter

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.880 
you'll want to use of 1.3 millimeter
crochet<00:02:59.610> hook<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.930> can<00:03:01.050> go<00:03:01.230> smaller<00:03:01.590> than

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
crochet hook you can go smaller than

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.210 
crochet hook you can go smaller than
that<00:03:02.070> so<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.850> 0.75<00:03:03.630> will<00:03:04.170> work<00:03:04.380> fine<00:03:04.709> on<00:03:05.069> the

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
that so the 0.75 will work fine on the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.030 
that so the 0.75 will work fine on the
larger<00:03:05.610> size<00:03:05.819> beads<00:03:06.180> but<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.380> don't<00:03:07.709> want<00:03:07.950> to

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
larger size beads but you don't want to

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.130 
larger size beads but you don't want to
get<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.190> crochet<00:03:08.610> hook<00:03:08.640> any<00:03:09.150> larger<00:03:09.780> than

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
get a crochet hook any larger than

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.440 
get a crochet hook any larger than
around<00:03:11.060> 1.3<00:03:12.060> millimeters<00:03:12.950> so<00:03:14.030> let's<00:03:15.030> start

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
around 1.3 millimeters so let's start

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.420 
around 1.3 millimeters so let's start
incorporating<00:03:15.900> some<00:03:16.380> beads<00:03:16.650> into<00:03:17.280> our

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
incorporating some beads into our

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.690 
incorporating some beads into our
knitting<00:03:17.820> using<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.360> crochet<00:03:18.750> hook<00:03:18.780> method

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
knitting using the crochet hook method

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.190 
knitting using the crochet hook method
so<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.790> can<00:03:20.940> see<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.209> started<00:03:21.630> incorporating

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
so you can see I started incorporating

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.970 
so you can see I started incorporating
my<00:03:23.010> beads<00:03:23.310> into<00:03:23.730> my<00:03:24.360> knitting<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.980> I'm

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
my beads into my knitting and I'm

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.210 
my beads into my knitting and I'm
working<00:03:26.400> them<00:03:26.610> on<00:03:26.790> every<00:03:27.329> right<00:03:27.870> side<00:03:27.900> row

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
working them on every right side row

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.090 
working them on every right side row
kind<00:03:29.220> of<00:03:29.370> staggering<00:03:29.910> them<00:03:30.299> a<00:03:30.329> little<00:03:30.750> bit<00:03:31.100> so

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
kind of staggering them a little bit so

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.380 
kind of staggering them a little bit so
you'll<00:03:33.000> need<00:03:33.269> your<00:03:33.989> very<00:03:34.799> small<00:03:35.280> crochet<00:03:36.150> hook

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
you'll need your very small crochet hook

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.199 
you'll need your very small crochet hook
here<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.900> again<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:38.100> crochet<00:03:38.489> hook<00:03:38.730> size<00:03:38.970> I'm

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
here and again the crochet hook size I'm

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.770 
here and again the crochet hook size I'm
using<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.890> 1.3<00:03:40.890> millimeters<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.850> then<00:03:42.540> you'll

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
using is 1.3 millimeters and then you'll

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.690 
using is 1.3 millimeters and then you'll
just<00:03:43.049> want<00:03:43.380> your<00:03:43.860> beads<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.579> you're

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
planning on using too so the first step

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.660 
planning on using too so the first step
is<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:50.010> simply<00:03:50.519> work<00:03:50.850> to<00:03:51.690> where<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:53.250> pattern

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
is to simply work to where the pattern

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.150 
is to simply work to where the pattern
says<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.390> incorporate<00:03:54.959> a<00:03:54.989> bead<00:03:55.290> or<00:03:55.650> if<00:03:56.010> you're

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
says to incorporate a bead or if you're

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.690 
says to incorporate a bead or if you're
just<00:03:56.390> making<00:03:57.390> a<00:03:57.660> pattern<00:03:58.260> up<00:03:58.620> making<00:03:59.340> up<00:03:59.549> your

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
just making a pattern up making up your

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.490 
just making a pattern up making up your
own<00:03:59.820> design<00:04:00.150> which<00:04:00.359> is<00:04:00.540> really<00:04:00.570> fun<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.350> do

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
own design which is really fun to do

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.210 
own design which is really fun to do
with<00:04:02.340> beads<00:04:03.049> just<00:04:04.049> get<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.500> spot<00:04:04.769> where

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
with beads just get to the spot where

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.030 
with beads just get to the spot where

here I want to add in a bead on this
stitch<00:04:11.480> the<00:04:12.480> very<00:04:12.720> first<00:04:13.019> step<00:04:13.290> is<00:04:13.910> take<00:04:14.910> your

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
stitch the very first step is take your

stitch the very first step is take your
small<00:04:16.139> crochet<00:04:16.530> hook

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
small crochet hook

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.110

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
and place a bead onto it now this is the

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.850 
and place a bead onto it now this is the
important<00:04:22.690> part<00:04:22.810> why<00:04:23.050> you<00:04:23.110> need<00:04:23.470> a<00:04:23.500> crochet

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
important part why you need a crochet

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.460 
important part why you need a crochet
hook<00:04:24.070> that's<00:04:24.580> so<00:04:24.820> small<00:04:25.150> because<00:04:25.990> you'll<00:04:26.170> need

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
hook that's so small because you'll need

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.520 
hook that's so small because you'll need
to<00:04:26.590> actually<00:04:26.770> place<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:27.820> crochet<00:04:28.240> hook

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
to actually place the crochet hook

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:35.580 
to actually place the crochet hook
through<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.770> bead<00:04:29.980> itself<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:34.690> again<00:04:35.260> I'm

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
through the bead itself and again I'm

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.630 
through the bead itself and again I'm
using<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:36.670> larger<00:04:37.660> size<00:04:37.930> seed<00:04:38.350> beads<00:04:38.680> the

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
using the larger size seed beads the

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:45.090 
using the larger size seed beads the
size<00:04:40.060> six<00:04:40.480> OTT<00:04:40.720> seed<00:04:41.260> beads<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:43.200> then<00:04:44.200> you're

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
size six OTT seed beads and then you're

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.620 
size six OTT seed beads and then you're
going<00:04:45.280> to<00:04:45.340> take<00:04:45.550> your<00:04:45.730> crochet<00:04:46.030> hook<00:04:46.240> and

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
going to take your crochet hook and
