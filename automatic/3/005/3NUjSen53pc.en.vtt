00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:08.099
 Hello, today's video I want 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.500
 show my masks which i made from 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.790
 papier mache 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:19.170
 first mask this jason mask here 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:25.140
 the simplest mask as I said from 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:28.010
 papier-mache is so pretty solid 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.730
 did on his face 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.010
 Means I pasted well sheets and on my 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.649
 face 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.129
 there is a first layer of water a second layer with 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:46.620
 glue and then worked glue water cool 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:51.899
 so much so I did not bother with him 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.100
 working days, two days, well, that's such here 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.860
 she's inside 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:01.949
 yes these are real holes to give not 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.270
 Thought it worked two days the first day 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.290
 it stuck it 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:11.939
 and the second day it was already drawing 1 was 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.460
 painting is white paint and then 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.010
 sketched the contour just typed in there 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.760

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.560
