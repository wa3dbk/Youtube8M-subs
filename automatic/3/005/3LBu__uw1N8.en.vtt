00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.860
 30 to 15 seconds 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.270

 more numbers if we get more numbers by 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.450
 example 8 etc. always let's 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:04.260
 select the largest number 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.260

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.909
 ok now let's get in the bar 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.130

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.789
 let's open the task manager 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.590
 and in the beginning all the programs that we 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.210
 go out to buy us on the apple plus 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.920
 the itunes 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.390
 you see that I have them in that state 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.569
 disabled ok they have to be 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.399
 all absolutely all disabled 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:39.219
 It's worth it if we appear enabled not 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.750
 they would show us what we would have 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:45.240
 what to do would be the right button and 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.399
