00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.330
 the pernambuco arena has a system 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.830
 cameras of 271 cameras being 10 in 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.990
 271 cameras 34 cameras are cameras in HD 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.300
 that allow the facial recognition of 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.899
 all the fans inside the arena 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.819
 that means you can know 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.760
 who within the area this brings a 

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:41.190
 comfort and safety for the whole crowd 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.100
 a ratio of lighting has already 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.159
 all this lateral closing and atef stf 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.069
 is a plastic that allows the entire 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:52.260
 lighting passes through it 

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:55.229
 so during the day we do not need 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.329
 turn on the lights to work the arena 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.899
 the building is very naturally lit 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.749
 with respect to acoustics the building has a 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.530
 coverage made with the technology called 

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:10.860
 sandwich technology that allows 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.039
 all the sound that this here is generated here 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.619
 by fans and fans really impact 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.869
 in the way players motivate 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.640
 with respect to sustainability the building 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.840
 has taken several actions that can be 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.359
 perceived 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.590
 we have in the arena the whole system of 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:27.299
 reuse water 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.369
 We have the lighting plates . 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.770
 solar that are used to 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.730
 heating of the players 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.150
 we sing 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.730
 in the area and not an effective control of the 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.330
 cooling system to the arena today 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.820
 it has an energy system that they 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.290
 photovoltaic plant which is an annex 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.860
 to the building 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.820
 the photovoltaic power plant provides us with 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.700
 during the day 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.220
 we do not have here in the arena is the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.210
 energy storage solar energy 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.910
 it is protected and it is consumed 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.470
 momentarily and this brings us 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.990
 a great economy, especially in the 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.430
 May before installation 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.380
 in these months we get a 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.960
 consumption of up to 30% of 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.650
 power the lawn drainage system 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.260
 it 's called fishbone 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.320
 he has all those vertebrae that 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.680
 have a spirit on the back of it 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.740
 water captured all these by all these 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.720
 systems come to the central part of the 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.390
 central part is distributed to the 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.550
 water boxes reuse all water 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.280
 used in lawn irrigation 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.959
 she does not screw her back to the prize 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.959
 in the reuse water system
