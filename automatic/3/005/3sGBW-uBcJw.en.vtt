function<00:01:44.250> button<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.420> don't

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
function button so this is if you don't

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.999 
function button so this is if you don't
have<00:01:45.720> an<00:01:45.810> NFC<00:01:46.140> device<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.649> want<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.860> pair

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
have an NFC device and you want to pair

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.280 
have an NFC device and you want to pair
it<00:01:47.040> up<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:48.329> do<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.020> just<00:01:49.049> hold

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
it up you can do that so you just hold

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.870 
it up you can do that so you just hold
it<00:01:49.380> down<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.740> put<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.159> pairing<00:01:50.460> mode<00:01:50.490> but

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
it down and put it in pairing mode but

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.819 
it down and put it in pairing mode but
the<00:01:51.840> big<00:01:51.960> thing<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.680> does<00:01:52.770> have

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
the big thing on it is that it does have

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.969 
the big thing on it is that it does have
NFC<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.579> for<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:54.049> lot<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.259> newer<00:01:55.380> blackberry

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
NFC so for a lot of the newer blackberry

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.770 
NFC so for a lot of the newer blackberry
7<00:01:56.219> devices<00:01:56.430> with<00:01:56.700> NFC<00:01:57.090> all<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.570> do<00:01:57.659> is

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
7 devices with NFC all you have to do is

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.179 
7 devices with NFC all you have to do is
tap<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.200> let's<00:01:58.439> just<00:01:58.590> show<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.920> second

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
here and it will pair it up and then

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.899 
here and it will pair it up and then
you're<00:02:01.680> rock<00:02:01.829> solid<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.280> can<00:02:02.399> actually<00:02:02.520> pair

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
you're rock solid you can actually pair

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.630 
you're rock solid you can actually pair
up<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.420> six<00:02:04.049> devices<00:02:04.350> with<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.579> only

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
up to six devices with it you can only

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.889 
up to six devices with it you can only
have<00:02:05.820> one<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.030> use<00:02:06.149> at<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.360> time<00:02:06.509> but<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.750> can

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
have one in use at a time but you can

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.449 
have one in use at a time but you can
pair<00:02:07.049> six<00:02:07.290> devices<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.829> if<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:07.979> have<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.369> know

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
pair six devices so if you have you know

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.669 
pair six devices so if you have you know
six<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.000> your<00:02:09.119> household<00:02:09.479> or<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.590> your

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
it can be all be paired and then you

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.759 
it can be all be paired and then you
just<00:02:15.450> have<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.659> you<00:02:16.019> know<00:02:16.140> switch<00:02:16.379> off<00:02:16.560> if

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
just have to you know switch off if

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.460 
just have to you know switch off if
you're<00:02:16.920> DJing<00:02:17.400> or<00:02:17.840> whatever<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.959> may<00:02:19.079> be<00:02:19.110> um

you're DJing or whatever it may be um

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.229 
you're DJing or whatever it may be um
but<00:02:20.129> I'm<00:02:20.220> going<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.400> go<00:02:20.459> ahead<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:20.670> remove<00:02:21.120> it

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
but I'm going to go ahead and remove it

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.410 
but I'm going to go ahead and remove it
on<00:02:21.420> my<00:02:21.720> device<00:02:21.900> here<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:23.760> can<00:02:23.909> just<00:02:24.150> take<00:02:24.390> a

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
on my device here so we can just take a

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.569 
on my device here so we can just take a
look<00:02:24.659> at<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.680> pairing<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.129> everything<00:02:26.459> so

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
look at the pairing and everything so

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.619 
look at the pairing and everything so
when<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.730> pull<00:02:26.879> it<00:02:26.970> out<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.150> box<00:02:27.299> and<00:02:27.510> plug

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
when you pull it out of the box and plug

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:28.819 
when you pull it out of the box and plug
it<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:27.870> it's<00:02:28.049> going<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.260> actually<00:02:28.379> jump<00:02:28.680> right

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
it in it's going to actually jump right

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.589 
it in it's going to actually jump right
into<00:02:28.980> pairing<00:02:29.340> mode<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:29.670> if<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.849> have<00:02:30.000> an<00:02:30.269> NFC

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
into pairing mode so if you have an NFC

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.039 
into pairing mode so if you have an NFC
device<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:31.349> know<00:02:31.470> bold<00:02:31.709> 9930<00:02:32.689> 1997<00:02:33.689> 90

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
device you know bold 9930 1997 90

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.520 
device you know bold 9930 1997 90
whatever<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:35.159> throw<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.519> on<00:02:35.609> I<00:02:35.849> get<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> vibrate

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
whatever you throw it on I get a vibrate

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.720 
whatever you throw it on I get a vibrate
of<00:02:37.530> course<00:02:37.769> you<00:02:37.829> have<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.010> make<00:02:38.129> sure<00:02:38.159> NFC<00:02:38.640> is

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
of course you have to make sure NFC is

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.849 
of course you have to make sure NFC is
on<00:02:38.879> let<00:02:39.659> me<00:02:39.720> see<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.930> connecting<00:02:40.319> dialogue<00:02:40.709> up

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
on let me see the connecting dialogue up

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:44.000 
on let me see the connecting dialogue up
top<00:02:41.069> there<00:02:42.409> it's<00:02:43.409> going<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.590> automatically

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
top there it's going to automatically

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.099 
top there it's going to automatically
turn<00:02:44.280> bluetooth<00:02:44.549> on<00:02:44.849> on<00:02:45.120> your<00:02:45.569> device<00:02:45.780> if<00:02:45.989> it's

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
turn bluetooth on on your device if it's

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:47.509 
turn bluetooth on on your device if it's
not<00:02:46.230> already<00:02:46.349> as<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.769> can<00:02:46.889> see<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.099> did<00:02:47.280> from

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
not already as you can see it did from

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.240 
not already as you can see it did from
the<00:02:47.670> LED<00:02:48.329> up<00:02:48.420> top<00:02:48.599> there<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.099> then<00:02:50.099> if<00:02:50.159> you

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
the LED up top there and then if you

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.379 
the LED up top there and then if you
give<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.489> second<00:02:50.879> it's<00:02:51.000> going<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.180> go<00:02:51.269> ahead

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
give it a second it's going to go ahead

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.420 
give it a second it's going to go ahead
and<00:02:51.510> connect<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:52.799> you<00:02:52.859> can<00:02:53.010> see<00:02:53.159> it's<00:02:53.280> all

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
and connect so you can see it's all

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.990 
and connect so you can see it's all
fired<00:02:53.730> up<00:02:53.909> there<00:02:54.799> and<00:02:55.799> that's<00:02:56.760> all<00:02:56.879> there<00:02:56.939> is

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
fired up there and that's all there is

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.429 
fired up there and that's all there is
to<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.420> then<00:02:57.720> if<00:02:57.780> we<00:02:57.840> go<00:02:57.930> back<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.290> jump

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
to it and then if we go back and jump

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.610 
to it and then if we go back and jump
into<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:59.220> music<00:02:59.430> player<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.139> pop<00:03:01.139> a<00:03:01.170> song<00:03:01.439> on

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.349 
into the music player and pop a song on
here<00:03:03.500> then<00:03:04.639> this<00:03:05.639> one<00:03:05.790> starts<00:03:06.030> out<00:03:06.150> kind<00:03:06.329> of

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
here then this one starts out kind of

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.089 
here then this one starts out kind of
slow<00:03:06.569> go<00:03:06.629> jump<00:03:07.019> in<00:03:07.109> the<00:03:07.170> lair<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:07.799> you<00:03:07.889> can<00:03:07.980> see

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
slow go jump in the lair so you can see

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.240 
slow go jump in the lair so you can see
inspired<00:03:08.400> there<00:03:08.670> just<00:03:08.879> like<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:10.129> so<00:03:11.129> that's

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
inspired there just like that so that's

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.289

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
percent of the time it should work the

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.979 
percent of the time it should work the
same<00:03:19.889> way<00:03:20.099> you<00:03:20.250> just<00:03:20.400> tap<00:03:20.609> it<00:03:20.639> with<00:03:21.389> the<00:03:21.540> NFC

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
same way you just tap it with the NFC

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.349 
same way you just tap it with the NFC
and<00:03:22.379> it'll<00:03:23.069> connect<00:03:23.370> it<00:03:23.519> it'll<00:03:23.819> work<00:03:23.970> with<00:03:24.150> any

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
and it'll connect it it'll work with any

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.970 
and it'll connect it it'll work with any
bluetooth-enabled<00:03:24.930> device<00:03:25.440> so<00:03:25.680> if<00:03:25.739> you<00:03:25.829> have

iPhone or some Android devices you can

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.990 
iPhone or some Android devices you can
hook<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.709> up<00:03:31.829> you<00:03:32.400> just<00:03:32.519> have<00:03:32.609> to<00:03:32.669> use<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.909> old

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
hook it up you just have to use the old

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.180 
hook it up you just have to use the old
school<00:03:33.299> manual<00:03:33.540> pairing<00:03:33.989> method<00:03:34.349> you<00:03:35.069> know

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
school manual pairing method you know

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.530 
school manual pairing method you know
and<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.370> would<00:03:35.459> hold<00:03:35.579> down<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.909> top<00:03:36.090> here<00:03:36.389> to

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
and you would hold down the top here to

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.089 
and you would hold down the top here to
get<00:03:36.659> in<00:03:36.720> pairing<00:03:37.019> mode<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.650> think<00:03:37.859> it<00:03:37.919> shows

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
get in pairing mode and I think it shows

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.860 
get in pairing mode and I think it shows
like<00:03:38.370> a<00:03:38.400> red<00:03:38.669> and<00:03:38.940> blue<00:03:39.150> alternating<00:03:39.720> light

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
like a red and blue alternating light

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.080 
like a red and blue alternating light
and<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.769> can<00:03:40.919> connect<00:03:41.129> it<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.430> way<00:03:41.579> like<00:03:42.000> I

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
and you can connect it that way like I

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.599 
and you can connect it that way like I
said<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.299> can<00:03:42.329> have<00:03:42.449> up<00:03:42.569> to<00:03:42.599> six<00:03:42.840> devices<00:03:43.139> so

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
said you can have up to six devices so

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.890 
said you can have up to six devices so
depending<00:03:44.609> on<00:03:44.609> what<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:44.879> got<00:03:45.030> going<00:03:45.269> on<00:03:45.359> you

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
depending on what you got going on you

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.939
