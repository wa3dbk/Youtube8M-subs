in the full format mode to do this when

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.120 
in the full format mode to do this when
I<00:01:08.020> open<00:01:08.380> an<00:01:08.470> image

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.459 

let<00:01:12.130> me<00:01:12.250> just<00:01:12.460> shot<00:01:12.670> a<00:01:12.700> local<00:01:13.270> lake<00:01:13.600> around<00:01:14.320> the

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
let me just shot a local lake around the

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.230 
let me just shot a local lake around the
corner<00:01:14.829> and<00:01:14.950> this<00:01:15.100> actually<00:01:15.700> was<00:01:15.880> one<00:01:16.090> of<00:01:16.180> the

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
corner and this actually was one of the

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.770 
corner and this actually was one of the
images<00:01:17.140> I<00:01:17.350> use<00:01:17.590> for<00:01:17.860> competition<00:01:18.610> I<00:01:18.850> just

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
images I use for competition I just

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.510 
images I use for competition I just
entered<00:01:20.140> in<00:01:20.290> a<00:01:20.350> competition<00:01:20.829> that's<00:01:21.159> coming

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
entered in a competition that's coming

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.109 
entered in a competition that's coming
up<00:01:21.610> and<00:01:21.939> I<00:01:22.329> use<00:01:22.540> Big<00:01:23.229> Brother<00:01:23.880> Photoshop<00:01:24.880> to

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
up and I use Big Brother Photoshop to

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.700 
up and I use Big Brother Photoshop to
create<00:01:25.509> my<00:01:25.689> black<00:01:25.960> and<00:01:26.140> white<00:01:26.320> from<00:01:26.530> this

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
create my black and white from this

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.709 
create my black and white from this
color<00:01:26.979> image<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.549> I<00:01:27.700> tell<00:01:28.299> you<00:01:28.420> it's<00:01:28.509> it's

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719 
color image and I tell you it's it's

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.190 
color image and I tell you it's it's
much<00:01:29.289> easier<00:01:29.710> to<00:01:29.829> do<00:01:29.950> it<00:01:30.100> in<00:01:30.130> elements<00:01:31.200> you

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
much easier to do it in elements you

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.620 
much easier to do it in elements you
know<00:01:32.350> so<00:01:32.560> anyway<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.950> can<00:01:36.189> some<00:01:36.880> cameras<00:01:37.360> have

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
know so anyway you can some cameras have

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.029 
know so anyway you can some cameras have
a<00:01:37.659> black<00:01:37.930> and<00:01:38.140> white<00:01:38.259> mode<00:01:38.500> but<00:01:38.649> the<00:01:38.740> problem

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
a black and white mode but the problem

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.510 
a black and white mode but the problem
is<00:01:39.130> it<00:01:39.340> creates<00:01:39.850> kind<00:01:40.149> of<00:01:40.299> a<00:01:40.649> flat<00:01:41.649> image<00:01:42.070> when

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
is it creates kind of a flat image when

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.959 
is it creates kind of a flat image when
you<00:01:43.170> when<00:01:44.170> shoots<00:01:44.469> black<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:44.950> white<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:45.549> give

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
you when shoots black and white and give

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.399 
you when shoots black and white and give
me<00:01:46.060> an<00:01:46.119> example<00:01:46.630> that<00:01:46.810> if<00:01:46.990> I<00:01:47.140> go<00:01:47.289> into<00:01:47.469> mode

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
me an example that if I go into mode

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.529 
me an example that if I go into mode
typical<00:01:50.409> color<00:01:51.009> mode<00:01:51.310> is<00:01:51.340> RGB<00:01:51.609> so<00:01:52.240> if<00:01:52.329> we<00:01:52.390> go<00:01:52.509> to

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
typical color mode is RGB so if we go to

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.490 
typical color mode is RGB so if we go to
image<00:01:52.869> mode<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:54.520> can<00:01:54.640> see<00:01:54.909> here<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:56.020> RGB

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
image mode you can see here the RGB

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.980 
image mode you can see here the RGB
color<00:01:56.950> mode<00:01:57.250> if<00:01:57.579> we<00:01:57.820> just<00:01:58.090> go<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:58.329> grayscale

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
color mode if we just go to grayscale

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.980 
color mode if we just go to grayscale
you'll<00:01:59.829> ask<00:02:00.009> if<00:02:00.969> we<00:02:01.149> want<00:02:01.329> to<00:02:01.390> discard<00:02:01.780> the

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
you'll ask if we want to discard the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.039 
you'll ask if we want to discard the
color<00:02:02.200> information<00:02:02.409> we'd<00:02:02.979> say<00:02:03.130> yes<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.719> here

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
color information we'd say yes and here

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.359 
color information we'd say yes and here
we've<00:02:05.320> removed<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.770> color<00:02:06.009> as<00:02:06.249> you<00:02:06.399> see<00:02:07.289> but

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
we've removed the color as you see but

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:16.310 
we've removed the color as you see but
the<00:02:09.369> black<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:09.820> white<00:02:10.000> is<00:02:10.270> very<00:02:10.990> very<00:02:11.260> flat<00:02:13.740> so

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
the black and white is very very flat so

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.710 
the black and white is very very flat so
one<00:02:17.320> of<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.500> things<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:17.800> can<00:02:18.129> do<00:02:18.400> if<00:02:18.819> this<00:02:19.330> you

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
one of the things you can do if this you

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.119 
one of the things you can do if this you
know<00:02:19.840> if<00:02:20.019> this<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:20.379> all<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.709> do<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:20.950> by<00:02:21.069> the

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
know if this is all you do and by the

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.559 
know if this is all you do and by the
way<00:02:21.310> this<00:02:21.670> is

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
way this is

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.270 
way this is
you<00:02:23.629> want<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.930> convert<00:02:24.200> it<00:02:24.260> back<00:02:24.379> you<00:02:25.069> want<00:02:25.219> to

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
you want to convert it back you want to

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.830 
you want to convert it back you want to
go<00:02:25.370> back<00:02:25.519> to<00:02:25.700> mode<00:02:25.939> RGB<00:02:27.639> color<00:02:28.639> when<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.659> go<00:02:29.780> to

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
go back to mode RGB color when you go to

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.959 
go back to mode RGB color when you go to
print<00:02:30.170> because<00:02:30.560> most<00:02:31.450> print<00:02:32.450> places<00:02:33.280> need<00:02:34.280> RGB

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:34.969 
print because most print places need RGB

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.839 
print because most print places need RGB
but<00:02:35.689> if<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.829> want<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.129> pump<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.459> up<00:02:37.549> a<00:02:37.700> little

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
but if you want to pump it up a little

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.339 
but if you want to pump it up a little
bit<00:02:38.030> sometimes<00:02:38.450> you<00:02:38.599> go<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.840> enhance<00:02:41.349> adjust

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
bit sometimes you go to enhance adjust

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.940 
bit sometimes you go to enhance adjust
lighting<00:02:43.120> brightness<00:02:44.120> contrast<00:02:44.389> and<00:02:45.049> you<00:02:45.739> can

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
lighting brightness contrast and you can

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.229 
lighting brightness contrast and you can
pump<00:02:46.549> some<00:02:46.760> contrast<00:02:47.389> into<00:02:47.659> it<00:02:48.010> here<00:02:49.060> see<00:02:50.060> if<00:02:50.120> I

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
pump some contrast into it here see if I

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.729 
pump some contrast into it here see if I
can<00:02:50.359> get<00:02:50.480> some<00:02:50.659> contrast<00:02:54.669> not<00:02:55.669> responding

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
can get some contrast not responding

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.250 
can get some contrast not responding
here<00:02:57.739> we<00:02:57.829> go<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:59.180> system<00:02:59.389> is<00:02:59.719> so<00:02:59.930> going<00:03:00.200> a

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
here we go the system is so going a

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.800 
here we go the system is so going a
little<00:03:00.379> slow<00:03:00.709> today<00:03:00.950> okay<00:03:01.879> so<00:03:01.909> so<00:03:02.329> I<00:03:02.359> can<00:03:02.569> pump

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
little slow today okay so so I can pump

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.809 
little slow today okay so so I can pump
some<00:03:02.989> contrast<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:04.099> that's<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.400> little<00:03:04.609> better

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
some contrast and that's a little better

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.819 
some contrast and that's a little better
get<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.150> little<00:03:05.359> brighter<00:03:05.569> that's<00:03:06.379> a<00:03:06.590> little

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
get a little brighter that's a little

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.379 
get a little brighter that's a little
better<00:03:07.040> black<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.519> white<00:03:08.620> but<00:03:10.389> Photoshop

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
better black and white but Photoshop
