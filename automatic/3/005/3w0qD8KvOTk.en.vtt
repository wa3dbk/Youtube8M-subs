00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.690
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.369
 get the aoc knife that's all 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.860
 simply the vehicle that only those 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.540
 who bought the collector pack of gta 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.309
 5 could have until today 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.720
 but here is the revolution it's time 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.460
 of the revolution it has changed so I 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.010
 will show you how to get it you 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.320
 just have on the lgi you 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.550
 click on the home button you go 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.020
 on the search bar with your 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.420
 slider makes you grow fast 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.420
 there you replace the number 27 with the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.550
 number 29 so using the keyboard you 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.110
 brings you come across the page 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.489
 the high size must be redone again 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.570
 once this mania takes the same manipulation 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.130
 by modifying the text 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.780
 here we're going to do is believe 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.520
 quickly there you see jifei manic 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.500
 it's okay to peille can the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.489
 do not go back do not we want where we go 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.350
 make you break quickly 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.680
 and there you simply remove the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.020
 because a quarter detail 29 by fear chase 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.720
 because who simply wants to say purchases 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.860
 of the car has in English a sportswoman 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.710
 because in the singular and you will do 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.110
 enter and there you will see that the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.600
 message will be displayed so you go 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.679
 get the car so the car is going 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.190
 to be delivered directly into your 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.649
 garage 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.690
 so this car will not be visible to 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.160
 the naked eye you will have to call the 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.270
 mechanic to get it like any 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.530
 any other vehicle when you put on 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.360
 a road anywhere you call the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.830
 mechanic he's going to bring it back to you so 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.330
 I had fun to customize this is 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.500
 really a very holy vehicle boss 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.060
 aesthetically it is really very 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.220
 pretty one 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.020
 on the other hand not much adhesion and 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.580
 a really bogus braking take it to 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.660
 I really can at the bars in 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.340
 the water in the end of this video 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.569
