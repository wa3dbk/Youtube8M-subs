included and my regular video review it
got<00:00:28.509> a<00:00:28.539> little<00:00:29.050> bit<00:00:29.230> buzzy<00:00:29.679> up<00:00:29.859> front<00:00:30.220> and<00:00:30.669> I

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
got a little bit buzzy up front and I

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.609 
got a little bit buzzy up front and I
couldn't<00:00:31.480> determine<00:00:31.989> where<00:00:32.140> it<00:00:32.230> was<00:00:32.350> coming

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
couldn't determine where it was coming

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.080 
couldn't determine where it was coming
from<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:34.270> little<00:00:34.330> bolt<00:00:34.900> right<00:00:35.110> here<00:00:36.090> that

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
from this little bolt right here that

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.410 
from this little bolt right here that
holds<00:00:37.330> on<00:00:37.630> the<00:00:38.290> windscreen<00:00:40.770> area<00:00:42.150> it<00:00:43.150> got

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
holds on the windscreen area it got

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.340 
holds on the windscreen area it got
loose<00:00:43.660> and<00:00:43.990> so<00:00:44.320> it<00:00:44.820> started<00:00:45.820> buzzing<00:00:46.170> at<00:00:47.170> low

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
loose and so it started buzzing at low

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:54.540 
loose and so it started buzzing at low
speed<00:00:47.620> also<00:00:47.920> if<00:00:48.400> you<00:00:48.520> notice<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.550> cable<00:00:53.550> right

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
speed also if you notice the cable right

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.050 
speed also if you notice the cable right
here<00:00:54.870> it'll<00:00:55.870> end<00:00:56.200> up<00:00:56.620> buzzing<00:00:56.980> this<00:00:57.370> a<00:00:57.550> little

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
here it'll end up buzzing this a little

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.730 
here it'll end up buzzing this a little
bit<00:00:58.290> so<00:00:59.610> if<00:01:00.610> you<00:01:01.420> this<00:01:01.720> is<00:01:01.960> if<00:01:02.230> it's<00:01:02.470> all<00:01:02.650> the

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
tool kit I'll stop playing up Allen

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.680 
tool kit I'll stop playing up Allen
wrenches<00:01:30.430> and<00:01:30.580> my<00:01:30.670> other<00:01:30.880> tools<00:01:31.210> here<00:01:31.540> in<00:01:31.600> my

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.880 
wrenches and my other tools here in my
garage<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:33.100> it<00:01:33.190> wasn't<00:01:33.520> a<00:01:33.700> big<00:01:34.030> deal<00:01:37.380> as<00:01:38.380> I<00:01:38.650> said

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
garage so it wasn't a big deal as I said

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.910 
garage so it wasn't a big deal as I said
before<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:42.330> you<00:01:43.330> know<00:01:43.479> most<00:01:43.780> of<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.619> fluid

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
before the you know most of the fluid

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.090 
before the you know most of the fluid
check<00:01:45.340> level<00:01:45.640> areas<00:01:46.060> are<00:01:46.560> really<00:01:47.560> hard<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:47.920> get

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
check level areas are really hard to get

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.010 
check level areas are really hard to get
to<00:01:48.159> you<00:01:48.670> can't<00:01:48.970> really<00:01:49.180> see<00:01:49.540> them<00:01:49.690> without

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
to you can't really see them without

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.649 
to you can't really see them without
taking<00:01:50.440> stuff<00:01:50.650> off<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:51.040> bike<00:01:51.250> you<00:01:51.659> know

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
taking stuff off the bike you know

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.840 
taking stuff off the bike you know
here's<00:01:52.900> the<00:01:53.049> rear<00:01:53.229> brake<00:01:53.619> fluid<00:01:54.100> there's<00:01:54.580> the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
here's the rear brake fluid there's the

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.580 
here's the rear brake fluid there's the
front<00:01:55.150> brake<00:01:55.450> fluid<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:57.040> can't<00:01:57.369> check<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
front brake fluid you can't check the

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.580 
front brake fluid you can't check the
radiator<00:02:00.010> fluid<00:02:00.340> level<00:02:00.850> without<00:02:01.840> you<00:02:02.500> know

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
radiator fluid level without you know

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.330 
radiator fluid level without you know
getting<00:02:03.130> into<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.460> bike<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:03.670> little<00:02:03.939> bit

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
getting into the bike a little bit

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.950 
getting into the bike a little bit
unfortunately<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.670> think<00:02:06.909> it's<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.630> only

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
unfortunately I think it's the only

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.300 
unfortunately I think it's the only
design<00:02:08.410> flaw<00:02:08.800> really<00:02:09.340> that<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:11.080> know<00:02:11.200> I

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
design flaw really that you know I

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.760 
design flaw really that you know I
just<00:02:12.730> don't<00:02:12.970> care<00:02:13.300> for<00:02:14.489> um<00:02:16.140> here's<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.230> little

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
just don't care for um here's a little

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.830 
just don't care for um here's a little
bit<00:02:17.890> of<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.040> closer<00:02:18.310> look<00:02:18.640> at<00:02:19.030> what<00:02:19.209> Honda<00:02:19.660> is

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
bit of a closer look at what Honda is

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.620 
bit of a closer look at what Honda is

instead<00:05:14.979> of<00:05:15.130> red<00:05:16.110> just<00:05:17.110> because<00:05:17.380> most<00:05:17.620> of<00:05:17.800> my

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
instead of red just because most of my

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.860 
instead of red just because most of my
writing<00:05:18.069> gear<00:05:18.430> is<00:05:18.580> blue<00:05:18.880> and<00:05:19.210> I<00:05:19.449> think<00:05:19.720> it

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
writing gear is blue and I think it

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.990 
writing gear is blue and I think it
would<00:05:19.990> be<00:05:20.110> pretty<00:05:20.770> damn<00:05:21.069> cool<00:05:21.370> to<00:05:21.610> be<00:05:21.699> a<00:05:21.729> little

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
would be pretty damn cool to be a little

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.719 
would be pretty damn cool to be a little
bit<00:05:22.090> different<00:05:22.569> from<00:05:23.409> the<00:05:23.500> other<00:05:23.740> bikes<00:05:26.729> on

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
bit different from the other bikes on

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.959 
bit different from the other bikes on
that<00:05:28.000> does<00:05:28.180> have<00:05:28.389> a<00:05:28.630> sport<00:05:28.990> screen<00:05:29.349> available

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:32.969 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:36.060 

instead<00:05:33.969> of<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.240> standard<00:05:34.449> windscreen<00:05:35.169> and

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
instead of the standard windscreen and

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.010 
instead of the standard windscreen and
they're<00:05:36.400> also<00:05:36.610> talking<00:05:37.030> about<00:05:37.389> a<00:05:38.789> taller

touring windscreen video if the bike

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.439 
touring windscreen video if the bike
would<00:05:47.110> be<00:05:47.139> good<00:05:47.409> for<00:05:47.710> touring<00:05:48.570> to<00:05:49.570> up<00:05:51.449> and
