00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.900
 ah 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.730
 good afternoon friends from youtube the 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.200
 today I bring you a tweet called 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.240
 forecast 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.490
 and those who already have experience with 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.340
 the world of jailbreak sure that when 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:46.070
 are forecast a tri decides since we 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.590
 bring a widget to place in the 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.800
 lock screen with information 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.470
 of the current weather situation does not 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.200
 and the prediction also for the 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.690
 next days this tweet has a few 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.870
 very notorious changes since in adobe 6 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.640
 it was just a little widget that occupied 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.860
 at the top on the screen 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.230
 blocking 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.690
 but now in cock you see 7 we do not have 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.120
 as a background full screen 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.150
 lively which will change according to the 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.630
 weather conditions and also the 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.960
 time of day and joined with another tubey that 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.760
 lest it make us much cleaner 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.200
 lock screen I mean to be a 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.560
 Blog 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.100
 that installing this tweet creates a 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.530
 Configuration menu within settings 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.409
 and there we can select which elements 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.359
 of the screen block 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.230
 or lock screen we want 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:46.960
 personalize 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.970
 so first we're going to do is 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.620
 install the first tweet we are going to go to 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.240
 cydia 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.240
 let's wait for it to load 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.240
 Y 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.670
 there are two there are several more versions in 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.650
 several rest I have it installed 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.820
 obvious free on the network can 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.899
 iphone hardware as you see forecast 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.750
 simply where it says modify to 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.900
 get lion when installing it in style and 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.420
 the second sprint and that would be all a 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.990
 Once it is already installed 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.010
 they are going to see that it will be for example like this 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.409
 activated that is and they will see 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.799
 down at the bottom what is 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:33.189
 be in how many degrees 26 degrees and they're going to 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:36.730
 see the whole screen filled not all the 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:39.159
 screen filled with the weather now by 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.620
 example to me how do you see I get in the 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.659
 top left the time and on the 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.640
 top right what is the 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.860
 date that's what the other does 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.000
 tweet 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.000
 we are not going to cydia 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.570
 let's go in like this day for the other the 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.570
 another tweet 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.070
 let's wait for it to load 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.070
 look for the other tweet 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.840
 and let's see 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.290
 who finished loading perfect 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.200
 let's find the other 'tweet' 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.560
 here is in the I have also with the 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.940
 repudio to the iPhone completely free 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.940
 I already have it installed 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.330
 and when we install, we're going to go 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.750
 to settings 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.069
 we are going to cydia 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.250
 let's find the tweet that is here 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.080
 and as you see 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:42.750
 we are going to activate it in this way 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:46.320
 for example in the first option 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:49.080
 is what moves the clock to the 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.580
 left and reduce the size by putting the 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.530
 date right as I do 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.230
 right now for example not 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.750
 klose seconds is more than everything for 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.150
 add the seconds to the clock the other 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.360
 option is what makes us move 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.060
 the unlocking bar 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.820
 to the bottom I for example this 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:12.300
 I have the option 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:15.600
 disabled as you see and I have 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.400
 and I have the one below the slide or the one 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.740
 down enabled which is what makes me 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.790
 hides the unlock bar so if you 

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:25.710
 have noticed in my case not as they see 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.980
 let's see in my case for example I do not 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:32.969
 it comes out to unlock your device all 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.759
 that's what that option makes me do 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:39.639
 and we like it not the one below modifies 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:43.479
 the color below hides the date 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.219
 the other is effective for effective 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.949
 camera not to show an access 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:51.639
 direct that is to leave it as it is 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:54.529
 you do not need to modify that 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.710
 but how do you see these two tics 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:59.580
 excellent 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.580
 for what it is 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.840
 to leave if I do not achieve it is more 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.520
 clean is not the big number with the 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.530
 hours the text down all right 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.380
 modified well ordered and it leaves you 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.259
 better the whole screen so you can 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.500
 know you clean the screen well yes 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:23.810
 how is a tweet 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.610
 ie with dynamic backgrounds 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.200
 always be aware of what is the 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.009
 battery because this consumes you a lot 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.869
 battery so 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:33.270
 the people who suffer with problems in 

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:34.700
 the battery and all that thinking well 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.130
 before 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.590
 to install this tweet and then the video 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.720
 do not forget to like it please 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.030
 the little hand up share the 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.980
 video 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.450
 and any reference tube can 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.830
 leave your comment and anyway 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.660
 in the video description would be 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.320
 leaving the rest in which it is 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.700
 free these two tics and also the 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.970
 steps to follow so that they can 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:01.020
 install and all go well many 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.020
 thank you and see you later
