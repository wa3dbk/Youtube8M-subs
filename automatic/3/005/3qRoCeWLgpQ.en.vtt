00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:17.360
 Hello everyone, Vitalik 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.560
 Today we will learn to distribute the Internet and 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.770
 local networks 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.180
 that is, if you have internet connected 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.789
 only on one computer 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.430
 then you can give it a small science and give it away 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.429
 to other computers 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.989
 how to do it let's see 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:37.250
 drew on check on whether we have 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.380
 ban a little minus if he turns off the volume 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.880
 nothing works him 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:48.030
 so go to start control panel 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:50.600
 system and security and we go bath 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.840
 invest 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.350
 drive service administration and here 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.680
 today all servants things firewall 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.680
 windows 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.620
 see it works 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.100
 If you have a rest, do we press something? 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.930
 twice on the inscription we choose the type 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.430
 startup automatically 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.960
 apply and click run 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.960
 after which we save everything and exit 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.220
 now we need to configure the network 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.990
 interface to distribute 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.990
 internet local network 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.320
 go to the control panel and remove in 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.320
 Network and Internet 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.500
 and go to the network control center and 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.500
 shared 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.290
 there is a parameter change point 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.290
 adapter 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.290
 opening 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.070
 we see this is our connection to 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.300
 the internet 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.300
 this is our local network 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.610
 first set up internet connection 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.500
 we select it we press the right button and 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.500
 go to properties 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.010
 go to the access tab 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.840
 and mark allow others 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.489
 network users use 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.760
 internet connection given 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.760
 computer 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.599
 checkbox 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.769
 below we also leave 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.750
 allow them to network users 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.519
 managing shared access connections 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:50.500
 the Internet 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:50.500
 after that we press ok and we think that 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:58.280
 dress network lan card 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:03:04.660
 ip will be assigned the address 192 168 137 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.660
 one click like that 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.980
 and now we go connection by 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.980
 local network 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.280
 we also select it we press right 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.280
 click and go to properties 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:37.530
 properties go internet protocol 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:40.790
 version 4 10 ipad 4 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.790
 live properties 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:50.370
 Here we see that the ip address is really 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:53.020
 changed now we need at all 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.620
 computers which 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.970
 want to access the internet 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:06.190
 write network settings 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:09.580
 IP address 192 168 137 two three four 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.250
 five six and so on i mean first 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:16.320
 three numbers remain and the last changes 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.320
 with an increase of 1 and 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:24.550
 main gateway to all others 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:28.530
 client computers we specify and pi 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.530
 address of this computer 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.620
 that is, we write on everyone else 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.950
 computers 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:45.140
 ah pi address for example 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:46.280
 192 168 137 3 so further up 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:54.460
 to not match 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:05:02.440
 and the main gateway we put 190 heads 168 137 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:06.040
 1 and in the dns server on each computer 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.360
 client we also prescribe 190 on 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:13.090
 160 8037 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.090
 1 and save 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.200
 I won't save everything here 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.740
 properly configured 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.820
 we just warmed up that's all after that 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:27.130
 reboot this computer and 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.750
 computer clients then internet 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.300
 will work for you all over the local 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.920
 network 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:37.150
 that's all thank you for your attention 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.660
 do not forget to subscribe and set 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.660
