00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
faith for a long time I thought that the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.240 
faith for a long time I thought that the
Bible<00:00:42.149> was<00:00:42.300> inspired<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:43.260> inerrant<00:00:43.980> that

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
Bible was inspired and inerrant that

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.190 
Bible was inspired and inerrant that
there<00:00:44.370> were<00:00:44.460> no<00:00:44.610> mistakes<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> Bible<00:00:45.450> but

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
there were no mistakes in the Bible but

that<00:01:50.729> was<00:01:51.090> original<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.659> Christianity<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
that was original to Christianity it's a

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.560 
that was original to Christianity it's a
later<00:01:52.890> historical<00:01:53.549> development<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
later historical development so to the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.389 
later historical development so to the
doctrine<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.110> Trinity<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.680> these

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
doctrine of the Trinity and these

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.580 
doctrine of the Trinity and these
various<00:01:56.790> ideas<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.540> had<00:01:57.689> held<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.380> I

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
various ideas that I had held on to I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.530 
various ideas that I had held on to I
started<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.250> realize<00:01:59.549> were<00:01:59.759> historical

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
started to realize were historical

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.170 
started to realize were historical
formulations<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.490> just<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> existence<00:02:03.060> of

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
formulations and just the existence of

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.240 
formulations and just the existence of
God<00:02:03.390> himself<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.020> finally<00:02:04.409> can<00:02:04.590> realize<00:02:05.040> that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
God himself I finally can realize that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.990 
God himself I finally can realize that
it<00:02:05.369> for<00:02:06.270> me<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.719> simply<00:02:07.170> didn't<00:02:07.409> make<00:02:07.439> sense

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
it for me it simply didn't make sense

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.700 
it for me it simply didn't make sense
or<00:02:08.240> how<00:02:08.479> well<00:02:08.690> that<00:02:08.810> is<00:02:08.960> an<00:02:09.080> interesting<00:02:09.350> thing

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
or how well that is an interesting thing

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.160 
or how well that is an interesting thing
that<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.220> you<00:02:11.060> know<00:02:11.150> we<00:02:11.330> think<00:02:11.600> when<00:02:11.780> we<00:02:11.930> read

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
that the you know we think when we read

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.020 
that the you know we think when we read
the<00:02:12.290> Bible<00:02:12.470> that<00:02:12.830> we're<00:02:13.040> obviously<00:02:13.820> reading

the Bible that we're obviously reading

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.820 
the Bible that we're obviously reading
the<00:02:14.210> words<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.750> Matthew<00:02:15.140> wrote<00:02:15.380> or<00:02:15.680> that

made later in many cases many most cases
many<00:02:32.480> centuries<00:02:32.840> later<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:34.370> we<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.480> New

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
many centuries later so we the New

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.030 
many centuries later so we the New

Greek and at present we have something

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.130 
Greek and at present we have something
like<00:02:39.489> 5500<00:02:40.489> manuscripts<00:02:41.180> in<00:02:41.330> Greek<00:02:41.720> of<00:02:41.930> the

New Testament which is a lot for an
ancient<00:02:44.180> book<00:02:44.450> it's<00:02:44.690> far<00:02:44.900> more<00:02:44.930> than<00:02:45.110> any

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
ancient book it's far more than any

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.770 
ancient book it's far more than any
other<00:02:45.620> ancient<00:02:46.040> book<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.940> problem<00:02:47.390> is<00:02:47.540> most

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
other ancient book the problem is most

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.390 
other ancient book the problem is most
of<00:02:48.020> these<00:02:48.140> copies<00:02:48.620> are<00:02:48.650> hundreds<00:02:49.280> and

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
of these copies are hundreds and

of these copies are hundreds and
hundreds<00:02:49.670> of<00:02:49.730> years<00:02:49.910> after<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.450> originals

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
hundreds of years after the originals

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.080 
hundreds of years after the originals
and<00:02:51.140> all<00:02:51.770> of<00:02:51.980> them<00:02:52.130> have<00:02:52.280> differences<00:02:52.760> in<00:02:52.820> them

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
and all of them have differences in them

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.600 
and all of them have differences in them
so<00:02:54.020> that<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.350> scribes<00:02:54.680> who<00:02:55.070> are<00:02:55.160> copying

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
so that the scribes who are copying

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.910 
so that the scribes who are copying
these<00:02:55.730> manuscripts<00:02:56.450> changed<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.380> text<00:02:57.800> that

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
these manuscripts changed the text that

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.190 
these manuscripts changed the text that
they<00:02:58.010> were<00:02:58.070> copying<00:02:58.900> sometimes<00:02:59.900> by<00:03:00.020> accident

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
they were copying sometimes by accident

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.140 
they were copying sometimes by accident
sometimes<00:03:00.950> they<00:03:01.070> just<00:03:01.220> made<00:03:01.370> mistakes<00:03:01.820> they

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
sometimes they just made mistakes they

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.630 
sometimes they just made mistakes they
were<00:03:02.239> sleepy<00:03:02.780> or<00:03:02.989> incompetent<00:03:03.739> or<00:03:03.890> whatever

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
were sleepy or incompetent or whatever

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.640 
were sleepy or incompetent or whatever
but<00:03:04.940> sometimes<00:03:05.390> it<00:03:05.840> looks<00:03:06.050> like<00:03:06.170> scribes

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
but sometimes it looks like scribes

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.140 
but sometimes it looks like scribes
actually<00:03:07.280> thought<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.610> text<00:03:07.880> should<00:03:08.000> say

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
actually thought the text should say

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.670 
actually thought the text should say
something<00:03:08.510> other<00:03:08.630> than<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.050> did<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.560> then

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
something other than it did and then

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.430 
something other than it did and then
they<00:03:09.830> so<00:03:10.310> they<00:03:10.430> would<00:03:10.550> change<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.970> text<00:03:11.440> some

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
they so they would change the text some

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.930 
they so they would change the text some
places<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.950> looks<00:03:13.130> like<00:03:13.250> it's<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.459> manipulation

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
places it looks like it's a manipulation

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.030 
places it looks like it's a manipulation
of<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.209> text<00:03:14.600> where<00:03:14.750> where<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.380> author<00:03:15.560> wants

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
of the text where where the author wants

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.280 
of the text where where the author wants
to<00:03:16.160> change<00:03:16.459> where<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.360> scribe<00:03:17.660> wants<00:03:18.140> to

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
to change where the scribe wants to

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.259 
to change where the scribe wants to
change<00:03:18.560> what<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.890> author<00:03:19.070> said<00:03:19.519> I<00:03:19.730> mean<00:03:20.150> in

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
change what the author said I mean in

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.060 
change what the author said I mean in
many<00:03:20.480> cases<00:03:20.930> it<00:03:21.080> may<00:03:21.230> be<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.799> scribe

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
many cases it may be that the scribe

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.410 
many cases it may be that the scribe
thought<00:03:22.340> this<00:03:22.549> is<00:03:22.670> what<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:22.910> author<00:03:23.030> really

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
thought this is what the author really

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.110 
thought this is what the author really
meant<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:23.900> so<00:03:24.380> he<00:03:24.470> changed<00:03:24.709> it<00:03:25.070> but<00:03:25.370> but

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
meant and so he changed it but but

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.240 
meant and so he changed it but but
sometimes<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.810> text<00:03:27.260> gets<00:03:27.440> changed<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:28.100> say

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
sometimes the text gets changed to say

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.410 
sometimes the text gets changed to say
just<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.519> opposite<00:03:28.910> of<00:03:29.000> what<00:03:29.180> it<00:03:29.299> originally

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
just the opposite of what it originally

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.770 
just the opposite of what it originally
said<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.290> so<00:03:30.950> that's<00:03:31.700> that<00:03:32.390> could<00:03:32.540> that<00:03:32.630> can

somebody<00:05:13.200> else<00:05:13.500> and<00:05:13.860> so<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.669> idea<00:05:15.030> is<00:05:15.330> usually

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
somebody else and so the idea is usually

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.830 
somebody else and so the idea is usually
thought<00:05:16.470> that<00:05:17.010> Matthew<00:05:17.970> and<00:05:18.150> Luke<00:05:18.360> actually

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
thought that Matthew and Luke actually

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.870 
thought that Matthew and Luke actually
copied<00:05:19.560> some<00:05:19.770> of<00:05:19.889> their<00:05:19.979> stories<00:05:20.370> from<00:05:20.520> mark

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
copied some of their stories from mark

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.120 
copied some of their stories from mark
that's<00:05:21.540> why<00:05:21.780> they're<00:05:22.080> there<00:05:22.440> verbatim<00:05:23.100> the

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
that's why they're there verbatim the

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.580 
that's why they're there verbatim the
same<00:05:23.490> in<00:05:24.030> so<00:05:24.210> many<00:05:24.300> places<00:05:24.540> one<00:05:25.140> of<00:05:25.169> the<00:05:25.350> things

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590

in early Christianity there were a
variety<00:05:41.250> of<00:05:41.729> Christian<00:05:42.240> groups<00:05:42.479> that

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
variety of Christian groups that

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.140 
variety of Christian groups that
believed<00:05:42.930> a<00:05:43.110> variety<00:05:43.590> of<00:05:43.620> things<00:05:44.120> some<00:05:45.120> of

believed a variety of things some of

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.090 
believed a variety of things some of
them<00:05:45.330> that<00:05:45.479> would<00:05:45.660> seem<00:05:45.930> wild<00:05:46.440> and<00:05:46.590> crazy<00:05:46.830> to

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
them that would seem wild and crazy to

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.100 
them that would seem wild and crazy to
most<00:05:47.310> Christians<00:05:47.430> today<00:05:47.870> but<00:05:48.870> there<00:05:49.020> were

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
most Christians today but there were

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.409 
most Christians today but there were
battles<00:05:49.590> for<00:05:50.160> who<00:05:50.610> would<00:05:50.760> be<00:05:50.940> right<00:05:51.150> and<00:05:51.300> who

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
battles for who would be right and who

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:52.460 
battles for who would be right and who
would<00:05:51.510> be<00:05:51.630> wrong<00:05:51.840> and<00:05:51.870> who<00:05:52.169> would<00:05:52.289> get<00:05:52.440> the

would be wrong and who would get the

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.290 
would be wrong and who would get the
most<00:05:52.740> converts<00:05:53.250> and<00:05:53.430> who<00:05:53.490> would<00:05:53.640> establish

most converts and who would establish

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.230 
most converts and who would establish
what<00:05:54.870> the<00:05:55.110> what<00:05:55.710> the<00:05:55.890> standard<00:05:56.490> view<00:05:56.789> would<00:05:57.000> be

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
what the what the standard view would be

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.080 
what the what the standard view would be
the<00:05:58.110> standard<00:05:58.410> view<00:05:58.919> is<00:05:59.039> called<00:05:59.220> orthodoxy

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
the standard view is called orthodoxy

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.270 
the standard view is called orthodoxy
the<00:06:00.300> word<00:06:00.720> orthodoxy<00:06:01.410> means<00:06:01.710> the<00:06:01.979> correct

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
the word orthodoxy means the correct

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.100 
the word orthodoxy means the correct
belief<00:06:02.490> so<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.390> people<00:06:03.539> who<00:06:03.780> ended<00:06:04.020> up

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
belief so the people who ended up

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.659 
belief so the people who ended up
winning<00:06:04.320> these<00:06:04.590> battles<00:06:05.100> over<00:06:05.250> what<00:06:05.520> to

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
winning these battles over what to

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.400 
winning these battles over what to
believe<00:06:05.820> called<00:06:06.300> themselves<00:06:06.570> Orthodox

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
believe called themselves Orthodox

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.750 
believe called themselves Orthodox
meaning<00:06:07.800> they<00:06:07.919> have<00:06:08.070> the<00:06:08.160> correct<00:06:08.370> beliefs

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
meaning they have the correct beliefs

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.690 
meaning they have the correct beliefs
and<00:06:09.030> everyone<00:06:09.930> else<00:06:10.110> they<00:06:10.320> called<00:06:10.530> heretics<00:06:11.070> a

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
and everyone else they called heretics a

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.659 
and everyone else they called heretics a
Herot<00:06:12.360> heresy<00:06:13.260> is<00:06:13.470> a<00:06:13.530> choke<00:06:13.950> means<00:06:14.310> choice

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:14.669 
Herot heresy is a choke means choice

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:16.490 
Herot heresy is a choke means choice
it's<00:06:15.090> a<00:06:15.270> choice<00:06:15.510> not<00:06:15.840> to<00:06:15.900> believe<00:06:16.169> the<00:06:16.320> right

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
it's a choice not to believe the right

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.409 
it's a choice not to believe the right
things<00:06:16.770> and<00:06:17.070> so<00:06:17.910> proto<00:06:18.840> orthodoxy<00:06:19.740> is<00:06:20.419> what

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
things and so proto orthodoxy is what

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.460 
things and so proto orthodoxy is what
people<00:06:22.260> were<00:06:22.440> saying<00:06:22.910> that<00:06:23.910> led<00:06:24.300> to<00:06:24.600> orthodoxy

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 
people were saying that led to orthodoxy

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.950 
people were saying that led to orthodoxy
before<00:06:26.310> it<00:06:26.400> was<00:06:26.520> orthodoxy<00:06:27.210> so<00:06:27.780> there's

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
before it was orthodoxy so there's

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.060 
before it was orthodoxy so there's
there's<00:06:28.260> what<00:06:28.470> so<00:06:28.620> you<00:06:28.680> have<00:06:28.860> a<00:06:28.890> lot<00:06:29.039> of

there's what so you have a lot of

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.290 
there's what so you have a lot of
different<00:06:29.460> Christian<00:06:29.700> groups<00:06:29.909> saying<00:06:30.090> a<00:06:30.150> lot
