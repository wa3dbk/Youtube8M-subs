00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.300
 we are in four laps 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.910
 not 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.650
 I don't see a truck it's the only thing I don't 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.910
 I look at speed then speed 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.670
 constant 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.670
 I recommend the evil on the steering wheel 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.670
 trajectories 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.970
 remember 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.290
 enlarged when 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.950
 the school 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.950
 you don't slide it 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.020
 and a first can accelerate 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.629
 then more steering 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.580
 the less famous steering wheels are the car 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.170
 then tinner had a understeer than here 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.500
 very external to then close the study 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.500
 who do it 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.930
 as you also look for a lot on the hands on 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.210
 steering wheel 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.070
 never get to the intersection because if 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.170
 no 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.010
 if you have to change 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.620
 a number of how many values 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.280
 10 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.280
 you're not 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.760
 almost a ghetto outside 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.270
 for 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.490
 marchetti 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.240
 general wide area searches 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.240
 external 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.659
 he 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.850
 grows 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.850
 this all go 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.210
 maybe 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.350
 a proper limit 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.840
 then the same thing is the same thing 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.569
 in rallies that unfortunately many times one 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.609
 I don't think about it here 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.860
 it makes me do it because it passes over 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.280
 greens 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.270
 own 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.270
 but bring us more 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.140
 you don't realize 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.940
 like carla 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.110
 these marks 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.310
 here 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.750
 so 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.750
 sinofsky has on trajectories 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:02.030
 but no one you need then still on 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.030
 everyday 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.870
 therefore avoided 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.870
 Share 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.870
 shakes hands 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.870
 but 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.560
 Yes No 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.750
 you're doing this to me 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.669
 surely you must think about it 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.190
 so, however, to think of others too 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.500
 things so often 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.270
 you do know that you can 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.280
 but there is more to the clientele almost 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.280
 instinctive gets you busy 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.100
 put 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.100
 I understood 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.100
 Yup 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.210
 and public 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.670
 of that clear the effects cannot 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.320
 turn out to be clearly yours 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.740
 run along with stucco for a long time 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.740
 time 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.630
 of course 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.990
 really beautiful from here the rome 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.990
 delay machines 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.409
 simple that 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.259
 for sure 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:05.120
 if there is a breakfast I am used to it 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:07.639
 milano 147 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:12.099
 boys 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.099
 yes yes yes see lynn barber with her hands 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.480
 in these first 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.069
 the position of the hands 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.570
 maneuvers 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.639
 it feels good ten buses e 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.199
 badly positioned at the end 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.819
 I want to get a sky you can 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.819
 more to work then 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.500
 the first 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.040
 Sunday 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.840
 the more he lets it expose 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.470
 and more to generate for a car 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.470
 don't put it down 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.200
 now active 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:11.120
 third closed to 

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.120
 the figures then everything 

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:16.520
 impotence to most this thing 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.520
 God 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.760
 but if when there is space you are also 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:44.060
 front because 

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.060
 back 

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.270
 Yup
