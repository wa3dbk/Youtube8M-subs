00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.050 
interesting about that when we're doing
when<00:01:27.080> we<00:01:27.170> do<00:01:27.290> our<00:01:27.320> sort<00:01:27.920> of<00:01:27.950> multiplayer<00:01:28.760> stuff

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
it's very story-driven stove so we

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.380
