00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hello everyone today I decided to show you 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.170
 another hand-made gift 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.320
 and now you see a regular notebook 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.599
 diary rather 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.490
 the stomach is my most common nickname in 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.250
 such a cover, I don't know how it is 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.100
 correctly called further what 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:25.740
 it will take various here such 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.539
 dragon pictures here i have one you 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.410
 you can choose your own no more 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.090
 just like this and here 4 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.219
 a little aggressive but not on me 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.079
 liked also we will like 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.239
 need a carbon copy better of course 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.700
 new black did not find black 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.649
 me a cake of lilac but it's not 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.239
 fundamentally 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.739
 further as usual in childhood we put 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.620
 We put it circled all 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.350
 neat pen and as it turned out 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.170
 as a result, they wear notebooks visible 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.030
 a carbon copy but on this notebook to 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.890
 regret it is almost no fault at all 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.270
 so I have not yet figured out what 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.600
 do with it around us like him 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.189
 decorate here but it does not matter because 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.440
 that I had a second such notebook 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.710
 on it to us on 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.720
 better to see a carbon copy here but to introduce 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.380
 I had to again near the window because 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.980
 that only the glare was circled by me 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.900
 black marker and stand gave all 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.850
 This is a black marker I do not know why I 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.910
 I decided to circle it all in gold 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.930
 a marker and now I'll show you this 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.970
 that's what's called well in general you see 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.760
 This is the golden thing before embossing or 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:39.320
 the marker also shimmers it is also golden 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:43.400
 it is very beautiful in my opinion please 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.160
 forgiveness here and so here on the butt on 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.310
 the spine is a notebook diary I'm 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.580
 I plan to write 2012 is a gift 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.350
 statuette of a man, of course, here I am 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.870
 I think it will be nice to get 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.080
 or not ashamed to use this here 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.080
 idea
