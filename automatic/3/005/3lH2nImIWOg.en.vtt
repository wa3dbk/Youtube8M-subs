the fifa 15 had three informs and a team
of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.770> season<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.129> think<00:00:47.370> Adrian<00:00:48.329> pace<00:00:48.539> 84

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
of the season I think Adrian pace 84

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.900 
of the season I think Adrian pace 84
shooting<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.500> dribbling<00:00:49.950> very<00:00:50.250> fun<00:00:50.489> colleges

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
shooting a dribbling very fun colleges

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.119 
shooting a dribbling very fun colleges
and<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.300> actually<00:00:51.510> predict<00:00:52.260> an<00:00:52.440> upgrade<00:00:52.949> for

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
and I actually predict an upgrade for

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.470 
and I actually predict an upgrade for
him<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.340> think<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.610> well<00:00:53.699> deserved<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.180> do

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
him I think it's well deserved I do

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.420 
him I think it's well deserved I do
actually<00:00:54.690> think<00:00:55.020> he<00:00:55.469> probably<00:00:55.890> could<00:00:56.399> have

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
actually think he probably could have

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.270 
actually think he probably could have
been<00:00:56.640> pushing<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.210> p7<00:00:57.570> anyway<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.590> 15<00:00:59.039> that

you<00:01:50.850> pretty<00:01:51.060> fair<00:01:51.270> had<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:52.170> couple<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.460> informs

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you pretty fair had a couple of informs

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.810 
you pretty fair had a couple of informs
I<00:01:54.149> believe<00:01:54.420> also<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:55.350> team<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> year<00:01:56.520> I

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
I believe also a team of the year I

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.249 
I believe also a team of the year I
don't<00:01:57.030> know<00:01:57.210> about<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.420> one<00:01:57.840> but

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
don't know about that one but

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.010 
don't know about that one but
nonetheless<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.369> think<00:01:59.399> an<00:01:59.700> 83<00:02:00.420> rate<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.810> card

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
nonetheless I think an 83 rate of card

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.080 
nonetheless I think an 83 rate of card
is<00:02:01.170> pretty<00:02:02.070> well<00:02:02.310> deserved<00:02:02.579> silly<00:02:02.790> because<00:02:02.939> I

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
is pretty well deserved silly because I

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.090 
is pretty well deserved silly because I
really<00:02:03.540> feel<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:03.780> EA<00:02:04.229> should<00:02:04.590> bump<00:02:04.829> up

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
really feel like EA should bump up

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.639 
really feel like EA should bump up
defenders<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.570> point<00:02:06.810> where<00:02:06.930> like<00:02:07.140> they

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
defenders to the point where like they

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.910 
defenders to the point where like they
did<00:02:07.799> with<00:02:07.920> Noah<00:02:08.129> senoia<00:02:08.670> was<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.929> 90<00:02:10.709> ray<00:02:10.860> to

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
did with Noah senoia was a 90 ray to

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.229 
did with Noah senoia was a 90 ray to
keep<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.459> think<00:02:11.640> it's<00:02:11.790> brilliantly

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
keep and I think it's brilliantly

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.730 
keep and I think it's brilliantly
recognized<00:02:12.840> how

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
recognized how

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.620 
recognized how
the<00:02:13.800> keeper<00:02:14.130> he<00:02:14.280> was<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.670> relation<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.300> all<00:02:15.450> the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
the keeper he was in relation to all the

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.540 
the keeper he was in relation to all the
other<00:02:15.810> ratings<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.470> game<00:02:16.740> I<00:02:16.950> feel<00:02:17.430> they

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
other ratings in the game I feel they

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.160 
other ratings in the game I feel they
should<00:02:17.580> do<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.940> for<00:02:18.090> defendants<00:02:18.540> cuz<00:02:18.660> alaba

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
should do that for defendants cuz alaba

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.020 
should do that for defendants cuz alaba
being<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:19.980> low<00:02:20.130> rated<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:20.700> some<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
being so low rated and some of the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.760 
being so low rated and some of the
sentiments<00:02:21.360> like<00:02:21.390> boa<00:02:21.630> tang<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:21.960> he<00:02:22.590> went

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
sentiments like boa tang and he went

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.160 
sentiments like boa tang and he went
yellow<00:02:22.920> silver<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.670> Ramos<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.180> do<00:02:24.450> feel<00:02:24.930> like

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
yellow silver and Ramos I do feel like

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.410 
yellow silver and Ramos I do feel like
they<00:02:25.860> should<00:02:25.890> have<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.310> ratings<00:02:26.700> changed<00:02:27.300> and

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
they should have the ratings changed and

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.080 
they should have the ratings changed and
all<00:02:27.690> defenders<00:02:28.440> should<00:02:29.040> be<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.430> just<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.850> number

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
all defenders should be a just a number

all defenders should be a just a number

predict him a 86 rates of card I don't
know<00:02:53.160> why<00:02:53.400> he<00:02:54.300> got<00:02:54.420> downgraded<00:02:54.660> in<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.290> first

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
know why he got downgraded in the first

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.860 
know why he got downgraded in the first
place<00:02:55.710> from<00:02:55.980> an<00:02:56.130> 86<00:02:56.610> oh<00:02:56.730> i<00:02:56.760> really<00:02:57.240> dont<00:02:57.420> that

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
place from an 86 oh i really dont that

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.350 
place from an 86 oh i really dont that
makes<00:02:58.080> me<00:02:58.430> kind<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.520> baffled<00:02:59.580> but<00:03:00.180> nonetheless

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
makes me kind of baffled but nonetheless

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.810 
makes me kind of baffled but nonetheless
I<00:03:00.690> think<00:03:00.720> it's<00:03:01.050> pretty<00:03:01.290> better<00:03:01.650> shooting<00:03:02.490> back

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
I think it's pretty better shooting back

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.350 
I think it's pretty better shooting back
up<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.270> an<00:03:03.540> 86<00:03:04.290> rated<00:03:04.680> card<00:03:04.920> on<00:03:05.700> head-to-head

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
up to an 86 rated card on head-to-head

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.280 
up to an 86 rated card on head-to-head
he<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:07.110> actually<00:03:07.620> still<00:03:07.860> an<00:03:08.180> 85<00:03:09.290> whereas

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
he is actually still an 85 whereas

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.070 
he is actually still an 85 whereas
players<00:03:10.560> like<00:03:10.860> David<00:03:11.220> Luiz<00:03:11.550> had<00:03:11.930> actually<00:03:12.930> got

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
players like David Luiz had actually got

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.360 
players like David Luiz had actually got
their<00:03:13.200> upgrade<00:03:13.530> but<00:03:13.680> we'll<00:03:13.830> have<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.010> see<00:03:14.340> i

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
their upgrade but we'll have to see i

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.150 
their upgrade but we'll have to see i
think<00:03:14.880> it's<00:03:15.030> fairly<00:03:15.300> belly<00:03:16.020> just<00:03:16.320> 5<00:03:16.530> 28<00:03:16.860> games

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
think it's fairly belly just 5 28 games

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.510 
think it's fairly belly just 5 28 games
seven<00:03:17.640> goals<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.240> four<00:03:18.720> assists<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.800> i<00:03:20.310> think

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
seven goals and four assists and i think

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.800 
seven goals and four assists and i think

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
is gonna do really well at x and i

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.510 
is gonna do really well at x and i
really<00:03:22.050> do<00:03:22.140> i<00:03:22.170> think<00:03:22.380> as<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.650> replacement<00:03:23.160> for
