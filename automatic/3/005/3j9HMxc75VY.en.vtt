00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.709 
here and today I'm bringing you guys
another<00:00:11.340> integral<00:00:11.880> building<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.360> found

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
another integral building that I found

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.169 
another integral building that I found
through<00:00:13.320> ok<00:00:13.830> otic<00:00:14.070> revenger<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.759> only<00:00:15.000> his

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
through ok otic revenger and only his

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.269 
through ok otic revenger and only his
channel<00:00:15.630> below<00:00:15.750> but<00:00:16.500> anyways<00:00:16.859> this<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.130> gonna

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
channel below but anyways this is gonna

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.189 
channel below but anyways this is gonna
be<00:00:17.520> Harvey's<00:00:18.029> house<00:00:18.240> from<00:00:18.480> story<00:00:18.840> mode<00:00:19.050> if<00:00:19.170> you

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
be Harvey's house from story mode if you

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.170 
be Harvey's house from story mode if you
remember<00:00:19.560> him<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.949> think<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.939> guy<00:00:21.119> who

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
remember him I think this is the guy who

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.939 
remember him I think this is the guy who
is<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.480> janitor<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.260> go<00:00:22.380> into<00:00:22.500> his<00:00:22.740> house

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
is the janitor and you go into his house

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.470 
is the janitor and you go into his house
you<00:00:23.310> see<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.789> or<00:00:23.970> somebody<00:00:24.269> elseís

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
you see that that or somebody elseís

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.689 
you see that that or somebody elseís
what<00:00:24.630> I'm<00:00:24.720> thinking<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.490> basically<00:00:26.490> all

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
what I'm thinking and basically all

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.130 
what I'm thinking and basically all
you're<00:00:26.849> gonna<00:00:26.970> need<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.150> do<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.810> get<00:00:27.900> into<00:00:28.050> this

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
you're gonna need to do to get into this

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.509 
you're gonna need to do to get into this
house<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.500> gonna<00:00:28.650> follow<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.070> location<00:00:29.369> on

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
house is gonna follow that location on

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.700 
house is gonna follow that location on
the<00:00:29.609> map<00:00:29.640> go<00:00:30.359> up<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.599> stairs<00:00:30.840> here<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.560> go

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the map go up the stairs here and you go

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.200 
the map go up the stairs here and you go
up<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.980> door<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.340> everyone<00:00:32.640> knows<00:00:32.910> this

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
up to the door and everyone knows this

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.790 
up to the door and everyone knows this
this<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.540> gonna<00:00:33.660> be<00:00:33.840> one<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.320> ways<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.500> get

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
this is gonna be one of the ways to get

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.799 
this is gonna be one of the ways to get
into<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> lot<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.280> buildings<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.270> turn<00:00:36.570> on

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
into a lot of buildings is you turn on

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.930 
into a lot of buildings is you turn on
your<00:00:37.440> passive<00:00:37.920> mode<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.309> then<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.520> disable

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
your passive mode and then you disable

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.910 
your passive mode and then you disable
pass<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> mode<00:00:39.450> as<00:00:39.570> soon<00:00:39.780> as<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.079> enabled<00:00:40.469> and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
pass a mode as soon as it's enabled and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.290 
pass a mode as soon as it's enabled and
it's<00:00:41.040> gonna<00:00:41.160> give<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.430> about<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.610> 10<00:00:41.910> second

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
it's gonna give you about a 10 second

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.790 
it's gonna give you about a 10 second
countdown<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:43.140> when<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.379> countdown

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
countdown and when that countdown

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.850 
countdown and when that countdown
reaches<00:00:44.160> zero<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.239> about<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.750> half<00:00:46.710> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
reaches zero you have about a half a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.290 
reaches zero you have about a half a
second<00:00:47.250> until<00:00:47.399> I've<00:00:47.520> walked<00:00:47.789> through<00:00:47.940> walls

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
second until I've walked through walls

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.940 
second until I've walked through walls
and<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.930> could<00:00:49.050> do<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.289> right<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.829> I'll

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
and you could do it right here so I'll

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.260 
and you could do it right here so I'll
just<00:00:50.070> go<00:00:50.219> ahead<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.489> walk<00:00:50.640> through<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:50.910> took

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
just go ahead and walk through it took

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.580 
just go ahead and walk through it took
me<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> couple<00:00:51.449> times<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:51.960> that's<00:00:52.050> why<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.260> cut

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
me a couple times so that's why I cut

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.560 
me a couple times so that's why I cut
there<00:00:52.829> but<00:00:53.430> once<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.699> get<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.239> gonna<00:00:54.360> be

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
there but once you get in it's gonna be

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.970 
there but once you get in it's gonna be
mostly<00:00:54.960> hollow<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.620> graphics<00:00:55.920> to

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
mostly hollow and then the graphics to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.560 
mostly hollow and then the graphics to
be<00:00:56.010> rendered<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.059> discovered<00:00:57.480> is

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
be rendered but what I discovered is

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.029 
be rendered but what I discovered is
that<00:00:57.719> if<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.079> jump<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.710> stumble

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
that if you just jump and you stumble

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.369 
that if you just jump and you stumble
then<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.239> graphics<00:01:00.600> will<00:01:00.719> load<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.230> you

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
then the graphics will load in and you

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.229 
then the graphics will load in and you
are<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.649> Harvey's<00:01:02.100> apartment<00:01:02.250> now<00:01:03.059> in

small apartment none of the doors are

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.240 
small apartment none of the doors are
interval<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:07.350> can't<00:01:07.619> actually<00:01:07.799> shoot<00:01:08.100> out

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
interval you can't actually shoot out

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.160 
interval you can't actually shoot out
the<00:01:08.430> windows<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.270> can<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.900> them
