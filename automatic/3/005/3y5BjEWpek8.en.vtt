00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.800
 it's an everton win 1-0 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.919
 in Europe 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.529
 the rsa will be adapted to the cinema 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.640
 you have become a horse show and one especially for that we can 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.070
 perhaps 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.070
 so past 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:27.279
 the pressure in the order 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.279
 she already had 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.340
 no 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.020
 in vain 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.590
 the role besides it is easy to understand the four horses well 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.380
 resulted 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.690
 four high-level athletes your team is composed the game consists of 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.639
 carry out 

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:52.010
 by team three passes between three different players before they can 

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:53.220
 score a goal 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.460
 then there is a sport of contact it is a sport of speed not to say that it is going 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.460
 cost very very fast they had their moments of action that are 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.450
 pretty warm normally within two years these resignations are so we have a little 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.310
 more on behalf of the weapon capacity it's very hot it's okay 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.210
 very quickly recently two levels of arbitrage a lot of texts and 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.110
 texts to do a lot of good 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.760
 this sport requires a lot of speed and horses and flexibility among 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.320
 especially riders to pick up the balloon by putting five years later at 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.130
 horse level 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.990
 we work a lot during the week in endurance training 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.200
 the best at that choices a good lung capacity for them 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.140
 riders also it takes a lot of strength for a lot of flexibility it gets 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.330
 works these are real worrying about sound and quality for 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.890
 one hundred but we can say that 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.270
 after a new level this is more the speed that plays 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.870
 physical papon 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.340
 compared to teams a little younger it's true that more contact 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.340
 but for me level 1 8% to 6 8% 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.170
 today on the road speed players default technique the novels 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.280
 fantasy 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.330
 the role is not widespread in belgium and only 15 teams 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.399
 essentially around brussels 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.369
 this horse show also an expo and big on the referrals Monday so it's 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.489
 a real boon to the Belgian federation to make 

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:05.119
 know this sport but this price drop if you have both an audience 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.560
 of connoisseurs so an audience has swept an audience 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.890
 more put to flight so that's very interesting why especially show 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.180
 young people do without their pivot try them to show that football 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.470
 is not a sport for 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.150
 produced at the exit indeed for the respect of the horses and it is to try 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.620
 to have several teams several young players that had to be 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.530
 grouped together in the other 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.009
 two teams so how did you get started in this sport 

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:29.549
 he 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.709
 very long I actually started with ps can also in belgium 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.759
 it's been twenty years since I started playing 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:38.579
 pony 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.879
 over time we evolve we think about horses 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.929
 we change equipped and for butter 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:43.849
 we are always there 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.409
 we can get into the race for the title 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.379
 in France learn to four doors to the public the competition 17 years ago in 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.059
 the veil is that there may have been future players 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:57.529
 soccer 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:00.879
 among the respondents MÃ©licie we had a good atmosphere that will pay for 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.729
 people who did not know have left his father who wears the most 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:04.609
 close to the balanced 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.619
 he was recent to stay very very hot 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.619
 atmosphere and for very beautiful land secret defense 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.769
