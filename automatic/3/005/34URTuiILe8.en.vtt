this tank is not balanced not even
slightly<00:05:45.680> and<00:05:46.680> certainly<00:05:47.069> not<00:05:47.250> as<00:05:47.370> long<00:05:47.550> as<00:05:47.789> it

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:47.939 
slightly and certainly not as long as it

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:50.209 
slightly and certainly not as long as it
can<00:05:48.150> use<00:05:48.360> premium<00:05:48.659> ammunition<00:05:49.379> although<00:05:49.590> the

start looking at game balance in the

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:45.800 
start looking at game balance in the
lower<00:06:44.339> tiers<00:06:44.789> Oh<00:06:45.060> Oh

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810 
lower tiers Oh Oh

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.899 
lower tiers Oh Oh
direct<00:06:46.439> hit<00:06:46.560> from<00:06:46.589> arty<00:06:47.009> that<00:06:47.339> still<00:06:47.699> couldn't

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:47.909

kill him and yeah game balance in the

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:56.719 
kill him and yeah game balance in the
lower<00:06:53.849> tiers<00:06:54.180> means<00:06:55.020> machines<00:06:55.469> like<00:06:55.710> this<00:06:56.099> in

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:56.729 
lower tiers means machines like this in

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:59.600 
lower tiers means machines like this in
particular<00:06:57.360> machines<00:06:58.319> like<00:06:58.529> the<00:06:59.039> tier<00:06:59.250> 18

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
particular machines like the tier 18

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.309 
particular machines like the tier 18
tank<00:06:59.939> destroyer<00:07:00.360> for<00:07:00.569> example<00:07:00.990> which<00:07:01.110> can

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 
tank destroyer for example which can

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:03.379 
tank destroyer for example which can
one-shot<00:07:01.560> anything<00:07:02.399> at<00:07:02.580> its<00:07:02.759> own<00:07:02.939> tier<00:07:03.210> and

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:03.389 
one-shot anything at its own tier and

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:06.110 
one-shot anything at its own tier and
below<00:07:03.689> while<00:07:04.439> remaining<00:07:04.770> almost<00:07:05.699> completely

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 
below while remaining almost completely

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.429 
below while remaining almost completely
impervious<00:07:06.599> to<00:07:07.110> attack<00:07:08.009> from<00:07:08.189> the<00:07:08.250> front<00:07:08.339> and

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:09.439 
impervious to attack from the front and

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:11.869 
impervious to attack from the front and
that<00:07:10.439> means<00:07:10.680> that<00:07:10.860> machines<00:07:11.250> lighten<00:07:11.699> this

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:11.879 
that means that machines lighten this

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:15.980 
that means that machines lighten this
and<00:07:12.419> the<00:07:12.810> t-80<00:07:13.110> just<00:07:13.770> as<00:07:13.889> two<00:07:14.099> examples<00:07:14.990> I've

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990 
and the t-80 just as two examples I've

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.719 
and the t-80 just as two examples I've
probably<00:07:16.259> had<00:07:16.620> their<00:07:16.860> day<00:07:17.069> in<00:07:17.219> the<00:07:17.250> Sun<00:07:17.370> and

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:17.729 
probably had their day in the Sun and

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:19.970 
probably had their day in the Sun and
results<00:07:18.479> like<00:07:18.810> that

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:19.980 
results like that

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.000 
results like that
or<00:07:20.610> probably<00:07:21.180> before<00:07:21.450> too<00:07:21.810> long<00:07:22.110> I'm<00:07:22.560> going<00:07:22.830> to

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.010 
or probably before too long I'm going to

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.170 
or probably before too long I'm going to
be<00:07:23.160> a<00:07:23.190> thing<00:07:23.490> of<00:07:23.610> the<00:07:23.700> past

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.180 
be a thing of the past

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.720 
be a thing of the past
I<00:07:24.360> mean<00:07:25.170> seriously<00:07:25.500> look<00:07:26.190> at<00:07:26.280> that<00:07:26.460> they

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:26.730 
I mean seriously look at that they

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.330 
I mean seriously look at that they
almost<00:07:26.910> ran<00:07:27.360> out<00:07:27.420> of<00:07:27.600> space<00:07:28.080> to<00:07:28.140> display<00:07:28.710> all

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.340 
almost ran out of space to display all

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.730 
almost ran out of space to display all
of<00:07:29.400> the<00:07:29.790> medals<00:07:30.210> that<00:07:30.420> he<00:07:30.540> earned<00:07:30.810> in<00:07:31.350> that

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 
of the medals that he earned in that

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.030 
of the medals that he earned in that
match<00:07:32.180> and<00:07:33.180> while<00:07:33.510> my<00:07:33.780> head<00:07:34.080> says<00:07:34.500> yeah

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:37.260 
absolutely right these things really

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.220 
absolutely right these things really
really<00:07:37.620> do<00:07:37.770> need<00:07:38.010> to<00:07:38.190> be<00:07:38.310> nerfed<00:07:38.870> my<00:07:39.870> heart

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:40.230
