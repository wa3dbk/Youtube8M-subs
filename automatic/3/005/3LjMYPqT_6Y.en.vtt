00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.140
 neutral 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.380
 this is very 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:17.840
 objects and many believe that the most 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.640
 interesting that they have it in their bowels 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.680
 sometimes they ask why they are needed at all 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.869
 new countries to study this far 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.820
 objects and there like by 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.220
 economic importance of the main 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.169
 the answer probably is that 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.560
 astronomical objects give us 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.540
 unique chance to explore the substance in 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.940
 extreme conditions that are on earth 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.250
 not available and this is always important because 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.350
 what if we build some big 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.750
 the theory is completely understandable 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.829
 national economic output for example 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.800
 electrodynamics 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.600
 we want to build a theory which 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.420
 would work in all ranges 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.820
 if we want to study there very strong 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.949
 currents are very strong magnetic fields to us 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.840
 need to test the prediction theory and 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.000
 the only object you can do 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.230
 neutron stars want to have good 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.240
 gravity theory 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.610
 for example to satellite on solar 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.890
 the system flew as it should again 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.110
 we need to test this theory altogether 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.570
 gravity look for some kind of extreme 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.150
 the objects will be neutron stars too 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.009
 or black holes and the same thing is right 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.759
 for nuclear physics we want to know how 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.860
 interact with each other 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.259
 some other protons and neutrons 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.689
 particles as they each other turn 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.189
 under what conditions including how does it lead 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.409
 itself substance at very high 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.009
 Earth's highest density 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.979
 density 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.060
 this is the density of the atomic nucleus we all 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.130
 remember that atoms 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.680
 these are quite ephemeral and 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.719
 education because the atom itself is big 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.880
 big due to the fact that you have electrons 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.280
 the whole mass is spinning around the core 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.140
 small toys and so force and 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.509
 yeast to huddle even more in the earth 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.549
 conditions are very difficult because we 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.939
 face a strong nuclear 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.740
 interaction and it is very powerful and 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.369
 interacting with him is very hard 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.590
 fight the only way on earth 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.690
 somehow preload core this overclock 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.210
 for example, two cores on the accelerator and 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.280
 push these cores but you have 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.680
 get hot stuff you have me 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.629
 troll off with a huge n. 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.299
 and and at the time of the collision on stands out 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.819
 it turns out to a cloud of hot plasma and this 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.590
 for some applications it is good but for 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.090
 studying how cold behaves 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.739
 dense substance is bad you its not 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.569
 get and the only place where you can 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.400
 indirectly study the substance at high 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.590
 density then nitro neutron stars 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.540
 estimates show that in the center 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.430
 neutron star density can be 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.159
 ten times more than the atomic nucleus 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.680
 and there can occur all sorts of very 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.730
 interesting transformation well firstly 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.590
 us 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.250
 matter consists of protons and neutrons 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.669
 and protons and neutrons roughly equally 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.889
 but if we start all this compress then y 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:03:00.079
 us getting more neutrons in 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:02.689
 some models in the central parts 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.909
 neutron stars neutrons really 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.739
 nine times more than protons 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.329
 actually therefore it is neutron 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.129
 stars such name 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.919
 all sorts of other tricky things can happen 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.290
 turning can be beneficial poppy for 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:17.000
 will turn the protons and 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.560
 neutrons other particles are 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.979
 accordingly models where there were such 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.560
 Hyper baths and stars and stars where in 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:27.919
 condensation occurs in the central parts and 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.169
 other particles of pions for example there is still 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:33.169
 more exotic models are models 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:35.329
 quark or strange stars we remember 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:38.269
 that the proton and neutron consist of quarks 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:41.180
 of three such small particles and they 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.959
 possess an interesting feature we don't 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.989
 can get 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.009
 separate quark right here and how you rui 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.139
 start studying 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:50.359
 if we try to rip the quark out 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.699
 for example proton or from some other 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:55.340
 particles then we spend so much 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:57.169
 energy that pulling quark is energy 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.060
 enough to give birth to another quark 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:03.530
 will turn out on the particles consisting of two 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:07.669
 steam and if you have a bowels compact 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.769
 stars then because of the big gravity you have 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:12.430
 create such a high density such 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.469
 conditions that quarks become free here 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.269
 areas and substance will consist already 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.130
 is there protons and neutrons of the league 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.470
 the apron is all some kind of particles namely from 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.419
 free quarks such quark and plasma in 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.960
 some sense it's scary interesting 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.639
 if possible and the only place 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.530
 where really it can be enough 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.979
 reliably study this is not the neutron 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.410
 the stars 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.650
 the problem is that of course neutron 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.370
 stars of far away if it is their meter then 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.669
 we need to observe some surface 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.889
 the processes 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.169
 outside the neutron star understand how it is 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.120
 arranged inside but here it arises 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.800
 this typical astronomical problem 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.900
 experiment is impossible only 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.820
 watch and people try like songs and 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.740
 cope 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.599
 for example, you can observe a cooling down 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.419
 neutron stars neutron stars 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.610
 are born hot perature surface 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.470
 let's say a few million degrees if 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.120
 there were already some first minutes 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.220
 days maybe she got a little cold 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.289
 millions of degrees and we see this hot 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.470
 surface we see such neutron 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.389
 the stars we are even now seeing 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.099
 the absolutely unique thing we see as 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.990
 neutron star cools down in a few 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:19.750
 years of observations at one of the neutron 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.430
 fitn stars how the temperature dropped and this 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.199
 gives us information about what is happening 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.860
 inside because the neutron star 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.110
 cools down 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.470
 from the inside strangely enough we usually 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.849
 accustomed to the body cool outside and 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.320
 if there is any hot object 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.090
 outside it is colder than the center 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.490
 neutron stars situation a little bit 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:40.150
 more tricky they care in the center 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.970
 hot but the energy is carried away 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.889
 not photons for example from the surface a 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.289
 netrino are taken straight from the bowels 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:50.320
 neutron star is transparent to netrino 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:53.199
 and therefore the base goes from meter and heat 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.570
 flows inward and from there is emitted in the form 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.400
 netrino therefore observing the temperature 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.080
 surface we get in indirect 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.419
 information about what is happening in the center 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.820
 and indeed quarters and stars should 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.060
 cool not like stars consisting of 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.770
 protons and neutrons and so on 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.300
 working interesting way to find out what 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.520
 is in the depths of the neutron star 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.139
 so imagine that we have 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.380
 neutron star and we start 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.090
 quietly throw me and substance 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.250
 mass and growing and in the end she 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.110
 Skopintsev black hole that 's scary 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.900
 fundamental question because on 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.970
 in fact what we learn we learn mass 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.730
 at which the star collapses the limit 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.720
 mass let us know how long the substance 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.430
 can withstand 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.020
 mockery of herself before that she 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.450
 will tell a lot of collapse 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.060
 black hole you're tired of me we learn 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.310
 at what central density 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.290
 this collapse occurs therefore it is very 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:47.430
 it is important to find more and more heavy 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:49.200
 neutron stars and raise this 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.669
 border zero in the end find it 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.520
 say that here we see neutron 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:55.530
 stars for example with a mass of 2.2 mass 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.960
 of the sun further we see the same black holes with 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.520
 weighing 2 and 5 masses we will mean 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.919
 this limit is very tightly clamped 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.229
 the transition will also tell us a lot 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:06.419
 about how to interact with each other 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:09.180
 particles at high density when 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:11.880
 Finally, the pressure is not enough for 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:16.140
 to keep the star from collapsing 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:19.860
 Well, finally, in the coming years, when 

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:21.750
 advanced installations will work 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.740
 for observing gravitational waves then 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.930
 again 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.090
 observing the fusion of neutron stars we 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:30.000
 can also find out what's going on with them 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:32.039
 subsoil because if we are the core 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.160
 you have to overclock push yourself 

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:37.620
 there we will have a natural experiment 

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.360
 by colliding 2 neutron stars and 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:44.070
 precisely for gravitational wave 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:46.380
 signal we can set some 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:48.979
 degrees of accuracy how does matter have them 

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.979
 arranged inside
