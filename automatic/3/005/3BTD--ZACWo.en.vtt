inside out you'll notice this yellow
material<00:04:50.770> now<00:04:51.150> basically<00:04:52.150> a<00:04:52.660> lot<00:04:53.020> of<00:04:53.080> summer

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
material now basically a lot of summer

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.900 
material now basically a lot of summer
suits<00:04:53.530> these<00:04:53.680> days<00:04:53.890> are<00:04:54.160> including<00:04:54.669> thermal

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
suits these days are including thermal

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.810 
suits these days are including thermal
lining<00:04:55.300> I<00:04:55.830> think<00:04:56.830> it's<00:04:56.950> just<00:04:57.160> become<00:04:57.490> sort<00:04:57.790> of

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
lining I think it's just become sort of

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.630 
lining I think it's just become sort of
expected<00:04:58.510> and<00:04:59.140> that<00:04:59.169> foam<00:04:59.560> lining<00:04:59.950> obviously

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
expected and that foam lining obviously

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.670 
expected and that foam lining obviously
does<00:05:00.820> weigh<00:05:00.970> the<00:05:01.120> suit<00:05:01.300> down<00:05:01.450> a<00:05:01.510> bit<00:05:01.750> but<00:05:02.260> we

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
does weigh the suit down a bit but we

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.990 
does weigh the suit down a bit but we
will<00:05:02.800> allow<00:05:02.979> you<00:05:03.040> to<00:05:03.280> wear<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.580> suit<00:05:03.790> for<00:05:03.940> a

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
will allow you to wear the suit for a

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.640 
will allow you to wear the suit for a
longer<00:05:04.180> parts<00:05:04.540> of<00:05:04.630> the<00:05:04.750> year<00:05:04.960> so<00:05:05.260> not<00:05:05.410> only<00:05:05.530> is

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
longer parts of the year so not only is

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.620 
longer parts of the year so not only is
it<00:05:05.800> a<00:05:05.830> summer<00:05:06.100> suit<00:05:06.370> and<00:05:06.940> you<00:05:07.000> can<00:05:07.150> also<00:05:07.270> wear

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
whole way through it's auntie absorbent

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.710 
whole way through it's auntie absorbent
as<00:05:37.550> well<00:05:37.700> and<00:05:37.850> also<00:05:37.970> quick<00:05:38.300> quite<00:05:38.540> quick

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
as well and also quick quite quick

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.150 
as well and also quick quite quick
drying<00:05:39.020> so<00:05:39.380> it's<00:05:39.560> a<00:05:39.650> good<00:05:39.770> little<00:05:39.890> feature

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
drying so it's a good little feature

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.490 
drying so it's a good little feature
that<00:05:40.400> have<00:05:40.550> all<00:05:40.880> the<00:05:41.030> fire<00:05:41.270> core<00:05:41.600> and<00:05:42.110> that's

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
that have all the fire core and that's

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.980 
that have all the fire core and that's
through<00:05:42.620> the<00:05:42.710> whole<00:05:42.830> front<00:05:43.690> you<00:05:44.690> can<00:05:44.720> see<00:05:44.810> the

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
through the whole front you can see the

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.240 
through the whole front you can see the
tape<00:05:45.200> around<00:05:45.290> the<00:05:45.500> knees<00:05:45.650> just<00:05:45.890> a<00:05:46.010> sort<00:05:46.220> of

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
tape around the knees just a sort of

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.250 
tape around the knees just a sort of
reinforced<00:05:46.970> in<00:05:47.060> that<00:05:47.210> whole<00:05:47.600> front<00:05:47.840> panel<00:05:48.140> and

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
reinforced in that whole front panel and

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.450 
reinforced in that whole front panel and
then<00:05:48.350> the<00:05:48.410> back<00:05:48.530> panel<00:05:48.740> is<00:05:48.950> just<00:05:49.100> the<00:05:49.190> ultra

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
then the back panel is just the ultra

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.790 
then the back panel is just the ultra
light<00:05:49.610> near<00:05:49.790> cream<00:05:50.060> and<00:05:50.270> so<00:05:50.990> again<00:05:51.230> leading

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
light near cream and so again leading

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.740 
light near cream and so again leading
that<00:05:52.010> back<00:05:52.220> unrestricted<00:05:53.120> so<00:05:53.480> you<00:05:53.540> get

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
that back unrestricted so you get

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.820 
that back unrestricted so you get
freedom<00:05:53.990> with<00:05:54.200> movement<00:05:54.530> should

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
freedom with movement should

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.410 
freedom with movement should
particularly<00:05:55.160> Torben<00:05:55.700> foreman<00:05:56.030> in<00:05:56.150> a<00:05:56.210> summer

particularly Torben foreman in a summer
wedding<00:05:56.770> so<00:05:57.770> a<00:05:57.800> good<00:05:58.250> sort<00:05:58.460> of<00:05:58.490> balance

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820
