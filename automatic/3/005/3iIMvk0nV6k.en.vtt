00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 no one knows exactly the time let alone the local antonio ugly leaves the canopy 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.169
 America is a fact before the day 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:11.549
 five and a half tons the size of a book will only land on the 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.509
 the next few hours we will have the probability of it falling here in Brazil 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.140
 scientists hope that the satellite and the Argentinean earthworm scrape from 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.780
 at three in the afternoon 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:28.080
 this must happen to 60 kilometers of height at that moment a satellite of 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.980
 five and a half tons dupar mother in the of a micro-bus will catch fire and 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.060
 according to the nar of the American space agency should be divided into 26 pieces 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.620
 the largest of them with about 150 kilos when hitting the earth 400 kilometers per hour 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.470
 can open a hole one meter and a half in diameter can not tell where 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.410
 these pieces will fall can be in south america in africa in australia 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.260
 in Russia or in Europe only North America would be out of danger of life 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.680
 in old age this simulation made by an American research site diskin ter 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.880
 four and five in the afternoon will pass through the state of são paulo 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.549
 I will post passing over the southwest region near the coast 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.020
 at 16 hours and 14 minutes 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.130
 already inside the window 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.470
 it allied in that there may be screen so you really have a chance to fall 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.000
 in some part that in Brazil yes this is the monitoring center of 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.610
 satellites of the inpe national institute of space researches of são josé dos 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.650
 fields here the researchers who so ohio 24 hours a day in the satellites 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.890
 living in orbit 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.610
 operating normally 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.710
 they emit signals all the time that allow their location, the alex is 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.310
 a dead satellite has no more batteries 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.130
 and the only way to know where he is is through calculations 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.189
 the satellite or the satellite was deactivated in 2005 but remained in 90 now it comes in 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.390
 our direction but what chance of being hit is very remote right. 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.400
 perhaps 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.420
 very good to be inferior 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.830
 the possibility that a thunderbolt falls a person who would be here determined in 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.930
 about 900 kilometers long by a 30 kilometers wide if this 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.400
 created network was within the densely populated tide the risk increases 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.469
 or if you saw me throw the sky because they have today I'm crazy 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:32.079
 only caution the four-time champion and the affiliate to the net globe showing a 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:37.059
 new estimate on this satellite drop it should have fallen today at the end of 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:40.989
 day or at dawn on Saturday and Michelle and I killed what had said that the 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.039
 United States would be out dealing with the coalition minutes more 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.919
 according to this new 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:50.869
 these new calculations the priests can penetrate hit so far nothing comes 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:55.509
 discarding precisely those who will launch in the orbit now only one 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:59.649
 last interesting information is in the last 40 to 50 years she was 

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:03.680
 placed in satellites in orbit and to this day I am a person stayed lightly 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:07.999
 with the fall is that from one of them the price of that person who hears
