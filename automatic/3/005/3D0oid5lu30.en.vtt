00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 let's place what is our syrup 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.080
 of three milks that is very hot 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.660
 hot, hot, and hot 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.580
 let's place what is 50 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.410
 grams of grenetine ok let's move a 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.420
 bit 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.650
 so that that 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.650
 grenetina that we put 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.089
 and we stayed 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.020
 well melted ok it 's important that 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.180
 must 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.370
 to use the syrup of three milks ti 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.370
 in hot ok that is boiling 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.309
 boiling so that the grenetina 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.110
 This melt is not important too 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.890
 what kind of great use to use 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.570
 its jellies 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.840
 not all are good brand gelatins 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.079
 okay 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.500
 especially those that are yellow ok 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.720
 yes when you buy a large 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.390
 tub that is yellow the truth is 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.150
 low quality but when you buy 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.280
 fine ones as in the case of 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.200
 that I heard they are white are 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.829
 very high quality grenetine 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.860
 ok then song retinas that are going to 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:20.460
 favor a lot because they do not go 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.759
 to occupy less Grenetina because it's a 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.640
 large tub that has very high levels 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.220
 of bloom the bloom is the force that 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.740
 has gelatin for fast curd 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:39.689
 then we are talking about you 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:43.860
 has 290 the 62 moments 260 to 290 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.500
 ok bloom for this ones that has it 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.959
 seats are very fast grenetina ok 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.959
 very fast and very good 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.880
 it is not so white 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.460
 and it comes a little bit more yellow 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.070
 but it does not stop being fast like the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.979
 white the white I use it that is 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.409
 only for transparent gelatin 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.610
 to make the transparent thin and 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:18.300
 what is the optimism for 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:23.240
 generate for 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.240
 colored water milk jellies 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.400
 but if there is grenetina that is the purchase 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.400
 a great one is and the truth is very bad 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.340
 affected support greece 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.590
 then it is very bad very bad we are going to 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:51.460
 grab and once it has melted 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.710
 our grenetina since it has melted 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:58.090
 our great destined that what we're going 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:00.540
 to do is add little by little our 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.540
 yogurt 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:12.640
 of strawberries ok little by little 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.640
 me three gelatin things 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.970
 little by little 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.690
 and little by little it's going to get cold 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.690
 our gelatin 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.100
 yogurt 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.050
 if nothing happens 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.410
 here as this technique of throwing little to 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.090
 little bit the other ingredients are called 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.450
 tempera 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.629
 ok it's called tempering if I made it 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.239
 of a sudden all if it curdles fast 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:06.390
 it congeals and I can not do anything but 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.490
 how to temper the retinas the crossing 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.100
 at a temperature a shock of 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:14.520
 temperatures does not curdle until it 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.980
 stop moving I can bring it like this and not 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:20.959
 it's going to set but I'm just leaving it 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.959
 to move and it starts to curdle ok 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:29.620
 ok so they will be what is the 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:32.260
 jelly with fruit ok if you set 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.920
 it is a resistant gelatin that is going to 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.920
 help a lot 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.810
 okay 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:46.770
 let's grab a spatula and be the 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.770
 let's put and there we go to 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:53.240
 place 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.240
 everything is our 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.680
 gelatine ok 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.880
 and we are going to take it to freeze
