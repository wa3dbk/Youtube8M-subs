00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.070
 the wood stove optimizes the reaction 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.440
 chemical known as fire because the 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.299
 multiply by 2 burning with so much 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.890
 efficiency that minimizes the amount of 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.520
 polluting gases that come out of the 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.220
 chimney 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.650
 the fire needs fuel as per 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.350
 example the firewood also needs oxygen 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.850
 to fuel the chemical reaction the 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.950
 air enters from the front and 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.750
 back to provide oxygen to the 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.730
 fire the combustion zones are 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.650
 strategically placed to create 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.090
 two combustion zones one above 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.820
 the logs in the combustion chamber 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.950
 main and the second just above 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.440
 It is also designed to optimize the 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.120
 convection and radiation because it deals 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.980
 heat safely while 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.890
 eliminates smoke and leftover gases 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.380
 By the chimney 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.090
 has two main vents per 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.520
 which enters the oxygen necessary to 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.870
 feed the fire this vent 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.750
 has a handle to control the 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.120
 amount of air that enters the stove 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.690
 the other main vent makes 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.430
 the oxygen enters from the back 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.100
 It looks like a normal wood stove and 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.290
 current but this can create a 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.270
 double combustion the vent 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.010
 secondary directs oxygen to a 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.930
 second combustion zone within the 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.150
 same chamber to burn more gases 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.640
 harmful this type of stove is so 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.750
 effective because it has not one but two 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.030
 combustion zones 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.570
 how is it possible if you only have one camera 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.570
 of combustion 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.580
 the important thing is where the air enters 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.530
 and where the oxygen that feeds 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.660
 the first combustion zone enters through 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.460
 the side vents are heated to 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.380
 as it rises and enters the 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.540
 combustion chamber just above 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.070
 the window of the door the air that 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.230
 it enters is colder and denser than the air 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.260
 hot on the camera so 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.970
 immediately falls to the base of the fire 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.460
 that movement of air is convection 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.930
 thermal in full operation also 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.490
 prevents smoke from falling on the window 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.010
 and on Negrete wood stoves 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.690
 conventional ones throw about 30 grams per 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.880
 time of waste not burned by the 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.070
 fireplace this stove with two zones of 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.490
 combustion produces less than 75 grams 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.180
 per hour ie contaminates a 75 by 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.180
 one hundred less 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.390
 the gases that resist double 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.520
 combustion come out through the chimney but 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.130
 like this tube so long and smooth it gets 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.870
 absorb the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.750
 again we talk about convection 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.030
 thermal the heat goes up and as the gases 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.950
 hot ones are less dense and lighter 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.380
 that outside air rise through the 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.030
 chimney the movement of the air creates a 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.590
 current that pushes smoke and gases 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.600
 towards the chimney once the gases 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.780
 hot climbs up the chimney it creates 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.800
 a vacuum and fresh air comes back in 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.600
 that is what creates the current 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.860
 necessary for the proper functioning of 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.860
 this miracle of engineering
