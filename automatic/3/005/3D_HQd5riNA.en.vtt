00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.759
 how do you actually do it right? 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.970
 good shredded for that we need 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.050
 The ingredients are blinded to the gentleman 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.210
 and we all prepare it 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.599
 that is, the first place was the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.580
 onions then dice on the finest possible 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.820
 was cut then also the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.710
 mushrooms on fine slices and all 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.939
 to give these prepared ingredients 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.800
 individually bowl in the small 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.449
 meat of the tüv I only leave I have here 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.820
 pork fillet there is also the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.790
 link with that in the online 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.739
 video how to take that apart 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.950
 then I like to take only the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.450
 fingertips the rest 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.500
 pork fillet is nice on less 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.579
 guys are cutting off the fingertips 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.020
 you can not do it 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.620
 and you can also relax a bit 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.809
 cause it to be prone behind 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.140
 lace anyway no more with that and that 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.640
 Let's cut it as fine as possible 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.649
 nor I pack again in an extra 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.120
 bowl and the preparation are 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.399
 important because the shredded same 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.899
 you need an incredibly fast one 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.110
 a little oil in a pan just that much 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.420
 as the flag just needs it 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.180
 means we do that and tilt 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.680
 then the excess oil and what 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.390
 staying in the pan that's what we are 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.909
 also effective for frying need 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.680
 at least when sliced ​​the whole 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.430
 is sorted that is actually it 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.570
 is fried jumping 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.770
 actually it is said that it is so hot 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.720
 it should be that meat already on 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.290
 a hopping has never happened to me 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.180
 but we limit that soon 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.040
 because it's only very short 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.520
 is fried and the flag must 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.840
 to be really well heated 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.579
 This is best done when you notice 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.829
 properly heat the flag properly 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.689
 radiates and then the meat 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.159
 nicely do not spread too much meat 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.790
 once in a pan so two 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.909
 portions of meat so as 300 to 350 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.000
 gram should be the maximum and it 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.680
 is seared now very short 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.579
 swung through I'm doing this with 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.750
 Of course, you can do it with the spatula 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.750
 also schwenkers can 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.530
 and the need meat and may also 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.790
 still not very clear if you 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.030
 get the pan right away 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:16.110
 We allow that to the data of the sauce 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.590
 Swing end is now equal to yes 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.330
 Yes, yes, now for the first time is important 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.030
 also that one distributes it that me 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.650
 can not collect liquid because 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.570
 it's cold on the bottom of the board 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.430
 meat in the country collects the 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.920
 liquid that would then start to 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.660
 cooking and that's exactly what it's allowed to do 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.180
 I will not give it to the onion and 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.440
 also the chance to do so 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.790
 and then you can do it again 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.550
 make some oil with it again 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.990
 onions and mushrooms pretty much 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.930
 absorb oil 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:54.090
 and the whole thing should roast nice and 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.680
 You can not dry so dry now 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.200
 For example, I already season quite well 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.460
 Actually I always like to do that 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.470
 so that the mushrooms and the onions 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.000
 really nice water because that is 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.459
 In addition to the raw materials now in the pan 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.470
 are our basis for the sauce is 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.080
 that I'm going off with brandy all over here 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.810
 and the flambé and I wanted you 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.800
 at least not show there are 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.489
 that's the flames now 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.290
 come up high 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.410
 Now that's what happens 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.550
 the hairs are scorching this fast 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.959
 Alcohol before is not quite so 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.610
 dangerous but you should know 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.910
 What he does there, he flambles the same 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.070
 again an extra video the whole 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.320
 let it boil down nicely 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.730
 especially if you work with wine so 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.459
 as little liquid as possible in the 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.600
 case is then the cream comes and 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.230
 we'll leave that for so long now 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.840
 cook until we get the desired consistency 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.910
 the sauce have it covers by itself 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.500
 put out the pan that the 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.870
 no more boiling liquid 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.640
 then add the meat and stir 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.160
 the residual heat becomes through and through 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.360
 The meat even with poultry I would 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.720
 Definitely a lid on it 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.760
 lay 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.920
 that definitely has to be through 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.140
 because of the salmonella danger and around 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.530
 Do something and that's good 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.530
 appetite wishes
