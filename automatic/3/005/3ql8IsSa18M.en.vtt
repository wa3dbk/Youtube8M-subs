00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.090 

hi<00:00:07.540> there<00:00:07.780> in<00:00:08.140> this<00:00:08.200> video<00:00:08.590> I'd<00:00:08.710> like<00:00:08.950> to

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.100 
hi there in this video I'd like to

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.190 
hi there in this video I'd like to
introduce<00:00:09.340> the<00:00:09.760> notion<00:00:09.970> of<00:00:10.180> intervals<00:00:10.930> and

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 
introduce the notion of intervals and

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.799 
introduce the notion of intervals and
why<00:00:12.100> we<00:00:12.280> should<00:00:12.309> be<00:00:12.490> concerned<00:00:12.580> with<00:00:13.120> them<00:00:13.270> how

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
why we should be concerned with them how

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.770 
why we should be concerned with them how
they<00:00:13.990> apply<00:00:14.320> and<00:00:14.379> music<00:00:14.830> and<00:00:15.450> how<00:00:16.450> we'll<00:00:16.600> go

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780 
they apply and music and how we'll go

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.500 
they apply and music and how we'll go
about<00:00:16.950> attacking<00:00:17.970> intervals<00:00:18.970> from<00:00:19.420> a

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
about attacking intervals from a

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.650 
about attacking intervals from a
learning<00:00:19.810> standpoint<00:00:20.730> okay<00:00:21.730> so<00:00:21.790> in<00:00:22.270> any<00:00:22.390> man's

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
learning standpoint okay so in any man's

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.350 
learning standpoint okay so in any man's
language<00:00:22.930> an<00:00:23.380> interval<00:00:24.310> is<00:00:24.430> simply<00:00:24.850> a<00:00:25.030> measure

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
language an interval is simply a measure

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.190 
language an interval is simply a measure
of<00:00:25.450> distance<00:00:25.720> between<00:00:26.080> any<00:00:26.590> two<00:00:26.950> points<00:00:27.270> so<00:00:28.270> to

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
of distance between any two points so to

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.840 
of distance between any two points so to
extend<00:00:29.590> that<00:00:29.650> I<00:00:29.740> adhere<00:00:30.010> to<00:00:30.220> music<00:00:30.610> theory

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 
extend that I adhere to music theory

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.090 
extend that I adhere to music theory
it's<00:00:31.450> just<00:00:31.750> simply<00:00:32.079> the<00:00:32.500> difference<00:00:32.770> between

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
it's just simply the difference between

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.750 
it's just simply the difference between
any<00:00:33.430> two<00:00:33.730> notes<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:35.410> then<00:00:35.620> for<00:00:36.010> example<00:00:36.519> if<00:00:36.640> I

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
any two notes so then for example if I

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.639 
any two notes so then for example if I
take<00:00:37.059> this<00:00:37.210> top<00:00:37.510> each<00:00:37.690> string<00:00:37.989> and<00:00:38.140> I<00:00:38.199> play<00:00:38.469> the

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
take this top each string and I play the

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.270 
take this top each string and I play the
G<00:00:38.859> and<00:00:39.179> then<00:00:40.179> let's<00:00:40.359> say<00:00:40.570> I<00:00:40.600> play<00:00:40.899> the<00:00:41.050> B<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
G and then let's say I play the B the

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.000 
G and then let's say I play the B the
distance<00:00:42.460> between<00:00:42.820> those<00:00:43.179> two<00:00:43.510> notes<00:00:43.769> is<00:00:44.769> an

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
distance between those two notes is an

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.130 
distance between those two notes is an
interval<00:00:45.449> similarly<00:00:46.449> the<00:00:46.600> distance<00:00:46.749> from

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
interval similarly the distance from

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.689 
interval similarly the distance from
clean<00:00:47.710> to<00:00:48.550> G<00:00:48.819> is<00:00:49.329> another<00:00:49.749> orbit<00:00:50.739> in<00:00:50.980> inversion

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
clean to G is another orbit in inversion

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.619 
clean to G is another orbit in inversion
which<00:00:52.210> I'll<00:00:52.420> discuss<00:00:52.749> also<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:54.629> basically

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
which I'll discuss also so basically

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.579 
which I'll discuss also so basically
chords<00:00:56.409> scales<00:00:56.739> arpeggios<00:00:58.319> to<00:00:59.319> note

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589

progressions<00:01:00.550> all<00:01:01.179> sorts<00:01:01.569> of<00:01:01.629> things<00:01:01.870> can<00:01:02.350> be

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:02.499 
progressions all sorts of things can be

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:04.380 
progressions all sorts of things can be
broken<00:01:02.620> down<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.159> intervals<00:01:03.550> they<00:01:04.059> are<00:01:04.210> the

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
broken down the intervals they are the

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.770 
broken down the intervals they are the
finest<00:01:05.140> level<00:01:05.409> of<00:01:05.500> granularity<00:01:05.680> that<00:01:06.220> we<00:01:06.460> have

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
finest level of granularity that we have

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.350 
finest level of granularity that we have
about<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.990> guitar<00:01:08.140> neck<00:01:08.909> when<00:01:09.909> we<00:01:10.030> learnt<00:01:10.240> the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
about the guitar neck when we learnt the

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.560 
about the guitar neck when we learnt the
chromatic<00:01:10.780> scale<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:12.520> was<00:01:12.729> another<00:01:13.180> way<00:01:13.390> of

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
chromatic scale that was another way of

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.149 
chromatic scale that was another way of
looking<00:01:13.930> at<00:01:14.079> intervals<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:15.520> terms<00:01:16.000> of<00:01:16.299> names

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
looking at intervals in terms of names

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.679 
looking at intervals in terms of names
moments<00:01:18.159> when<00:01:18.520> we<00:01:18.640> put<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:18.939> two<00:01:19.119> together<00:01:19.270> we

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
moments when we put the two together we

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.350 
moments when we put the two together we
have<00:01:19.930> complete<00:01:20.350> master's<00:01:20.860> mastery<00:01:21.549> of<00:01:21.640> the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
have complete master's mastery of the

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.870 
have complete master's mastery of the
fretboard<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.229> we<00:01:23.380> can<00:01:23.560> create<00:01:23.799> music<00:01:24.310> we<00:01:24.729> can

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
fretboard and we can create music we can

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.700 
fretboard and we can create music we can
create<00:01:25.090> tensions<00:01:25.719> we<00:01:25.869> can<00:01:26.020> resolve<00:01:26.350> tensions

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
create tensions we can resolve tensions

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.850 
create tensions we can resolve tensions
we<00:01:27.430> can<00:01:27.640> create<00:01:27.850> movements<00:01:28.659> we<00:01:28.780> can<00:01:28.990> we<00:01:29.619> can

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
we can create movements we can we can

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.149 
we can create movements we can we can
modulate<00:01:30.520> we<00:01:31.240> can<00:01:31.450> do<00:01:32.200> all<00:01:32.380> sorts<00:01:32.799> of<00:01:32.859> things

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
modulate we can do all sorts of things

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.279 
modulate we can do all sorts of things
and<00:01:33.340> we<00:01:33.399> can<00:01:33.909> understand<00:01:34.570> how<00:01:34.869> we're<00:01:35.049> getting

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
and we can understand how we're getting

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.139 
and we can understand how we're getting
from<00:01:35.500> one<00:01:35.680> any<00:01:36.070> given<00:01:36.520> point<00:01:36.729> to<00:01:36.969> another

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
from one any given point to another

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.260 
from one any given point to another
given<00:01:37.539> point<00:01:37.810> just<00:01:38.439> by<00:01:38.590> considering<00:01:39.270> in

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
given point just by considering in

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.260 
given point just by considering in
Divali<00:01:40.630> theory<00:01:41.250> okay<00:01:42.250> so<00:01:42.310> it<00:01:42.759> follows<00:01:43.090> that

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
Divali theory okay so it follows that

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.749 
Divali theory okay so it follows that
intervals<00:01:43.869> can<00:01:44.259> be<00:01:44.469> either<00:01:44.829> melodic<00:01:45.490> played

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
intervals can be either melodic played

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.730 
intervals can be either melodic played
sequentially<00:01:46.390> as<00:01:46.570> was<00:01:47.049> the<00:01:47.200> example<00:01:47.530> I<00:01:47.710> just

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
sequentially as was the example I just

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.160 
sequentially as was the example I just
showed<00:01:48.130> before<00:01:48.250> or<00:01:48.909> harmonically<00:01:49.600> such<00:01:50.020> as

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
showed before or harmonically such as

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.580 
showed before or harmonically such as
chords<00:01:50.590> so<00:01:51.399> to<00:01:52.359> elaborate<00:01:52.780> on<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:53.079> idea<00:01:53.469> of

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
chords so to elaborate on the idea of

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.499 
chords so to elaborate on the idea of
chords<00:01:53.979> let's<00:01:54.100> just<00:01:54.399> break<00:01:54.789> it<00:01:54.820> down<00:01:54.969> to<00:01:55.149> its

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
chords let's just break it down to its

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.490 
chords let's just break it down to its
simplest<00:01:56.170> idea<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:56.740> take<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:56.950> C<00:01:57.640> major<00:01:58.200> triad

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
simplest idea and take a C major triad

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.590 
simplest idea and take a C major triad
and<00:01:59.649> I'll<00:02:00.100> just<00:02:00.280> take<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.729> fourth<00:02:01.329> string

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
and I'll just take the fourth string

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.810 
and I'll just take the fourth string
sorry<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.409> third<00:02:02.590> string<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.159> I'll<00:02:03.549> play<00:02:03.759> to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
sorry the third string and I'll play to

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.039 
sorry the third string and I'll play to
see<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.179> few

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
see the few

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.800 
see the few
the<00:02:05.799> a<00:02:05.829> of<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.310> fifth<00:02:06.579> on<00:02:06.790> this<00:02:06.970> second<00:02:07.540> string

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
the a of the fifth on this second string

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.770 
the a of the fifth on this second string
and<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.319> g<00:02:08.349> on<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.709> top<00:02:09.009> string<00:02:09.420> okay<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:10.479> I'm

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
and the g on the top string okay so I'm

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.440 
and the g on the top string okay so I'm
playing<00:02:11.020> a<00:02:11.140> C<00:02:11.380> major<00:02:11.620> triad<00:02:11.950> now<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.000> distance

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
playing a C major triad now the distance

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
notes are present the more intervals we

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.660 
notes are present the more intervals we
are<00:02:23.260> playing<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.800> there's<00:02:24.250> so<00:02:24.519> much

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
are playing and there's so much

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.720 
are playing and there's so much
information<00:02:25.599> and<00:02:26.349> detail<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:27.040> explains

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
information and detail that explains

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.670 
information and detail that explains
just<00:02:27.910> what<00:02:28.269> it<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.450> we're<00:02:28.690> doing<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.230> that's

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
just what it is we're doing and that's

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.130 
just what it is we're doing and that's
why<00:02:29.860> they're<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:30.069> important<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.810> theory

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
why they're so important and the theory

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.140 
why they're so important and the theory
can<00:02:32.560> seem<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:32.980> little<00:02:33.099> bit<00:02:33.340> daunting<00:02:33.670> but<00:02:34.090> it's

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
can seem a little bit daunting but it's

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.759 
can seem a little bit daunting but it's
really<00:02:34.450> not<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.750> hard<00:02:34.900> once<00:02:35.440> we<00:02:35.560> get<00:02:35.650> the

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
really not that hard once we get the

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.920 
really not that hard once we get the
basic<00:02:36.099> rules<00:02:36.340> down<00:02:36.610> pat<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.120> it's<00:02:37.540> definitely

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
basic rules down pat and it's definitely

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.600 
basic rules down pat and it's definitely
worth<00:02:38.140> pursuing<00:02:38.590> because<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.220> will<00:02:39.310> give<00:02:39.489> you

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
worth pursuing because it will give you

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.520 
worth pursuing because it will give you
so<00:02:39.819> much<00:02:39.940> control<00:02:40.390> over<00:02:40.420> what<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:41.049> do<00:02:41.230> when

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
so much control over what you do when

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.289 
so much control over what you do when
you<00:02:41.620> create<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:41.950> piece<00:02:42.160> of<00:02:42.220> music<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.880> that's

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
you create a piece of music and that's

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.120 
you create a piece of music and that's
ultimately<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:44.350> goal<00:02:44.500> that<00:02:44.680> we<00:02:44.830> would<00:02:44.950> like

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
ultimately the goal that we would like

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.830 
ultimately the goal that we would like
to<00:02:45.160> teach<00:02:45.519> here<00:02:45.819> at<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.030> Augmented<00:02:46.480> seventh

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
to teach here at the Augmented seventh

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.490 
to teach here at the Augmented seventh
calm<00:02:48.090> okay<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:49.150> we've<00:02:49.510> introduced<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.110> idea

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
calm okay so we've introduced the idea

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.289 
calm okay so we've introduced the idea
of<00:02:50.530> an<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.980> an<00:02:51.100> interval<00:02:51.430> what<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:51.819> means<00:02:52.030> in

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
of an of an interval what it means in

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.710 
of an of an interval what it means in
practice<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.489> we<00:02:54.489> need<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:55.030> meet<00:02:55.390> now<00:02:55.660> to

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
practice and we need to meet now to

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.140 
practice and we need to meet now to
consider<00:02:56.110> how<00:02:56.530> they<00:02:56.739> named<00:02:57.010> now<00:02:57.819> you'll

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
consider how they named now you'll

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.910 
consider how they named now you'll
recall<00:02:58.510> from<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.110> chromatic<00:02:59.500> scale<00:02:59.530> of

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
recall from the chromatic scale of

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.620 
recall from the chromatic scale of
twelve<00:03:00.130> notes<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:00.549> western<00:03:01.060> music

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
twelve notes in western music

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.559 
twelve notes in western music
there<00:03:01.989> are<00:03:02.140> seven<00:03:02.470> natural<00:03:02.980> notes<00:03:03.569> it's

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
there are seven natural notes it's

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.089 
there are seven natural notes it's
because<00:03:05.019> of<00:03:05.140> this<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.650> idea<00:03:05.980> is

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
because of this that the idea is

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.800 
because of this that the idea is
extended<00:03:06.640> so<00:03:06.790> that<00:03:06.819> there<00:03:07.090> are<00:03:07.180> seven<00:03:07.510> types

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
extended so that there are seven types

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.680 
extended so that there are seven types
of<00:03:08.019> intervals<00:03:08.380> within<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:08.769> given<00:03:08.950> octave<00:03:09.690> now

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
of intervals within a given octave now

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.220 
of intervals within a given octave now
recall<00:03:11.140> that<00:03:11.890> there<00:03:12.459> are<00:03:12.519> twelve<00:03:12.910> different

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
recall that there are twelve different

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.110 
recall that there are twelve different
notes<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.530> we're<00:03:15.040> only<00:03:15.160> considering<00:03:15.640> seven

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
notes and we're only considering seven

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.720 
notes and we're only considering seven
to<00:03:16.209> begin<00:03:16.540> with<00:03:16.720> that<00:03:17.350> means<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.980> these

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
to begin with that means that these

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.660 
to begin with that means that these
intervals<00:03:19.120> will<00:03:19.390> have<00:03:19.510> different<00:03:19.750> types<00:03:20.109> of

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
intervals will have different types of

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.640 
intervals will have different types of
qualities<00:03:21.720> whether<00:03:22.720> they<00:03:22.900> be<00:03:22.959> sharpened<00:03:23.530> or

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
qualities whether they be sharpened or

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.819 
qualities whether they be sharpened or
flattened<00:03:24.040> or<00:03:24.160> altered<00:03:24.579> in<00:03:24.640> some<00:03:24.970> way<00:03:25.049> so<00:03:26.049> when

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
flattened or altered in some way so when

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.349 
flattened or altered in some way so when
we<00:03:26.950> look<00:03:27.130> at<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.250> twelve<00:03:27.640> know<00:03:27.820> top<00:03:28.030> tip<00:03:28.209> of

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
we look at a twelve know top tip of

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.080 
we look at a twelve know top tip of
western<00:03:29.049> music<00:03:29.170> we're<00:03:29.709> talking<00:03:30.160> about<00:03:30.430> seven

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
western music we're talking about seven

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.150 
western music we're talking about seven
different<00:03:31.150> types<00:03:31.600> and<00:03:31.840> various<00:03:32.650> qualities<00:03:33.130> of

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
different types and various qualities of

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.750 
different types and various qualities of
each<00:03:33.459> type<00:03:34.109> now<00:03:35.109> the<00:03:35.829> qualities<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.400> which<00:03:36.579> we

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
each type now the qualities to which we

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.330 
each type now the qualities to which we
will<00:03:36.940> encounter<00:03:37.269> a<00:03:37.900> minor<00:03:38.230> taught<00:03:38.769> us<00:03:39.010> are<00:03:39.310> a

certain rules and regulations on how

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.789 
certain rules and regulations on how
these<00:03:47.620> names<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.670> qualities<00:03:49.180> appear<00:03:49.650> when<00:03:50.650> we

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
these names of qualities appear when we

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.580 
these names of qualities appear when we
move<00:03:51.040> from<00:03:51.340> one<00:03:51.670> note<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.540> another<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:53.290> so<00:03:53.440> on

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
move from one note to another and so on

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.050 
move from one note to another and so on
and<00:03:53.739> so<00:03:53.920> forth<00:03:55.380> now<00:03:56.489> because<00:03:57.489> of<00:03:57.609> the<00:03:57.670> tuning

and so forth now because of the tuning

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.759 
and so forth now because of the tuning
of<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.180> guitar<00:03:58.569> it<00:03:58.810> can<00:03:59.049> be<00:03:59.200> a<00:03:59.230> little<00:03:59.560> bit

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
of the guitar it can be a little bit

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.670 
of the guitar it can be a little bit
problematic<00:03:59.950> it's<00:04:00.519> not<00:04:00.700> it's<00:04:01.060> not<00:04:01.350> so<00:04:02.350> much<00:04:02.560> of

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
problematic it's not it's not so much of

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.770 
problematic it's not it's not so much of
a<00:04:02.769> problem<00:04:03.010> that<00:04:03.100> we<00:04:03.220> that<00:04:04.120> we<00:04:04.269> ignore<00:04:04.510> it

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
a problem that we that we ignore it

a problem that we that we ignore it
altogether<00:04:04.930> but<00:04:05.470> because<00:04:05.739> of<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:05.889> chain

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130

particularly in this region of the neck
you<00:04:09.280> know<00:04:09.430> if<00:04:09.519> we're<00:04:09.670> playing<00:04:09.880> a<00:04:10.060> larger<00:04:10.420> type

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
you know if we're playing a larger type

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.170 
you know if we're playing a larger type
intervals<00:04:11.109> such<00:04:11.380> as<00:04:11.590> this<00:04:12.250> G<00:04:12.609> on<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:12.940> fifth

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
intervals such as this G on the fifth

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.620 
intervals such as this G on the fifth
fret<00:04:13.359> of

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
fret of

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.920 
fret of
the<00:04:13.720> stream<00:04:14.560> and<00:04:14.830> this<00:04:15.460> gee<00:04:15.670> that's<00:04:15.910> not<00:04:16.150> food

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.090 

and<00:04:19.930> it<00:04:20.320> can<00:04:20.470> be<00:04:20.560> a<00:04:20.590> little<00:04:20.709> bit<00:04:20.860> problematic

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
and it can be a little bit problematic

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.430 
and it can be a little bit problematic
to<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:24.160> visualize<00:04:24.910> intervals<00:04:25.390> so<00:04:25.870> it's<00:04:26.230> worth

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
to to visualize intervals so it's worth

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.710 
to to visualize intervals so it's worth
it's<00:04:26.770> worth<00:04:26.860> taking<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.460> time<00:04:27.790> to<00:04:28.150> learn

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
it's worth taking the time to learn

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.190 
it's worth taking the time to learn
intervals<00:04:29.470> visually<00:04:30.010> and<00:04:30.600> definitely<00:04:31.600> orally

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
intervals visually and definitely orally

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.440 
intervals visually and definitely orally
so<00:04:32.230> by<00:04:33.160> yury<00:04:33.430> you<00:04:33.850> should<00:04:34.060> be<00:04:34.180> able<00:04:34.390> to

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
so by yury you should be able to

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.510 
so by yury you should be able to
determine<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:35.200> type<00:04:35.980> and<00:04:36.190> quality<00:04:36.340> of

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
determine the type and quality of

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.240 
determine the type and quality of
interval<00:04:36.970> by<00:04:37.690> hearing<00:04:38.170> it<00:04:38.320> and<00:04:38.440> then<00:04:38.950> create

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
interval by hearing it and then create

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.370 
interval by hearing it and then create
even<00:04:39.820> what<00:04:40.060> you<00:04:40.180> hear<00:04:40.420> in<00:04:40.510> your<00:04:40.630> mind's<00:04:40.990> ear<00:04:41.110> so

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
even what you hear in your mind's ear so

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
even what you hear in your mind's ear so
to<00:04:41.440> speak<00:04:41.770> okay<00:04:42.600> so<00:04:43.650> in<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:44.920> event<00:04:45.160> that<00:04:45.220> we

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
to speak okay so in the event that we

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.000 
to speak okay so in the event that we
don't<00:04:45.610> want<00:04:45.760> to<00:04:45.820> have<00:04:46.000> for<00:04:46.870> example<00:04:46.990> I<00:04:47.590> can<00:04:47.920> be

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
don't want to have for example I can be

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.370 
don't want to have for example I can be
playing<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.460> top<00:04:48.700> opening<00:04:49.210> and<00:04:49.480> then<00:04:50.140> I<00:04:50.230> can

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
playing the top opening and then I can

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.370 
playing the top opening and then I can
play<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:50.740> ear<00:04:50.860> at<00:04:51.790> the<00:04:51.820> 12th<00:04:52.240> fret<00:04:52.480> an<00:04:53.080> octave

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
play the ear at the 12th fret an octave

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.860 
play the ear at the 12th fret an octave
above<00:04:53.530> I've<00:04:53.950> just<00:04:54.340> played<00:04:54.610> in<00:04:54.790> a<00:04:55.000> perfect

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
above I've just played in a perfect

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.990 
above I've just played in a perfect
eighth<00:04:56.050> interval<00:04:56.830> which<00:04:57.370> is<00:04:57.550> simply<00:04:57.880> an

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
eighth interval which is simply an

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.020 
eighth interval which is simply an
octave<00:04:58.650> and<00:04:59.650> because<00:04:59.950> there's<00:05:00.100> 24<00:05:00.580> notes<00:05:00.820> in

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
octave and because there's 24 notes in

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.450 
octave and because there's 24 notes in
two<00:05:01.210> octaves<00:05:01.360> we'll<00:05:02.200> will<00:05:02.830> extend<00:05:03.310> the

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
two octaves we'll will extend the

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.080 
two octaves we'll will extend the
analysis<00:05:04.000> to<00:05:04.150> include<00:05:04.540> 15<00:05:04.930> types<00:05:05.440> of

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
analysis to include 15 types of

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.910 
analysis to include 15 types of
intervals<00:05:07.090> as<00:05:07.840> well<00:05:08.110> as<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.350> various<00:05:08.650> types

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
intervals as well as the various types

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.180 
intervals as well as the various types
of<00:05:09.070> qualities<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:10.530> in<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.710> event<00:05:11.980> that<00:05:12.040> we

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
of qualities and in the event that we

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.670 
of qualities and in the event that we
don't<00:05:12.400> necessarily<00:05:13.090> want<00:05:13.330> to<00:05:13.420> have<00:05:14.380> large

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
don't necessarily want to have large

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.610 
don't necessarily want to have large
position<00:05:15.310> shifts<00:05:15.730> or<00:05:15.970> for<00:05:16.720> that<00:05:16.810> many<00:05:17.050> huge

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
position shifts or for that many huge

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.640 
position shifts or for that many huge
stretches<00:05:18.480> we<00:05:19.480> will<00:05:19.690> look<00:05:20.170> at<00:05:20.290> intervals

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
stretches we will look at intervals

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.520 
stretches we will look at intervals
across<00:05:20.770> adjacent<00:05:21.490> screens<00:05:22.020> such<00:05:23.020> as<00:05:23.290> the

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
across adjacent screens such as the

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.290 
across adjacent screens such as the
example<00:05:24.040> that<00:05:24.160> I<00:05:24.250> just<00:05:24.280> came<00:05:24.610> up<00:05:24.670> with<00:05:24.820> the

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
example that I just came up with the

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.050 
example that I just came up with the
Fugees<00:05:26.070> so<00:05:27.070> because<00:05:27.460> of<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:27.640> tuning<00:05:27.940> of<00:05:28.000> the

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
Fugees so because of the tuning of the

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.460 
Fugees so because of the tuning of the
guitar<00:05:28.390> we<00:05:28.510> have<00:05:28.630> to<00:05:28.750> pay<00:05:28.900> a<00:05:28.930> little<00:05:29.110> bit<00:05:29.260> of

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
guitar we have to pay a little bit of

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.950 
guitar we have to pay a little bit of
care<00:05:29.740> and<00:05:30.010> attention<00:05:30.130> with<00:05:31.060> largest<00:05:31.600> largest

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
care and attention with largest largest

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.910 
care and attention with largest largest
skips<00:05:32.470> between<00:05:32.920> notes<00:05:33.130> but<00:05:33.820> definitely<00:05:34.920> it's

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
skips between notes but definitely it's

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.100 
skips between notes but definitely it's
a<00:05:36.010> goal<00:05:36.190> worth<00:05:36.430> pursuing<00:05:36.790> so<00:05:37.540> I<00:05:37.570> look<00:05:37.840> forward

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
a goal worth pursuing so I look forward

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.260 
a goal worth pursuing so I look forward
to<00:05:38.140> presenting<00:05:38.320> the<00:05:38.740> theory<00:05:39.550> of<00:05:39.580> intervals<00:05:40.030> to

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
to presenting the theory of intervals to

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.550 
to presenting the theory of intervals to
you<00:05:40.450> and<00:05:40.630> we'll<00:05:40.750> go<00:05:40.870> through<00:05:41.170> them<00:05:41.350> an

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
you and we'll go through them an

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.730 
you and we'll go through them an
interval<00:05:42.220> of<00:05:42.340> a<00:05:42.370> type<00:05:42.670> at<00:05:42.820> a<00:05:42.910> time<00:05:43.150> and<00:05:44.110> we'll

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
interval of a type at a time and we'll

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.980 
interval of a type at a time and we'll
build<00:05:45.010> the<00:05:45.160> theory<00:05:45.400> up<00:05:45.550> as<00:05:45.700> we<00:05:45.850> go<00:05:46.060> once<00:05:46.840> again

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
build the theory up as we go once again

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.300 
build the theory up as we go once again
