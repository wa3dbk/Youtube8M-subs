00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.350 
amazing and it's really I'm privileged
to<00:00:15.839> be<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> part<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.320> it

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.130 

Jupiter<00:00:20.260> Milas<00:00:21.130> character<00:00:21.580> has<00:00:21.960> come<00:00:22.960> to<00:00:23.050> the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
Jupiter Milas character has come to the

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.980 
Jupiter Milas character has come to the
attention<00:00:23.380> of<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:25.029> universe<00:00:25.480> and<00:00:25.810> this

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
attention of the universe and this

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.290 
attention of the universe and this
family<00:00:26.230> I<00:00:26.439> think<00:00:26.830> each<00:00:27.310> of<00:00:27.369> their<00:00:27.759> priorities

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
family I think each of their priorities

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.679 
family I think each of their priorities
is<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:30.189> kind<00:00:30.460> of<00:00:30.520> lock<00:00:30.700> her<00:00:30.910> down<00:00:31.090> find<00:00:31.509> out

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
is to kind of lock her down find out

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.720 
is to kind of lock her down find out
more<00:00:31.810> about<00:00:31.960> her<00:00:32.290> and<00:00:32.529> to<00:00:32.950> make<00:00:33.160> sure<00:00:33.190> that<00:00:33.550> she

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
more about her and to make sure that she

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.540 
more about her and to make sure that she
doesn't<00:00:33.910> take<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:35.440> power<00:00:35.680> that<00:00:36.040> they<00:00:36.250> feel

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
doesn't take the power that they feel

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.470 
doesn't take the power that they feel
they're<00:00:36.699> owed<00:00:36.940> and<00:00:37.210> I<00:00:37.270> think<00:00:37.480> Khaliq<00:00:37.750> is<00:00:37.900> very

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
they're owed and I think Khaliq is very

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.240 
they're owed and I think Khaliq is very
very<00:00:40.480> cleverly<00:00:40.960> trying<00:00:41.350> to<00:00:41.620> figure<00:00:42.070> out

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
very cleverly trying to figure out

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.869 
very cleverly trying to figure out
Jupiter<00:00:42.760> and<00:00:43.059> and<00:00:43.360> what<00:00:44.280> what<00:00:45.280> this<00:00:45.400> girl<00:00:45.670> how

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
Jupiter and and what what this girl how

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.220 
Jupiter and and what what this girl how
much<00:00:46.120> of<00:00:46.239> a<00:00:46.300> threat<00:00:46.510> this<00:00:46.660> girl<00:00:46.870> is<00:00:46.989> going<00:00:47.140> to

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
much of a threat this girl is going to

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.860 
much of a threat this girl is going to
be<00:00:47.410> to<00:00:47.559> their<00:00:47.710> power<00:00:47.949> and<00:00:48.309> to<00:00:48.519> their<00:00:49.480> rule<00:00:49.720> in

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
be to their power and to their rule in

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.130 
be to their power and to their rule in
the<00:00:49.960> universe

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
through so many different worlds and I

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.260 
through so many different worlds and I
think<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:45.619> it's<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.830> sci-fi<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.850> that

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
think it's it's a sci-fi and and that

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
think it's it's a sci-fi and and that
one<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.869> matrix<00:01:49.229> their<00:01:49.650> first<00:01:49.860> kind<00:01:50.280> of

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
one of the matrix their first kind of

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.390 
one of the matrix their first kind of
big<00:01:52.290> hit<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.520> suppose<00:01:54.590> it<00:01:55.590> was<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> sci-fi<00:01:56.190> and<00:01:56.369> I

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
big hit I suppose it was a sci-fi and I

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.830 
big hit I suppose it was a sci-fi and I
think<00:01:56.610> it's<00:01:56.820> something<00:01:57.030> they<00:01:57.240> do<00:01:57.300> really<00:01:57.630> well

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
think it's something they do really well

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.670 
think it's something they do really well
I<00:01:57.900> think<00:01:58.080> they<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.740> real<00:01:58.950> passion<00:01:59.160> for<00:01:59.400> it
