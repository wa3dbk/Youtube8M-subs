at 60 miles an hour this car I think

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.260 
at 60 miles an hour this car I think
you're<00:00:51.220> going<00:00:51.340> to<00:00:51.400> get<00:00:51.550> one<00:00:51.700> of<00:00:51.820> these<00:00:51.910> cars

you're going to get one of these cars
basically<00:00:52.780> what<00:00:53.230> I<00:00:53.260> go<00:00:53.680> for<00:00:53.710> if<00:00:54.100> you're<00:00:54.190> going

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370

that it's going to be a problem
I've<00:02:25.430> tried<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:25.969> in<00:02:26.090> sport<00:02:26.510> mode<00:02:26.629> and<00:02:27.379> it

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:27.469 
I've tried it in sport mode and it

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:28.690 
I've tried it in sport mode and it
doesn't<00:02:27.799> seem<00:02:27.889> to<00:02:28.040> really<00:02:28.159> make<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.430> lot<00:02:28.639> of

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
doesn't seem to really make a lot of

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.459 
doesn't seem to really make a lot of
difference<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.359> lag<00:02:29.599> on<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.049> throttle

which<00:02:30.859> is<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.040> bit<00:02:31.280> depressing<00:02:32.799> it's<00:02:33.799> certainly

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
which is a bit depressing it's certainly

particular car has two undersized engine
an<00:03:52.040> undersized<00:03:52.580> engines<00:03:53.060> can<00:03:53.300> be<00:03:53.330> a<00:03:53.450> pain

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
an undersized engines can be a pain

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.230 
an undersized engines can be a pain
because<00:03:54.460> you've<00:03:55.460> got<00:03:55.610> to<00:03:55.730> drive<00:03:55.970> them
