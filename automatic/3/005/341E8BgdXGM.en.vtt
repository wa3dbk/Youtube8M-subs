00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 let's talk about susana giménez la diva 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.339
 of the phones the most important woman 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.160
 in my opinion that has television 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.019
 Argentina because she finally told him 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.210
 suar no to what I'm talking about 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.429
 a very important meeting that there was the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.650
 last week a scene with adrián suar 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.090
 and with carnevale frames they met in 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.220
 a restaurant in la recoleta to talk 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.470
 of the projects that Shuar offered him 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.269
 also obviously of the possible pass to 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.119
 channel 13 that finally is not going to give 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.830
 for now he offered to do theater 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.990
 the bridges of madison you remember 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.700
 that movie in which we all 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.070
 we fell in love with the good middle district 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.930
 Finally, Susana told her not to 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.489
 do not feel like doing drama does not have 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.680
 desire to do theater be all 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.090
 days at the theater but good nights 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.300
 now we have this so that we listen 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.300
 everyone 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:55.630
 I have my friends in the neighborhood and of course 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.530
 I do not have an English friend to talk 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.530
 English and everything 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.800
 speak spanish the english are cold 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:12.520
 for example you are eating at a table and 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:21.580
 you're eating with 23 english and that 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:23.229
 they eat fast they end up making concession 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.940
 to the room in the club itself by 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.520
 example in the selection or in the 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.940
 elections and talk shows you'll spend 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.860
 clear letters you take a coffee a wheat there are 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.229
 something else and if at the time you get up 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.229
 but at the club in england 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.930
 good since we do not have changes and 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.930
 rang you played what did you get 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.930
 Amen 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.530
 but total idol in the corinthians was 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.860
 imagine that you did it is only 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.060
 you have more friends in Brazil I have 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.399
 two friends 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.399
 the Portuguese much easier 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.150
 just a little bit clear and you're going to take 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:22.690
 the veto and the one of u that you take back you go a 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:25.200
 little English until this year 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.200
 four years 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.099
 [Laughs] 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.099
 because these sections that clear 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.370
 for example 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.099
 he grew up in england perfect english me 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.079
 loved it with you when you got that 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.930
 riquelme that was your idol of corneas 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:52.750
 guys who sign an autograph 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.220
 it's true that sleeping you slept with the 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.220
 autograph down the pillow 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.989
 When I was a kid I was already in the mouth and 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.659
 I go when Roman was enjoying 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.579
 reached-balls then I was inside 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.299
 the court and picture message with 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:12.090
 Roman with many players then not 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.769
 I know what else 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:23.580
 the one who had it most was Roman then 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:28.010
 consider high power to be cleaned 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.959
 look my god my god 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.640
 good was susana last night with this peak 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.500
 of rating he did with Carlos Tevez 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.750
 close the information of the show not 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.340

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.530

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.890

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.209

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.250
 with Carlos because thing is that I stay 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.019
 I remembered what I would not again 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.750
 I had seen except the little bit 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.420

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.030

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.840

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.310
