00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.640
 p one of the most common situations 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:22.499
 but that produces more serious accidents in other routes which 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:26.390
 the drivers are forced for any reason has lowered the bench 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.919
 This is a situation that except in some exceptional cases such as 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:33.970
 games in terrible condition 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.970
 should not cause serious accidents if drivers will react 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.640
 adequately 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.570
 but unfortunately there is usually a circular instinctive fear at that moment 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.150
 off the asphalt 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.360
 this usually causes the driver to turn the steering wheel towards the route 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.790
 trying to make them more quickly possible to the same 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.010
 and it is that at that moment when the problem is triggered 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.440
 the front wheels on the edge of the asphalt take abruptly grip 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.650
 and as the steering wheel was turned inwards they produce a brusque the inevitable 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.740
 displacement of the car towards the opposite hand with the risk rudder that 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.590
 this means 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.150
 It is good to understand that after doing this to you 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.530
 there is no way to avoid the utop colussi violently the way that 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.420
 is transiting 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.050
 plus and two defeats 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.480
 It is possible that the vehicle stops at half the width of the road 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.660
 to better understand the reality of this reaction 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.960
 we must in the foreground how much do you need to throw the address to 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.820
 that the problem occurs 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.500
 as we see it is not necessary a big change of direction 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.450
 it is enough with a small blow of steering wheel to produce the situation 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.020
 but let's think 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.430
 what can be on the shoulder 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.820
 there is usually nothing that complicates too much 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.610
 maybe some stone there was some well that could damage a wheel there was another 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.549
 mechanical element of the automobile 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:11.849
 this last case 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.869
 always any mechanical break will be preferable 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.989
 to the possibility of having a compact high-speed portal group 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.169
 Thus 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.149
 I do not fear the shoulder 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:26.159
 if forced to enter it I tried to do it with the front 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.659
 first and in the most parallel way possible to the route 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.809
 and then travel the same number of meters as necessary until it is 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:40.040
 possible to return without abruptly turning the direction and check that everything is 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.099
 develop without major risks 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.739
 that way you will have all the possibilities of keeping the car low 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.849
 your control without difficulties dancing
