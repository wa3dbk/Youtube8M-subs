00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.699
 many companies and universities in the world 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.100
 are carrying out experiments for the 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.990
 development of autonomous vehicles and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.640
 Brazil is not behind 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.310
 three groups of Brazilian universities 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.710
 are developing projects and the most 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.560
 is in são carlos 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.149
 the project calls Catarina that is car 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.340
 intelligent robotics for navigation 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.290
 and the idea of ​​the project is 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.300
 develop a vehicle that can navigate 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.530
 on the streets without the need for a 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.300
 human driver 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.340
 kharina 2 basically works with gps 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.300
 to keep the car on the intended route 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.610
 a 360 degree camera with two lenses that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.960
 identify the brightness and shape of 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.690
 people and animals 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.910
 two laser radars on the roof and another 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.120
 the front to find obstacles in the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.010
 way beyond two computers one with 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.799
 high power of data processing that 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.260
 is in the trunk and another is smaller 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.570
 located in the glove compartment that 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.570
 drive all car hardwares 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.350
 then that vehicle he has adapted it 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.030
 has a number of mechanical adaptations 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.159
 that allow it to be controlled by 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.200
 computers already have several types of 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.960
 different sensors such as laser cameras or 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.360
 gps it has embedded computers 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.909
 inside it and has a lot of sensors 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.470
 that work with how the eyes of that 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.509
 vehicle then these sensors they are 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.210
 used to identify 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.570
 transit to identify others 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.700
 vehicles to persons and in accordance with 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.740
 information that computers receive 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.420
 on these computer sensors take 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.420
 decision of what the vehicle should do 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.759
 initially the vehicle was tested on the 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.590
 field of university and from that 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.659
 month it started to be tested on the streets 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.860
 of the city then the traffic office 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.330
 the city ​​of são carlos she has 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.950
 allowed us to do tests 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.950
 controlled on the streets 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.650
 so that it avoids approaching a 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.540
 curve it already slows it down 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.840
 know you have to do speed sent 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.360
 the curve at a slightly lower speed 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.740
 he makes agreement here on the computer and 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.120
 can analyze a series of 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.830
 information that is happening in 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.020
 car in real time 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.030
 so I can identify the 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.440
 desired speed of the vehicle by 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.720
 example I see that he is 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.240
 detecting an obstacle to it 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.170
 again once the obstacles 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.170
 internal the track it goes 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.280
 so he has him keep a 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.620
 relatively high speed and it is a 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.319
 quite safe vehicle today 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.040
 and we expect that in 15 or 10 or 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.750
 15 years 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.769
 really this technology has called 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.769
 return market 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.430
 the car it has two cameras being 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.170
 which is one of them has two lenses is a 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.989
 external camera that mimics the human eye 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.420
 then she sees the colors and texture and 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.019
 she estimates the depth of each pixel in the 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.790
 Image 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.040
 he has another camera that actually 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.590
 is a set of cameras that can 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.690
 an image 360 degrees the environment is like 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.430
 if there were 12 computer programs 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.200
 which are executed at the same time in 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.200
 of the car and they communicate with each other 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.329
 then he can plan the trajectory 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.579
 he can identify obstacles 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.560
 and manages to keep a distance 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.230
 of other vehicles 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.510
 him for himself if for example a pedestrian 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.220
 cross in front of him but still has 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.400
 a long work ahead 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.829
 today has a number of aspects that the 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.540
 computer can not and can not 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.950
 process the way a year does 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.669
 when we approach a 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.560
 crossing 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:15.930
 You can look at the face 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.060
 drivers and realize if they saw 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.829
 we go to the passage or it is not 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.690
 this is a very difficult thing to do 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:26.910
 through a computer camera by 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.889
 example the planes they use much 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.570
 autopilot in most of the 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.849
 cases the pilot more with the airplane is very 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.889
 more secure than a human pilot and 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:38.510
 believes that the same will occur in 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.510
 some years as a land vehicle 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.950
 treaties of large cities 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.410
 continue to increase the vehicle fleet 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.910
 The way it's done is a lot of people. 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.100
 who believes that people do not go any further 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.620
 have your own car in the future and if the 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.240
 people think well, for example, we have 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.710
 a car but it gets most of the day 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.300
 stopped in the garage 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.310
 so if we had vehicles 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.230
 intelligent and communitarian when I 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.940
 I need to go home at the end of the day 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.520
 I call vehicle through the cell phone 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.990
 He comes and picks me up and takes me home and he's gone. 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.640
 available immediately for 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.670
 meet another person 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.200
 in addition they have a great advantage 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.050
 to use the highly 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.690
 sophisticated that allow the flow is 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.700
 traffic is optimized so that 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.300
 travel in cities and on highways 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.740
 would be shorter and that the entire flow of 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.770
 transit took place more 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.840
 adequate in addition to urban applications in 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.430
 Which one do we work there is a 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.620
 portion of other applications that this 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.260
 type of technology and one of them 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.450
 a big appeal in Brazil is gringo by 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.700
 example week could monitor all 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:48.200
 a fleet of tractors from a room with air 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.200
 conditioning with total security
