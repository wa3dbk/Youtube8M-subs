00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
so there was obvious limitations that

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.550 
so there was obvious limitations that
had<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.119> made<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.570> get<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.869> game<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.229> last

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.530 
had to be made to get the game on last
generation<00:01:17.189> platforms<00:01:17.670> as<00:01:17.850> well<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
generation platforms as well but the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.030 
generation platforms as well but the
game<00:01:18.720> looks<00:01:18.930> terrific<00:01:19.290> by<00:01:19.590> all<00:01:19.770> gameplay

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
game looks terrific by all gameplay

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.620 
game looks terrific by all gameplay
videos<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:20.670> obviously<00:01:21.090> there<00:01:21.270> could<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.509> a

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
videos but obviously there could be a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.999 
videos but obviously there could be a
downgrade<00:01:21.900> but<00:01:22.290> let's<00:01:22.439> hope<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.710> there

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
downgrade but let's hope that there

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.830 
downgrade but let's hope that there
isn't<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.520> ground<00:01:23.850> zero<00:01:24.119> still<00:01:24.420> looks<00:01:24.630> great
