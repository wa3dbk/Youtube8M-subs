00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.910
 hello, I 'm simon dine muscle maker 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.550
 This video is about five times 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.349
 five training system a training system 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.570
 measure is particularly well suited to this 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.150
 to build up power and over the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.740
 building strength also build muscle 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.080
 Of course you know the progressive 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.730
 Muscle structure so more weight the same 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.960
 more muscle mass that has the one or 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.519
 others certainly already good 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.680
 Of course you can also find out right now 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.720
 good to get out of stagnation 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.340
 as well a plateau phase where nothing more 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.079
 you just have to overcome that 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.000
 something that does not enforce something 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.200
 wants to work by itself five times 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.350
 Five training systems basically mean 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.329
 taken five sets of a5 repetitions too 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.980
 schnapps weight what you exactly five 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.230
 can move times or 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.360
 where you short after five repetitions 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.399
 muscle failure you are training 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.289
 of course with relatively high weights like that 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.239
 which is not quite natural here 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.100
 at the diagonal railway bridges something right here 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.989
 Of course, not quite because biceps 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.210
 cologne there must be other calibres 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.920
 Well, that depends on the year of weight 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.690
 how strong you are you can sometimes 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.100
 Bench presses make five times five sets 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.390
 I 'm just doing weight here 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.380
 once 5 x 5 that means you lie down 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.729
 concentrate on it five 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.200
 repetitions to make the weight 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.760
 Of course, it must be adjusted accordingly 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.229
 I did not do that extra now 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.490
 but I just hit five 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.020
 repetitions out with it 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.020
 and show you the whole thing was 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.890
 was, of course, as expected 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.210
 a little too light that is after five 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.369
 You really have to repeat it 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.410
 just at the limit of muscle failure 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.369
 stand so short of muscle failure 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.460
 you have to be 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.380
 that the training time is just that 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.729
 right one 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.170
 has five sets of five repetitions 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.970
 simply the advantage that you are 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.780
 of course, since a force build-up area 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.330
 or 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.070
 sup maximalkraft has just topped the 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.509
 advantage that you always have one 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.710
 can increase a little bit year if you like that 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.600
 trained over four to six weeks 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.080
 you can just weight a lot 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.240
 move 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.800
 Of course, five sentences also always mean 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.940
 again that you are with the same 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.009
 So loads really, too 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.020
 same weight five sets always make 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.700
 brings you back to the threshold where you are 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.650
 just with the first sentence already shortly before 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.690
 muscle failure is, of course, whole 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.480
 good because you're in the area of like 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.280
 a lot of weight and few repetitions 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.450
 attracted maximalkraft trains but that 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.400
 whole over five sentences 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.870
 keep fetching that means also just now 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.340
 the muscle on the gate is in one 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.900
 special way because 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.370
 you usually make three sets 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.560
 Of course you have the last sentence 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.790
 already the feeling that everyone knows that 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.260
 you just do not quite as strong from 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.120
 like the first sentence ever 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.769
 five times five system had on one 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.720
 fifth sentence at the last sentence the 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.549
 Same performance as the first 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.959
 course training partner is natural 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.860
 just important for exercises the bank 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.450
 just press them as a certain 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.070
 injury prevention 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.540
 also bring great risks 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.920
 just the bench press because it can 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.150
 naturally like to behave yourself 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.620
 to suffer serious injuries 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.850
 who has no partner should that 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.280
 rather here in the area of 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.480
 try dumbbells because you have just 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.019
 not the possibility to yourself 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.880
 fight 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.019
 or if you then because of the 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.049
 point is probably no longer possible 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.579
 because you just let off and has 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.079
 not injured just like that 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.790
 a bit of exercise comes with that 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.620
 short had actually handled quite well 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.750
 and also know to what point you 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.160
 everything can go 5x5 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.959
 training system very good 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.299
 build up strength through the build-up of strength 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.040
 building muscle mass works 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.480
 fun is really good 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.890
 especially in the mass phase of success 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.239
 promising thing just times 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.470
 try if you my video 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.940
 of course, I'm happy about it 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.480
 Every review will be in the next one 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.190
 Video 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.190
 many greetings your simon
