00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.220 
trilogy was unbelievably annoying in
fact<00:02:23.580> when<00:02:24.240> I<00:02:24.300> was<00:02:24.480> watching<00:02:24.630> The<00:02:24.960> Empire

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
fact when I was watching The Empire

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.460 
fact when I was watching The Empire
Strikes<00:02:25.290> Back<00:02:25.710> my<00:02:26.100> dad<00:02:26.310> said<00:02:26.610> seat<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.840> c-3po
