that promotion anymore anything we need
the<00:03:14.419> reverse<00:03:16.750> so<00:03:18.760> this<00:03:19.760> is<00:03:19.849> a<00:03:19.910> nineteen

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
the reverse so this is a nineteen

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
capture I don't know I need to read the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.300 
capture I don't know I need to read the
analysis<00:03:24.349> but<00:03:24.530> I<00:03:24.560> don't<00:03:24.769> think<00:03:24.980> it's<00:03:25.069> going<00:03:25.220> to

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
analysis but I don't think it's going to

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.399 
analysis but I don't think it's going to
actually<00:03:25.430> get<00:03:25.790> that<00:03:25.970> much<00:03:26.209> because<00:03:27.109> it's

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
actually get that much because it's

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.500 
actually get that much because it's
offset<00:03:27.919> by<00:03:28.099> what<00:03:28.340> they<00:03:28.489> pay<00:03:28.730> in<00:03:28.760> that<00:03:29.060> country

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
offset by what they pay in that country

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.330 
offset by what they pay in that country
but<00:03:32.510> there<00:03:32.690> would<00:03:32.900> be<00:03:32.930> also<00:03:33.290> a<00:03:33.560> crack<00:03:34.069> down<00:03:34.310> on

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
but there would be also a crack down on

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.159 
but there would be also a crack down on
tax<00:03:34.730> avoidance<00:03:35.379> so<00:03:36.379> this<00:03:37.000> game<00:03:38.000> where<00:03:38.599> a<00:03:38.629> u.s.

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169 
tax avoidance so this game where a u.s.

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.530 
tax avoidance so this game where a u.s.
