00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
into the video we have 4 multiplayer

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.080 
into the video we have 4 multiplayer
maps<00:00:45.539> as<00:00:45.690> usual<00:00:46.170> these<00:00:46.320> are<00:00:46.590> Cove<00:00:46.920> rush<00:00:47.520> detour

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090

and<00:00:48.300> uplink<00:00:48.809> these<00:00:49.500> again<00:00:49.770> are<00:00:49.829> very<00:00:50.190> very

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
and uplink these again are very very

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.400 
and uplink these again are very very
likely<00:00:50.670> sounding<00:00:51.180> names<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.719> their<00:00:51.930> kind<00:00:52.350> of

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
likely sounding names and their kind of

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.840 
likely sounding names and their kind of
emphasizes<00:00:52.920> why<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.160> think<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.579> more

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
emphasizes why I think this is more

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.970 
emphasizes why I think this is more
legitimate<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.629> then<00:00:55.260> there's<00:00:55.469> one<00:00:55.620> zombie

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
legitimate and then there's one zombie

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.069 
legitimate and then there's one zombie
map<00:00:56.129> called<00:00:56.370> buried<00:00:56.940> now<00:00:57.539> where<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:57.960> a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
of worked well because everyone was

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.570 
of worked well because everyone was
really<00:01:21.780> excited<00:01:22.320> about<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.950> new<00:01:23.070> gun<00:01:23.340> but

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
really excited about the new gun but

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.219 
really excited about the new gun but
this<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.030> not<00:01:24.180> going<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.360> happen<00:01:24.450> anymore<00:01:24.780> if

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
this is not going to happen anymore if

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.690 
this is not going to happen anymore if
you've<00:01:25.500> seen<00:01:25.680> my<00:01:25.799> recent<00:01:26.130> video<00:01:26.310> you'd<00:01:26.490> know

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
you've seen my recent video you'd know

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.149 
you've seen my recent video you'd know
that<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> ray<00:01:27.810> gun<00:01:28.049> isn't<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> way

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
that and so the ray gun isn't is a way

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.800 
that and so the ray gun isn't is a way
for<00:01:29.189> them<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> be<00:01:29.700> able<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.909> prote<00:01:30.210> new<00:01:30.479> guns

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
for them to be able to prote new guns

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.450 
for them to be able to prote new guns
but<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.530> know<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.860> something<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.280> all<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
but we know it's something to do all the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.520 
but we know it's something to do all the
time<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.909> they<00:01:33.329> actually<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.900> put<00:01:34.170> new<00:01:34.320> guns

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
time and they actually can put new guns

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.530 
time and they actually can put new guns
into<00:01:34.770> zombies<00:01:35.070> regularly<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.329> not<00:01:36.509> a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
into zombies regularly and it's not a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.719 
into zombies regularly and it's not a
big<00:01:36.720> deal<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.829> very<00:01:38.040> very<00:01:38.159> likely<00:01:38.520> to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
big deal so this is very very likely to

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.880 
big deal so this is very very likely to
what's<00:01:39.240> realistic<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.049> what<00:01:40.200> truck<00:01:40.740> can

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
what's realistic and what truck can

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.380 
what's realistic and what truck can
actually<00:01:41.189> do<00:01:41.369> because<00:01:41.640> we<00:01:41.790> know<00:01:41.970> they<00:01:42.150> can't

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
actually do because we know they can't

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.569 
actually do because we know they can't
put<00:01:42.540> new<00:01:42.750> guns<00:01:43.020> into<00:01:43.290> multiplayer<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:44.280> they

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
put new guns into multiplayer but they

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.389 
put new guns into multiplayer but they
can<00:01:44.880> do<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.180> for<00:01:45.299> zombies<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.920> we<00:01:47.159> can't

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
can do it for zombies and so we can't

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.410 
can do it for zombies and so we can't
really<00:01:47.430> gather<00:01:47.729> anything<00:01:48.000> about<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
really gather anything about the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.940 
really gather anything about the
multiplier<00:01:48.810> map<00:01:49.049> stressed<00:01:49.290> by<00:01:49.380> these<00:01:49.530> images

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
multiplier map stressed by these images

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.639 
multiplier map stressed by these images
and<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.119> zombies<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.659> looks<00:01:51.899> very<00:01:52.170> very<00:01:52.229> f

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
and but the zombies it looks very very f

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.719 
and but the zombies it looks very very f

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
there's a lot of things be able to pick

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.870 
there's a lot of things be able to pick
out<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.149> look<00:01:54.479> very<00:01:54.810> very<00:01:54.869> interesting

what kind of time periods in like in
black<00:02:10.080> ops<00:02:10.229> 1<00:02:10.349> they<00:02:10.619> were<00:02:10.679> yellow<00:02:11.099> control<00:02:11.550> x

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
black ops 1 they were yellow control x

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.130 
black ops 1 they were yellow control x
70<00:02:12.390> and

controlled<00:02:14.910> by<00:02:15.060> Richthofen<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:16.020> then<00:02:16.560> they

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
controlled by Richthofen and then they

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.130 
controlled by Richthofen and then they
turn<00:02:16.860> red<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.400> mob<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.760> dead<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:19.110> now

they're dark blue which kind of confuses

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.600 
they're dark blue which kind of confuses
us<00:02:21.540> yes<00:02:21.810> again<00:02:22.140> but<00:02:22.709> we<00:02:23.040> can't<00:02:23.250> really<00:02:23.340> gather

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
us yes again but we can't really gather

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.000 
us yes again but we can't really gather
that<00:02:23.910> much<00:02:24.209> about<00:02:24.420> just<00:02:24.810> one<00:02:24.990> image<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.620> anyway

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
that much about just one image so anyway

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.070 
that much about just one image so anyway
moving<00:02:26.190> on<00:02:26.459> we<00:02:27.000> can<00:02:27.180> see<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.420> name<00:02:27.540> vengeance

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
moving on we can see the name vengeance

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.470 
moving on we can see the name vengeance
fits<00:02:28.350> in<00:02:28.530> perfectly<00:02:29.069> with<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.700> with<00:02:30.090> other<00:02:30.270> to

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
fits in perfectly with the with other to

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.570 
fits in perfectly with the with other to
map<00:02:30.690> names<00:02:30.900> revolution<00:02:31.440> uprising<00:02:32.010> because

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
map names revolution uprising because

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.580 
map names revolution uprising because
revolution<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.150> like<00:02:33.300> changing<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.080> uprising

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
revolution is like changing and uprising

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.530 
revolution is like changing and uprising
is<00:02:34.709> like<00:02:34.890> roof<00:02:35.190> getting<00:02:35.580> stronger<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.150> rising

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
is like roof getting stronger and rising

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.690 
is like roof getting stronger and rising
up<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.620> vengeance<00:02:38.100> is<00:02:38.250> like<00:02:38.400> fighting

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
up and the vengeance is like fighting

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.490 
up and the vengeance is like fighting
back<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.209> fits<00:02:39.360> into<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.630> theme<00:02:39.720> of<00:02:39.989> what

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
back so it fits into the theme of what

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.199 
back so it fits into the theme of what
track<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.070> trying<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.310> put<00:02:41.430> across<00:02:41.520> with<00:02:42.000> their

track is trying to put across with their

track is trying to put across with their
map<00:02:42.420> pack<00:02:42.600> names<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.250> another<00:02:44.250> thing<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.520> I

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
map pack names and another thing that I

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.160 
map pack names and another thing that I
want<00:02:44.819> to<00:02:44.880> point<00:02:44.940> out<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.780> color<00:02:46.050> the

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
want to point out is that the color the

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.800 
want to point out is that the color the
kind<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.770> theme<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.209> poster<00:02:48.660> which

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
kind of theme of the of the poster which

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.630 
kind of theme of the of the poster which
is<00:02:48.959> orange<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.620> this<00:02:50.100> is<00:02:50.250> very<00:02:50.340> strange

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
is orange and this is very strange

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.250 
is orange and this is very strange
because<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.030> same<00:02:51.209> color<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.600> uprising<00:02:52.140> and

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
because the same color is uprising and

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.050 
because the same color is uprising and
if<00:02:52.350> you<00:02:52.440> ask<00:02:52.560> me<00:02:52.800> em<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.580> would<00:02:53.880> have<00:02:53.970> thought

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
if you ask me em I would have thought

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.550 
if you ask me em I would have thought
track<00:02:54.330> would<00:02:54.510> change<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.989> normally<00:02:55.290> they<00:02:55.380> want

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
track would change it normally they want

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.020 
track would change it normally they want
to<00:02:55.620> put<00:02:55.830> across<00:02:55.980> a<00:02:56.040> different<00:02:56.400> theme<00:02:56.700> for

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
to put across a different theme for

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.120 
to put across a different theme for
every<00:02:57.269> year<00:02:57.480> for<00:02:57.600> every<00:02:57.780> map<00:02:57.959> pack<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.440> I

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
every year for every map pack and I

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.500 
every year for every map pack and I
thought<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.459> would<00:02:59.730> assume<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.120> they<00:03:00.360> would

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
thought I would assume that they would

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.240 
thought I would assume that they would
change<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.900> color<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.350> me<00:03:01.440> like<00:03:01.620> blue<00:03:01.920> or<00:03:02.190> a

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
change the color to me like blue or a

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.800 
change the color to me like blue or a
different<00:03:02.580> color<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:03.180> hasn't<00:03:03.510> been<00:03:03.600> used

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
different color that hasn't been used

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.710 
different color that hasn't been used
already<00:03:04.019> by<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.590> map<00:03:04.830> packs<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:06.269> if<00:03:06.540> this

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
already by the map packs and so if this

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.000 
already by the map packs and so if this
was<00:03:06.870> made<00:03:07.080> up<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.440> would<00:03:07.650> have<00:03:07.739> thought<00:03:07.860> the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
was made up I would have thought the

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.890 
was made up I would have thought the
person<00:03:08.190> trying<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.880> make<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.269> up<00:03:09.510> will

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
person trying to make this up will

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.270 
person trying to make this up will
change<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.290> car<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.620> make<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.800> more<00:03:11.010> believable

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
change the car to make a more believable

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.729 
change the car to make a more believable
but<00:03:12.060> because<00:03:12.420> it's<00:03:12.690> orange<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:13.500> it's<00:03:13.680> the

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
but because it's orange and it's the

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.650 
but because it's orange and it's the
same<00:03:13.950> color<00:03:14.190> as<00:03:14.310> uprising<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:14.970> makes<00:03:15.180> me<00:03:15.390> think

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
same color as uprising it makes me think

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.199 
same color as uprising it makes me think
more<00:03:15.930> likely<00:03:16.440> that<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.830> is<00:03:16.980> not<00:03:17.430> just<00:03:17.880> made<00:03:18.090> up

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
more likely that it is not just made up

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.210 
more likely that it is not just made up
by<00:03:18.360> some<00:03:18.600> random<00:03:18.780> dude<00:03:19.230> who<00:03:19.799> are<00:03:19.950> trying<00:03:20.130> to

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
by some random dude who are trying to

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.069 
by some random dude who are trying to
make<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.400> fake<00:03:20.670> image<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.540> we're<00:03:21.810> also

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
make a fake image so we're also

and<00:04:28.010> every<00:04:28.640> 100<00:04:29.060> steady<00:04:29.210> work<00:04:29.450> on<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.660> trailer
