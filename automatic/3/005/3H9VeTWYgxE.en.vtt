00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.660
 question when you start thinking about 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.480
 holidays 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:56.390
 Well, in general, I'm starting to think about the holidays 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.500
 as soon as you run out of example 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.450

 when they end but in summer 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.190

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.460
 winters 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.360
 in the fall I'm starting to think so 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.439
 next question 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:42.380

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.840
 most often this toy of the world is a concept 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.640
 playing for an hour can hardly be 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:21.030

 new year weird family yes and name 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:58.209
 no one not remembering simple 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:03.909
 so pure question when you find out what 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:05.219
 santa claus doesn't exist of course i don't 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:07.900
 I want to upset 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:09.400
 some of my subscribers because 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.000
 some subscribers probably still 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:17.949
 small children and they are probably still 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.560
 believe that frost up for example in me 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:23.410
 VKontakte wrote a letter there 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.870
 girl 7 years old wrote what you ask 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.509
 Grandfather Frost for the new year and and there 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.919
 wrote that of course of course but my grandfather 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.490
 there is no frost 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:37.440
 she wrote to me I didnâ€™t get anymore 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.440
 friends and do not believe and Santa Claus 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.240
 Yes, probably did not have to upset her 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:50.220
 but still when there is no frost headset 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:50.220
 I found out when I found out about a year ago 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:05:02.139
 I am now literally in a day 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:05.919
 will be 13 years old somewhere frost is not pretty 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.630
 same sides but still about a year two 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:13.960
 or three back my friends and 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:16.630
 who are on chi for 3 and four years 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.120
 younger than me they told me that this 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.690
 parents brings well, I kind of believe 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:28.780
 because because I knew it was 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:31.389
 however, but so it may be 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.570
 It puts pressure on parents but somewhere 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:43.030
 eight years old or until 9 I believed he was 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:45.340
 but then somewhere around 12 I thought but 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.820
 As if partially types study I believed 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.009
 now also the same feeling is not easy 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:55.680
 I want to believe in him sometimes because 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:58.289
 that I want some miracle I do not know 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.150
 magic 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:06.849
 the seventh question is you alive or 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:08.440
 I have an artificial Christmas tree in my house 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:11.169
 artificial tree more precisely I have 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.460
 big tree and one small little 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.700
 never stand because i always 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.979
 want big because I live we never 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.810
 buy because firstly you it 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:23.590
 bought pretty 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:30.070
 Expensive then later right after the new 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:31.719
 years threw away and in general she does she smell 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:36.430
 I certainly like how they take the trees but 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:37.029
 it pours and then the garbage falls 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.529
 remove 

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:44.469
 I don't think that Lenin is just you are just 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:48.990
 how unpleasant that you sit here 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:48.990
 about the Christmas tree and there like wolves pouring and 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:58.479
 the real tree is fading 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:00.550
 prickly rather than artificial 8 question 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:04.990
 where and with whom do you like to celebrate new 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:07.120
 year before that year I always celebrated 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:10.180
 new year at home with my family 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.909
 more precisely, I eat and how you always celebrate 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:16.180
 new year with my family but that year 

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:20.110
 I celebrated with my parents only 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:23.610
 we went to another country here is 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:25.990
 came to the sea to rest there and 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:30.370
 to celebrate the new year but it was great 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:35.560
 but a little the screen without my grandmother and 

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:37.990
 grandpas well what was it all here for you 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:42.460
 liked my new year 

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:46.360
 so by the way, I have such a sweetheart 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.639
 herringbone we took her specifically in that 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:53.110
 year 

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:57.219
 as without a tree in general, this peak I 

00:07:53.110 --> 00:08:00.719
 I give the channels Darya Alekseev 

00:07:57.219 --> 00:08:04.240
 mlp blue star mlp emerald star 

00:08:00.719 --> 00:08:06.510
 what you were Daria Mironova all 

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.510
 until
