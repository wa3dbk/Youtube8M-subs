00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
so what's really cool is that these are

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.980 
so what's really cool is that these are
the<00:01:42.860> legitimate<00:01:43.640> tracks<00:01:44.330> that<00:01:44.720> you<00:01:44.840> would

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
what's cool about that is that you're

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.240 
what's cool about that is that you're
getting<00:01:51.980> first<00:01:52.220> hand<00:01:52.520> practice<00:01:53.980> so<00:01:54.980> that<00:01:55.130> when

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250
