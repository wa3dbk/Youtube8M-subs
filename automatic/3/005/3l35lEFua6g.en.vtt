00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.970
 recall that the band released at the microphone 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.970
 So 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.970
 because currency control want 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.590
 develops 45 minutes nice that near 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.140
 Kiev May 25 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.840
 Therefore, the case is 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.970
 someone else 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.970
 Let's do it together 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.750
 contribution 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.090
 for auction 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.320
 also according to him 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.590
 prim 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.610
 key to traffic jams 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.610
 experience showed that boy 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.870
 also friday 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.080
 he 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.930
 it is better 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.820
 I 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.450
 danger 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.560
 government besides if lost 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.560
 business leaders themselves 5 years 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.710
 in the center of Tallinn this man 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.710
 the project will continue 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.290
 political scientist Victor Nebozhenko 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.450
 he is however not so simple 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.060
 in my opinion it opened 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.000
 by myself 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 in the Internet 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.410
 Yakunin really 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.410
 so here you are 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.570
 not 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.949
 who said environmentalist 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:12.389
