that paper so you can go ahead and throw

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.580 
that paper so you can go ahead and throw
it<00:00:29.699> away

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
it away

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.740

oops so then you're going to take your
pair<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:33.989> scissors<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.649> you're<00:00:35.010> going<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.280> cut

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
pair of scissors and you're going to cut

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.959 
pair of scissors and you're going to cut
along<00:00:36.840> right<00:00:37.260> here<00:00:37.489> to<00:00:38.489> where<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.790> have

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
along right here to where you have

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.299 
along right here to where you have
something<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.809> looks<00:00:39.930> like<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
something that looks like this just a

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.610 
something that looks like this just a
little<00:00:41.550> plastic<00:00:41.730> dome<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.809> so

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
little plastic dome just like that so

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.520 
little plastic dome just like that so
you<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.829> see<00:00:44.040> take<00:00:44.640> your<00:00:44.789> scissors<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.360> cut

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
you can see take your scissors and cut

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.119 
you can see take your scissors and cut
around<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.950> circle<00:00:47.370> now<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.680> have<00:00:49.680> found<00:00:49.980> it

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
around a circle now I have found it

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.250 
around a circle now I have found it
easier<00:00:50.250> for<00:00:50.789> cutting<00:00:51.690> if<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.620> lay<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.829> down

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
easier for cutting if you lay it down

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.299 
easier for cutting if you lay it down
may<00:00:55.260> take<00:00:55.469> your<00:00:55.590> pair<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.800> scissors<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.219> I'm

may take your pair of scissors and I'm
just<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.610> go<00:00:56.670> ahead<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:56.940> put<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
just going to go ahead and put the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:07.640 
just going to go ahead and put the
camera<00:00:57.329> here<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:58.940> just<00:01:05.990> anyone<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.170> nice

continue cutting till you get a nice

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.149 
continue cutting till you get a nice
size<00:01:15.270> which<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.720> about<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.680> about<00:01:16.799> this

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
size which is about this is about this

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.840 
size which is about this is about this
size<00:01:17.220> here<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.830> again<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.100> think<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.670> made

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.149 
size here and again I think I just made
it<00:01:20.880> too<00:01:21.150> big<00:01:21.330> again<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.580> you<00:01:23.580> keep<00:01:24.150> cutting

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
it too big again so you keep cutting
