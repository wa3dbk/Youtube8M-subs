00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
capable of doing that yeah we were and

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.389 
capable of doing that yeah we were and
we<00:00:38.969> thought<00:00:39.210> it'd<00:00:39.390> be<00:00:39.420> ok<00:00:39.860> apparently<00:00:40.860> not<00:00:41.070> but

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
we thought it'd be ok apparently not but

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.130 
we thought it'd be ok apparently not but
then<00:00:41.520> neither<00:00:41.820> was<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> streamed<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
switch and that's that and it's not to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.580

think I'd feel that good about bringing

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.810 
think I'd feel that good about bringing
in<00:01:36.689> shitty<00:01:37.140> quality<00:01:37.350> when<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.490> know<00:01:38.640> that

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
in shitty quality when we know that

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.260 
in shitty quality when we know that
maybe<00:01:39.030> with<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> bit<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.689> testing<00:01:40.020> or<00:01:41.150> you<00:01:42.150> know

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
maybe with a bit of testing or you know

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.850 
maybe with a bit of testing or you know
jigging<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.720> few<00:01:42.990> things<00:01:43.170> around<00:01:43.409> we<00:01:43.649> want<00:01:43.799> were

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
jigging a few things around we want were

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.160 
jigging a few things around we want were
to<00:01:43.979> improve<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.490> significantly<00:01:45.119> or<00:01:45.420> at<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
to improve it significantly or at the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.020 
to improve it significantly or at the
very<00:01:46.200> least<00:01:46.500> hopefully<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.310> first<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.759> March

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
