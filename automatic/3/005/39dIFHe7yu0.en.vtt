00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.400
 Poupen 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:13.700
 Yes Hi, I 'm Mitsuhiro Kawamura 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.210
 a year's title is first in that Tsu Susumero the here 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.770
 Tees's 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.770
 King bolt f spec 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:29.300
 This is what I was involved in development, but 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:31.140
 The aim is the highest peak of light riglots 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.710
 The material is 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.430
 Most of Yamato 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:45.230
 The lightest super high sensitivity high repulsive force 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:46.380
 I 'm using Pyrex right now, so this property has been a great match with jig worm lots so far 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:52.020
 You 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:54.110
 Of picture material with the now Pyrex steez is when I do the Jiguwamu 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.190
 Even though we had and love the rod 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.870
 Light and ultra-sensitive This is the light rig 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.350
 I think I'm facing 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.970
 We adopted a 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.050
 It is the mug that stuck 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.190
 This taper 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.490
 This is me 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:18.110
 When squeezing the spinning rod into one in land 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:21.860
 I coped with what is called the king bolt of steez , but this taper is 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.450
 It was this inherited good for Perfect 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.939
 Over a length of the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:33.470
 This f spec is 6.4 feet from 6.8 beats of King Bolt 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:38.840
 This 6.4 feet is a bit short 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:44.130
 It is easy to decide what kind of hand from back &amp; can handle any cast 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:49.439
 Even when I say I want to be a customer, because I'm so stupid 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.170
 The accuracy with which the contestants are determined and the best part of the Roncast is 6.4 feet 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.409
 Conclusion 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.409
 do it 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.250
 Grip length 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.380
 I also stuck with this 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.010
 It's seemingly short but it's also because this length 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.960
 Oh, with the hand 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:13.340
 Technical cast like backhand cast 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.430
 It's out of the way so when you cast with a double hand 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.360
 Dog is short but 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.310
 this 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:25.260
 When the hold and the long length Kedomo I tried also long and umbrella 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.410
 In later years Then aside gar 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:33.290
 Not 's so this length 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:35.470
 You can decide the cast from the fact that you just feel in grip to fit 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.260
 I can be home naturally 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.640
 This length is What decision 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.350
 The details are here too 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.560
 It comes with a hook hanger 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:50.120
 This is especially true when traveling with a spinning down shot rig for spinning 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.510
 It is disturbed 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.319
 Not only hooks but also those down shot sinkers with one touch 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.129
 I can also set this position 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.129
 For example 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.270
 It is wrong 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:11.400
 Maybe after Toka or put in here and put something like Wow clothing keeper is also commercially available 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.390
 Here I Kedomo I think that there are things that hook version is marked with it was ng 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.660
 that is 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:21.430
 And with what such a superfluous before the Villiers 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:23.100
 If this is the case, the line is a burger so this one never gets into trouble 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.290
 Hmm 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:30.990
 Have in 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:32.940
 Even when gripped by the double hand dodge in painful and Yano hit this bracket is the finger 1 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.170
 It is here by the way 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.790
 ni 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:41.349
 Maa's 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:46.180
 Even though it's a medium light in terms of the King volt power, which has become the base 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:47.019
 It's impossible there are two forces to hear of precisely because it will be a lot even stronger say in the spinning 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.130
 But 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.040
 This rod is 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:56.810
 One with more Raitorigu No. 1 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:00.560
 A light rig with around 1/16 notes 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.609
 The rest is like Mashuru w or no sinker rig 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:08.359
 Comfortable to use with the lightest category of figma 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.470
 And it's super sensitive and hooking is very easy to handle 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.300
 Such 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.530
 Ultimate meeting 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.530
 Finished with light rig rod 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.090
 Hmm
