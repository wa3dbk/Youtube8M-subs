00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:10.320
 I have to lay out exclusively today 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.790
 who can play undercover on 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.440
 I just played a mission where 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.450
 one with james mccann on one 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.950
 He had to be scrapped by his 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.750
 girlfriend Natalia attacked the 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.720
 somehow in danger and is 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.400
 Of course, as Jason Cain brave 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.859
 policeman you had to rush now help 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.380
 but plug it in I was your dare 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.900
 the new thing about lego city is undercover 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.910
 that you are different now, so to speak 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.460
 Professions one plays one and the same 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.480
 figure but this figure can be different 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.489
 occupy disguises and take each one 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.949
 Disguise then offers certain 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.899
 abilities and the special is then 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.329
 and the street corner at each in lego 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.829
 city somewhere such a possibility is waiting 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.840
 partly several that one for example 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.840
 First , open a door with the robber 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.489
 then you have to go backyard there 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.440
 you have to have a flower vat 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.000
 then you have to mend with the farmer 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.530
 climb up somewhere and someday 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.290
 do you have new cars new 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.460
 cladding new lego stones with the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.090
 then you build any again 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.070
 can build 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.600
 it is incredibly diverse this 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.600
 Spiels is so much fun 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.290
 lego city undercover is based on the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.090
 lego world on lego city and still has 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.860
 you get scary allusions 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.909
 the movie world on titanic like that 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.970
 church book stands and on crime series 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.280
 crime films for example starsky &amp; hutch 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.979
 Bars also appear as starsky 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.680
 and gossip one even has allusions 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.920
 on various nintendo themes or 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.380
 theme worlds that one 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.689
 mario star finds or different 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.549
 Mario figures somewhere in the game 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.240
 show up or you with the angel 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.700
 pulling out of the lake is very very funny 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.290
 you have to prove yourself in lego city 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.030
 of course not walking but you 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.659
 really can be an incredible variety 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.490
 to sit on vehicles over 200 are supposed to 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.470
 at the number there are are mainly 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.490
 Of course, cars or motorcycles, though 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.039
 Also helicopter boats ride horses 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.720
 or on a pig in a mission one 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.430
 Special feature at lego city undercover 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.560
 is that it stops with the gamepad 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.780
 Controls and a special feature on the gamepad 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.760
 is that everyone call the man out of the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.440
 police headquarters gets over the gamepad 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.430
 sounds that is totally cool because you 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.650
 really about it and another function 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.140
 is that in the mirror one 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.790
 photo function gets to yes for example 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.350
 to climb the golden gate bridge 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.330
 Just enjoy the view 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.860

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.620
 friends to share totally cool 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.540
 Let the sweet wood grate on your account 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.760
 I have to give up my identity 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.440
 even my hair color needs to change 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.440
