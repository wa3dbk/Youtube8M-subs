&gt;&gt;THAD MATTA: Tough, persevering, relentless.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.250
You know, I think he’s a very proud young
man,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.210
and I would say those are four words that,
in my opinion, would describe him.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.530

&gt;&gt;DEREK UPP: It is a dream come true, just
trying to be a part of a team,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.820
and being a part of this organization. That’s
how great it is.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.989
And being able to be like other people,

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.149
and not worry about your disability.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.389

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.200
&gt;&gt;DEREK UPP: I’ve grown from when I first
started here,

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.000
not knowing what a manager was to do and stuff like that,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.810
to now I’m one of the three leaders that
the other freshman look to

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.180
to try to figure out what to do. 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.479
It has helped me grow to be more
independent, and be more of a leader,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.500
and trying to organize stuff.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.000
&gt;&gt;ANNOUNCER: Sam Thompson! For free, from
DeAngelo Russell!

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.000
&gt;&gt;DEREK UPP: When I first came here, my sister’s
like,'It’s too big.’

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.500
but once you get in your like little niche,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.500
you don’t realize how big it is.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.700
And you realize, ‘Wow, I’m part of one
of the biggest universities in the nation.’

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
[Guitar playing]

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.000
&gt;&gt;MATTA: If you ever think you’re having
a rough go at it,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.000
and you look over there and you see a guy
in a wheelchair

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.000
who’s doing everything he can physically
possibly do on a daily basis,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.860
it serves as an inspiration.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.200
[Guitar playing]

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.080
There’s not many other programs that have
managers in wheelchairs.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.351
And just being able to do as best as I can
for my disability.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.900
