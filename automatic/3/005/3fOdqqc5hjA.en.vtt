that's very important for you to be able

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.990 
that's very important for you to be able
to<00:00:03.610> control<00:00:04.680> this<00:00:05.680> area<00:00:05.980> in<00:00:06.370> the<00:00:06.490> movements

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.000 
to control this area in the movements

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.690 
to control this area in the movements
because<00:00:07.540> the<00:00:08.530> energy<00:00:08.860> comes<00:00:09.100> right<00:00:09.490> from<00:00:09.519> the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
because the energy comes right from the

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.780 
because the energy comes right from the
roots<00:00:09.969> up<00:00:10.360> to<00:00:10.570> your<00:00:10.690> brain<00:00:11.160> so<00:00:12.160> you<00:00:12.190> can<00:00:12.490> sit

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:12.790 
roots up to your brain so you can sit

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
and think about it into meditations for

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.980 
and think about it into meditations for
energy<00:00:15.040> which<00:00:15.219> is<00:00:15.339> very<00:00:15.549> important<00:00:15.969> but<00:00:16.870> it's

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
energy which is very important but it's

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.779 
energy which is very important but it's
even<00:00:17.200> more<00:00:17.380> powerful<00:00:17.619> you<00:00:18.100> can<00:00:18.220> actually<00:00:18.400> move

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789 
even more powerful you can actually move

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.359 
even more powerful you can actually move
this<00:00:19.090> and<00:00:19.570> control<00:00:20.050> it<00:00:20.289> and<00:00:20.920> align<00:00:21.189> it<00:00:21.340> with

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
this and control it and align it with

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.009 
this and control it and align it with
the<00:00:21.580> rhythm<00:00:21.880> there's<00:00:22.420> something<00:00:22.720> to<00:00:22.869> be<00:00:22.990> said

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
balancing because the runn running

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.160 
balancing because the runn running
it<00:01:49.890> balances<00:01:50.100> all<00:01:50.760> the<00:01:51.240> opposite<00:01:51.720> muscles

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
it balances all the opposite muscles

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.380 
it balances all the opposite muscles

and before you sprint it's important

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.540 
and before you sprint it's important
first<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.590> make<00:02:17.680> sure<00:02:17.740> you're<00:02:18.040> doing<00:02:18.130> squats

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
first to make sure you're doing squats

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.300 
first to make sure you're doing squats
and<00:02:18.820> lunges<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.270> walking<00:02:19.570> lunges<00:02:19.840> today

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
and lunges and walking lunges today

strength and if your muscles are not

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.500 
strength and if your muscles are not
like<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.160> your<00:02:26.280> him<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.610> be<00:02:26.730> quiet<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.150> much<00:02:27.300> on

the<00:02:27.720> hamstrings<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.620> said<00:02:28.800> I'm<00:02:28.890> spending

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
the hamstrings and you said I'm spending

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.860 
the hamstrings and you said I'm spending
a<00:02:29.250> lot<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.370> times<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.700> get<00:02:29.850> the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
a lot of times you get the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.050 
a lot of times you get the
one<00:02:31.440> thing<00:02:31.650> difference<00:02:32.250> between<00:02:32.489> spinning<00:02:32.910> in

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
one thing difference between spinning in

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.270 
one thing difference between spinning in
distance<00:02:33.690> money<00:02:35.120> when<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.209> sprint<00:02:36.980> your<00:02:37.980> bits

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
distance money when you sprint your bits

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.190 
distance money when you sprint your bits
it's<00:02:38.519> muscle<00:02:38.760> building<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.510> fat<00:02:39.629> burning<00:02:39.810> at

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
it's muscle building and fat burning at

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.869 
it's muscle building and fat burning at
the<00:02:40.290> same<00:02:40.500> time<00:02:40.769> if<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.310> look<00:02:41.340> at<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.640> bodies

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
the same time if you look at the bodies

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.420 
the same time if you look at the bodies
and<00:02:42.030> splinters<00:02:42.390> are<00:02:42.540> usually<00:02:42.900> very<00:02:43.830> lean<00:02:44.190> but

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
and splinters are usually very lean but

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.220 
and splinters are usually very lean but
there<00:02:44.580> must<00:02:44.760> be<00:02:44.930> whereas<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.080> distance

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
there must be whereas the distance

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.680 
there must be whereas the distance
running<00:02:46.739> now<00:02:47.459> this<00:02:47.700> depends<00:02:48.090> on<00:02:48.269> how<00:02:48.330> much

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
running now this depends on how much

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.320 
running now this depends on how much
body<00:02:48.930> fat<00:02:49.049> somebody<00:02:49.530> has<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:49.950> begin<00:02:50.099> with<00:02:50.400> what

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
body fat somebody has to begin with what

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.390 
body fat somebody has to begin with what
the<00:02:51.480> stuff<00:02:52.170> like<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.530> but<00:02:52.799> it's<00:02:53.129> a<00:02:53.190> general

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
the stuff like that but it's a general

money<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.549> a<00:02:56.879> lot<00:02:57.180> is<00:02:57.209> different<00:02:57.810> depending

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
money and a lot is different depending

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.740 
money and a lot is different depending
on<00:02:58.379> the<00:02:58.440> person<00:02:58.590> but<00:02:59.209> you<00:03:00.209> start<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.569> burn

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
on the person but you start to burn

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.720 
on the person but you start to burn
muscle<00:03:00.989> after<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.620> while<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:02.489> if<00:03:02.549> we<00:03:02.610> look

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
muscle after a while and so if we look

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.130 
muscle after a while and so if we look
at<00:03:02.880> your<00:03:03.030> lead<00:03:03.180> distance<00:03:03.630> runner<00:03:03.870> who<00:03:04.019> so

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
at your lead distance runner who so

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.940 
at your lead distance runner who so
often<00:03:04.380> vary<00:03:04.829> then<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:06.410> you<00:03:07.410> know<00:03:07.530> sometimes

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
often vary then and you know sometimes

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.120 
often vary then and you know sometimes
they<00:03:08.099> even<00:03:08.250> kind<00:03:08.549> of<00:03:08.670> caved<00:03:08.880> in<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.980> don't

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
they even kind of caved in so you don't

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.069 
they even kind of caved in so you don't
