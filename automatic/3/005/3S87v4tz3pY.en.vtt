and separate them and then I'm just
going<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.680> stretch<00:01:41.040> them<00:01:41.460> out<00:01:42.080> round<00:01:43.080> off<00:01:43.410> the

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
going to stretch them out round off the

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.160 
going to stretch them out round off the
edges<00:01:46.310> now<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.520> bit<00:01:47.910> bread<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.600> going<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.020> be

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
edges now this bit bread is going to be

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.640 
edges now this bit bread is going to be
baked<00:01:49.470> at<00:01:50.690> 425<00:01:51.690> degrees<00:01:52.010> anywhere<00:01:53.010> from<00:01:53.310> 18<00:01:54.000> to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
22 to 25 minutes because all oven set up

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.060 
22 to 25 minutes because all oven set up

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
differently so start checking it after

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:11.800 
differently so start checking it after
about<00:02:02.340> 15<00:02:02.970> minutes<00:02:06.080> now<00:02:07.080> once<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.560> do<00:02:07.800> that

I'm<00:02:19.890> going<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.069> narrow<00:02:20.400> them<00:02:20.549> in<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.239> little<00:02:21.510> bit

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:21.719 
I'm going to narrow them in a little bit

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:26.050 
I'm going to narrow them in a little bit

bringing<00:02:32.939> the<00:02:33.650> sides<00:02:34.650> over<00:02:35.219> and<00:02:35.790> then<00:02:36.120> I'm

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
bringing the sides over and then I'm

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.800 
bringing the sides over and then I'm
just<00:02:36.420> going<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.989> pinch<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.739> ends<00:02:38.540> so<00:02:39.540> when<00:02:39.689> it

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
just going to pinch the ends so when it

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.520 
just going to pinch the ends so when it
bakes<00:02:40.099> doesn't<00:02:41.099> come<00:02:41.670> apart<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:43.230> I'm<00:02:43.349> just

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
bakes doesn't come apart so I'm just
