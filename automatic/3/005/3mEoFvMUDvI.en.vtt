into the TV up over here and then you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.010 
into the TV up over here and then you
want<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.550> is<00:00:56.550> take<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.239> ones<00:00:57.449> going<00:00:57.750> from

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
top of the splitter like this so you

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.820 
top of the splitter like this so you
take<00:03:00.320> this<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.460> don't<00:03:01.550> need<00:03:01.730> white<00:03:02.060> still<00:03:02.830> put

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830

it in yellow and take the red and put it
in<00:03:08.090> red<00:03:08.830> so<00:03:09.830> it<00:03:09.950> should<00:03:10.130> look<00:03:10.340> like<00:03:10.700> this

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930
