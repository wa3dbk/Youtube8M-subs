00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.210 

that's<00:01:56.530> what<00:01:56.909> every<00:01:57.909> bird<00:01:58.149> looks<00:01:58.539> like

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
that's what every bird looks like

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.679 
that's what every bird looks like
underneath<00:02:00.220> its<00:02:00.490> feathers

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.940 

it<00:02:04.689> looks<00:02:04.929> like<00:02:05.939> pluck<00:02:06.939> a<00:02:06.970> chicken<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:08.140> little

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
woods you're seeing all these feathers

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.590 
woods you're seeing all these feathers
that<00:02:22.980> cover<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.250> bird's<00:02:24.549> body<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:25.120> smooth

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
that cover the bird's body and smooth

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.360 
that cover the bird's body and smooth
out<00:02:25.870> all<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.290> edges<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:28.830> all<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:30.010> feathers

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
out all the edges and all the feathers

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.390 
out all the edges and all the feathers
grow<00:02:30.730> out<00:02:31.060> out<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.170> body<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.680> curved<00:02:33.010> back

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
grow out out of the body and curved back

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.720 
grow out out of the body and curved back
like<00:02:33.760> this<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:35.620> just<00:02:35.650> like<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:37.830> dog<00:02:38.830> or<00:02:39.099> cat<00:02:39.220> that

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
like this so just like a dog or cat that

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.699 
like this so just like a dog or cat that
if<00:02:40.360> you<00:02:40.540> rub<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:40.930> wrong<00:02:41.170> way

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
if you rub it the wrong way

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.349 
if you rub it the wrong way
the<00:02:42.310> hair<00:02:42.519> gets<00:02:42.700> all<00:02:44.220> messed<00:02:45.220> up<00:02:45.430> so<00:02:45.730> if<00:02:46.329> you

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
the hair gets all messed up so if you

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:47.819 
the hair gets all messed up so if you
rub<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.780> bird<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.170> wrong<00:02:47.320> way<00:02:47.500> all<00:02:47.680> the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
puffed up all they do do is raise all

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.960 
puffed up all they do do is raise all
their<00:03:19.090> feathers<00:03:19.420> up<00:03:19.630> like<00:03:19.959> this<00:03:20.609> so<00:03:21.609> instead

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
their feathers up like this so instead

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.120 
their feathers up like this so instead
of<00:03:22.030> laying<00:03:22.630> back<00:03:22.900> close<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.650> body<00:03:23.829> like

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
of laying back close to the body like

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.729 
of laying back close to the body like
that<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.639> feathers<00:03:24.970> get<00:03:25.180> raised<00:03:25.420> up<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:25.930> then

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
that the feathers get raised up and then

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.809 
that the feathers get raised up and then
it's<00:03:27.549> like<00:03:27.760> it's<00:03:28.000> got<00:03:28.269> a<00:03:28.650> really<00:03:29.650> thick<00:03:29.829> down

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
it's like it's got a really thick down

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.330 
it's like it's got a really thick down
jacket

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
jacket

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.060 
jacket
instead<00:03:33.340> of<00:03:34.110> instead<00:03:35.110> of<00:03:35.170> wearing<00:03:35.500> a<00:03:35.710> fitting

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
instead of instead of wearing a fitting

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.920 
instead of instead of wearing a fitting
coat<00:03:36.310> like<00:03:36.640> it<00:03:36.820> does<00:03:37.000> most<00:03:37.210> of<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.480> time<00:03:37.720> it

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
coat like it does most of the time it

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.630 
coat like it does most of the time it
can<00:03:38.050> puff<00:03:38.350> up<00:03:38.530> its<00:03:38.710> feathers<00:03:39.070> and<00:03:39.280> it's<00:03:39.460> like

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
can puff up its feathers and it's like

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.740 
can puff up its feathers and it's like
its<00:03:40.770> feathers<00:03:41.770> are<00:03:41.950> twice<00:03:42.190> as<00:03:42.220> thick<00:03:42.630> so<00:03:43.630> it

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
its feathers are twice as thick so it

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.450 
its feathers are twice as thick so it
can<00:03:43.930> stay<00:03:44.170> warm<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.590> then<00:03:44.740> it's<00:03:44.920> gonna<00:03:45.250> look

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
can stay warm and then it's gonna look

00:03:45.460 --> 00:04:00.090 
can stay warm and then it's gonna look
like<00:03:45.760> like<00:03:46.720> this<00:03:50.430> really<00:03:51.430> round<00:03:58.830> and<00:03:59.830> it's

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
like like this really round and it's

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.530 
like like this really round and it's
just<00:04:00.310> depends<00:04:00.850> on<00:04:00.910> how<00:04:01.120> they<00:04:01.300> move<00:04:01.510> their

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
just depends on how they move their

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.470 
just depends on how they move their
feathers<00:04:02.640> when<00:04:03.640> you're<00:04:03.790> drawing<00:04:03.970> a<00:04:04.150> bird<00:04:04.330> you

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
feathers when you're drawing a bird you

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.380 
feathers when you're drawing a bird you
got<00:04:04.600> to<00:04:04.720> think<00:04:04.840> about<00:04:05.140> how<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.380> feathers<00:04:05.860> are

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
got to think about how the feathers are

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.750 
got to think about how the feathers are
arranged<00:04:07.390> and<00:04:08.100> remember<00:04:09.100> that<00:04:09.310> it's<00:04:09.520> just

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
arranged and remember that it's just

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.850 
arranged and remember that it's just
like<00:04:09.880> a<00:04:09.940> like<00:04:10.660> a<00:04:10.720> dog<00:04:11.020> or<00:04:11.230> a<00:04:11.260> cat<00:04:11.470> all<00:04:11.710> the

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
like a like a dog or a cat all the

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.900 
like a like a dog or a cat all the
feathers<00:04:12.160> are<00:04:12.340> going<00:04:12.550> the<00:04:12.670> same<00:04:12.700> direction

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
feathers are going the same direction

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.020 
feathers are going the same direction
they're<00:04:13.600> all<00:04:15.030> smooth<00:04:16.030> down<00:04:16.390> towards<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.140> tail

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
they're all smooth down towards the tail

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.970 
they're all smooth down towards the tail
and<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.239> job<00:04:19.630> of<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.900> feathers<00:04:20.290> is<00:04:20.500> partly<00:04:20.860> to

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
and the job of the feathers is partly to

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.560 
and the job of the feathers is partly to
keep<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.340> bird<00:04:21.489> warm<00:04:21.760> but<00:04:21.970> also<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.330> make<00:04:22.540> it

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
keep the bird warm but also to make it

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.630 
keep the bird warm but also to make it
really<00:04:22.960> streamline<00:04:23.590> so<00:04:23.890> it<00:04:24.040> can<00:04:24.250> go<00:04:24.430> through

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
really streamline so it can go through

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.950 
really streamline so it can go through
the<00:04:24.760> air<00:04:24.970> like<00:04:25.270> an<00:04:25.480> airplane<00:04:25.780> and<00:04:27.960> through

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
the air like an airplane and through

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.550 
the air like an airplane and through
there<00:04:29.170> so<00:04:30.130> it's<00:04:30.970> all<00:04:31.240> smooth<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.260> streamlined

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
there so it's all smooth and streamlined

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.830 
there so it's all smooth and streamlined
