00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.720
 found with lot for a new 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.099
 nuclear in multi on black hole info 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.660
 the necks it's super hot to do 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.099
 but I made only two at the same 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.519
 time i'm not an expert in multi i 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.049
 do not strive to do it even if I 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.020
 go to charlene i think i would do 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.660
 not been at all early 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.340
 yes I tried a little bit faster 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.609
 Richard is really not really 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.289
 well played to you it's still not 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.660
 obvious so we're at the fal on 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.120
 standoff a weapon that does not like 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.860
 necessarily because you bring it back I 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.350
 really find out of all the guys who 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.730
 play with its two selectors 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.840
 of tiercé is forbidden but there is 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.149
 still guys you see like me you 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.800
 have a scop trigger stop author of you 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.660
 tires really fast so that there 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.079
 no actually it's abused she should 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.300
 be forbidden to leave prohibited 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.949
 without his readers so law forbidden 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.750
 with his shooting readers but without his 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.190
 TV shooters but they have 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.809
 all trigger stop with their skate 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.120
 so it's almost the same thing I 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.330
 want to there was a moment there is a bet 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.070
 updated for level in laval 0 early see 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.479
 since this makes updating 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.189
 now but when you put the shot 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.520
 self it takes three balls why then 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.780
 to san siro early it takes 2 yeah that I 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.259
 find it a little bitchish and they 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.299

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.130

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.540
 there was the roster sponsors 3rd number 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.980
 1 to make one but I 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.440

 with humor cap and whip I do not know 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.180
 I already have already been happy because 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.760
 that it's wrong it's still enough 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.560
 not a beautiful structure and all are there 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.909

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.590
 their chains he's waiting for me they're doing 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.209

 streamers commentators you this is 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.810

 it's a roster 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.900
 we get along well there is a level here 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.900
 that's it's cool me it's mostly 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.040
 to progress is not necessarily to 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.879
 become the best world to win 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.099
 of a charger to earn money it's not 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.920
 an idea in dari scadd think is gone to 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:15.099
 change a little tekki street a 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.959
 bomb but m but not that as must 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.120
 play under change the micro station 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.769
 orbital the blackbird the drones kill 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.690
 more often seen with a fog when 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.970
 you were doing nuclear but the bomb 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.770
 he likes it does not hurt because 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.090
 it pays more points in fact soon 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.590
 that you are allies do one he expects 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.300
 report more points than you can 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.979
 go back to chaining on your ta 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.630
 second series actually it delirious ah 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.250
 yeah ben a drone bru joined this 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.130
 gives a +10 whereas an irm when your 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.780
 buddy you a man it gives a +28 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.430
 rails I do not know in any case this 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.450
 do not hurt what but what is 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.520
 it's a bit more advantageous for 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.900
 repeat the ground suite to the duke is 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.060
 what I like about the gameplay 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:53.820
 there are none of these four have once 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:56.770

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.910
