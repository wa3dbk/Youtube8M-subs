00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.320
 ops 2 a gap and my own 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.240
 stratospheric was created by 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.620
 our element breed and of course the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.630
 second time I comment on gameplay 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.500
 because my favorite place is the game 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.750
 elements are so many kids part today 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.239
 in fact we bring you the nuclear nearby 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.770
 faster in Italy I don't know if 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.540
 we will write it in the title do not ask 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.960
 to me because to me this video 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.850
 however, it is the novese ct 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.980
 Consider a bartender don't ask me 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.019
 accessories because the gameplay knows them 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.580
 still in times of faces italy for those 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.239
 did not know them, do a culture 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.220
 there are those who vote in Italy on youtube e 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.250
 no guys it is gameplay in palmi it is 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.690
 stratospheric also because I mine 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.420
 therefore devoid it has been in 100 seconds 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.519
 and with weapons he made it in 180 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.920
 seconds with zecchino then perhaps 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.840
 some questions I should do stop 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.909
 to play 30 aside today just alive 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.430
 I didn't want to bring you an argument 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.310
 precise because there is no gameplay time 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.390
 precisely of a three-minutes it did not sense 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.789
 more than anything I wanted to ask you a question 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.219
 that my professor imposed on me 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.490
 really blair guys has placed mine 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:33.750
 professor of gymnastics he in over 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.930
 to be our tudorel 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.610
 from the physical point of view he is also 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.080
 great person you guys don't 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.290
 truly realize a person 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.610
 cultured once we are in the classroom 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.710
 perhaps to do what reflections 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.770
 maybe about life and made us one 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.980
 little question but it's already said but you 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.930
 favorite sports team sports 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.620
 individual transport of teams one 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.020
 political but in short there 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.150
 and immediately when I did this 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.190
 I had asked you at first glance, but 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.400
 fixed team sport because it has 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.270
 rejected this thing made me do it 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.540
 of reflections 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.160
 based on this sense it makes me football 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.680
 it is the maximum expression 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.480
 however team sports in the world 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.580
 big everyone you think there really are 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.090
 as many other sports as can be 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.650
 the basketball the volleyball that bring clicks 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.430
 he told me a lot of satisfaction 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.980
 in short, rugby and small sports 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.750
 differences that arise between a sport the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.120
 single which may be tennis is one 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.310
 Team sports are the satisfactions 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.830
 which can be opened perfect because 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.510
 doing a team sport, guys do 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.990
 everyone wins together you lose everyone 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.900
 together and not if you lose is not that you 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.530
 afflicts ces afflicts the team at 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.760
 end because it is not that everyone goes on a 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.770
 player of his team for di 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.390
 yesterday disgust this way it's your fault 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.180
 we lost while a single sport 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.540
 if you lose it was only your fault 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.650
 so if you win you can see the 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.030
 girls 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.590
 think how nice to celebrate with the 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.930
 own team place to celebrate from 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.090
