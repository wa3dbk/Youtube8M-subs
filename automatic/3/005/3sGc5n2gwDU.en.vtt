you know mighty switch force started off

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.910 
you know mighty switch force started off
sorry<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.840> jump<00:00:48.960> jump<00:00:49.320> back<00:00:49.469> now<00:00:49.649> mighty

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
3d us and we started talking about like

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.590 
3d us and we started talking about like
how<00:00:56.100> would<00:00:56.160> flip<00:00:56.460> champs<00:00:56.730> work<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> 3ds

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
how would flip champs work on the 3ds

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.180 
how would flip champs work on the 3ds
how<00:00:57.899> would<00:00:57.989> we<00:00:58.079> do<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> 3ds

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
how would we do it just on the 3ds

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.220 
how would we do it just on the 3ds
screen<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.270> then<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.660> kind<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.930> came<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
screen and then we kind of came to the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.990 
screen and then we kind of came to the
conclusion<00:01:01.289> well<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.430> we're<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> do<00:01:02.879> all

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
conclusion well if we're going to do all

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.549 
conclusion well if we're going to do all
this<00:01:03.149> would<00:01:03.390> be<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> different<00:01:03.690> game<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.409> then

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
this would be a different game and then

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.870 
this would be a different game and then
we<00:01:04.710> came<00:01:04.890> up<00:01:04.920> with<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.159> mechanic<00:01:05.640> for<00:01:05.670> mighty

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
we came up with a mechanic for mighty

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.789 
we came up with a mechanic for mighty
switch<00:01:06.119> force<00:01:06.350> um<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.850> you<00:01:08.850> know<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:10.590> game

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
switch force um so you know the the game

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.950 
switch force um so you know the the game
sort<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.460> come<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.540> guess

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
sort of just come out of I guess

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.289 
sort of just come out of I guess
necessity<00:01:13.560> or<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.250> know<00:01:14.280> ideas<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
necessity or just you know ideas and the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.580 
necessity or just you know ideas and the
idea<00:01:15.540> came<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.170> man<00:01:16.320> mighty

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
idea came that it's like man mighty

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.580 
idea came that it's like man mighty
switch<00:01:16.860> force<00:01:16.890> was<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.430> much<00:01:17.580> fun<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.790> make<00:01:18.000> um

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
switch force was so much fun to make um

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.780 
switch force was so much fun to make um
we<00:01:19.590> were<00:01:19.650> able<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.890> crank<00:01:20.070> things<00:01:20.250> out<00:01:20.460> let's

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
we were able to crank things out let's

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.550 
we were able to crank things out let's
let's<00:01:21.150> let's<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.600> another<00:01:21.689> one<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.140> lets<00:01:22.320> you

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
excited for it but I just thought to be

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.780 
excited for it but I just thought to be
fun<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.150> mention<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.020> now<00:01:40.430> versus<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.759> a

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
fun to mention it now versus you do a

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.730 
fun to mention it now versus you do a
press<00:01:42.060> release<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.899> then<00:01:42.990> people<00:01:43.140> kind<00:01:43.710> of

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
press release and then people kind of

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.649 
press release and then people kind of
don't<00:01:43.950> pick<00:01:44.070> up<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.670> then<00:01:44.970> they<00:01:45.509> aren't

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
don't pick up on it and then they aren't

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.210 
don't pick up on it and then they aren't
too<00:01:45.720> excited<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.040> tell<00:01:47.130> you
