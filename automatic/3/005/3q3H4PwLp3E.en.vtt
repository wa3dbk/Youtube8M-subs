because<00:02:34.050> I<00:02:34.170> had<00:02:34.350> that<00:02:34.530> same<00:02:35.160> problem<00:02:35.610> with

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
because I had that same problem with

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:45.560 
because I had that same problem with
other<00:02:38.030> devices<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.330> I've<00:02:39.630> Rhian<00:02:41.150> via<00:02:44.570> the

other devices that I've Rhian via the
mods<00:02:45.870> on<00:02:48.770> this<00:02:49.770> is<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.100> first<00:02:50.340> time<00:02:50.520> I've

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
mods on this is the first time I've

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.430

never<00:02:50.910> ever<00:02:51.180> been<00:02:51.510> able<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.840> get<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.230> work

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
never ever been able to get it to work

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.980 
never ever been able to get it to work
so<00:02:54.050> pretty<00:02:55.050> stock<00:02:55.290> right<00:02:55.890> now<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:57.480> did<00:02:57.750> come

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
so pretty stock right now it did come

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.910

with Google Apps

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.730 
with Google Apps
so<00:03:07.340> overall<00:03:08.340> I'm<00:03:08.640> pretty<00:03:08.820> happy<00:03:09.210> I<00:03:09.740> really

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
so overall I'm pretty happy I really

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.130 
so overall I'm pretty happy I really
wish<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.240> camera<00:03:12.240> would<00:03:12.600> have<00:03:12.750> worked<00:03:12.870> on

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
wish the camera would have worked on

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.160 
wish the camera would have worked on
though<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:14.910> could<00:03:15.630> live<00:03:15.840> without<00:03:15.960> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
this device because this device has a

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.210 
using it with that Bluetooth device so
probably<00:03:32.730> as<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.209> phone<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:34.320> can't<00:03:34.860> live<00:03:35.100> without

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
probably as a phone I can't live without

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.180 
probably as a phone I can't live without
the<00:03:35.520> Bluetooth<00:03:36.140> for<00:03:37.140> anything<00:03:37.470> else<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:38.040> could

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
the Bluetooth for anything else I could

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.750 
the Bluetooth for anything else I could
live<00:03:38.370> without<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.820> Bluetooth<00:03:43.400> jellybean<00:03:44.400> has

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
live without the Bluetooth jellybean has

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.920 
live without the Bluetooth jellybean has
much<00:03:45.060> better<00:03:48.019> memory<00:03:49.019> usage<00:03:50.120> so<00:03:51.120> that<00:03:51.750> was

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
much better memory usage so that was

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.540 
much better memory usage so that was
that<00:03:52.290> was<00:03:52.470> one<00:03:52.650> reason<00:03:52.980> why<00:03:53.100> I<00:03:53.130> wanted<00:03:53.489> to

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
that was one reason why I wanted to

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:00.680 
that was one reason why I wanted to
upgrade<00:03:54.890> because<00:03:56.690> with<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:58.519> 2.3<00:03:59.519> that<00:04:00.269> was<00:04:00.420> on

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
upgrade because with the 2.3 that was on

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.530 
upgrade because with the 2.3 that was on
here<00:04:02.420> it<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:04.260> memory<00:04:04.590> usage<00:04:04.800> was<00:04:05.250> horrid<00:04:05.880> and

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
here it the memory usage was horrid and

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.100 
here it the memory usage was horrid and
I<00:04:07.110> was<00:04:07.290> filling<00:04:07.709> up<00:04:07.830> that<00:04:07.890> 512<00:04:08.780> very<00:04:09.780> very

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
I was filling up that 512 very very

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:18.470 
I was filling up that 512 very very
quickly<00:04:10.410> so<00:04:14.450> yeah<00:04:16.549> so<00:04:17.549> this<00:04:17.730> device<00:04:18.030> has<00:04:18.269> been

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
quickly so yeah so this device has been

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.940 
quickly so yeah so this device has been
routed<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:19.880> relatively<00:04:20.880> painless<00:04:21.500> way<00:04:22.500> to<00:04:22.530> go

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
routed a relatively painless way to go

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.450 
routed a relatively painless way to go
about<00:04:23.190> that<00:04:23.460> you<00:04:24.030> do<00:04:24.539> need<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.900> drivers<00:04:25.380> and

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
about that you do need the drivers and

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.240 
about that you do need the drivers and
plug<00:04:26.669> it<00:04:26.819> into<00:04:26.970> your<00:04:27.180> computer<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:28.130> then<00:04:29.389> it

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
plug it into your computer and then it

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:40.909 
plug it into your computer and then it
fairly<00:04:32.250> easy<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:33.889> do<00:04:34.889> the<00:04:35.069> upgrade<00:04:39.800> it<00:04:40.800> was

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
fairly easy to do the upgrade it was

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.189 
fairly easy to do the upgrade it was
relatively<00:04:41.370> painless

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
relatively painless

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.110 
relatively painless
you<00:04:43.199> know<00:04:43.319> delete<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:43.889> cache<00:04:44.099> here<00:04:44.580> or<00:04:44.789> delete

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
you know delete to cache here or delete

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:54.260 
you know delete to cache here or delete
that<00:04:45.330> there<00:04:45.870> and<00:04:47.030> upgrade<00:04:48.030> basically<00:04:50.270> but<00:04:53.270> the

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
that there and upgrade basically but the

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.629 
that there and upgrade basically but the
limitations<00:04:54.990> of<00:04:55.849> four<00:04:56.849> point<00:04:57.150> one<00:04:58.250> may<00:04:59.250> force

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
limitations of four point one may force

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.600 
limitations of four point one may force
me<00:04:59.820> to<00:04:59.849> go<00:05:00.030> back<00:05:00.270> to<00:05:00.710> two<00:05:01.710> point<00:05:02.039> three

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.980 

especially<00:05:05.610> if<00:05:05.910> I<00:05:06.000> can't<00:05:06.240> get<00:05:06.389> the<00:05:06.509> camera<00:05:06.720> to

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
especially if I can't get the camera to

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:15.409 
especially if I can't get the camera to
work<00:05:07.520> alright<00:05:08.520> well<00:05:08.759> that's<00:05:09.060> it<00:05:11.270> so<00:05:14.389> have<00:05:15.389> a
