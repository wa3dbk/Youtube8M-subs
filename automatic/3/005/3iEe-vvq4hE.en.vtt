line<00:02:47.109> you<00:02:48.109> can't<00:02:48.349> make<00:02:48.470> units<00:02:48.890> on<00:02:49.069> their<00:02:49.250> side

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
line you can't make units on their side

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.190 
line you can't make units on their side
but<00:02:50.420> once<00:02:50.599> they<00:02:50.840> cross<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.439> boundary<00:02:51.859> you<00:02:52.099> can

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
but once they cross the boundary you can

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.940 
but once they cross the boundary you can
so<00:02:54.200> yeah<00:02:54.700> also<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:55.760> can<00:02:55.879> take<00:02:56.239> um<00:02:56.739> units<00:02:57.739> from

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
so yeah also you can take um units from

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.559 
so yeah also you can take um units from
