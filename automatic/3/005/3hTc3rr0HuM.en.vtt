00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.060
 we are here now at the stand of oil in spear toes 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:11.959
 nobody knows Klaus Diehl I'm responsible for the technology 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:14.129
 I want you here now 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.199
 In Germany parts for 2011 introduce the prude in offer for 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.679
 the Moto Cross models 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.249
 that's the first thing 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.399
 the revised EGS 4 in Fürth won the reception 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.550
 Furthermore, we have a duel for it 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:32.820
 just to reach a progressive Kenny line 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.630
 this part is optional i included in the normal scope of delivery 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.080
 Furthermore, Arbon we have a blue is the deliverer for the pressure level 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.550
 Percent in the program also this is then optional available continues 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.130
 The cartridge system for the front fork has been revised 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.710
 especially in the vote for Doom or running 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.810
 So here we have our new segment by means of fun 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.570
 Program from ö1 is 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.870
 So here we have a damper we take along with the Type II 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.040
 integrated reservoir 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.760
 and adjustable rebound damping 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.530
 This is the optimal and affordable entry into the cave in the worlds 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.049
 So we now specifically for 2011 endangered species 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.309
 Interesting here is the sale price of Thaler Bolle 90 Euro 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.740
 In particular, I now order here also this new percent 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.230
 Demonstration projects 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.620
 so will offer lower-laid models 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.650
 also in the middle segment the same damper as I just called him 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.750
 but then for smaller riders who often have problems with their feet 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.090
 to come on the floor 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.240
 that too would have been a big highlight for 2011 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.619
 the army now the whole 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.119
 new parts for the road models 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.809
 when he starts racing, we have the new fgr 100 gift 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.940
 So here is special fork final fork and limited too only 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.180

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.860
 the also new for street racing and for everyone 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.160
 Now available is a closed corporates system which is the last one 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.289
 Years only with special contract was available 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:19.499
 Furthermore, the 30 mm cartridge has been reworked 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:20.919
 thickest in the fire 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:26.059
 Per cent Vidic 36 who has come true in recent years, in particular, is here 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:30.079
 So striking the adjuster in compression and rebound now with a 3 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.669
 Millimeters are available on the bus 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:36.149
 as it used to be in module type b and in the Superbike World Championship 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:37.479
 was 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:42.079
 furthermore we see different optional parts also for the sweater of the 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.079
 Economic side can be adjusted via compressed air percent 

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:50.959
 together then just to sit with a gas cylinder so it is needed 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.959
 to allow the adjustment 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:03.079
