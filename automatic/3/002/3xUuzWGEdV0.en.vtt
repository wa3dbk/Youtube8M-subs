00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:13.539
 5 these problems 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.400

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.859

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.610

 cCN 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.570
 from what I saw the lady 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.570
 this rise is useful to have given up 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.880
 it's time to stop 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.290
 the memory is good 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.030

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.740
 Villepin

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.660
 the Arab league 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.660

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.680

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.410

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.839
 scientific technique
