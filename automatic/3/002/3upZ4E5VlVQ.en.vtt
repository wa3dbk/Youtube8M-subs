00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.849
 Sales have been doing me for the ninth year 9 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:15.170
 years but this is more or less conscious 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.270
 forward time actually taking 7 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.760
 more but i'm this and not considering because 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.910
 what were the first steps 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.680
 that is, it was a different deal 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.679
 sale ie i was just starting 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.900
 learn how to build market trading 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.450
 relationship it was still long average 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.150
 school grades so here is a conscious 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.380
 being engaged in sales for the ninth year that 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.380
 I understand by scrapping consciously 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:49.170
 consciously it means understanding you 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.660
 doing how are you doing why are you doing 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.420
 and how effective is what you do 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:01.110
 I am a supporter 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.730
 your every action was so much 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:08.630
 effective so you save time on 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:12.090
 this action so you can save 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.070
 effort resources anything i mean i 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.980
 supporter of what you do 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.600
 it worked if you hire salespeople 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.540
 you hire effective sellers you 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.580
 or waste your time i'm not at all out 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.250
 I do not really like the word I spend 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.960
 I try not to clean any more 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.420
 negative points so you don't 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.659
 spend time typing sellers and you 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.950
 spend time in a set of effective 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.950
 your team members 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.690
 same thing if you sell you don't 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.240
 just walk with the buyer there is something 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.610
 tell him show there by his 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.490
 let's say so need yes at his request 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.500
 you really understand what you 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.840
 do if you ask now 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.240
 buyer question you understand why it is 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.060
 what you will lead you to understand 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.979
 as far as it brings you closer to 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.310
 completion of the sale 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.290
 this is what i preach my programs 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.740
 clear understanding of action clear 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.180
 understanding why 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:27.920
 whale your every phrase she must bear 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:32.510
 should bring you treasured sales 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:35.480
 in my opinion the highest professionalism 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.710
 not only do it all effectively 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.280
 but also make it so that the client is 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.880
 satisfied so that the client comes to you 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.370
 time and time again 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.390
 so that he tells you his 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:52.610
 to friends of friends where is the advertisement 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:55.489
 so that he becomes loyal to your 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.590
 companies to your boutique store 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:02.820

 the path from the seller to the business owner then 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.860
