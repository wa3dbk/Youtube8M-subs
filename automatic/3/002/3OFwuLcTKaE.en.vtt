00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
okay this is kind of easy one in the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.729 
okay this is kind of easy one in the
corner<00:00:51.030> they<00:00:51.269> get<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> little<00:00:51.659> speed<00:00:52.050> boost<00:00:54.739> but

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
corner they get a little speed boost but

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.270 
corner they get a little speed boost but
yeah<00:00:55.920> what<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.250> ripping<00:00:56.850> off<00:00:57.000> well<00:00:57.329> I

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
yeah what this is ripping off well I

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.229 
yeah what this is ripping off well I
know<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.640> do<00:00:59.789> notice<00:01:00.089> this<00:01:00.479> is<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> reskin<00:01:01.350> of

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
know but I do notice this is a reskin of

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.469 
know but I do notice this is a reskin of
motor<00:01:03.239> rally<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:03.869> the<00:01:03.899> previous<00:01:04.440> device<00:01:05.420> can<00:01:06.420> I

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
motor rally on the previous device can I

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.480 
motor rally on the previous device can I
actually<00:01:06.720> hurt<00:01:07.320> them<00:01:07.530> or<00:01:07.770> they<00:01:08.340> hurt<00:01:08.490> me<00:01:08.759> no

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
actually hurt them or they hurt me no

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.969 
actually hurt them or they hurt me no
yeah<00:01:11.490> okay<00:01:11.789> so<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:12.180> you're<00:01:12.390> dead<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:12.960> then<00:01:13.590> you

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
yeah okay so if you're dead on then you

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.460 
yeah okay so if you're dead on then you
actually

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
actually

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.000 
actually
don't<00:01:16.100> click<00:01:16.400> for<00:01:16.640> them<00:01:16.820> make<00:01:17.450> sense<00:01:17.870> but<00:01:18.770> yeah

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
don't click for them make sense but yeah

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.030 
don't click for them make sense but yeah
that<00:01:19.820> probably<00:01:20.270> has<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:20.840> do<00:01:21.140> with<00:01:21.410> that<00:01:21.800> the

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
that probably has to do with that the

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.760 
that probably has to do with that the
original<00:01:22.820> sprites<00:01:23.120> of<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.330> game<00:01:23.540> were

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
original sprites of the game were

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.280 
original sprites of the game were
motorcycles<00:01:25.210> so<00:01:26.210> you<00:01:26.270> know<00:01:26.510> they<00:01:26.720> didn't

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
motorcycles so you know they didn't

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.100 
motorcycles so you know they didn't
really<00:01:27.500> adjust<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.130> year<00:01:28.430> hitbox<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:29.900> can

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
really adjust the year hitbox you can

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.530 
really adjust the year hitbox you can
really<00:01:30.380> clip<00:01:30.620> through<00:01:30.800> them<00:01:30.980> and<00:01:31.850> it's<00:01:32.270> them

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
really clip through them and it's them

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.770 
really clip through them and it's them
and<00:01:32.810> where<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.110> tires<00:01:33.350> are<00:01:33.590> concerned

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
and where the tires are concerned

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.980 
and where the tires are concerned
interesting<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.740> I<00:01:36.770> guess<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.360> actual

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
interesting so I guess the actual

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.620 
interesting so I guess the actual
kind<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.770> inspiration<00:01:41.730> for<00:01:41.940> you<00:01:42.120> which<00:01:42.390> no

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
kind of inspiration for you which no

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.090 
kind of inspiration for you which no
game<00:01:42.900> was<00:01:43.880> like<00:01:45.200> super<00:01:46.200> hang<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.530> or<00:01:46.710> something

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
game was like super hang on or something

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.210 
game was like super hang on or something
and<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:48.120> know<00:01:48.240> some<00:01:48.720> basic<00:01:49.230> motorcycle<00:01:50.040> game

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
and you know some basic motorcycle game

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.420 
and you know some basic motorcycle game
but<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.480> don't<00:01:51.780> know<00:01:51.900> it<00:01:52.110> mostly<00:01:53.010> reminds

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
but this I don't know it mostly reminds

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.429 
but this I don't know it mostly reminds
me<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.820> boogie<00:01:54.210> boy<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.600> guess<00:01:54.900> but<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.800> know

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
me of boogie boy I guess but you know

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.580 
me of boogie boy I guess but you know
very<00:01:57.740> much<00:01:57.979> dumbed<00:01:58.310> down<00:01:59.110> so<00:02:00.110> yeah<00:02:00.350> I<00:02:00.380> don't

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
think anyone came close to any of those

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.940 
think anyone came close to any of those
guesses<00:02:04.579> it's<00:02:05.149> it's<00:02:05.570> yeah<00:02:06.229> I<00:02:06.590> don't<00:02:07.340> know

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
it's it's kind of amazing how they run

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.280 
it's it's kind of amazing how they run
out<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.530> ideas<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:17.390> such<00:02:17.599> an<00:02:17.750> extent<00:02:18.110> that

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
out of ideas to such an extent that

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.460 
out of ideas to such an extent that
they've<00:02:18.440> started<00:02:18.770> risking<00:02:19.280> their<00:02:19.550> own<00:02:19.700> games

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470
