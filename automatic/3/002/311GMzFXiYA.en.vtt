can choose freely because this thing

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.060 
can choose freely because this thing
there's<00:03:47.490> only<00:03:47.790> one<00:03:48.090> way<00:03:48.300> to<00:03:48.330> live<00:03:48.690> but<00:03:49.560> it's<00:03:49.740> ok

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
because we all have our own way you know

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.370 
because we all have our own way you know
many<00:03:53.700> people<00:03:53.850> think<00:03:54.210> that<00:03:54.540> black<00:03:54.810> people<00:03:55.140> are

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
many people think that black people are

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.710 
many people think that black people are
gangsters<00:03:55.980> because<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.880> parents<00:03:57.360> told<00:03:57.540> them

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
gangsters because the parents told them

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.890 
gangsters because the parents told them
they<00:03:58.560> brought<00:03:58.830> up<00:03:59.040> with<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.460> all<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.570> people

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
they brought up with it all the people

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.770 
they brought up with it all the people
are<00:04:01.020> programmed<00:04:01.680> in<00:04:01.890> one<00:04:02.100> way<00:04:02.540> we're<00:04:03.540> either

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
are programmed in one way we're either

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.830 
are programmed in one way we're either
to<00:04:04.050> have<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.380> figure<00:04:04.620> out<00:04:04.890> what<00:04:05.130> that<00:04:05.280> is

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
to have to figure out what that is

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.020 
to have to figure out what that is
but<00:04:06.840> when<00:04:07.620> we<00:04:07.770> are<00:04:07.800> all<00:04:08.070> foreign<00:04:08.520> people<00:04:08.910> we

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
but when we are all foreign people we

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.280 
but when we are all foreign people we
can't<00:04:09.270> choose<00:04:09.450> our<00:04:09.600> own<00:04:09.720> way

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
can't choose our own way

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.520 
can't choose our own way
I<00:04:10.550> think<00:04:11.550> we<00:04:11.640> can't<00:04:11.880> decipher<00:04:12.120> it<00:04:12.360> and<00:04:13.140> you<00:04:13.380> are

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
I think we can't decipher it and you are

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.699 
I think we can't decipher it and you are
that<00:04:13.650> programming<00:04:14.250> no<00:04:14.910> we<00:04:15.870> don't<00:04:16.140> have<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.530> be

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
that programming no we don't have to be

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.880 
that programming no we don't have to be
all<00:04:17.100> people<00:04:17.940> can<00:04:18.090> choose<00:04:18.330> it<00:04:18.600> there's<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.650> big

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
all people can choose it there's the big

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.580 
all people can choose it there's the big
thing<00:04:20.190> between<00:04:20.430> born<00:04:20.910> and<00:04:21.269> brought<00:04:21.480> up<00:04:21.540> we<00:04:22.470> are

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
thing between born and brought up we are

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.290 
thing between born and brought up we are
a<00:04:22.620> big<00:04:22.890> mix-up<00:04:23.250> we<00:04:24.000> have<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.330> figure<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:24.780> out<00:04:26.300> it

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
a big mix-up we have to figure it out it

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.060 
a big mix-up we have to figure it out it
sounds<00:04:27.750> extremely<00:04:28.140> difficult<00:04:28.500> and

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
sounds extremely difficult and

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.820 
sounds extremely difficult and
complicated<00:04:29.700> but<00:04:30.570> I<00:04:30.630> hope<00:04:30.930> you<00:04:31.110> take<00:04:31.350> my<00:04:31.410> liver

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
complicated but I hope you take my liver

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.010 
complicated but I hope you take my liver
it's<00:04:32.610> my<00:04:32.820> biggest<00:04:33.000> wish<00:04:33.560> no<00:04:34.560> I<00:04:35.270> won't<00:04:36.270> do<00:04:36.690> that
