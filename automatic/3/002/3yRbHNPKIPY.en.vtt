does take a little practice so you're

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.570 
does take a little practice so you're
just<00:04:55.470> going<00:04:55.680> to<00:04:55.710> want<00:04:55.950> to<00:04:56.990> practice<00:04:57.990> as<00:04:58.169> you<00:04:58.320> go

just going to want to practice as you go
you're<00:04:59.580> gonna<00:04:59.669> want<00:05:00.000> to<00:05:00.120> get<00:05:00.240> your<00:05:00.570> petals

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
you're gonna want to get your petals

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.360 
you're gonna want to get your petals
overlapping<00:05:03.000> so<00:05:03.510> that<00:05:03.660> they're<00:05:03.780> not

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
overlapping so that they're not

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.350 
overlapping so that they're not
automatically<00:05:05.370> just<00:05:05.729> right<00:05:05.940> behind<00:05:06.210> each

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
automatically just right behind each

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.200 
automatically just right behind each
other<00:05:06.540> if<00:05:06.810> you<00:05:07.350> have<00:05:07.580> like<00:05:08.580> if<00:05:08.700> this<00:05:08.880> petal

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
other if you have like if this petal

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.850 
other if you have like if this petal
we're<00:05:09.330> gonna<00:05:09.450> lay<00:05:09.690> right<00:05:09.720> here<00:05:09.960> I<00:05:10.500> would<00:05:10.680> just

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
we're gonna lay right here I would just

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.540 
we're gonna lay right here I would just
push<00:05:11.400> it<00:05:11.610> over<00:05:11.940> a<00:05:12.240> little<00:05:13.050> and<00:05:13.470> overlay<00:05:14.340> it<00:05:14.490> in

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
push it over a little and overlay it in

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.510 
push it over a little and overlay it in
the<00:05:14.669> back<00:05:14.880> so<00:05:15.240> that<00:05:15.290> there's<00:05:16.290> it<00:05:17.010> doesn't<00:05:17.400> lay

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
the back so that there's it doesn't lay

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.730 
the back so that there's it doesn't lay
right<00:05:17.880> behind<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.510> petal<00:05:19.200> in<00:05:19.290> front<00:05:19.530> of<00:05:19.620> it<00:05:19.710> so

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
right behind the petal in front of it so

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:26.800 
right behind the petal in front of it so
it's<00:05:20.070> not<00:05:20.190> hidden<00:05:21.500> so<00:05:22.500> you<00:05:22.560> just<00:05:22.770> keep<00:05:23.070> going

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.020 

when<00:05:27.810> it's<00:05:27.960> time<00:05:28.169> to<00:05:28.200> lay<00:05:28.590> the<00:05:28.800> next<00:05:29.250> piece<00:05:29.790> on

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
when it's time to lay the next piece on

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.710 
when it's time to lay the next piece on
I<00:05:30.560> just<00:05:31.560> put<00:05:31.740> a<00:05:31.770> little<00:05:31.919> hot<00:05:32.220> glue<00:05:32.720> overlapping

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
I just put a little hot glue overlapping

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.680 
I just put a little hot glue overlapping
where<00:05:34.410> the<00:05:34.590> first<00:05:35.520> piece<00:05:35.820> ended<00:05:36.270> right<00:05:36.630> there

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
where the first piece ended right there

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.510 
where the first piece ended right there
and<00:05:37.229> then<00:05:38.010> I<00:05:38.100> just<00:05:38.310> lay<00:05:38.580> my<00:05:39.560> new<00:05:40.560> piece<00:05:40.860> on<00:05:41.190> top

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
and then I just lay my new piece on top

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.370 
and then I just lay my new piece on top
so<00:05:41.880> it<00:05:41.910> keeps<00:05:42.600> that<00:05:43.040> flap<00:05:44.040> down<00:05:44.630> and<00:05:45.630> then<00:05:46.229> you

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
so it keeps that flap down and then you

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.990 
so it keeps that flap down and then you
can<00:05:46.500> just<00:05:46.710> keep<00:05:46.919> working<00:05:47.100> the<00:05:47.580> opposite

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
can just keep working the opposite

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:58.370 
can just keep working the opposite
direction<00:05:54.440> and<00:05:56.150> the<00:05:57.150> petals<00:05:57.540> will<00:05:57.900> just<00:05:58.110> get<00:05:58.320> a

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
direction and the petals will just get a

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.670 
direction and the petals will just get a
little<00:05:58.790> bigger<00:05:59.790> if<00:06:00.780> you<00:06:00.960> want<00:06:00.990> some<00:06:01.500> of<00:06:01.590> these

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
little bigger if you want some of these

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.870 
little bigger if you want some of these
really<00:06:02.040> big<00:06:02.190> petals<00:06:02.970> like<00:06:03.630> this<00:06:04.370> the<00:06:05.370> template

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
really big petals like this the template

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.830 
really big petals like this the template
that<00:06:06.060> I<00:06:06.090> posted<00:06:06.750> the<00:06:07.110> PDF<00:06:07.790> just<00:06:08.790> enlarge<00:06:09.240> it<00:06:09.600> so

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
that I posted the PDF just enlarge it so

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.190 
that I posted the PDF just enlarge it so
like<00:06:10.169> you<00:06:10.320> can<00:06:10.530> copy<00:06:10.740> it<00:06:10.890> and<00:06:11.220> then<00:06:11.990> enlarge<00:06:12.990> it

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
like you can copy it and then enlarge it

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.200 
like you can copy it and then enlarge it
to<00:06:13.229> like<00:06:13.470> 50%<00:06:14.070> or<00:06:14.640> just<00:06:14.760> kind<00:06:14.940> of<00:06:14.970> play<00:06:15.180> around

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
to like 50% or just kind of play around

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.300 
to like 50% or just kind of play around
until<00:06:15.630> it's<00:06:16.020> the<00:06:16.260> size<00:06:16.590> that<00:06:16.620> you<00:06:16.950> want<00:06:16.979> so

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
until it's the size that you want so

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.120 
until it's the size that you want so
that's<00:06:17.430> how<00:06:17.640> you're<00:06:17.820> gonna<00:06:17.880> get<00:06:18.120> the<00:06:18.270> bigger

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
that's how you're gonna get the bigger

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:25.610 
that's how you're gonna get the bigger
roses<00:06:21.320> so<00:06:22.320> we're<00:06:22.530> just<00:06:22.560> going<00:06:24.169> the<00:06:25.169> bigger<00:06:25.410> it

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
roses so we're just going the bigger it

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.680 
roses so we're just going the bigger it
gets<00:06:25.650> kind<00:06:26.640> of<00:06:26.700> the<00:06:26.820> easier<00:06:27.180> it<00:06:27.300> gets<00:06:27.419> that

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
gets kind of the easier it gets that

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.469 
gets kind of the easier it gets that
middle<00:06:27.960> part<00:06:28.110> really<00:06:28.440> is<00:06:28.530> the<00:06:28.710> hardest<00:06:29.479> and

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
middle part really is the hardest and

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:31.940 
middle part really is the hardest and
you<00:06:30.599> will<00:06:30.780> go<00:06:30.960> through<00:06:31.200> quite<00:06:31.380> a<00:06:31.440> bit<00:06:31.530> of<00:06:31.770> hot

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
you will go through quite a bit of hot

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.100 
you will go through quite a bit of hot
glue<00:06:32.159> but<00:06:33.090> I<00:06:33.150> haven't<00:06:33.330> found<00:06:33.630> an<00:06:33.810> adhesive

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
glue but I haven't found an adhesive

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.459 
glue but I haven't found an adhesive
that<00:06:34.530> works<00:06:34.740> as<00:06:35.130> well<00:06:35.490> as<00:06:35.640> well

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:37.469 
that works as well as well

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:43.100 
that works as well as well
despite<00:06:38.189> getting<00:06:38.339> the<00:06:38.759> ferns<00:06:39.689> I<00:06:41.749> use<00:06:42.749> the<00:06:42.959> low

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
despite getting the ferns I use the low

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.350 
despite getting the ferns I use the low
temp<00:06:43.409> for<00:06:43.649> that<00:06:43.800> reason<00:06:44.189> at<00:06:44.819> the<00:06:44.939> Macon<00:06:45.239> tea

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
temp for that reason at the Macon tea

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.169 
temp for that reason at the Macon tea
table<00:06:45.749> I<00:06:45.989> ended<00:06:46.199> up<00:06:46.259> with<00:06:46.409> a<00:06:46.439> high<00:06:46.679> temp<00:06:47.179> hot

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:48.179 
table I ended up with a high temp hot

00:06:48.179 --> 00:06:50.839 
table I ended up with a high temp hot
glue<00:06:48.389> gun<00:06:48.599> and<00:06:48.839> some<00:06:49.169> actually<00:06:50.069> left<00:06:50.580> some

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:50.849 
glue gun and some actually left some

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:53.509 
glue gun and some actually left some
marks<00:06:51.179> okay<00:06:51.839> when<00:06:52.169> you<00:06:52.259> get<00:06:52.379> to<00:06:52.529> the<00:06:52.619> back<00:06:52.800> this

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:53.519 
marks okay when you get to the back this

00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:58.309 
marks okay when you get to the back this
is<00:06:53.580> all<00:06:53.849> I<00:06:53.909> do<00:06:54.059> I<00:06:54.419> just<00:06:56.269> get<00:06:57.269> put<00:06:57.599> extra<00:06:58.110> hot

00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 
is all I do I just get put extra hot
