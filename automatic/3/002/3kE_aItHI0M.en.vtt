00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
the base I dropped my free spell on the

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.010 
the base I dropped my free spell on the
inferno<00:01:36.549> as<00:01:36.670> I<00:01:36.939> saw<00:01:37.119> it<00:01:37.149> targeting<00:01:37.689> one<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.929> the

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
inferno as I saw it targeting one of the

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.929 
inferno as I saw it targeting one of the
archers<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:38.560> fauna<00:01:39.279> goes<00:01:39.429> down<00:01:39.670> everything's

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
archers and fauna goes down everything's

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.760 
archers and fauna goes down everything's
looking<00:01:40.270> good<00:01:40.600> I<00:01:40.810> waited<00:01:41.289> a<00:01:41.380> little<00:01:41.499> bit

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
looking good I waited a little bit

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.199 
looking good I waited a little bit
because<00:01:41.889> there<00:01:42.159> was<00:01:42.249> a<00:01:42.279> lot<00:01:42.459> of<00:01:42.490> open<00:01:42.909> spaces

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:43.209 
because there was a lot of open spaces

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:45.569 
because there was a lot of open spaces
in<00:01:43.569> the<00:01:44.079> middle<00:01:44.349> right<00:01:44.499> there<00:01:44.740> where<00:01:45.459> the

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
in the middle right there where the

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:46.949 
in the middle right there where the
queen<00:01:45.819> is<00:01:45.849> and<00:01:46.299> I<00:01:46.329> figured<00:01:46.630> there<00:01:46.749> would<00:01:46.840> be<00:01:46.869> a

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959 
queen is and I figured there would be a

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:48.209 
queen is and I figured there would be a
Giant<00:01:47.289> Bomb<00:01:47.319> there<00:01:47.619> so<00:01:47.740> I<00:01:47.770> didn't<00:01:48.039> want<00:01:48.159> to

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219

troll I don't think there was another
way<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.340> attack<00:02:42.670> this<00:02:42.850> base<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.390> really<00:02:44.050> thought

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
way to attack this base I really thought

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.710 
way to attack this base I really thought
about<00:02:44.290> it<00:02:44.680> I<00:02:44.800> tried<00:02:45.040> like<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.940> tried<00:02:46.420> thinking

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
about it I tried like I I tried thinking

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.990 
about it I tried like I I tried thinking
maybe<00:02:46.900> lava<00:02:47.200> Looney<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:47.740> tried<00:02:48.010> maybe<00:02:48.700> go<00:02:48.970> i

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
maybe lava Looney and I tried maybe go i

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.300 
maybe lava Looney and I tried maybe go i
put<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.630> only<00:02:49.930> way<00:02:50.110> i<00:02:50.380> thought<00:02:50.950> this<00:02:51.100> would<00:02:51.280> be

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
put the only way i thought this would be

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.070 
put the only way i thought this would be
the<00:02:51.490> best<00:02:51.670> way<00:02:51.820> is<00:02:52.090> because<00:02:52.270> even<00:02:52.840> if<00:02:52.930> there

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
the best way is because even if there

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.450 
the best way is because even if there
were<00:02:53.170> skeleton<00:02:53.590> traps<00:02:53.860> in<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.100> middle<00:02:54.340> i

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
were skeleton traps in the middle i

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.030 
were skeleton traps in the middle i
figured<00:02:55.030> my<00:02:55.150> hogs<00:02:55.420> always<00:02:56.230> target<00:02:56.680> the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
figured my hogs always target the

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.250 
figured my hogs always target the
closest<00:02:57.490> building<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:57.970> not<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.540> nearest

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
closest building and not the nearest

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.380 
closest building and not the nearest
troops<00:02:59.620> so<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:00.460> is<00:03:00.610> why<00:03:00.730> i<00:03:00.760> dropped<00:03:01.030> my<00:03:01.090> hogs

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
troops so that is why i dropped my hogs

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.600 
troops so that is why i dropped my hogs
and<00:03:01.720> as<00:03:01.870> i<00:03:01.900> mentioned<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.920> skeleton<00:03:03.400> traps

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
and as i mentioned the skeleton traps

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.370 
and as i mentioned the skeleton traps
come<00:03:03.820> out<00:03:03.970> they<00:03:04.300> hit<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.660> hogs<00:03:04.870> but<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.200> hogs

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
come out they hit the hogs but the hogs

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.870 
come out they hit the hogs but the hogs
will<00:03:05.560> not<00:03:05.710> get<00:03:05.890> distracted<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.490> actually

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
will not get distracted and actually

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.190 
will not get distracted and actually
take<00:03:07.060> care<00:03:07.210> of<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.330> town<00:03:07.510> hall<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:07.840> then

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
take care of the town hall and then

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.900 
take care of the town hall and then
focus<00:03:08.620> on<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.800> skeletons<00:03:09.250> but<00:03:09.700> we're<00:03:09.820> at

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
focus on the skeletons but we're at

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.640 
focus on the skeletons but we're at
ninety-nine<00:03:10.300> percent<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.840> we<00:03:11.080> will<00:03:11.290> get<00:03:11.470> the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
ninety-nine percent and we will get the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.740 
ninety-nine percent and we will get the
one<00:03:11.800> hundred<00:03:12.100> percent<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.640> now<00:03:13.210> this<00:03:13.510> was

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
one hundred percent and now this was

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.930 
one hundred percent and now this was
honestly<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.380> biggest<00:03:14.770> i<00:03:15.250> think<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:15.910> most

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
honestly the biggest i think the most

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.030 
honestly the biggest i think the most

got<00:03:46.570> one<00:03:46.870> Archer<00:03:47.170> out<00:03:47.230> so<00:03:47.650> this<00:03:47.800> is<00:03:47.950> going<00:03:48.160> to

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
got one Archer out so this is going to

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.100 
got one Archer out so this is going to
be<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.640> little<00:03:49.150> tricky<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:49.870> little

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
be a little tricky and a little

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.570 
be a little tricky and a little
difficult<00:03:50.530> because<00:03:50.650> he<00:03:50.830> did<00:03:51.070> not<00:03:51.100> bring<00:03:51.430> a

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
difficult because he did not bring a

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.160 
difficult because he did not bring a
lightning<00:03:51.910> spell<00:03:52.150> so<00:03:52.630> if<00:03:52.750> he<00:03:52.840> had<00:03:52.959> brought<00:03:53.110> a

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
lightning spell so if he had brought a

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.270 
lightning spell so if he had brought a
lightning<00:03:53.530> spoke<00:03:53.680> he<00:03:53.769> probably<00:03:54.010> would<00:03:54.220> have

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
lightning spoke he probably would have

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.370 
lightning spoke he probably would have
got<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.550> one<00:03:54.730> star<00:03:55.030> but<00:03:55.630> as<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:56.019> guys<00:03:56.170> can<00:03:56.320> see
