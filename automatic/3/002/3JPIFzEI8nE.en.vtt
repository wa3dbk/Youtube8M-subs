00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.630
 osman professor ratib the university hospitals of geneva has a 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.429
 cutting-edge new technology with that fart yesterday m 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.049
 what is his great asset 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.779
 this new machine that makes it the first in Morocco 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.779
 combines two advanced imaging technologies 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.909
 m a scanner yesterday m 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.609
 traditional killer and for 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.939
 positron tomography also called machine fart 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.489
 which is a beautiful machine for visualizing and phenomena 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:32.660
 biological 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.260
 these two technologies have traditionally been 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.129
 it's the same since you can not live together in the same room 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.610
 yesterday's imagery likes and a pretty important magnetic field 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.740
 that disrupts the imaging head 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.690
 thanks to the technological prowess and new developments that the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.760
 house fitch could realize this machine today allows to have the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.410
 two scanners in the same room separated by albi which allows to pass 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.390
 the patient 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.339
 2 at the other of the modalities 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.309
 without connotation mouth thus allowing to have the two images or both 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.309
 series of images obtained perfectly superimposed 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.130
 advantages 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.620
 and so we have no exams that combined two technologies a 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.229
 technology yesterday me that allows to see the fabrics 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.180
 organs 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.540
 it made more sense 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.560
 the proposal that allows to see the metabolism 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.330
 and the function of the different tissues 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.980
 what are the clinical implications for which this machine gets 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.570
 reveals particularly effective 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.000
 the combination of a review yesterday me benzema head the flemish parties useful 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.200
 for exams on Monday 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.980
 cancer tumors 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.270
 in tracking the detection of these elected deaths disease since most 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.890
 patients need these two modalities already today that are 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.560
 made separately 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.729
 general allowing to see the houses still tumors team 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.470
 no time to analyze 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.140
 function but also the response 2 some of these tumors to some 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.790
 treatments 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.450
 it's an extremely useful tool now that will allow us to be 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.750
 even more precise 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.960
 for monitoring 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.950
 ability to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments and a 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.950
 certain still for the earlier detection of certain sequences 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.439
 there are other applications pki his potential for his technologies inc 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.830
 especially in everything that is cerebral degenerative diseases 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.559
 neurological and also in cardiovascular disease 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.739
 she's helped the gunners sclerotic heart mania 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.860
 what passion to draw everyone is difficult to this new 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.499
 to scan 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.349
 many patients already need both modalities today 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.599
 of an irremediable petz in the follow-up of their cancer or other diseases 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:34.769
 it's hexameters traditionally done separately at two moments 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:35.950
 different 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.920
 will now thanks to this technology is done at the same time in 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.170
 a sub-station of which therefore not sure to have a better comfort 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.949
 since he will need it only once 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:46.179
 for both exams 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:49.579
 for us it will also be an advantage since the images obtained are then 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:50.480
 perfectly 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.620
 stackable 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.069
 which allows us to better identify lesions 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.109
 to better analyze these images of the most accurate of a diagnosis 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.299
 to superimpose images reindeer image quest 

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:03.579
 it is clear that this new technology will open new 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:04.750
 perspectives is going 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.670
 allow a number of benefits and improvements to our 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.309
 patient survival 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:12.739
 it will probably also change some routes 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.389
 where patients will benefit from this land 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:20.309
 hybrid technology that adds he dies metabolic dimensions of evaluation of the 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.919
 fabric 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:22.209
 and how they work 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.999
 a traditional exam irene they have today 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:28.209
 it is undeniable that this new technology and will bring 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.059
 important benefits for many patients 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:35.049
 who to benefit from this technique in monitoring their treatment and in 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.049
 the evaluation of the therapeutic responses of the accounting treatment 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:41.199
 you also carry out research projects 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.199
 in which area and for which purpose 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:48.019
 in the case of the collaboration we claimed jean-philip what has 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.389
 so built this device we intend to demonstrate so 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.039
 more objective 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:57.289
 the added value of merging these two terms into a single machine 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:04:01.109
 hybrid and its impact on cancer monitoring and treatment 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:05.759
 we have particularly wanted to study three areas in which 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:10.279
 we think that the superposition of these images will improve the diagnosis and the 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:11.939
 quality of our services 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.249
 especially in cancers or cancers of the head and neck 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:19.049
 these cancers that undergoes this very disabling ogi waste that alter 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.530
 Latvia very much and for which it is often very difficult 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.950
 to know 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.370
 if recurrence lucien change following a treatment undergone surgery 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.670
 we think that superposition of images the contribution of the text submitted to a ben ahmed 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.670
 lioret our performance in capacity 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.170
 to detect the evolution of his concerts recidivism and some 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.349
 sequences 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:43.219
 the second area is that of prostate cancer a concert in which 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:46.800
 it is bringing to be able to detect recurrences that occur after 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.819
 treatments 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.930
 and detect them early enough to power 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.449
 introduce a second or third treatment 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.830
 it is in these cases that the superimposition of the two images 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.279
 again it allows for a more accurate diagnosis earlier 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:04.349
 10 cancer of the prostate and its recurrence following surgery of 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:05.589
 to follow a therapy 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:06.990
 the third domain 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.520
 this is an important area is that of breast cancer 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.770
 but this cancer soup complicated brain imaging yesterday my already 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.430
 has made a lot of progress in recent times it has become a tool for 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.160
 job 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.480
 at the conference for the follow-up of breast cancers 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.150
 they ask us again added 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.979
 in this country in these difficult cases to head imaging which is a component 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.210
 metabolic that allows to see again 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.659
 treatment efficiency metabolic changes of tissue 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:32.259
 to be more precise and effective 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:35.599
 in the application of these treatments we can really follow in a very 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.370
 precise evolution is and eventual recurrences also 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.740
 but some sequences 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.629
 Geneva University Hospitals 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:46.050
 without the first hospital in europe to have such a machine 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.479
 another is at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:52.479
 on what to report the collaboration with my American colleague 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.750
 thanks to our useful works and particularly in the 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.199
 areas of oncology 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:01.139
 we were selected by the fixed house putting the first site 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.139
 pilot who benefits from this new technology 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.909
 and so we are actually considering evaluating applications 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:12.349
 in the very special areas of cancer and cancer treatment 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:15.439
 at new york red bulls a second manna pastel machine is 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:16.770
 practically at the same time 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:17.909
 for 100 th line 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:21.489
 work focused on all or cardiovascular disease on the study 

00:06:21.489 --> 00:06:22.939
 ship's plates 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:25.619
 thanks to professor fayette is an expert in this field 

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:29.979
 so we will be able to benefit from our experiences in New York 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:32.979
 and to apply protocols and new techniques in the field 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:34.040
 cardiovascular 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.050
 and vice versa 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.260
 so shared with the new york team 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.740
 developments and developments that we are going to do in the 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.740
 field of oncology and in the field of cancer monitoring 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.319
 it is clear that we are still considering a number of other collaborations 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:49.129
 and that both teams worked 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:50.749
 pretty close 

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:53.889
 we have several specific projects still in mind
