actually<00:00:33.870> ended<00:00:34.290> pretty<00:00:34.440> soon<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:34.980> think<00:00:35.370> it'll

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.910 
actually ended pretty soon I think it'll
only<00:00:35.700> lasted<00:00:36.180> around<00:00:36.270> six<00:00:36.930> minutes<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.890> I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
only lasted around six minutes so I

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.680 
only lasted around six minutes so I
definitely<00:00:38.129> couldn't<00:00:38.489> could<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.300> gotten<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690

this gameplay i was using the lodestar
dogs<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.079> swarm<00:01:01.410> i<00:01:01.620> changed<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.579> up<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.789> bit

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820

decided to use a lodestar dogs and swarm

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.460 
decided to use a lodestar dogs and swarm
because<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.549> kind<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.360> wanted<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.840> try<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.290> out

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
because I kind of wanted to try it out

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.770 
because I kind of wanted to try it out
see<00:01:10.799> if<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.130> was<00:01:11.220> better<00:01:11.369> because<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.360> lot<00:01:12.750> of

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
see if it was better because a lot of

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.149 
see if it was better because a lot of
times<00:01:13.020> when<00:01:13.170> I'm<00:01:13.260> playing<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.500> domination<00:01:13.890> i'm

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
times when I'm playing a domination i'm

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.010 
times when I'm playing a domination i'm
using<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.549> vsat<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.180> when<00:01:15.330> i<00:01:15.360> call<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.900> be

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
using the vsat and when i call on the be

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.899 
using the vsat and when i call on the be
set<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.560> pretty<00:01:17.189> much<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.490> makes<00:01:17.729> my

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
set it pretty much just makes my

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.670 
set it pretty much just makes my
teammates<00:01:18.270> go<00:01:18.479> triple<00:01:18.840> cap<00:01:19.020> when<00:01:19.500> i'm<00:01:19.590> playing

with randoms and most of the time i'm
playing<00:01:21.689> solo<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.500> all<00:01:22.560> my<00:01:22.710> Rams<00:01:22.890> will<00:01:23.189> triple

playing solo so all my Rams will triple

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.100 
playing solo so all my Rams will triple
cap<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> game<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:24.600> soon<00:01:24.900> when<00:01:25.080> i

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
call my v set because as most of you

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.580 
call my v set because as most of you
guys<00:01:27.210> probably<00:01:27.299> know<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.900> visa<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.290> what

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
guys probably know the visa is what

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.530 
guys probably know the visa is what
really<00:01:28.860> causes<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.549> randoms<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.150> go<00:01:30.240> triple

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
really causes the randoms to go triple

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.270 
really causes the randoms to go triple
cap<00:01:30.689> because<00:01:31.170> they<00:01:31.439> know<00:01:31.590> exactly<00:01:31.710> where<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
cap because they know exactly where the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.160 
cap because they know exactly where the
enemies<00:01:32.549> are<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.270> they<00:01:33.299> actually<00:01:33.689> feel

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
enemies are and that they actually feel

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.080 
enemies are and that they actually feel
safe<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.130> going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.460> try<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.670> capture<00:01:35.909> the

safe and going to try and capture the
enemy<00:01:36.299> flags<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.320> makes<00:01:37.500> them<00:01:37.680> triple

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
enemy flags so that makes them triple

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.550 
enemy flags so that makes them triple
cap<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.759> if<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.119> guys<00:01:39.299> are<00:01:39.750> having<00:01:40.229> trouble

cap so if you guys are having trouble
with<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.100> game<00:01:41.250> ending<00:01:41.520> really<00:01:41.729> soon

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
with the game ending really soon

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.990 
with the game ending really soon
domination<00:01:42.630> i<00:01:42.780> recommend<00:01:43.380> taking<00:01:44.280> off<00:01:44.549> be<00:01:44.759> set

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
domination i recommend taking off be set

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.819 
domination i recommend taking off be set
and<00:01:45.119> putting<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.420> lodestar<00:01:45.960> cuz<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.619> lowest

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
and putting on lodestar cuz the lowest

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.530 
and putting on lodestar cuz the lowest
star<00:01:46.979> goes<00:01:47.159> hard<00:01:47.490> i<00:01:47.759> got<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> bunch<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.360> kills

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
star goes hard i got a bunch of kills

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.420 
star goes hard i got a bunch of kills
within<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.899> gameplay<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.560> i<00:01:49.979> started<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
within this gameplay and i started the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.550 
within this gameplay and i started the
dogs<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.759> swarm<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.450> sick<00:01:51.780> setup<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.409> I

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
dogs to swarm it's a sick setup and I

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.359 
dogs to swarm it's a sick setup and I
get<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> shitton<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.759> kills<00:01:54.030> with<00:01:54.180> them<00:01:54.439> but<00:01:55.439> i<00:01:55.710> lo

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
get a shitton I kills with them but i lo

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.010 
get a shitton I kills with them but i lo
lo<00:01:57.060> star<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:58.200> probably<00:01:58.920> better<00:01:59.189> for

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
lo star is probably better for

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.380 
lo star is probably better for
domination<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:01.500> kill<00:02:01.950> confirmed<00:02:02.159> i<00:02:02.790> probably

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
domination but kill confirmed i probably

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.999 
domination but kill confirmed i probably
should<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.689> turned<00:02:03.869> on<00:02:04.140> my<00:02:04.350> v<00:02:04.500> set<00:02:04.770> because

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
should have turned on my v set because

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.429 
should have turned on my v set because
there's<00:02:05.490> no<00:02:05.670> flags<00:02:05.969> obviously<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:07.049> i<00:02:07.079> forgot

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
there's no flags obviously but i forgot

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.510 
there's no flags obviously but i forgot
to<00:02:07.500> do<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.710> and

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
to do that and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.430 
to do that and
I<00:02:08.550> ended<00:02:08.880> up<00:02:08.970> getting<00:02:09.600> a<00:02:09.660> lot<00:02:09.840> more<00:02:09.870> kills<00:02:10.290> than

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
I ended up getting a lot more kills than

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.460 
I ended up getting a lot more kills than
I<00:02:10.860> would<00:02:11.550> have<00:02:11.580> gotten<00:02:11.850> with<00:02:12.270> my<00:02:12.600> V<00:02:12.810> set<00:02:13.050> so

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
I would have gotten with my V set so

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.310 
I would have gotten with my V set so
hopefully<00:02:13.950> guys<00:02:14.070> do<00:02:14.340> enjoy<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:15.540> is<00:02:15.840> probably

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
hopefully guys do enjoy this is probably

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.250 
hopefully guys do enjoy this is probably
the<00:02:16.470> best<00:02:17.010> scorestreak<00:02:17.700> set<00:02:17.910> up<00:02:18.030> for<00:02:18.480> getting

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
the best scorestreak set up for getting

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.530 
the best scorestreak set up for getting
the<00:02:19.500> most<00:02:19.530> kills<00:02:19.950> possible<00:02:20.550> like<00:02:20.760> these<00:02:21.330> are

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
the most kills possible like these are

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.940 
the most kills possible like these are
probably<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.930> best<00:02:22.170> three<00:02:22.380> score<00:02:22.590> streaks

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
probably the best three score streaks

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.700 
probably the best three score streaks
even<00:02:23.310> though<00:02:23.400> they're<00:02:23.580> not<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.820> highest

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
even though they're not the highest

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.440 
even though they're not the highest
lodestar<00:02:25.710> is<00:02:26.040> definitely<00:02:26.730> better<00:02:26.850> than<00:02:27.000> the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
lodestar is definitely better than the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.630 
lodestar is definitely better than the
VTOL<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.650> think<00:02:28.860> there's<00:02:29.070> another<00:02:29.400> one

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
VTOL and I think there's another one

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.240 
VTOL and I think there's another one
that's<00:02:29.970> after<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.600> VTOL<00:02:30.930> between<00:02:31.530> dogs<00:02:32.130> and

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
that's after the VTOL between dogs and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.430 
that's after the VTOL between dogs and
swarm<00:02:32.520> i'm<00:02:32.670> not<00:02:32.790> sure<00:02:33.060> but<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.630> lodestar<00:02:34.260> dog

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
swarm i'm not sure but a lodestar dog

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.750 
swarm i'm not sure but a lodestar dog
and<00:02:34.620> swarm<00:02:34.860> is<00:02:34.980> probably<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.310> best<00:02:35.490> one<00:02:35.700> for

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
and swarm is probably the best one for

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.150 
and swarm is probably the best one for
getting<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.720> most<00:02:36.750> kills<00:02:37.080> possible<00:02:37.620> because

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
getting the most kills possible because

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.560 
getting the most kills possible because
all<00:02:38.400> three<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.670> them<00:02:38.790> go<00:02:38.970> hard<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:39.390> got<00:02:39.540> to

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
all three of them go hard you got to

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.840 
all three of them go hard you got to
make<00:02:39.810> sure<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.290> calling<00:02:40.710> your<00:02:41.250> dogs<00:02:41.550> and

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
make sure that you calling your dogs and

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.130 
make sure that you calling your dogs and
your<00:02:41.940> swarm<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.480> then<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.720> calling<00:02:43.050> your

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
your swarm and then you calling your

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.020 
your swarm and then you calling your
lodestar<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:44.040> way<00:02:44.220> while<00:02:44.730> you're<00:02:44.880> in<00:02:44.970> a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
lodestar so that way while you're in a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.640 
lodestar so that way while you're in a
lodestar<00:02:45.570> your<00:02:45.720> dogs<00:02:45.930> in<00:02:46.110> your<00:02:46.230> swarm<00:02:46.500> will

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
lodestar your dogs in your swarm will

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.140 
lodestar your dogs in your swarm will
also<00:02:46.920> get<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.100> bunch<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.370> kills<00:02:47.580> or<00:02:47.850> you<00:02:48.000> can

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
also get a bunch of kills or you can

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.070 
also get a bunch of kills or you can
space<00:02:48.360> them<00:02:48.510> out<00:02:48.710> and<00:02:49.710> make<00:02:50.220> sure<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:51.390> you

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
space them out and make sure that you

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.810 
space them out and make sure that you
you<00:02:52.380> just<00:02:52.560> don't<00:02:52.860> want<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.070> overlap<00:02:53.520> your

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
you just don't want to overlap your

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.880 
you just don't want to overlap your
lodestar<00:02:54.750> while<00:02:55.020> you're<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.380> lodestar

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
lodestar while you're in a lodestar

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.380 
lodestar while you're in a lodestar
because<00:02:56.490> I<00:02:56.520> don't<00:02:56.670> think<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.940> can<00:02:57.090> get<00:02:57.360> a

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
because I don't think you can get a

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.330 
because I don't think you can get a
lodestar<00:02:57.990> with<00:02:58.230> your<00:02:58.350> own<00:02:58.470> lodestar<00:02:59.010> which<00:02:59.190> is

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
lodestar with your own lodestar which is

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.520 
lodestar with your own lodestar which is
weird<00:02:59.750> but<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.900> just<00:03:01.020> want<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.260> make<00:03:01.320> sure<00:03:01.380> you

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
weird but you just want to make sure you

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.730 
weird but you just want to make sure you
don't<00:03:01.590> overlap<00:03:02.060> but<00:03:03.060> anyways<00:03:03.680> hopefully<00:03:04.680> you

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
don't overlap but anyways hopefully you

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.560 
don't overlap but anyways hopefully you
guys<00:03:04.830> do<00:03:05.310> enjoy<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.790> quality<00:03:06.000> of<00:03:06.210> this<00:03:06.420> video

section<00:03:10.770> below<00:03:10.860> I<00:03:11.010> think<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.370> looks<00:03:11.520> pretty

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
section below I think it looks pretty

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.210 
section below I think it looks pretty
good<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:12.060> think<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.600> took<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:12.990> from<00:03:13.290> Pacific<00:03:14.100> to

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
good I think I took it from Pacific to

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.560 
good I think I took it from Pacific to
when<00:03:14.340> we<00:03:14.430> made<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.610> video<00:03:14.850> about<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.360> I

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
when we made a video about it and I

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.270 
when we made a video about it and I
tried<00:03:15.990> putting<00:03:16.140> on<00:03:16.320> his<00:03:16.410> settings<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.890> don't

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
tried putting on his settings I don't

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.860 
tried putting on his settings I don't
think<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.490> looks<00:03:17.610> really<00:03:17.730> good<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.690> color

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
think it looks really good the color

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.940 
think it looks really good the color
correction<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:19.350> really<00:03:19.560> good<00:03:19.709> in<00:03:19.830> the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
correction is really good in the

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.250 
correction is really good in the
brightness<00:03:20.400> settings<00:03:21.209> looks<00:03:21.600> pretty<00:03:22.140> sweet

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
brightness settings looks pretty sweet

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.500 
brightness settings looks pretty sweet
so<00:03:22.890> let<00:03:23.220> me<00:03:23.250> know<00:03:23.340> your<00:03:23.640> thoughts<00:03:23.670> on<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.180> and

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
also you can make it 1080p if you want i

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.590 
also you can make it 1080p if you want i
got<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.230> elgato<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.070> it's<00:03:29.700> ready<00:03:29.970> for<00:03:30.090> 1080p

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
got the elgato and it's ready for 1080p

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.030 
got the elgato and it's ready for 1080p
if<00:03:31.050> you<00:03:31.140> guys<00:03:31.260> want<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.530> watch<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:31.800> that<00:03:31.920> if

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
if you guys want to watch in that if

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.510 
if you guys want to watch in that if
your<00:03:32.160> internet<00:03:32.520> can<00:03:32.700> handle<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:34.280> but<00:03:35.280> also

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
your internet can handle it but also

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.070 
your internet can handle it but also
another<00:03:35.880> thing<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.150> want<00:03:36.270> to<00:03:36.300> say<00:03:36.360> is<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.780> i

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
another thing I want to say is that i

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.540 
another thing I want to say is that i
was<00:03:37.320> using<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:38.130> PDW<00:03:38.730> with<00:03:39.060> sound<00:03:39.750> sir<00:03:39.990> and

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
was using the PDW with sound sir and

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.980 
was using the PDW with sound sir and
laser<00:03:41.550> sight<00:03:41.910> instead<00:03:42.300> of<00:03:42.390> sound<00:03:42.570> sent<00:03:42.780> grip

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
laser sight instead of sound sent grip

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.080 
laser sight instead of sound sent grip
which<00:03:43.170> i<00:03:43.260> normally<00:03:43.320> use<00:03:43.620> because<00:03:44.400> recently<00:03:45.000> I

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
which i normally use because recently I

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.090 
which i normally use because recently I
figured<00:03:45.450> out<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:45.600> grip<00:03:46.350> actually<00:03:46.830> doesn't

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
figured out that grip actually doesn't

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.980 
figured out that grip actually doesn't
really<00:03:47.220> help<00:03:47.459> apparently<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.600> doesn't<00:03:48.750> really

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
really help apparently it doesn't really

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.790 
really help apparently it doesn't really
help<00:03:49.230> because<00:03:50.300> drifter<00:03:51.320> you<00:03:52.320> guys<00:03:52.440> might<00:03:52.680> know

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
help because drifter you guys might know

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.760 
help because drifter you guys might know
drifter<00:03:53.459> he<00:03:54.360> made<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.720> video<00:03:54.930> about<00:03:55.050> grip<00:03:55.440> and

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
drifter he made a video about grip and

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.650 
drifter he made a video about grip and
how<00:03:56.010> it's<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.370> guess<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:57.000> placebo<00:03:57.630> effect

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
how it's a I guess the placebo effect

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.690 
how it's a I guess the placebo effect
sort<00:03:58.230> of<00:03:58.380> something<00:03:58.920> like<00:03:58.980> that<00:03:59.160> how<00:03:59.370> grip

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
sort of something like that how grip

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.070 
sort of something like that how grip
doesn't<00:04:00.000> actually<00:04:00.120> affect<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:00.570> weapons<00:04:00.870> some

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
doesn't actually affect the weapons some

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.360 
doesn't actually affect the weapons some
of<00:04:01.200> them<00:04:01.380> some<00:04:01.709> of<00:04:01.770> the<00:04:01.980> weapons<00:04:02.130> that

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
of them some of the weapons that

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.550 
of them some of the weapons that
actually<00:04:02.730> hurts<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:03.150> so<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:03.720> really<00:04:04.320> don't<00:04:04.440> know

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
actually hurts it so I really don't know

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.920 
actually hurts it so I really don't know
what<00:04:04.830> to<00:04:04.860> use<00:04:05.160> grip<00:04:05.489> on<00:04:05.670> I<00:04:05.970> don't<00:04:06.570> want<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.780> use

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
what to use grip on I don't want to use

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.300 
what to use grip on I don't want to use
it<00:04:07.080> cuz<00:04:07.200> i'm<00:04:07.290> not<00:04:07.470> sure<00:04:07.709> if<00:04:07.890> it<00:04:08.010> hurts<00:04:08.190> my

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
it cuz i'm not sure if it hurts my

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.610 
it cuz i'm not sure if it hurts my
weapon<00:04:08.610> or<00:04:08.730> not<00:04:08.880> so<00:04:09.270> let<00:04:10.020> me<00:04:10.050> know<00:04:10.260> if<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:10.500> guys

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
weapon or not so let me know if you guys

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.010 
weapon or not so let me know if you guys
have<00:04:11.040> any<00:04:11.160> idea<00:04:11.790> what's<00:04:12.390> going<00:04:12.660> on<00:04:12.780> with<00:04:12.900> the

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
have any idea what's going on with the

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.479 
have any idea what's going on with the
grip<00:04:13.260> because<00:04:13.470> i<00:04:13.770> know<00:04:13.860> it's<00:04:14.100> supposed<00:04:14.250> to

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
grip because i know it's supposed to

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:15.920 
grip because i know it's supposed to
help<00:04:14.610> the<00:04:14.790> recoil<00:04:15.180> but<00:04:15.390> apparently<00:04:15.840> it

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
help the recoil but apparently it

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.780 
help the recoil but apparently it
doesn't<00:04:16.140> so<00:04:16.680> that's<00:04:16.830> why<00:04:16.979> i<00:04:17.010> stopped<00:04:17.370> using<00:04:17.549> it

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
doesn't so that's why i stopped using it

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.849 
doesn't so that's why i stopped using it
and<00:04:18.030> i<00:04:18.299> actually<00:04:18.660> didn't<00:04:18.870> see<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.380> big

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
and i actually didn't see a big

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.080 
and i actually didn't see a big
difference<00:04:19.979> between<00:04:20.310> grip<00:04:20.850> and

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
difference between grip and

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.360 
difference between grip and
grip<00:04:21.419> so<00:04:21.959> I<00:04:21.989> definitely<00:04:22.830> like<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.130> laser

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
grip so I definitely like the laser

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.490 
grip so I definitely like the laser
sight<00:04:23.669> ins<00:04:23.850> sounds<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:24.840> set<00:04:25.020> up<00:04:25.110> with<00:04:25.199> a<00:04:25.260> PDW

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
sight ins sounds to set up with a PDW

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.740 
sight ins sounds to set up with a PDW
but<00:04:26.340> I<00:04:26.639> don't<00:04:26.940> know<00:04:27.000> if<00:04:27.090> this<00:04:27.210> habit<00:04:27.540> this

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
but I don't know if this habit this

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.659 
but I don't know if this habit this
happens<00:04:28.410> to<00:04:28.560> you<00:04:28.620> guys<00:04:28.770> but<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.250> laser<00:04:29.430> sight

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
happens to you guys but the laser sight

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.879 
happens to you guys but the laser sight
sometimes<00:04:30.120> doesn't<00:04:30.510> work<00:04:30.540> which<00:04:31.139> I<00:04:31.290> hate<00:04:31.500> cuz

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
sometimes doesn't work which I hate cuz

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.800 
sometimes doesn't work which I hate cuz
like<00:04:32.100> sometimes<00:04:33.000> it<00:04:33.180> works<00:04:33.330> sometimes<00:04:33.419> it

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
like sometimes it works sometimes it

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.270 
like sometimes it works sometimes it
doesn't<00:04:33.870> so<00:04:34.290> I<00:04:34.320> don't<00:04:34.530> know<00:04:34.620> when<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:34.979> use<00:04:35.130> it

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
doesn't so I don't know when to use it

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.680 
doesn't so I don't know when to use it
yourself<00:04:35.370> stuff<00:04:35.970> like<00:04:36.090> that<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.270> I<00:04:36.540> don't

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
yourself stuff like that and I don't

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.540 
yourself stuff like that and I don't
know<00:04:36.780> what<00:04:37.050> makes<00:04:37.290> it<00:04:37.410> stopped<00:04:37.949> working<00:04:38.130> but

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
know what makes it stopped working but

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.040 
know what makes it stopped working but
laser<00:04:38.850> sight<00:04:39.150> is<00:04:39.240> good<00:04:39.449> when<00:04:39.630> it's<00:04:39.810> actually

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
laser sight is good when it's actually

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.080 
laser sight is good when it's actually
working<00:04:40.440> because<00:04:41.370> a<00:04:41.400> lot<00:04:41.610> of<00:04:41.669> times<00:04:41.910> it

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
working because a lot of times it

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.939 
working because a lot of times it
doesn't<00:04:42.240> actually<00:04:42.479> show<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.900> laser<00:04:43.260> which<00:04:43.800> is

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
doesn't actually show the laser which is

the<00:04:55.530> gameplay<00:04:55.740> I<00:04:56.360> once<00:04:57.360> again<00:04:57.510> i<00:04:57.720> was<00:04:57.870> using

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
the gameplay I once again i was using

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.629 
the gameplay I once again i was using
the<00:04:58.229> lodestar<00:04:58.680> doc<00:04:58.919> and<00:04:59.100> so<00:04:59.220> on<00:04:59.310> which<00:04:59.430> i<00:04:59.580> do

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
the lodestar doc and so on which i do

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.270 
the lodestar doc and so on which i do
think<00:05:00.000> is<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.389> best<00:05:00.630> score<00:05:01.560> streak<00:05:01.800> set<00:05:02.040> up<00:05:02.130> in

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
think is the best score streak set up in

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.830 
think is the best score streak set up in
this<00:05:02.430> game<00:05:02.639> forgetting<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.450> most<00:05:03.570> kills

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
this game forgetting the most kills

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.110 
this game forgetting the most kills
possible<00:05:04.380> but<00:05:04.889> if<00:05:05.040> you<00:05:05.130> guys<00:05:05.220> do<00:05:05.520> wanna<00:05:05.850> rock
