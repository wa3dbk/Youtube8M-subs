00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
basically done the glitch correctly and

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.660 
basically done the glitch correctly and
the<00:01:10.500> glitch<00:01:10.680> basically<00:01:11.070> allows<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.520> walk

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the glitch basically allows you to walk

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.429 
the glitch basically allows you to walk
through<00:01:11.729> any<00:01:12.119> door<00:01:12.390> which<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.840> actually<00:01:13.110> only

through any door which is actually only
active<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.799> purgatory<00:01:14.220> mode<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:15.119> door<00:01:15.270> won't

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
active in purgatory mode the door won't

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.090 
active in purgatory mode the door won't
even<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:15.720> there<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.200> kind<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.650> beyond<00:01:16.830> like

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
even be there it is kind of beyond like

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.249

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
simply walk in there um now your friends

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.820 
simply walk in there um now your friends
if<00:01:21.600> they<00:01:21.780> are<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.140> game<00:01:22.290> they<00:01:22.470> do<00:01:22.530> not<00:01:22.710> do

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
if they are in the game they do not do

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.870 
if they are in the game they do not do
it<00:01:22.860> because<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.310> not<00:01:23.400> done<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> glitch

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
it because they have not done the glitch

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.640 
it because they have not done the glitch
and<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.180> zombies<00:01:24.960> will<00:01:25.110> still<00:01:25.259> pile<00:01:25.439> up<00:01:25.619> like

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
want to do this at the very beginning of

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.140 
want to do this at the very beginning of
the<00:01:40.619> game<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.549> would<00:01:41.640> work<00:01:41.790> for<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.060> as

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the game and it would work for you as

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.789 
the game and it would work for you as
long<00:01:42.329> as<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.540> don't<00:01:42.630> go<00:01:42.810> down<00:01:42.840> because<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
long as you don't go down because you

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.350 
long as you don't go down because you
just<00:01:44.040> go<00:01:44.159> back<00:01:44.310> down<00:01:44.340> into<00:01:44.729> purgatory<00:01:44.939> mode

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
just go back down into purgatory mode

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.420 
just go back down into purgatory mode
the<00:01:45.600> doors<00:01:45.750> will<00:01:45.899> reset<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.439> they'll<00:01:47.250> all

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the doors will reset and they'll all

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.069 
the doors will reset and they'll all
close<00:01:47.700> again<00:01:47.939> now<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.450> see<00:01:48.570> here<00:01:48.780> that

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
close again now you can see here that

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.620 
close again now you can see here that
this<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.470> doorway<00:01:49.700> which<00:01:50.700> would<00:01:51.119> activate

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
this is a doorway which would activate

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.719 
this is a doorway which would activate
the<00:01:51.689> door<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.590> unlock<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.009> double<00:01:53.250> points<00:01:53.579> and

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the door to unlock the double points and

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.580 
the door to unlock the double points and
it<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.270> only<00:01:54.360> purgatory<00:01:54.630> only<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.380> see

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
it is only purgatory only but you see

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.830 
it is only purgatory only but you see
there's<00:01:55.740> no<00:01:55.860> door<00:01:56.100> even<00:01:56.430> there<00:01:56.759> but<00:01:57.210> when<00:01:57.360> my

actual barrier for him and the zombies
lows<00:02:03.420> pile<00:02:03.630> up<00:02:03.810> now<00:02:04.259> it's<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.469> really<00:02:04.590> cool

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
lows pile up now it's a really cool

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.080 
lows pile up now it's a really cool
glitch<00:02:04.950> guys<00:02:05.159> might<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.369> please<00:02:05.520> ask<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.000> guys

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
glitch guys might I please ask you guys

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.520 
glitch guys might I please ask you guys
not<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.479> exploit<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.290> reason<00:02:07.469> I'm

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
not to exploit it the reason I'm

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.600 
not to exploit it the reason I'm
uploading<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.099> because<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.399> think<00:02:08.489> it

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
uploading this is because I think it

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.499 
uploading this is because I think it
would<00:02:08.700> be<00:02:08.759> useful<00:02:08.879> for<00:02:09.119> going<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
would be useful for going to the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.760 
would be useful for going to the
bathroom<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:09.869> stuff<00:02:10.050> like<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.289> or<00:02:10.530> going

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
bathroom and stuff like that or going

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.440 
bathroom and stuff like that or going
away<00:02:10.920> from<00:02:11.099> your<00:02:11.250> controller<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.360> that

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
away from your controller and so that

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.830 
away from your controller and so that
trailer<00:02:12.720> can<00:02:12.900> actually<00:02:13.170> see

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
trailer can actually see

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.180 
trailer can actually see
and<00:02:14.050> they<00:02:14.170> can<00:02:14.319> kind<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.500> patch<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.830> faster

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
and they can kind of patch it faster

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.820 
and they can kind of patch it faster
because<00:02:15.730> glitching<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:17.170> used<00:02:17.349> to<00:02:17.440> be<00:02:17.500> fun<00:02:17.680> to

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
because glitching it used to be fun to

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.229 
because glitching it used to be fun to
exploit<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.280> leaderboards<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:18.790> stuff<00:02:19.060> but<00:02:19.180> I

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
exploit the leaderboards and stuff but I

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.360 
exploit the leaderboards and stuff but I
think<00:02:19.270> now<00:02:19.569> these<00:02:20.080> maps<00:02:20.349> are<00:02:20.590> much<00:02:20.920> more<00:02:21.130> fun

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
think now these maps are much more fun

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.699 
think now these maps are much more fun

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
than normal for three maps and does

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:24.210 
than normal for three maps and does
everything<00:02:23.980> like<00:02:24.069> that

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
everything like that

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.350 
everything like that
I<00:02:24.370> know<00:02:24.430> zombies<00:02:24.760> wearing<00:02:25.090> mine<00:02:25.209> were<00:02:25.300> for

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
I know zombies wearing mine were for

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.210 
I know zombies wearing mine were for
three<00:02:25.660> but<00:02:26.200> mine<00:02:26.410> were<00:02:26.560> for<00:02:26.590> three<00:02:26.830> was<00:02:26.950> fun<00:02:27.130> to
