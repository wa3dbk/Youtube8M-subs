make your own play Matt back up a little

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.570 
make your own play Matt back up a little
bit<00:00:16.139> show<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.350> guys<00:00:16.560> how<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:16.920> do<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.310> basically

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
bit show you guys how I do it basically

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.500 
bit show you guys how I do it basically
start<00:00:18.180> off<00:00:18.300> with<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.600> blank<00:00:18.810> white<00:00:19.020> Matt<00:00:19.230> and

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
start off with the blank white Matt and

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.450 
start off with the blank white Matt and
you<00:00:21.510> take<00:00:22.199> colored<00:00:22.800> pencils<00:00:23.359> a<00:00:24.980> little<00:00:25.980> tip<00:00:26.220> it

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
you take colored pencils a little tip it

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.910 
you take colored pencils a little tip it
works<00:00:26.760> nicer<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.570> use<00:00:27.869> watercolor<00:00:28.470> pencils

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
works nicer to use watercolor pencils

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.769 
works nicer to use watercolor pencils
because<00:00:29.310> then<00:00:29.490> when<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.880> put<00:00:30.210> water<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:30.630> it

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
because then when you put water on it

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.810 
because then when you put water on it
the<00:00:31.109> color<00:00:31.679> will<00:00:31.890> fade<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.489> you'll<00:00:32.610> have<00:00:32.730> to

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
the color will fade and you'll have to

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.950 
the color will fade and you'll have to
worry<00:00:32.940> about<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.239> popping<00:00:33.570> through<00:00:35.960> but

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
worry about it popping through but

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.950 
worry about it popping through but
because<00:00:37.550> I<00:00:38.550> cannot<00:00:39.180> find<00:00:39.360> mine<00:00:39.600> I'm<00:00:39.780> using

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
because I cannot find mine I'm using

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.819 
because I cannot find mine I'm using
regular<00:00:40.200> oil<00:00:40.410> pencils<00:00:41.180> it's<00:00:42.230> really<00:00:43.230> really

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
I didn't have to do any planning but if

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.160 
I didn't have to do any planning but if
you<00:01:03.030> guys<00:01:03.210> were<00:01:03.329> going<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> do<00:01:03.660> your<00:01:03.780> own<00:01:03.899> I

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170

you guys were going to do your own I
would<00:01:04.379> highly<00:01:04.680> suggest<00:01:04.710> sketching<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.430> out<00:01:05.460> on

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
would highly suggest sketching it out on

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.789 
would highly suggest sketching it out on
a<00:01:05.610> piece<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.760> paper<00:01:05.909> first<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.540> make<00:01:07.409> sure

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
a piece of paper first and make sure

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.120 
a piece of paper first and make sure
that<00:01:08.490> it's<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.390> right<00:01:09.590> ratio<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.650> how<00:01:10.860> big<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
that it's the right ratio to how big the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
that it's the right ratio to how big the
thing<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.520> because<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.790> don't<00:01:11.939> want<00:01:12.060> to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
thing is because you don't want to

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
out you're missing like to three inches

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.920 
out you're missing like to three inches
of<00:01:16.470> what<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> picture<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.100> supposed<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.930> so

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
of what the picture is supposed to be so

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.469 
of what the picture is supposed to be so
after<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.380> get<00:01:19.920> your<00:01:20.070> sketch<00:01:20.280> down<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:21.270> can

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
after you get your sketch down you can

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.330 
after you get your sketch down you can
start<00:01:21.750> painting<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.320> always<00:01:22.710> start<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:23.130> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
start painting I always start with a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.700 
start painting I always start with a
wash<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.270> background<00:01:24.720> which<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.560> why

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
wash for the background which is why

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.719 
wash for the background which is why
this<00:01:25.770> looks<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.729> kind<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.500> not<00:01:28.500> smooth<00:01:29.280> it's

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
this looks so kind of not smooth it's

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.700 
this looks so kind of not smooth it's
because<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.450> literally<00:01:30.780> acrylic<00:01:31.470> paint

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
because it's literally acrylic paint

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.719 
because it's literally acrylic paint
wash<00:01:32.009> down<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:33.380> like<00:01:34.380> nothing<00:01:34.650> with<00:01:35.130> water<00:01:35.369> and

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
wash down to like nothing with water and

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.149 
wash down to like nothing with water and
I<00:01:36.060> take<00:01:37.310> big<00:01:38.310> brush<00:01:38.549> that's<00:01:39.090> 2<00:01:39.479> inches<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.159> you

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
I take big brush that's 2 inches and you

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.429 
I take big brush that's 2 inches and you
just<00:01:41.369> start<00:01:41.640> applying<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.930> takes<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.259> long

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
just start applying and it takes a long

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.770 
just start applying and it takes a long
time<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:45.000> has<00:01:45.149> been<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.450> here<00:01:45.720> for

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
time and like this has been on here for

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.139 
time and like this has been on here for
about<00:01:46.170> 30<00:01:46.649> minutes<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.430> see<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.799> touch<00:01:49.799> it

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
about 30 minutes and see if I touch it

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.539 
about 30 minutes and see if I touch it
completely<00:01:51.149> wet<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.979> first<00:01:53.189> step<00:01:53.399> I

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
completely wet so the first step I

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.830 
completely wet so the first step I
always<00:01:53.759> do<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.149> do<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.360> background<00:01:54.509> like

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
always do is I do the background like

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.170 
always do is I do the background like
that<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.290> then<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.189> leave<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.460> till<00:01:57.030> it's

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
that and then I leave it till it's

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.719 
that and then I leave it till it's
completely<00:01:57.570> dry<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.020> touch

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
completely dry to the touch

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.730 
completely dry to the touch
then<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.820> take<00:02:00.030> white<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.719> go<00:02:00.899> over<00:02:01.320> where

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
then I take white and I go over where

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
little helpful hints be sure you have a

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.190 
little helpful hints be sure you have a
surface<00:04:38.370> that<00:04:38.400> you're<00:04:38.910> okay<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.600> go<00:04:39.840> over<00:04:39.870> on

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.990 
drawing boards
I<00:04:44.810> used<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:46.340> some<00:04:47.340> of<00:04:47.430> them<00:04:47.550> come<00:04:47.730> with<00:04:47.760> these

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
I used to some of them come with these

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.150 
I used to some of them come with these
little<00:04:48.240> clips<00:04:48.600> don't<00:04:49.140> do<00:04:49.350> that<00:04:49.530> because<00:04:49.740> then

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
little clips don't do that because then

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.010 
little clips don't do that because then
you'll<00:04:50.340> indent<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:50.970> mat<00:04:51.150> and<00:04:51.510> you'll<00:04:51.810> just

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
you'll indent the mat and you'll just

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.780 
you'll indent the mat and you'll just
damage<00:04:52.320> it<00:04:52.500> and<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:53.130> mat<00:04:53.310> has<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.550> rubber

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
damage it and the mat has a rubber

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.140 
damage it and the mat has a rubber
surface<00:04:54.180> anyway<00:04:54.480> so<00:04:54.540> it<00:04:54.870> won't<00:04:55.020> slide<00:04:56.150> other

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
surface anyway so it won't slide other

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.330 
surface anyway so it won't slide other
than<00:04:57.390> that<00:04:57.570> that's<00:04:58.410> just<00:04:58.770> how<00:04:58.920> to<00:04:58.980> get<00:04:59.160> started
