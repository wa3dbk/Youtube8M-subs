have<00:05:32.420> an<00:05:32.510> app<00:05:32.720> to<00:05:32.960> go<00:05:33.140> with<00:05:33.320> it<00:05:33.350> to<00:05:33.710> you<00:05:33.860> can<00:05:34.010> see

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
have an app to go with it to you can see

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.100 
have an app to go with it to you can see
and<00:05:34.550> that's<00:05:35.300> just<00:05:35.420> I<00:05:35.600> mean<00:05:35.630> some<00:05:35.930> of<00:05:36.050> the

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
said it's all about the watches for some

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.520 
said it's all about the watches for some
reason<00:05:41.180> it's<00:05:41.690> all<00:05:41.840> about<00:05:42.020> who's<00:05:42.230> going<00:05:42.380> to<00:05:42.440> be

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530

first<00:05:42.560> on<00:05:42.890> your<00:05:43.070> wrist<00:05:43.280> basically<00:05:44.620> so<00:05:45.620> steam

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
first on your wrist basically so steam

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.740 
first on your wrist basically so steam
actually<00:05:46.580> made<00:05:46.730> an<00:05:46.850> appearance<00:05:47.090> as<00:05:47.360> well<00:05:47.390> you

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
actually made an appearance as well you

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.120 
actually made an appearance as well you
can<00:05:47.810> see<00:05:47.990> here<00:05:48.140> why<00:05:48.260> the<00:05:48.290> steam<00:05:48.650> machines<00:05:48.980> they

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
can see here why the steam machines they

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.530 
can see here why the steam machines they
actually<00:05:49.370> have<00:05:49.490> further<00:05:49.790> their<00:05:50.120> advertising

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
actually have further their advertising

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.110 
actually have further their advertising
for<00:05:50.750> their<00:05:50.840> new<00:05:50.960> steam<00:05:51.320> OS<00:05:51.560> they<00:05:52.520> had<00:05:52.670> multiple

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
for their new steam OS they had multiple

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.400 
for their new steam OS they had multiple
different<00:05:53.240> things<00:05:53.570> also<00:05:53.780> at<00:05:53.930> here<00:05:54.110> like<00:05:54.260> you

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
different things also at here like you

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.200 
different things also at here like you
can<00:05:54.560> see<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:54.950> key<00:05:55.550> are<00:05:55.760> the<00:05:55.940> actual

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
can see the key are the actual

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.970 
can see the key are the actual
controller<00:05:56.780> that<00:05:57.380> they're<00:05:57.500> planning<00:05:57.830> to<00:05:57.890> use

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
controller that they're planning to use

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.830 
controller that they're planning to use
force<00:05:58.220> concept<00:05:58.730> goes<00:05:58.940> and<00:05:59.210> it<00:05:59.300> actually<00:05:59.480> look

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
force concept goes and it actually look

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.210 
force concept goes and it actually look
pretty<00:05:59.870> good<00:06:00.140> I<00:06:00.290> mean<00:06:00.530> it<00:06:00.650> felt<00:06:00.770> like<00:06:00.950> a<00:06:00.980> dummy

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
pretty good I mean it felt like a dummy

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.490 
pretty good I mean it felt like a dummy
model<00:06:01.490> but<00:06:02.090> you<00:06:02.420> can<00:06:02.540> also<00:06:02.690> see<00:06:03.110> that<00:06:03.140> we<00:06:03.290> have

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
model but you can also see that we have

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.380 
model but you can also see that we have
the<00:06:03.770> multiple<00:06:04.610> different<00:06:04.730> machines<00:06:05.240> that

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
the multiple different machines that

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.390 
the multiple different machines that
they<00:06:05.510> were<00:06:05.570> probably<00:06:05.810> trying<00:06:06.110> to<00:06:06.230> do<00:06:06.740> either

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
they were probably trying to do either

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.210 
they were probably trying to do either
like<00:06:08.120> a<00:06:08.150> small<00:06:08.690> slim<00:06:08.990> design<00:06:09.170> or<00:06:09.560> a<00:06:09.590> big<00:06:09.830> design

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
like a small slim design or a big design

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.860 
like a small slim design or a big design
or<00:06:10.640> you<00:06:11.120> see<00:06:11.270> that<00:06:11.420> all<00:06:11.510> the<00:06:11.600> different

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
or you see that all the different

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.480 
or you see that all the different
capabilities<00:06:12.290> when<00:06:12.770> you<00:06:12.860> also<00:06:13.040> see<00:06:13.190> things

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
capabilities when you also see things

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:14.980 
capabilities when you also see things
like<00:06:13.550> the<00:06:13.730> ticky<00:06:13.970> computer<00:06:14.540> that<00:06:14.690> was<00:06:14.840> out

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
like the ticky computer that was out

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.290 
like the ticky computer that was out
there<00:06:15.200> that<00:06:16.070> would<00:06:16.370> have<00:06:16.700> already<00:06:16.880> been<00:06:17.120> out

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
there that would have already been out

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.490 
there that would have already been out
in<00:06:17.450> existence<00:06:17.870> that<00:06:17.930> they<00:06:18.080> efficiently

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
in existence that they efficiently

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.620 
in existence that they efficiently
modify<00:06:18.890> with<00:06:19.100> steamos<00:06:19.490> so<00:06:19.880> it<00:06:20.270> looks<00:06:20.420> pretty

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
modify with steamos so it looks pretty

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.810 
modify with steamos so it looks pretty
promising<00:06:21.400> another<00:06:22.400> thing<00:06:22.520> that<00:06:22.580> they<00:06:22.730> were

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
promising another thing that they were

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.580 
promising another thing that they were
also<00:06:22.970> doing<00:06:23.210> was<00:06:23.480> accessories<00:06:24.200> accessories

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
also doing was accessories accessories
