that<00:00:44.430> something<00:00:44.879> seems<00:00:45.210> missing<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.559> reason

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
that something seems missing the reason

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
out I took him out earlier and I've

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.970 
out I took him out earlier and I've
always<00:00:51.840> had<00:00:52.079> him<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.350> display

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
always had him on display

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.610

without<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.910> sheet<00:00:54.239> now<00:00:55.200> that<00:00:55.380> I've<00:00:55.500> opened

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
without the sheet now that I've opened

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.979 
without the sheet now that I've opened
up<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.950> evolution<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.700> evil<00:00:57.120> 2-pack<00:00:57.750> I

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
up the evolution of evil 2-pack I

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.990 
up the evolution of evil 2-pack I
probably<00:00:58.230> will<00:00:58.440> keep<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.920> Michael<00:00:59.430> out<00:00:59.670> and

probably will keep that Michael out and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.990 
probably will keep that Michael out and
then<00:01:00.899> I'll<00:01:01.020> probably<00:01:01.290> put<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.100> sheets<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.670> the

then I'll probably put the sheets on the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.999 
then I'll probably put the sheets on the
other<00:01:03.149> Michael<00:01:03.540> that<00:01:03.690> order<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> Michael

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
that came with this I'll probably put

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.749

all<00:01:12.930> was<00:01:13.110> familiar<00:01:13.380> with<00:01:13.649> the<00:01:14.009> with<00:01:14.700> NECA<00:01:15.000> on

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
all was familiar with the with NECA on

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.020 
all was familiar with the with NECA on
the<00:01:16.110> side<00:01:16.320> there<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.710> get<00:01:16.890> happy<00:01:17.550> Halloween

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the side there we get happy Halloween

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.940 
the side there we get happy Halloween
poster<00:01:18.570> which<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.140> was<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.560> because<00:01:19.740> I

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
poster which I was like because I

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.320 
poster which I was like because I
thought<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.190> was<00:01:20.280> neat<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> blade<00:01:21.030> and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
thought it was neat with the blade and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.600 
thought it was neat with the blade and
then<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.869> idea<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.289> that<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.830> hand<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
then the idea is that the hand and the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.600 
then the idea is that the hand and the
blade<00:01:24.020> transitioned<00:01:25.020> over<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:26.010> shape<00:01:26.490> of

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
blade transitioned over to the shape of

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.660 
blade transitioned over to the shape of
the<00:01:26.700> pumpkin<00:01:27.090> which<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.590> don't<00:01:29.159> know<00:01:29.310> does<00:01:29.520> it

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the pumpkin which I don't know does it

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.950 
the pumpkin which I don't know does it
does<00:01:30.000> everybody<00:01:30.510> know<00:01:30.690> that<00:01:31.280> now<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.340> do<00:01:32.960> says

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
does everybody know that now you do says

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.899 
does everybody know that now you do says

you've<00:05:04.930> seen<00:05:04.990> my<00:05:05.320> evolution<00:05:05.860> of<00:05:05.980> evil<00:05:06.340> set

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
you've seen my evolution of evil set

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.410 
you've seen my evolution of evil set
this<00:05:07.360> is<00:05:07.540> the<00:05:07.570> exact<00:05:07.870> same<00:05:08.050> pumpkin<00:05:08.530> that<00:05:09.430> that

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
this is the exact same pumpkin that that

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.420 
this is the exact same pumpkin that that
came<00:05:10.660> with<00:05:10.810> that<00:05:10.990> set<00:05:11.350> the<00:05:11.770> only<00:05:12.010> difference

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
came with that set the only difference

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.540 
came with that set the only difference
is<00:05:13.230> is<00:05:14.230> even<00:05:14.710> though<00:05:14.890> there's<00:05:15.070> a<00:05:15.130> battery

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
is is even though there's a battery

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.100 
is is even though there's a battery
compartment<00:05:15.880> that<00:05:16.510> you<00:05:16.570> can<00:05:16.750> change<00:05:16.960> the

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
compartment that you can change the

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.310 
compartment that you can change the
battery<00:05:17.620> and<00:05:17.830> there<00:05:18.340> is<00:05:18.370> still<00:05:18.790> the<00:05:18.940> switch

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
battery and there is still the switch

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.760 
battery and there is still the switch
they've<00:05:20.320> disabled<00:05:21.040> the<00:05:21.960> light-up<00:05:22.960> feature<00:05:23.110> on

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
they've disabled the light-up feature on

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.100 
they've disabled the light-up feature on
this<00:05:24.040> pumpkin<00:05:24.490> which<00:05:24.850> I<00:05:25.060> don't<00:05:25.720> know<00:05:25.840> why

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
this pumpkin which I don't know why

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.050 
this pumpkin which I don't know why
because<00:05:26.500> I<00:05:26.710> mean<00:05:26.920> if<00:05:27.040> it's<00:05:27.190> the<00:05:27.310> same<00:05:27.520> pumpkin

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
because I mean if it's the same pumpkin

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.870 
because I mean if it's the same pumpkin
why<00:05:28.330> not<00:05:28.510> just<00:05:28.690> go<00:05:28.900> through<00:05:29.170> the<00:05:29.670> full<00:05:30.670> motion

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
why not just go through the full motion

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.120 
why not just go through the full motion
and<00:05:31.330> release<00:05:32.050> the<00:05:32.350> pumpkin<00:05:32.710> with<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:32.920> same

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
and release the pumpkin with the same

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.400 
and release the pumpkin with the same
light-up<00:05:33.400> feature<00:05:33.520> but<00:05:34.450> they<00:05:34.810> have<00:05:34.960> taken<00:05:35.230> the

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
light-up feature but they have taken the

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.220 
light-up feature but they have taken the
light<00:05:35.590> off<00:05:35.770> light<00:05:36.250> up<00:05:36.460> feature<00:05:36.790> out<00:05:37.150> so<00:05:38.080> all

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
light off light up feature out so all

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.580 
light off light up feature out so all
we're<00:05:38.440> stuck<00:05:38.650> with<00:05:38.800> is<00:05:38.980> the<00:05:39.100> pumpkin<00:05:40.440> he<00:05:41.440> also

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
we're stuck with is the pumpkin he also

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.520 
we're stuck with is the pumpkin he also
comes<00:05:42.010> with<00:05:42.330> his<00:05:44.700> butcher<00:05:45.700> knife<00:05:46.320> which<00:05:47.320> has

comes with his butcher knife which has

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.560 
comes with his butcher knife which has
it<00:05:47.680> which<00:05:48.010> adds<00:05:48.250> a<00:05:48.340> little<00:05:48.520> bit<00:05:48.670> of<00:05:48.760> wear<00:05:49.090> to<00:05:49.390> it

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
it which adds a little bit of wear to it

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.390 
it which adds a little bit of wear to it
which<00:05:50.050> is<00:05:50.200> nice<00:05:50.380> it's<00:05:50.590> not<00:05:50.710> just<00:05:50.950> a<00:05:51.100> straight

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
which is nice it's not just a straight

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.870 
which is nice it's not just a straight
silver<00:05:51.970> blade<00:05:52.860> and<00:05:53.860> then<00:05:54.040> you<00:05:54.160> get<00:05:54.340> the<00:05:54.460> handle

silver blade and then you get the handle

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.020 
silver blade and then you get the handle
there<00:05:55.030> going<00:05:55.330> on<00:05:58.260> put<00:05:59.260> the<00:05:59.350> knife<00:05:59.530> down<00:05:59.560> here

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
off on Michael and it's not much of a

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.570 
off on Michael and it's not much of a
surprise<00:06:05.470> really<00:06:06.070> because<00:06:06.220> I<00:06:06.310> mean<00:06:06.460> you

already know what he looks like

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.020 
already know what he looks like
underneath<00:06:07.830> if<00:06:08.830> you've<00:06:09.010> seen<00:06:09.250> my<00:06:09.400> evolution

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
underneath if you've seen my evolution

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.080 
underneath if you've seen my evolution
of<00:06:10.120> evil<00:06:10.450> set<00:06:10.830> this<00:06:11.830> sheet<00:06:12.310> comes<00:06:12.610> off<00:06:12.820> and

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
then underneath we've got a nice Michael

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
then underneath we've got a nice Michael
Myers<00:06:15.510> as<00:06:16.770> I<00:06:17.770> commented<00:06:18.040> in<00:06:18.460> the<00:06:18.490> evolution<00:06:19.030> of

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
Myers as I commented in the evolution of

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.180 
Myers as I commented in the evolution of
evil<00:06:19.420> the<00:06:19.570> head<00:06:19.930> is<00:06:20.170> a<00:06:20.230> little<00:06:20.710> different<00:06:21.130> on

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
evil the head is a little different on

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.460 
evil the head is a little different on
this<00:06:21.430> Michael<00:06:21.700> that<00:06:22.030> it<00:06:22.150> is<00:06:22.300> then<00:06:22.810> on<00:06:23.050> the

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
this Michael that it is then on the

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.200 
this Michael that it is then on the
evolution<00:06:23.950> of<00:06:24.040> evil<00:06:24.370> the<00:06:24.760> head<00:06:24.940> is<00:06:25.090> a<00:06:25.120> little

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
evolution of evil the head is a little

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.300 
evolution of evil the head is a little
slimmer<00:06:25.870> and<00:06:26.140> it<00:06:26.530> almost<00:06:26.770> doesn't<00:06:26.980> seem<00:06:27.220> to

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
slimmer and it almost doesn't seem to

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.460 
slimmer and it almost doesn't seem to
have<00:06:27.460> as<00:06:27.580> much<00:06:27.700> detail<00:06:27.970> sculpt<00:06:28.810> in<00:06:28.930> the<00:06:29.050> actual

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 
have as much detail sculpt in the actual

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.730 
have as much detail sculpt in the actual
head<00:06:29.800> I<00:06:30.460> think<00:06:30.840> possibly<00:06:31.840> the<00:06:32.200> reason<00:06:32.440> why

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
head I think possibly the reason why

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.950 
head I think possibly the reason why
this<00:06:32.830> is<00:06:32.980> a<00:06:33.160> little<00:06:33.460> more<00:06:33.550> narrow<00:06:33.820> is<00:06:34.180> just<00:06:34.840> to

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
this is a little more narrow is just to

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.490 
this is a little more narrow is just to
accommodate<00:06:35.260> the<00:06:35.710> sheet<00:06:36.040> maybe<00:06:36.910> from<00:06:37.500> maybe

articulation<00:06:45.910> is<00:06:46.060> that<00:06:46.300> there's

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:46.510 
articulation is that there's

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.840 
articulation is that there's

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:48.850 
articulation in the neck the neck does

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.670 
articulation in the neck the neck does
give<00:06:49.060> you<00:06:49.180> a<00:06:49.210> free<00:06:49.750> range<00:06:50.020> of<00:06:50.200> movement

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 
give you a free range of movement

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.590 
give you a free range of movement
there's<00:06:50.910> articulation<00:06:51.910> in<00:06:52.060> the<00:06:52.150> shoulders

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:52.600 
there's articulation in the shoulders

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.620 
there's articulation in the shoulders
there's<00:06:53.500> articulation<00:06:54.310> in<00:06:54.490> the<00:06:54.970> elbow<00:06:55.600> you

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:55.630 
there's articulation in the elbow you

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.430 
there's articulation in the elbow you
get<00:06:55.930> that<00:06:56.140> that<00:06:56.920> kind<00:06:57.280> of<00:06:57.340> GIMP<00:06:58.290> rotation<00:06:59.290> I've

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 
get that that kind of GIMP rotation I've

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.860 
get that that kind of GIMP rotation I've
never<00:07:00.190> liked<00:07:00.490> this<00:07:00.640> rotation<00:07:01.270> I

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
never liked this rotation I

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.120 
never liked this rotation I
would<00:07:02.050> have<00:07:02.110> been<00:07:02.169> nice<00:07:02.380> if<00:07:02.440> it<00:07:02.740> was<00:07:02.860> just<00:07:03.040> a

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.130 
would have been nice if it was just a

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.140 
would have been nice if it was just a
bend<00:07:03.430> at<00:07:03.610> the<00:07:03.639> elbow<00:07:04.300> but<00:07:05.280> no<00:07:06.280> articulation<00:07:07.030> in

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.150 
bend at the elbow but no articulation in

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.090 
bend at the elbow but no articulation in
the<00:07:07.240> waist<00:07:07.449> nothing<00:07:08.320> from<00:07:08.590> the<00:07:08.710> waist<00:07:08.919> down

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.100 
the waist nothing from the waist down

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.060 
the waist nothing from the waist down
there<00:07:09.970> is<00:07:10.150> some<00:07:10.510> slight<00:07:10.780> articulation<00:07:11.680> in<00:07:11.860> the

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.070 
there is some slight articulation in the

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.670 
there is some slight articulation in the
feet<00:07:12.490> but<00:07:13.240> I<00:07:13.300> almost<00:07:13.540> think<00:07:13.900> it<00:07:14.080> stems<00:07:14.500> from

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 
feet but I almost think it stems from

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.590 
feet but I almost think it stems from
the<00:07:14.949> way<00:07:15.070> the<00:07:15.220> figure<00:07:15.490> was<00:07:15.669> assembled<00:07:16.150> and<00:07:16.419> not

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:16.600 
the way the figure was assembled and not

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.390 
the way the figure was assembled and not
so<00:07:16.840> much<00:07:16.990> the<00:07:17.050> fact<00:07:17.440> that<00:07:17.560> they<00:07:17.770> intended<00:07:18.310> on

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
so much the fact that they intended on

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.629 
so much the fact that they intended on
into<00:07:18.790> articulation<00:07:19.889> but<00:07:20.889> there<00:07:21.400> you<00:07:21.520> have

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:21.639 
into articulation but there you have

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:25.530 
into articulation but there you have
Michael<00:07:22.090> a<00:07:23.160> lot<00:07:24.160> a<00:07:24.190> lot<00:07:24.520> of<00:07:24.610> sculpted<00:07:25.120> details

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:25.540 
Michael a lot a lot of sculpted details

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.010 
Michael a lot a lot of sculpted details
put<00:07:25.810> in<00:07:25.960> the<00:07:26.110> costume<00:07:26.530> itself<00:07:26.680> and<00:07:27.660> he<00:07:28.660> does

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.020 
put in the costume itself and he does

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:35.030 
put in the costume itself and he does
also<00:07:29.290> hold<00:07:29.650> his<00:07:30.160> knife<00:07:30.430> very<00:07:30.850> well<00:07:32.010> like<00:07:33.010> that

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:35.040 
also hold his knife very well like that

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.120 
also hold his knife very well like that
so<00:07:36.040> overall<00:07:36.310> I<00:07:36.430> mean<00:07:36.639> it's<00:07:36.790> a<00:07:36.850> nice<00:07:37.000> figure<00:07:38.130> if

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:39.130 
so overall I mean it's a nice figure if

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.340 
so overall I mean it's a nice figure if
you<00:07:39.460> are<00:07:39.639> a<00:07:39.669> collector<00:07:39.940> of<00:07:40.300> the<00:07:40.780> Halloween
