now<00:00:22.320> what<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:22.980> find<00:00:23.310> odd<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.760> whenever<00:00:23.970> you

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
now what I find odd is whenever you

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.710 
now what I find odd is whenever you
record<00:00:24.570> things<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:24.960> them<00:00:25.140> Xbox<00:00:25.920> video<00:00:26.720> the

record things on them Xbox video the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.710 
record things on them Xbox video the

listening<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.739> rebel<00:00:41.070> radio<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.700> for<00:00:41.879> some

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
listening to rebel radio but for some

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.600 
listening to rebel radio but for some
reason<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.420> can't<00:00:42.660> hear<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> music<00:00:43.320> but<00:00:43.610> then

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
reason you can't hear the music but then

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.340 
reason you can't hear the music but then
you<00:00:44.760> do<00:00:45.180> hear<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> interference<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
you do hear the interference so the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.900 
you do hear the interference so the
interference<00:00:46.649> isn't<00:00:47.039> considered<00:00:47.370> music<00:00:47.820> I

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
interference isn't considered music I

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.160 
interference isn't considered music I
guess<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.329> don't<00:00:48.450> know<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:48.750> kind<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.989> weird

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
guess I don't know it's kind of weird

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.529 
guess I don't know it's kind of weird
but<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.250> did<00:00:50.399> make<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> radio<00:00:51.030> turn<00:00:51.300> down

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
but it did make the radio turn down

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.459 
but it did make the radio turn down
whenever<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.930> came<00:00:52.110> on<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.620> um<00:00:54.469> without
