reach every student for the ones they do

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.809 
reach every student for the ones they do
it's<00:02:17.170> worth<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.769> I<00:02:17.980> think<00:02:18.340> because<00:02:18.610> it's

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
it's worth it I think because it's

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.449 
it's worth it I think because it's
coming<00:02:19.030> from<00:02:19.299> them<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:20.140> they're<00:02:20.980> trying<00:02:21.310> to

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
coming from them and they're trying to

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.180 
coming from them and they're trying to
play<00:02:21.850> out<00:02:22.230> scenes<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.470> actually<00:02:23.950> could

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
play out scenes that actually could

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.360 
play out scenes that actually could
happen<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:25.120> think<00:02:26.110> that's<00:02:26.290> why<00:02:26.500> maybe<00:02:27.160> the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
happen I think that's why maybe the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.039 
happen I think that's why maybe the
message<00:02:27.760> gets<00:02:28.030> across<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.360> little<00:02:28.750> bit<00:02:28.870> better

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
message gets across a little bit better

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.930 
message gets across a little bit better
it's<00:02:29.380> just<00:02:29.440> kind<00:02:29.860> of<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:30.010> privilege<00:02:30.519> to<00:02:30.760> get<00:02:30.880> to

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
it's just kind of a privilege to get to

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.580 
it's just kind of a privilege to get to
know<00:02:31.150> that<00:02:31.329> you<00:02:31.450> might<00:02:31.600> have<00:02:31.810> an<00:02:31.930> impact<00:02:32.109> on

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
know that you might have an impact on

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.740 
know that you might have an impact on
somebody's<00:02:33.100> life<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.670> hope<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.090> at<00:02:34.329> least<00:02:34.570> just

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
somebody's life I hope it at least just

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.739 
somebody's life I hope it at least just
helps<00:02:35.019> one<00:02:35.200> or<00:02:35.350> two<00:02:35.500> people
