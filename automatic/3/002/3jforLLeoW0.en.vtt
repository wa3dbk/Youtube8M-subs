dancing needs there's the crank feels
like<00:00:54.600> I'm<00:00:54.690> scratching<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.699> mic<00:00:56.699> no<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
like I'm scratching on the mic no on the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.599 
like I'm scratching on the mic no on the
what<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.649> there's<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.190> shake<00:00:59.399> oh<00:01:01.370> wait<00:01:02.370> there

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
what and there's the shake oh wait there

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.370 
what and there's the shake oh wait there
is<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.760> popular<00:01:03.000> move<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.600> they<00:01:03.719> do<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:04.019> this

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.870 

shake<00:01:07.380> lights<00:01:07.619> are<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:07.979> simple<00:01:08.400> they<00:01:08.790> have

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
shake lights are really simple they have

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.460 
shake lights are really simple they have
a<00:01:08.939> magnet<00:01:09.360> inside<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.869> moves<00:01:10.020> back<00:01:10.290> and

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
a magnet inside that moves back and

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.140 
a magnet inside that moves back and
forth<00:01:10.560> through<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.979> coiled<00:01:11.369> metal<00:01:11.640> wire<00:01:11.880> to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
forth through a coiled metal wire to

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.030 
forth through a coiled metal wire to
generate<00:01:12.510> electricity<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:13.560> crank<00:01:13.830> ones

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
generate electricity the crank ones

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.980 
generate electricity the crank ones
generally<00:01:14.460> aren't<00:01:14.729> as<00:01:14.909> good<00:01:15.090> they<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.869> lot

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
generally aren't as good they have a lot

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.450 
generally aren't as good they have a lot
of<00:01:16.020> moving<00:01:16.290> parts<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.009> they<00:01:17.130> tend<00:01:17.340> to

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
of moving parts and so they tend to

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.550 
of moving parts and so they tend to
break<00:01:17.700> easily<00:01:17.970> see<00:01:18.920> it's<00:01:19.920> broken<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:21.470> give<00:01:22.470> you

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
break easily see it's broken I give you

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.700 
break easily see it's broken I give you
a<00:01:22.590> d-plus<00:01:23.100> because<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.500> didn't<00:01:25.500> try<00:01:25.680> very

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
a d-plus because you didn't try very

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.219 
a d-plus because you didn't try very
hard<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.490> they<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.270> get<00:01:27.360> clogged<00:01:27.689> with<00:01:27.960> dirt

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
hard and they can get clogged with dirt

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.219 
hard and they can get clogged with dirt

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
make the little charger stop working

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.810 
make the little charger stop working

working<00:01:36.030> honestly<00:01:36.780> what<00:01:37.470> did<00:01:37.619> woody<00:01:37.770> call

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
working honestly what did woody call

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.469 
working honestly what did woody call
that<00:01:38.250> some<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.759> these<00:01:38.850> flashlights<00:01:39.329> use

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
that some of these flashlights use

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.910 
that some of these flashlights use
rechargeable<00:01:39.630> batteries<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:40.799> to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
rechargeable batteries so you have to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.499 
rechargeable batteries so you have to
shake<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.189> more<00:01:41.460> wind<00:01:41.729> them<00:01:41.939> every<00:01:42.150> once<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.479> a

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
shake a more wind them every once in a

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.730 
shake a more wind them every once in a
while<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.750> keep<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.020> battery<00:01:43.320> from<00:01:43.470> dying

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
while to keep the battery from dying

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.319 
while to keep the battery from dying
some<00:01:44.159> shake<00:01:44.399> lights<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:44.970> one<00:01:45.149> can<00:01:45.270> be

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
some shake lights like this one can be

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.480 
some shake lights like this one can be
completely<00:01:45.810> self<00:01:46.170> sealed<00:01:46.500> units<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.310> one

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
completely self sealed units this one

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.969 
completely self sealed units this one
floats<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.180> waterproof<00:01:48.509> down<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.979> 2,400

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.520 
floats and it's waterproof down to 2,400
feet<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:51.149> uses<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.450> gold<00:01:51.689> foil<00:01:51.960> capacitor

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
feet and it uses a gold foil capacitor

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.380 
feet and it uses a gold foil capacitor
instead<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.950> battery<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.820> it'll<00:01:54.030> work<00:01:54.180> for

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
instead of a battery so it'll work for

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.120 
instead of a battery so it'll work for
years<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.869> years<00:01:54.930> because<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.560> capacitor

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
years and years because that capacitor

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.700 
years and years because that capacitor
unlike<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> battery<00:01:57.210> won't<00:01:57.540> go<00:01:57.719> bad<00:01:57.960> even<00:01:58.619> if

just<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:13.980> case<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.280> needed<00:02:14.520> most<00:02:15.180> of<00:02:15.360> these
