00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.889
 let's make the recipe really good 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.240
 it takes some time especially for 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.519
 prepare the tomatoes but the result 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.859
 will be really extraordinary here I have gods 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.539
 tomatoes piccadilly enough tomatoes 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.990
 mature and what we do we go to 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.630
 cut in half like this and put one on 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.710
 baking plate so exactly 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.710
 how they are open 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:45.450
 now we're going to dress a little 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:47.700
 of oil a little bit of salt and then a 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.890
 pinch of sugar a teaspoon a 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.150
 maximum of sugar you split up 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.780
 all the promoters but not even one 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.390
 spoon 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.430
 just like that and then I like the pepper 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.010
 white pepper in this case of the first sti 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.730
 you can choose black pepper of your own 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.620
 taste 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.130
 at this point we go into the oven let's go 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.250
 in the oven 140 degrees 150 degrees maximum 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:13.170
 an hour and a half them and a half anyway 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.369
 then we're going to check them these are the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.770
 our tomatoes have now come out 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.860
 from the oven for quite a while you are 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.479
 cool you will see how practically 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.660
 they almost completely lose moisture 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.380
 inside then here or water that 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:31.979
 I put to boil we go to put the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.680
 salt is not there but boil again 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.630
 here I have some beautiful prawns that 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.700
 we have already blossomed we and 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.140
 visceral are already practically ready 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.060
 to cook them but we will not keep them all 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.240
 some of us are going to cut it 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:50.959
 let's do a kind of meanwhile with this 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.959
 pan wants to admit some oil 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:58.890
 accent and I'm going to put a slice 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.259
 of garlic and one I leave whole clove 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.789
 Garlic is because I want it to be 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.539
 flavor well 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.979
 the oil but then I don't want it to end in 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.810
 flat not because I don't like it because of me 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.840
 really like it but because I don't think so 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.840
 I take a little parsley 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:21.230
 I remove the terminal part of the 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:24.439
 change and leave it so coarse that it 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.900
 I'll put garlic together right away 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.329
 meanwhile I take some of the shrimp in it 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.980
 I leave someone I will leave whole 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:40.430
 because it's nice to see these high ones 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:44.719
 arrived practically atriers giving water 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.549
 has boiled and we go to put 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:49.700
 I chose pasta as pasta 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:52.930
 signal about 12 minutes of cooking and 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:58.219
 I do about the portion and little more 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.230
 copra is so boiling resumes I go to 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:04.909
 take some of the parsley that 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:10.549
 we put that by now flavored 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:15.129
 oil well but no need to keep it e 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.129
 let's go put our ganda there 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.340
 I remove the garlic clove that goes to 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.540
 add the tomatoes 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.540
 so it is whole 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:36.319
 here we are at this point 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:39.989
 push that we can put aside 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:43.739
 for a moment our sauce and there 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:47.819
 we dedicate to our internal shrimp neither 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.739
 let's cook a little quickly 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.519
 oil 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:04:04.500
 when we are very hot we go to put 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:04:06.870
 of our gander codes here is the cooking 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.730
 of these shrimps naturally yours 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.010
 taste 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.829
 I don't want you to cook so much because 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:17.519
 otherwise they become the sensation 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:19.829
 almost sandy wad xi anyway 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.239
 are ready for me at this point that 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.550
 what do we do 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:32.130
 we transfer our prawns together 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:34.620
 to the ragÃ¹ with all their I read that 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:40.110
 we take a tablespoon of water of 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.520
 cooking that is rich in starch then between 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.650
 become the most interesting subject 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.650
 nema scolare the pasta 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:54.050
 and let's add the pasta then 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.670
 we finish cooking directly 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.290
 inside his kitten is really 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.450
 very good while the pasta is maintained 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.350
 for good and I'm going to prepare even a 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.350
 little bit of parsley 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:27.220
 let's go add it immediately dust 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:27.220
 with parsley and a trickle of oil 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.370
 enjoy your meal
