00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
 today I 'm going to put some oil 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.050
 first thing I'm going to do is put your 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.050
 Fry the onion 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:17.460
 I'm going to add tomato 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.380
 and yellow paprika 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.210
 if you can not find the yellow you can 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.810
 use green, red , orange 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.550
 Whatever is good 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.090
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.489
 put the lentils the amount needed 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.600
 in water the night before the fast ones are 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.600
 since last night in water 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.239
 and those are the ones I'm going to use and here 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.150
 I have the lentils and to drain them 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.040
 water that had been left in the chain 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.890
 been all night and what I did was 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.530
 give them a quick swim with water and the 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.930
 I have to drain and then put them 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.420
 the evolving 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.800
 I'm going to put the thyme that you already know 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.800
 I am a family fan 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.660
 a clove of garlic 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.120
 remember that is not a rule 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.890
 is what I like so I do them 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.110
 you can put it instead of thyme 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.110
 laurel if you are looking for more laurel 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.270
 do not put peppers and suddenly you 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.390
 hurts 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.579
 If you have irritable colon, it will not fall 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.890
 little squares carrots I'm going 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.540
 to put 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.540
 at this moment I'm going to put water 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.940
 and this water almost that is to the eye 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:56.210
 there is no exact measurement do not worry 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.450
 and I'm going to take the lentils inside the 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.450
 cooking pot 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.940
 I mix a little 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.250
 and now I review the important thing is that the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.420
 water cover the lentils then I'll 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.420
 put a little bit more 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.859
 there it is because during the cooking it 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:27.459
 they are going to dry then it has to have 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.459
 good water 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.769
 also eye because as is the pot 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.840
 express we can not fill it with 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:40.080
 water because soon 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.640
 we have problems finally I'm going to 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.640
 put two tablespoons of salt 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.370
 these are teaspoons do not think they are 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.640
 Large spoons of salt 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.080
 and we are going to take our 2 express 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.080
 make sure you have the rubber on 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.220
 at medium-high heat you will spend so 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.800
 less 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.850
 20 minutes with the express pot 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.620
 running this pot does not pita but that 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.560
 it makes a permanent sound then I 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.780
 I have to calculate the time 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.640
 and they do not know how it is the pot you 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.650
 you have but if you dare to do them 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.750
 more or less calculate the time that you already 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.640
 you know it takes cooking 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.640
 I show you when they are ready 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.580
 and ready, the 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.040
 our cooking lentils and them 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.260
 I took all the air to the pot because it is 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.020
 the first thing to do and now I'm going 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.840
 to open for you to see 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:49.890
 how is the appearance of the lentils 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.550
 and this looks like a soup no 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.550
 look 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:01.189
 there they are already or soup or tea puree 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.439
 I like that they are very soft 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:06.139
 so that's how they are 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:09.109
 perfect for me at the end of cooking 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:12.019
 you must rectify how it tastes 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:14.540
 if you lack salt chile that was very 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.000
 salty and if it is very salty paul and a 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.239
 little milk and if you need salt 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.070
 add it or a little salt stir and 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.570
 try again until the point that 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.300
 you like it 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.780
 thank you very much for watching this video for being 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:33.910
 here we are seeing in a next 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.770
 I hope you're encouraged to do it and 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.100
 I wait for you in social networks 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.100
 blessings chau
