each<00:01:05.309> edge<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:06.510> your<00:01:06.840> pattern<00:01:07.229> after<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.740> cut

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
each edge on your pattern after you cut

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.039 
each edge on your pattern after you cut
it<00:01:08.040> out<00:01:08.210> that<00:01:09.210> way<00:01:09.420> when<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.610> glue<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:12.049> fabric

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
it out that way when you glue the fabric

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.969 
it out that way when you glue the fabric
onto<00:01:14.420> your<00:01:15.420> bag<00:01:15.659> you'll<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.409> enough<00:01:16.740> room<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
to be no sewing which is good I don't

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.130 
to be no sewing which is good I don't
really<00:01:23.340> like<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.820> try<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.240> sew<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.750> your

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
got our pattern cut out and I just

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.109 
got our pattern cut out and I just
traced<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.899> onto<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.290> fabric<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.950> got<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.000> all

traced it onto the fabric and got it all

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.020 
traced it onto the fabric and got it all
done<00:01:51.360> up<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.720> way<00:01:52.490> so<00:01:53.490> what<00:01:53.759> we're<00:01:53.880> going<00:01:53.970> to

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
done up that way so what we're going to

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.530 
done up that way so what we're going to
do<00:01:54.210> after<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:54.840> get<00:01:55.049> our<00:01:55.110> fabric<00:01:55.740> cut<00:01:56.189> out<00:01:56.540> we're

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
do after we get our fabric cut out we're

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.240 
do after we get our fabric cut out we're
going<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.719> take<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.590> best<00:01:58.860> thing<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.070> I

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
going to take and the best thing that I

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.039 
going to take and the best thing that I
have<00:01:59.399> found<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.820> can<00:01:59.969> use<00:02:00.210> fabric<00:02:00.509> glue<00:02:00.719> if

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
have found you can use fabric glue if

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.649 
have found you can use fabric glue if
you<00:02:01.200> would<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.670> but<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:02.969> actually<00:02:03.450> found

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
you would like but I have actually found

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.190 
you would like but I have actually found
that<00:02:03.930> fabric<00:02:04.439> glue<00:02:04.590> yarn<00:02:05.369> does<00:02:06.270> not<00:02:06.659> really

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
that fabric glue yarn does not really

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.130 
that fabric glue yarn does not really
adhere<00:02:08.009> very<00:02:08.039> well<00:02:08.459> together<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.539> use<00:02:09.929> hot

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
adhere very well together so I use hot

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.790 
adhere very well together so I use hot
glue<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.840> will<00:02:12.959> take<00:02:13.140> your

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
glue that you will take your

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.780 
glue that you will take your
fabric<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:15.080> just<00:02:16.080> lay<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.350> out<00:02:16.470> like<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:16.890> on

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
fabric and just lay it out like so on

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.850 
fabric and just lay it out like so on

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.620 
together and I left enough on my corners
on<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.810> front<00:04:29.130> and<00:04:30.130> on<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:30.850> back<00:04:31.000> so<00:04:31.419> that<00:04:31.450> I

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
on the front and on the back so that I

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.090 
on the front and on the back so that I
could<00:04:31.780> sew<00:04:31.960> on<00:04:32.080> my<00:04:32.169> handles<00:04:32.590> when<00:04:32.740> I<00:04:32.770> get<00:04:32.980> to

have you when you hot glue it so you

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.310 
have you when you hot glue it so you
don't<00:04:57.490> if<00:04:58.270> you<00:04:58.419> don't<00:04:58.600> want<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:59.020> use<00:04:59.169> the
