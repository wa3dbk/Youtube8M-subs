00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.079
 the guy he catches digital community 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.579

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.960
 dude told himself mommy morning I'm going to 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.920

 I'm going to catch banon demos 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.000
 banished 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.860
 you gamers in scoot hope you 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 go really well but I'm fine 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.680
 between today for a new 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.060
 video the first episode of a new 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.190
 series that I will present in 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.690
 this video above all I would like you 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.180
 give a little something my little back 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.979
 thought i have that juba ku ya of that 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.540
 a few days a few hours 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:12.280
 weeks more seriously go you go 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.690
 I see you I watch the videos etc at 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.369
 see if it's not something I'm 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.990
 not sure where not worry if the 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.060
 gameplay there before that's normal you 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.350
 not worry was relaxed meant that 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.940
 I wanted to test weapons the phalecca 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.690
 it did not work I took the limit that 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.570
 did not work 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.619
 so here we go I see my videos and 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.270
 then I noticed that I was a lot 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.500
 more serious than before there is at 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.320
 at least three weeks or frankly there 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.369
 you justify to death but video - you 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.350
 if I think you like them in 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.520
 Anyway I hope but here I found 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.040
 that me anyway I have at home 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.810
 I was less - it's a more serious 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.729
 precisely that normal where I had the most 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.680
 peace is a lover xd raoult have fun on 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.729
 background does not take the sweet head and that's 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.110
 a little bit my trademark is so 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.509
 here I think a little bit but 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.500
 transfers to be serious let's say is 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.060
 so luckily I notice 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.530
 now he not later and so me 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.709
 I say to myself now we are going to be 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.330
 even more fun extra - be at the point the 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.160
 like that monotonous even though I was not talking 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.600
 like that are my trips 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.429
 So here I am, if you are 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.470
 safer for comments I am 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.399
 really really like fishing that 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.770
 it roars during fishing 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.539
 I'm counting on you here but 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.890
 otherwise veiled me otherwise and overall 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.720
 everything is fine everything goes well extra 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.690
 you guys are great and then that's it 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.150
 so just friends were 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.280
 series that will normally be called 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.690
 am everything going well but class for 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.550
 to make big carnage a simple trick 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.140
 between full and then you're fine with 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.650
 them with videos simply 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.760
 so when will this happen 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.590
 pass and why 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.060
 already why did you only because 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.590
 I know he did not hurt on strong moder 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.760
 three highlights of xterra black up 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.720
 who was super good and now are 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.670
 so on wood like those who are less 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.349
 well that's what happened to me under 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.520
 sailors by 3 I'm good words with this 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.450
 field we feel they go well 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.680
 but I did that everyone is 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.330
 now I take into account de facto 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.860
 it's still and so I understand 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.480
 not too much so I thought I should play 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.069
 the ease and so I'm going to you 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.360
 present this class the smc and then 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.310
 you're going to see you're going to like it so 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.480
 quite simply 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.130
 and that's going to happen on several 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.280
 episodes how much I have no idea 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.810
 with hello it will be rather snj ar 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.420
 because it's true he can do 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.410
 than 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.599
 make it two good rick guardians at 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.680
 sniper no but here I am 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.700
 think it will help you I think 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.950
 it is a beautiful pleasure and then in any case 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.390
 I hope so this class that is 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.680
 just enormously 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.209
 it must be said it must be said so to 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.290
 return to studio the new map of 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.660
 pack the pricing which is really a 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.250
 superb love above all here is it's 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.239
 perfect good little opportunity it's 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.440
 the perfect opportunity 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.060
 watch out the gameplay not cut in 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.200
 end I like cut in three of 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.670
 the impasse that the gameplay cut in half 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.200
 between yeah so here's gas 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.790
 also I have to think to speak more 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.010
 slowly because it's a thing of phew 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.540
 trick of you guys so this 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.940
 opportunity to talk about the pick up 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.080
 rising just because I knew there 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.280
 have a lot of subscriber friends who 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.140
 followed durmenach do 3 and that I 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.519
 made live discoveries of 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.660
 packs I think finally now I the 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.470
 will do more I go over to nothing because 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.200
 that there are too many youtube hours they 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.610
 do and I say to myself bah if six months 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.190
 do we have my video chat go out after two 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.569
 hours tubes so since here I have a 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.250
 little bit laziness and xterra do not eat 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.650
 no where or when was it then we get 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.640
 said everything so we also said all that 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.519
 done three times I'm doing this video 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.480
 because there were a lot of problems 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.069
 watch and have not left recognized 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.920
 second time more battery in 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.079
 this fucking iphone becomes wok 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.269
 so we guys are going to calm down to 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.700
 calm down so here I go more 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.750
 live discovery of dlc because he 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.709
 there are too many players who make me I'm 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.669
 say if you look at youtube 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.109
 hours you have not looked at mine 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.789
 so it's really useless so here we go 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.109
 so this class that is just whew that 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.560
 play any future of a cupboard must I 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.289
 I am hurrying 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.370
 mc otherwise this fast chariot was dashing for 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.780
 to be one of the turns are fast because 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.550
 that the guy me they expect from m 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.169
 samaras friends to go to have a beer 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.960
 at the outsize bar made early in the world 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.550
 to put back fast chargers by 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.789
 bob and it goes on and that's very very 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.669
 cool padam secondary that's because 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:43.310
 I play in bed msm is in assets 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.680
 make determination you know what 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.479
 are its assets since it is robustness 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.550
 therefore already be all healthy and 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.680
 robustness why comes from aix has not 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.940
 too much what is this asset in fact you 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.200
 see you flinch when you 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.400
 actually shudder people you pull 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.630
 on the mayor and the guy is shooting at you 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.860
 so we do when they shoot you 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.120
 above your viewfinder will go up a bit 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.320
 whereas if you have robustness your 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.010
 viewfinder is going to be well fixed drive you 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.190
 like to be able to 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.070
 he made me so that's it if you 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.540
 understand what I'm saying 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.560
 now denied I loved him all 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.290
 time with stone it's really a good 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.330
 combo and where abbot 4th with 4 to all 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.220
 like that it's really great for this 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.540
 which is from my music videos here's because 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.530
 it squeezed there was an email 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.490
 subscribers who tells me yeah you can 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.870
 change a little killstreak there is one 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.770
 little tired of the lot star dog group of 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.620
 ethical charter of eavesdropping and me too 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.430
 I was tired of telling you 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.510
 now that these new guides for 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.290
 a lot more fun because it's 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.960
 as soon as it is that I unlock 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.610
 several times in the game while 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.990
 the tsar hunting group touches of 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.760
 unlock once big max or two 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.660
 in the game so it's really not 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.650
 very funny and especially that the enemies 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.660
 rage that was almost all the time 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.550
 while there now with aircraft 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.080
 micro and dreux escort really a 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.840
 perfect combo the minors Thursday not he 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.310
 you really do a pure massacre the 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.640
 roannais curtis you put in the middle of 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.290
 the map 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.150
 that's any way you put it 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.170
 in the middle of the map he will take care of 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.360
 quite frankly I really find 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.620
 overpowering it was nico out there the 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.450
 microphone could not do much 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.680
 frankly apart from the momentum apart from the 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.300
 put in your pocket or pokemon gold 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.950
 a pokéball the invention you put it 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.040
 in escort drones it follows you from the doubs 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.810
 his escort so wherever you go 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.610
 he will follow you guys and so you 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.350
 go to the enemies he goes also he 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.320
 had to snipe that you see there you 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.850
 are you going to just gorge yourself? 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:16.780
 by the way if nuclear negative this 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:18.340
 video puts besides wahlen does the 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.480
 nuclear but it was not 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.520
 killstreaks course and you and the fat
