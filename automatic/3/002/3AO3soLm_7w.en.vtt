00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:03.370
 Buenos Aires 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.350
 members 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.300
 the installation of ubuntu 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.300
 as we see there is no cd unit 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.979
 only memory is connected 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.769
 well let's choose our 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.609
 language 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.259
 you can not see very well but it's 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:22.800
 the Spanish 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.270
 if you do not brush come prepared to install once you answered 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.949
 some questions you can install all your equipment 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.349
 the content and the excellent 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.300
 so you can run the theme at maximum speed and without needing the 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.039
 it usually takes a few minutes to answer more questions for a little 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.750
 I started rather hurt language 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.350
 during the installation process in principle older 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.810
 once finished 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.210
 in the final stretch 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.580
 if you have internet access the lototurf and publication puts a little more about 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.580
 the problems that can affect you 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.840
 We have chosen 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.870
 language 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.820
 Let's go ahead, Cristina, since you can use your mouse 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.820
 we click ahead 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.900
 she managed to press to start this month to start the process 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.580
 now what we are doing is topic like messi 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.570
 the sinister time zone 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.630
 in my case 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.450
 the one that is 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.390
 cover the age of majority 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.869
 schedule of the Mexican territory in this case is that it would be 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.920
 the center time 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.310
 here according to mark one hour 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.590
 other than the artist 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.590
 right now 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.040
 the work with 45 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.040
 good team where tsonga says 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.040
 2. 3 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.040
 mexico city of mexico or the dependents 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.520
 selection that directs mexico-puebla and we select metro 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.060
 time zone we click on 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.060
 ahead 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.889
 now what you have to do that is 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.149
 the Argentine team 2 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:13.679
 we are going to select 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:17.079
 in our case in this case there is the doctor efe 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.989
 Latin America 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.689
 lineker power 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.139
 If I remember correctly, who is the Mexican artist? 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:32.969
 including 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:36.819
 dead dead vocento lyrics I do not remember very well the fact is that it is 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.099
 the accent should be marked 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.099
 up a vowel in such a way 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:48.259
 that you will see how you can make a reptilian discussion and current because 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.999
 so the accident 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:52.069
 keb baas 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.069
 they lean towards the acquisition of the pieces 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.569
 It is different from another language 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.569
 and the one we are looking for is ours 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:02.899
 What is it 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:05.669
 which will tilt to the right 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:08.689
 in my case like knowing how the norm is marked 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.739
 as indicated today efe 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.739
 combining the keys alcácer again more like 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.689
 I insist brand 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.689
 We are checking the keyboard 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:26.969
 7 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:30.519
 pique is to manage the keyboard very well because then we will not be able to 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.239
 set up 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.879
 as easy as we are doing right now 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.649
 or do you think that then 

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:39.649
 for all those Mexican users who want to install ubuntu 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.199
 the keyboard that should reflect in my case 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.719
 the Latin American keyboard 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:49.719
 dear in english including 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.239
 it is not true has in door 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.899
 It is what it says 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:54.929
 what is the What 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:56.919
 it is commonly known 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.919
 like our earth an umbilical Latin tilde 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.369
 let's go pa 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:05.369
 click ahead 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.569
 now comes the most important 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.909
 this to bring there the partitioning of the hard disk 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.879
 remember that he had told them that they should not have space on the hard drive 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:22.909
 this is where 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.800
 the ubuntu installer 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.800
 will carry out its work 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.939
 vijay will prepare the disk space 

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.180
 this team has good pass 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.660
 and covers practically all the exception photo p the content of the 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.729
 HDD 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.999
 I will expose bad points companies 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:49.439
 installed next to the others choosing between them when starting the equipment that is 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:50.349
 power 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.349
 that we can give us the possibility to choose 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.599
 If there is an operation, we want to start 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:01.559
 through a program that creates a point called a group 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:04.559
 efe rv 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.419
 or we can also specify partitions manually fire 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.039
 if what we want is to erase everything 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.499
 let's go the other one that says 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:17.319
 borja ekiza the whole disk but we want to leave the 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:17.949
 offer 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.139
 yes when they do accounts then 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.449
 let's choose the option that says install it 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.849
 next to the others who choosing between them when starting the equipment 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.589
 inside this one 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:33.479
 it remained rejectable that they put green orange and blue 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.479
 we can detect them in such an atypical way and I was 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.229
 fifty 50 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:47.519
 55 with popular 55 pochi there is perfect 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:55.330
 already the other ukraine scene the installation of a filter plus things is going 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.379
 to create the necessary partitions 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:01.169
 so that it can work optimally since it is also necessary 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.150
 create a second partition that is the one that will do 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.150
 called as a page file 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.030
 I do not feel like virtual memory by ram 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:15.569
 pérez t 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:16.619
 substitute 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:19.619
 in case there is not enough ram memory 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.669
 we click ahead 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:28.210
 since we have finished 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.559
 moss appears to the right 

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:34.150
 that the lyrics say that the changes before the disc are awaited 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.400
 to save the changes before the disk before you can select a 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.229
 new partition size 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:43.039
 you can not do this operation please 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:46.770
 keep in mind that the size adjustment operation may take a long time 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.099
 time 6 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:51.589
 we click continue 

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:55.219
 and now I'm going to start adjusting the partitions has more things 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:59.659
 there do not despair please 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.229
 He commented that even at work 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:06.169
 I think here to show video 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:09.650
 if we return from accommodations, the following hockey screen appears 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.879
 it goes then 

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:12.959
 coulthard we already voted
