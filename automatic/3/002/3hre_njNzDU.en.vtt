00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.080
 to get a new series here on the 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.930
 channel it's time I got something 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.490
 new thought and indeed one will 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.670
 start new series on this channel 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.890
 and she calls herself honda's road to beast 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.460
 or hospitality I still have to 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.380
 think 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.060
 But what is this series about? 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.410
 I will tell you now briefly 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.119
 but no wonder no matter what he does 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.410
 do not play alone and that's why 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.270
 we have to get a team around first 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.840
 build this good man and there we have 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.570
 also directly 1 tila felipe yoshida daniel 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.750
 small then we have in nazi kagawa 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.700
 honda hosogai escudero and adi and front 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.920
 we forgot the player 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.480
 by the way, I absolutely have 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.000
 does not look like a japanese what should 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.950
 what is the series what is it about 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.930
 seen this series action it goes in the 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.270
 Principle around the player 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.760
 kazuki honda at the moment still at zska 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.080
 moscow is under contract next 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.730
 season or this winter 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.640
 but transferred to ac milan 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.369
 and I will be a little year 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.109
 tour with honda until we are a beast 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.640
 team and we start with 

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:13.899
 this Japanese team and everyone 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.219
 episode recognize that possibly from 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.780
 last year in every episode 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.009
 or look after each game 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.119
 I at whom the rating on 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.219
 worst was 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.079
 and depending on who the ratings are 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.070
 was the worst I will then 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:25.719
 say okay here 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.460
 you fly out of the team and for that 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.380
 then we pick a new player and 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.270
 First of all, we'll do it 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.770
 with the Russian league we pack 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.850
 first Russian league heavy with 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.710
 starting with the Japanese 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.899
 national team and a few others 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.100
 Players come running and chemistry is coming 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.630
 and now we just pack players 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.359
 from the Russian one the league but 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.249
 both increase and humiliation 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.289
 I say times have potential that is 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:49.509
 so always around the value of 75 so so 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.590
 always so mangold players in the field 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.509
 maybe a bit higher ever 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.429
 after he can step in twice 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.229
 and make him worse 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.249
 So, the whole thing is planned or two 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.479
 sometimes worse you can also once 

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:00.399
 can do better depending on 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.350
 that's how we plan and start 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.810
 that we stop the player the players 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.280
 which are Japanese at the moment 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.140
 replace Russian league players 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.729
 and when we think of it the perfect team 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.900
 together have the strong team or one 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.540
 team I am satisfied with 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.370
 Let's go into series a and do it 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.090
 the whole halt with casecon the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.860
 transferred 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.140
 then we had in the series a until we too 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.340
 because I have a beast team I guess 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.540
 that will be very interesting because honda 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.310
 he is also a very good player for me 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.390
 I really like it and I think that 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.890
 that will be very difficult 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.170
 maybe the series will be one more 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.700
 a bit converted but what 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.379
 it is important to tell about this corner 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.390
 Please look at what happens first 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.580
 that was all okay 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.349
 and then comes this foul from philippe 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.810
 outside the sixteen but there are 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.860
 elfmeter always writes in the 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.670
 comments if you think that this year 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.170
 penalty kick was because I'm whole 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.790
 Honestly the opinion no because foul 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.319
 him outside of the sixteen one here 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.209
 can clearly see but there are 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.519
 eleven meters and we have a problem because 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.739
 goals exactly as in reality can be in fifa 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.150
 do not hold an eleven meter and yes it will 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.640
 destined for us and thus always one 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.110
 was to zero by ronaldinho however 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.299
 it that pretty much partie from because 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.739
 my salary is not putty afterwards 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.569
 I'm cemented no my opponent the 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.650
 lost connection and that's why it was 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.970
 also from this lot and we jump 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.190
 directly into the next lot drives 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.019
 By the way, only one tries 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.000
 play per episode make it the event 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.709
 I can live live, depending on that 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.760
 a look and of course so that the 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.109
 we'll make you a bit shorter with that 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.940
 you could watch this by the way and me 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.410
 spend about fifteen minutes time 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.579
 because many of you have yes 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.739
 not asking for me again and again 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.630
 to make shorter videos resp 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.639
 you do not know that because that psn 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.160
 or there were but often on 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.109
 every case so yes what should I still 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.079
 say exactly it's like this 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.849
 player if we won the will 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.829
 player by one i have that now 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.790
 only just made that and decided 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.530
 so no idea I already have 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.400
 bit taken in advance and 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.010
 I do not think I have one 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.959
 but I do not know if this one 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.430
 considered good question but what 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.859
 it's going to be that way anyway 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.700
 people pass us when the plant 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.169
 We will inform the player with the 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.739
 worst rating in silver players 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.739
 replace 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.720
 So go in the rating below and at one 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.579
 Victory we would be the player with low 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.590
 rating by a hearing aid player 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.599
 replace I think that's quite 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.819
 clearly and me necessarily hard to 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.579
 understand and it the difficulty in 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.109
 this year in this road to be scality 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.639
 while having the first goal for ours 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.280
 team eight times a template of course 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.990
 casey honda and 194 one way, because almost 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.060
 you're on the next scene on that 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.900
 identical 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.789
 The difficulty, of course, exists 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.390
 in that, for example, Japanese 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.010
 of course, team do not form first 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.010
 logically, if there are 19 ii 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.660
 Russian league player comes in and 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.800
 with a team with for example 80 emi 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.380
 it is already much more difficult 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.000
 against mostly with 100 chemistry teams 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.460
 Attack the opponent but I win 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.750
 think we have to see as we do 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.280
 will beat us there and I think 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.110
 that's what makes the charming also came 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.490
 his later to play for 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.780
 First we stay online first 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.520
 single play because I want to be honest 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.920
 said do not dismount in league three 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.900
 but what the hell are we gonna see like that 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.100
 whole will continue and then can 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.900
 the comments in any case 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.090
 first write if you think that that 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.770
 just one eleven meters was and there's something 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.660
 you also think of this serial idea 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.450
 during honda his first goal for 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.670
 our club makes in the 39 minute 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.900
 wonderfully inserted from the harbor there 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.850
 I had unlocked that before 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.020
 conquered the ball very well and I have to completely 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.760
 to say honestly about what I have until now 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.560
 I like honda with him 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.060
 really very very very very very 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.800
 good and i can only recommend him 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.330
 and i am definitely looking forward to it 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.620
 of course , waltz is still playing a series 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.070
 better laid than in the Russian 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.630
 Premier League of the Russian premier 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.150
 league and look how we are there 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.660
 will move forward so we go times 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.340
 a bit on the gameplay a 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.470
 what must we make of it my adversary 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.970
 had with little emi and honda did that 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.010
 ice cold used that is freezing cold 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.080
 the gate and makes his second goal here 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.450
 two templates and two gates after me 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.800
 Sach times two play after a game 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.780
 because the first game I can really do 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.260
 worth 120 minutes was canceled by the 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.270
 opponent 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.860
 what should then can the opponents here 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.120
 front door with his not chemistry team 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.430
 and the only player who knows what 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.170
 namely valencia and the ball is everything 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.580
 no nazi yes no chance of the ball 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.290
 hit perfectly and flies in the 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.580
 angle beautiful goal in any case 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.990
 but it will be a bit unnecessary 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.820
 Let's see if they can do that 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.960
 We will be rating on 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.710
 already see the end of the episode 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.810
 besides, I would be very, of course 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.970
 happy if we also have this video 200 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.260
 I'll see you guys 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.610
 I like the series idea 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.080
 that you may have fun that you 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.340
 want to see more and so on and so on 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.440
 In any case , I will be very happy 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:28.880
 Happy and honda ice cold you have to believe 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.860
 I could not say anything anymore 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.300
 a self- giving a place for it 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.100
 I made for purely so arrogant 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.810
 And especially in the end it was not 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.190
 a hocus-pocus, but just 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.289
 quite normal passant again 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.369
 made exciting
