00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.900
 hello my name is britta nuremberg 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.820
 Today we make-up with eyes 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.769
 You always think 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.519
 slip lider would be a beauty mark is 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.199
 but not 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.910
 with the right technology we can get 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.910
 These eyes really big out 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.190
 Make-up along this guide line 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.390
 First, wear a dark one 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.390
 eyeshadow to the outer corner of the eye 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.940
 for theresa the blue eyes i use 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.940
 a dark gray 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.220
 upper and are subject to it so 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.220
 emphasizes that a small triangle is created 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.659
 as a second shade I take something 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.179
 light gray what i made of moving lid 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.560
 apply a nice shade 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:17.560
 to get to the outside 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.970
 put the eyeshadow on the liter 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.970
 and blind him in both directions 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.590
 to give the eye even more expression 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.420
 I work now with a dark brown 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.540
 I'm really out of the channel 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.920
 of course, the outer edge also orders the 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.920
 beautiful blind again 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.890
 wear the kajal again upper and 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.890
 not on 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.110
 this turns the triangular shape of the neat 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.110
 shades still stressed 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.530
 the eyelashes will be concluded 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.530
 inked 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.980
 it opens your eyes and leaves them 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.980
 look bigger 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.580
 the make-up for schlupflider is ready 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.890
 important is that you really am 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.569
 outer edge very much accentuated after 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.769
 not so strong inside because that leaves 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.769
 the eyes appear bigger
