00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.300
 solidary aerobics villa de vegadeo that 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.040
 is a bit integrated into the 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.100
 activities that will be developed in 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.510

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.670
 in fact , March 8 is the day 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.660
 International Women's Day and 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.029
 in our town hall they have 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.730
 organized a series of activities for 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.410

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.269
 they for example is to eat to win 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.309
 the cancer that is going to be a talk that the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.430
 are taught by the nativity oncologist 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.120
 Ã¡lvarez is going to have some more activity 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.980
 related about about this kind of 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.559
 disease about cancer that both 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.050
 affects society in general and the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.120
 women in particular and we 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.860
 so we have decided to make a 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.960
 playful-sports activity as it is a 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.449
 aerobics marathon and give it a focus 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.190
 solidary and precisely because of the theme 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.789
 that has a little bit of these talks that 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.590
 are going to be done in vegadeo, because everything 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.180
 what we collect in this marathon what 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.710
 we are going to pay for the investigation 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.869
 cancer through 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.570
 association sandra ibarra fight against 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.880
 cancer and as I say it's going to be a 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.920
 recreational-sports activity is going to be the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.200
 next Saturday , March 9 in the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.330
 municipal sports center of vegadeo of 5 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.520
 at 8 o'clock in the afternoon it is open to any 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.060
 type of audience that wants to go and spend it 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.740
 well we are going to gather a total of 5 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.920
 aerobics monitors that we're going to do 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.630
 a series of aerobics classes or some 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.869
 choreographies different styles of 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.329
 aerobic and iii and good will be a moment 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.880
 so that to enjoy to do 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.250
 exercise and above all to collaborate 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.439
 with this cause because as I say everything 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.030
 collected in full will be 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.619
 intended for the investigation against 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.380
 against cancer well 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.960
 to make the donations we have two 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.240
 options we have an account enabled and 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.799
 it can be done there that I think that 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.420
 is going to be why they tell me what 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.100
 is going to be the most part of the people the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.860
 Marathon starts at 5 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.509
 From half past three we will be 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.840
 there a series of people in the entrance 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.149
 and we are going to collect that what the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.790
 people willingly give us we have 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.810
 decided to put an inscription of three 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.940
 euros 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.190
 it seems to us something symbolic three euros that 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.250
 it is not an important amount nor 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.280
 much less but good every person that 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.030
 dedicate and give us what what 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.910
 I think it is convenient, as I say what 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.190
 we are going to pay everything to the investigation 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.230
 against cancer and we have decided 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.780
 through make it through 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.459
 association of sandra ibarra because 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.739
 they have been organizing for some 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.300
 years a charitable career also in 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.550
 figueres good they spoke to us very well of 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.019
 This we call this organization 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.459
 we got in touch with them and 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.400
 from the first moment they seemed like a 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.560
 very good idea and they supported us then 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.290
 That's why we decided to make it through 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.180
 this association and well I have decided 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.580
 do this activity in particular this 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.349
 aerobics marathon since I am a monitor 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.630
 aerobics and pilates in the 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.090
 vegadeo city hall I have a group 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.620
 quite quite ample of female students are 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.450
 some activities that are working 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.459
 very well because they are focused on a 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.900
 sector of the population so that there is 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.459
 other kind of sports activities in 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.349
 the town there are different clubs 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.780
 soccer rowing basketball but 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.670
 always focused on boys and girls 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.550
 but for this sector of the population 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.260
 let's say women obviously aerobics and 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.700
 Pilates can make men and 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.069
 guys perfectly are always a 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.290
 little more reluctant especially to the 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.150
 aerobics time although good is already 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.620
 changing in fact I have I have guys in 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.690
 class also in both pilates and 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.970
 aerobic and then we have decided that is 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.100
 my group or me backed by my group 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.569
 you can organize this first marathon of 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.700
 aerobics in vegadeo because although they have 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.950
 many years imparting this type of 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.019
 activities in vegadeo no longer only me 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.209
 but other monitors never did anything 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.040
 of this type then we decided to make a 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.070
 older marathon give it a focus 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.570
 supportive of these activities 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.660
 good of which I am speaking in 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.540
 concrete the aerobics that is what it's going 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.010
 to record the marathon is an activity 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.720
 that you can obviously start 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.050
 anyone is an activity 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.480
 The objective is to exercise 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.150
 but in a funny way using 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.739
 Music as a tool is worth 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.930
 thus following different styles of 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.360
 music following the rhythms and that's how 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.980
 as we will obviously do in the marathon 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.480
 both the aerobic and the pillar 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.570
 are the activities that I impart so much 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.400
 in vegadeo as here in navia they are 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.640
 indicated for any type of person 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.310
 and how is a sporting activity 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.350
 the truth is always highly recommended 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.660
 is that my aerobic group 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.550
 we are all a little nervous 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.530
 because it 's the first time we do 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.100
 this is the first time in vegadeo 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.290
 does something similar and I do 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.610
 I feel particularly very 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.970
 happy and very flattered because my 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.950
 students have decided to do it now that 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.360
 let's say I'm his monitor despite 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.770
 that they have been doing aerobics since 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.430
 that I was a child and did not know what 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.290
 it was aerobics and yes let's hope and 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.240
 We want to come many people come 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.060
 first because we have done it with a lot 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.670
 illusion because we really want and 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.270
 second because as I say I think that the 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.710
 cause he deserves by donating everything to the 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.080
 cancer research are going to 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.090
 come monitors and they are going to come two 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.190
 monitors from from oviedo and that 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.410
 Antonio Ramiro Marcos will also be 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.450
 the monitor that the aerobic in wall 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.910
 silvia garcia and a monitor will come 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.040
 of the mariÃ±a de viveiro berta balseiro 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.300
 then among all everyone has their 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.580
 style 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.740
 let's try to move people each 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.389
 from your area to congregate in vegadeo 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.430
 in the west asturias and we move a 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.560
 little the area of ââthe mariÃ±a and a 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.980
 little bit asturias and participation 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.530
 let's hope it's important 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.360
 yes it is true that a few months ago in May 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.670
 a marathon was held in 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.380
 aerobics organized by this monitor that 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.820
 will be with us silvia silvia 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.920
 Garcia I was there as well 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.200
 monitor and the truth that was a success 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.330
 silvia worked her students a lot 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.790
 many worked and the marathon was a 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.700
 success and partly because of that was when 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.590
 my students started to guide me 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.140
 little to see if in vegadeo we did 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.850
 something similar really the one that we 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.550
 motivated and the one that gave us the pistol shot 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:24.100
 let's say it like that was Silvia the 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.800
 monitora de hereu de tapia well as 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.840
 I say everything we are going to raise goes to 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.700
 be donated in full for the 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.370
 cancer research and this 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.560
 we can do it like that because we say that 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.590
 all the expenses that arise for us 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:41.140
 can mount an event of this type 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:44.169
 the neighbors of vegadeo the association of 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:46.539
 merchants of vegadeo ascove and 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:49.319
 and different bars will access us 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:49.319
 little things 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.910
 I do not want to name someone 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.140
 concrete because I'm afraid that it's 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.780
 go forget all the collaborators 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.460
 but the truth is that people the people of 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.750
 on foot and different companies have 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.960
 dump with us have facilitated us 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.940
 since since from water from from 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.470
 some some product some smoothie 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.260
 to replenish energies throughout the 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:12.250
 afternoon in the afternoon we all came out 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:14.080
 free then all that what 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.310
 So let's collect it by not having to pay 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.190
 no expense everything we collect 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.470
 we can donate it to the cause that believes and 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.630
 finally I just wanted to invite you 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.130
 go near to all those without 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.710
 kind of commitment you can come 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.510
 put on the tracksuit if you want to 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.130
 participate with us and if not 

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:33.430
 simply to know and enjoy the 

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:37.380
 environment and collaborate with this one with this 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.380
 cause I think the occasion deserves it
