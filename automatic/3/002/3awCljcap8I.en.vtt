including yourself instead of the
traditional<00:01:37.439> eight<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.640> me<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:39.000> makes<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
traditional eight for me this makes the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.600 
traditional eight for me this makes the
game<00:01:39.570> much<00:01:39.960> more<00:01:40.020> enjoyable<00:01:40.680> because<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
addition I don't think it disrupts the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.219 
addition I don't think it disrupts the
style<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.670> Mario<00:01:56.969> Kart<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.420> think<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.899> makes<00:01:58.049> it

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
style of Mario Kart I think it makes it

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.770 
style of Mario Kart I think it makes it
better<00:01:58.380> there<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.399> no<00:01:59.729> story<00:02:00.000> or<00:02:00.149> plot<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.659> this

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
better there is no story or plot to this

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.230 
better there is no story or plot to this
game<00:02:01.020> or<00:02:01.290> any<00:02:01.590> other<00:02:01.829> Mario<00:02:02.100> Kart<00:02:02.490> games<00:02:02.729> it's

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
game or any other Mario Kart games it's

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.209 
game or any other Mario Kart games it's
just<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.570> straight-up<00:02:03.869> racer<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.649> start<00:02:05.100> out

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
just a straight-up racer you start out

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.859 
just a straight-up racer you start out
by<00:02:05.340> choosing<00:02:05.610> your<00:02:05.820> ruleset<00:02:06.299> then<00:02:06.659> your

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
by choosing your ruleset then your

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.440 
by choosing your ruleset then your
character<00:02:07.079> then<00:02:07.680> your<00:02:07.890> cart<00:02:08.190> or<00:02:08.340> bike<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:09.239> your

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
character then your cart or bike in your

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.479 
character then your cart or bike in your
transmission<00:02:10.170> which<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.129> say<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.459> a

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
transmission which I have to say is a

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.080 
transmission which I have to say is a
nice<00:02:11.760> new<00:02:11.970> feature<00:02:12.000> then<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
nice new feature then the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.750 
nice new feature then the
stage<00:02:13.239> that's<00:02:13.959> it<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.440> it<00:02:14.980> works<00:02:15.220> there

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
stage that's it and it works there

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.309 
stage that's it and it works there
doesn't<00:02:16.120> need<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.269> be<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:16.510> storyline<00:02:16.900> when<00:02:17.200> it

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
doesn't need to be a storyline when it

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.740 
doesn't need to be a storyline when it
comes<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.709> Mario<00:02:17.980> Kart<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:19.090> controls<00:02:19.510> are

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750

with<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.300> Wii<00:02:22.390> wheel<00:02:22.720> all<00:02:23.230> this<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.769> is<00:02:24.010> a

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
with the Wii wheel all this is is a

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.740 
with the Wii wheel all this is is a
plastic<00:02:24.550> shell<00:02:24.819> that<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.030> insert<00:02:25.450> your<00:02:25.599> Wii

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
plastic shell that you insert your Wii

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.449 
plastic shell that you insert your Wii
mote<00:02:25.930> into<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.739> becomes<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.129> steering

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
mote into and it becomes a steering

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.940 
mote into and it becomes a steering
wheel<00:02:27.489> this<00:02:28.150> works<00:02:28.420> surprisingly<00:02:28.629> well<00:02:29.290> the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
wheel this works surprisingly well the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.039 
wheel this works surprisingly well the
sensors<00:02:30.370> are<00:02:30.549> just<00:02:31.000> right<00:02:31.390> not<00:02:31.989> too

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
sensors are just right not too

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.339 
sensors are just right not too
oversensitive<00:02:33.010> nor<00:02:33.430> under<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:34.959> can<00:02:35.140> also

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
oversensitive nor under you can also

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:36.809 
oversensitive nor under you can also
play<00:02:35.650> with<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.860> GameCube<00:02:36.370> controller

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
play with the GameCube controller

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.670 
play with the GameCube controller
classic<00:02:37.420> controller<00:02:37.660> or<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.049> Wii<00:02:38.349> mote<00:02:38.530> with

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
classic controller or the Wii mote with

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.800 
classic controller or the Wii mote with
nunchuck<00:02:39.129> I<00:02:39.400> actually<00:02:39.849> have<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.269> say<00:02:40.299> I've

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
nunchuck I actually have to say I've

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.300 
nunchuck I actually have to say I've
never<00:02:41.080> tried<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.530> game<00:02:41.709> with<00:02:41.950> these<00:02:42.040> three

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
never tried the game with these three

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.070 
never tried the game with these three
different<00:02:42.700> controllers<00:02:43.180> since<00:02:43.690> using<00:02:43.989> the

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
different controllers since using the

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.900 
different controllers since using the
Wii<00:02:44.230> wheel<00:02:44.379> just<00:02:44.620> works<00:02:44.860> perfectly<00:02:44.950> for<00:02:45.579> me<00:02:45.700> I

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
Wii wheel just works perfectly for me I

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.460 
Wii wheel just works perfectly for me I
assume<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.569> Gamecube<00:02:47.019> in<00:02:47.110> classic

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
assume the Gamecube in classic

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.289 
assume the Gamecube in classic
controller<00:02:47.829> would<00:02:48.010> work<00:02:48.190> well<00:02:48.400> too<00:02:48.640> while

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
controller would work well too while

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.240 
controller would work well too while
with<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.599> Wiimote<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:49.900> Nunchuk<00:02:50.260> combo<00:02:50.650> yeah

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
with the Wiimote and Nunchuk combo yeah

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.509 
with the Wiimote and Nunchuk combo yeah
I<00:02:51.280> don't<00:02:52.090> know<00:02:52.269> it's<00:02:52.780> 50/50<00:02:53.530> maybe<00:02:54.220> I<00:02:54.340> should

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
I don't know it's 50/50 maybe I should

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:06.809 
I don't know it's 50/50 maybe I should
just<00:02:54.610> give<00:02:54.790> it<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:54.940> try<00:03:02.819> -<00:03:04.769> was<00:03:05.769> better<00:03:05.980> for<00:03:06.549> this

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
just give it a try - was better for this

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.220 
just give it a try - was better for this
oh<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:09.700> also<00:03:09.819> on<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.150> bike<00:03:10.329> you<00:03:10.510> can't<00:03:10.780> like

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
oh and also on the bike you can't like

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.020 
oh and also on the bike you can't like
lift<00:03:11.560> up<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:11.860> do<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.040> wheelie<00:03:12.280> like<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:12.849> can

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
lift up to do a wheelie like you can

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:20.830 
lift up to do a wheelie like you can
with<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.269> Wii<00:03:13.390> mode

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
it's a lot better than I expected it be

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.149 
it's a lot better than I expected it be
the<00:03:38.569> wheel<00:03:38.900> is<00:03:39.079> a<00:03:39.109> lot<00:03:39.290> better<00:03:39.469> actually<00:03:39.889> you

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159 
the wheel is a lot better actually you

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.530 
the wheel is a lot better actually you
don't<00:03:40.310> really<00:03:40.400> need<00:03:40.579> to<00:03:40.639> wheel<00:03:40.819> you<00:03:40.999> just<00:03:41.209> do

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
don't really need to wheel you just do

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.770 
don't really need to wheel you just do
this<00:03:41.749> but<00:03:42.549> no<00:03:43.549> if<00:03:43.700> I<00:03:45.969> say<00:03:46.969> it's<00:03:47.329> my<00:03:47.450> second
