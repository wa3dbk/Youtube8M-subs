00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.810
 I will go 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.929
 that we can give to a hedgehog that runs 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.559
 He wears red sneakers and he does not wear 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:16.030
 combs that if not hot dogs of 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.030

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.030
 for today's recipe we will use 450 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.070
 grams of minced meat 100 grams of 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.230
 chopped white onion 100 grams of 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.579
 pepper also chopped 100 grams of 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.620
 mushrooms also these trozitos 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.930
 tots tots tots one 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.909
 spoonful of English sauce 210 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.890
 milliliters of barbecue sauce one 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.500
 teaspoon chili powder a bit of 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.910
 ground cumin and a little oregano 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.250
 we will add also for the dish 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.899
 main will be 6 hot spots all 6 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.269
 buns and then some cheese 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.620
 gratin to finish off to begin 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.329
 let's start let's start 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.289
 prepare the sauce that we will start 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.289
 suffering the flesh 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.230
 my advice is that the mushrooms 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.430
 leave for the beginning or for the end 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.150
 more than anything because the mushroom loose 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.150
 lots of water 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.680
 once the meat is done 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.680
 we put it in the pot 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.490
 and we will suffer the rest of things 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.210
 once subscribed everything we mix everything 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.650
 in a bigger pot so that we 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.130
 it's better unless you have the ante 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.130
 bigger 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.579
 throwing the big sausages 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.140
 to cool down a bit because here 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.350
 there are the columns 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.289
 while you are doing 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.530
 we want it 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.030
 Clear 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.030
 I'm still thinking about passing the word 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.370
 I do not understand 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.370
 but now 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.750
 one 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.530
 and then we take the English sauce 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.000
 can be strong estero western soul 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.860
 as 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.860
 you squirt 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.500
 it seems that we are many truly 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.500
 take a little 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.670
 and we mix everything well at this 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.670
 we add 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.069
 a little cumin 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.660
 and a little oregano 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.680
 and finally we take a spoonful 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.700
 tiny of 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.700
 chili powder 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.800
 we remove everything well and let 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.450
 go taking it quietly because 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.069
 I also have to be a tad of 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.680
 water therefore while the water is 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.860
 evapora we finished cooking the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.860
 sausages 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.420
 once prepared 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:53.020
 we put the bun 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.020
 we miss him 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.110
 the sauce 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.680
 trying not to destroy the 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.680
 structure 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:12.030
 and finally he pours some cheese 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.030
 to gratinate the 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.129
 and now to gratinar 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.169
 the best hot dogs of all 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.300
 mobile puppy salted a puppy 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.250
 hot with a bit of cinema if you want 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.659
 you can take a couple of a couple of 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.330
 beans but good I do not do it because 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:38.009
 I do not like it and nothing and this is what 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.939
 this week 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.939
 take advantage
