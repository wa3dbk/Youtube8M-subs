00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.939
 about 20 years ago herta 03 has 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.960
 last time the berliner cup of the a 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.550
 juniors won 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.080
 Now you want to catch up again 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.660
 zehlendorf bring in the final against the 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.269
 Berlin goalie ludwig full 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.860
 motivated trainer sebastian hoeneß 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.949
 sends his team in the poststadion 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.710
 with a 4 4 2 deployment in attack 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.089
 with lozenge on the field about 1000 spectators 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.920
 see at the beginning but not the 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.960
 favored Zehlendorf in attack 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.900
 but the first chance works out 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:01.409
 the sc dangerous but zwick is too 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:03.600
 Make his team want to go flat 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.880
 vertical play opportunities 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.940
 nice tip but it all works 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.520
 quite cramped anticipates well and 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.570
 Now the sc is back quickly 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.470
 back on sami k rescues the ten 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.270
 villages with two to one they have in 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.220
 semi-final the first FC Union 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.229
 beaten but today likes it 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.689
 coach the game of his boys whole and 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.460
 Not at all the ball control 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.460
 leaves much to be desired 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.049
 Mehlhorn after ten minutes finally the 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.079
 first goal shot for herta 03 now 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.799
 open up slowly 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.329
 dennis dombrowe on captain dennis vines 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.189
 well seen and what a beautiful 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:52.869
 Ball acceptance by daniel wassmann cakmakci 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.229
 the keeper box team out and in the second 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.979
 start it holds him securely and makes 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.590
 the game fast 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.590
 the long ball on 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.390
 Philipp Sommerfeld 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.479
 I'm having a hard time with that 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.590
 quick attacker again luis purpose 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:18.600
 with the left foot fifteenth minute 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.600
 the adjoining corner of berliner sc 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.110
 Heinz extended and summer field with much 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:30.459
 space so free he is not allowed to 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.909
 shot , the ten finally come up with more 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.780
 print 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:43.959
 bonn prof the central sixth moves to 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:44.530
 Tor and seeks the conclusion 25 minutes 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.780
 are around 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.480
 the team of hertha 03 attacks 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.440
 that it counts early now and keeps it in 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.440
 their own half 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.720
 Three minutes later the spectators are watching 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.930
 then a foul on the profi just before 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.709
 penalty free kick shoots from the right 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.709
 the captain 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.390
 just over the best way of the 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.390
 zehlendorfer in the first half hour 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.440
 the sc only with long balls they come 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.040
 from the own half but the worries 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.210
 again and again for danger 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:29.000
 especially if the fast paladin at 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.000
 But no problem for the top 8 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.970
 sebastian hoeneß is on the verge of 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.870
 half-time break is no longer on the bank 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:41.370
 just no offense before the page change 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:43.670
 marcel tiemann sees palla alone 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.440
 in front of the gate and the thing is in there though 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.540
 offside goal does not count 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.460
 The striker is at the ball 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.100
 probably just off the beaten track 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.480
 barely recognizable even in the second 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.650
 attitude you do not see if the 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:02.080
 umpires are right here 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:04.620
 then 45 minutes are around 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:08.860
 in the cup final the zehlendorfer show 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:12.790
 no nice kick and the coach 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.860
 he nods thoughtfully second half 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.340
 herter 03 finally with more courage 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.940
 ahead 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.910
 The captain gives direction now 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.360
 it is almost exclusively on a goal 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.360
 freestoss ruby 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.030
 nice technology but a few meters 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.030
 past 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.410
 65 minutes played zehlendorf again im 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.980
 attack 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.950
 Mehlhorn foul shortly before the punishment room 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.510
 here 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.850
 the fouled hoard shoots itself 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.310
 despite superiority in the field comes 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.400
 nothing countable with rum and that can 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.200
 also backfire quickly 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.120
 it follows the last chance of the game 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.830
 and that has the berliner sc in the 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:04.820
 Ninety minute but that's easy 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.430
 too harmless louis zwick without problems 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:11.660
 ups is and no extension but 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.420
 Eleven penalty shoot 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.880
 The first thing the opponent can do is to point 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.410
 louis zwick has his team in goal 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.940
 so far saved from a defeat 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:26.250
 now it's a nerve-game fortune 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.920
 had chor hours lupft the ball 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.560
 the latte the boys of herta only three 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.599
 Can not go ahead now 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.120
 be fearless 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:45.389
 dennis dammbruch 10 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:45.389
 herter is ahead of Japan against zwick 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.290
 the corner was just right but the shot 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:57.920
 placed and certainly no chance for 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:06:02.910
 the north is ready 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:06.260
 Well shot 2 to 1 and now he has to 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.260
 again ran louis 2 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.010
 no chance 2 to 2 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.690
 Fortum places the ball cope 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.650
 three to two for theater well that the 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.490
 keeper in the other corner jumps because 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.319
 that would have been tough 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.349
 zwick can now be far behind 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:32.300
 bring in the front if he keeps that in 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:36.550
 was just wrong corner but with the foot 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.550
 He almost comes to Bayern 3 to 3 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:41.460
 alcala full concentration 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:47.979
 certainly transforms 4 to 3 

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:50.259
 and if the opponent now pats are the 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:53.729
 a-juniors from herta 0 3 for the first time 

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:58.020
 for 20 years again cup winner 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.020
 it is in his hands 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:03.960
 no it lies between his feet 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:05.599
 louis zwick holds hard 03 has won 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.669
 after an exciting penalty shootout 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:10.319
 with 4 3 won the team of 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:12.569
 sebastian hoeness because all 

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:15.330
 Eleven scorer have met and the 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:18.319
 Goalkeeper the last ball between the 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:22.139
 holds legs 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:24.499
 they are Berlin cup winner and there is 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:24.499
 the for
