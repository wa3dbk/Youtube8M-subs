00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
of the things that we've done is we've

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.810 
of the things that we've done is we've
researched<00:00:34.950> some<00:00:35.360> recipes<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.950> Civil

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
researched some recipes that the Civil

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.370 
researched some recipes that the Civil
War<00:00:38.910> soldiers<00:00:39.240> would<00:00:39.420> have<00:00:39.450> eat<00:00:39.660> eaten<00:00:40.260> or

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
War soldiers would have eat eaten or

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.050 
War soldiers would have eat eaten or

might have eaten during the time period
and<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.270> we're<00:00:42.840> replicating<00:00:43.470> some<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.100> those

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
and so we're replicating some of those

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.980 
and so we're replicating some of those
recipes<00:00:47.300> Civil<00:00:48.300> War<00:00:48.450> soldiers<00:00:48.810> would<00:00:48.960> have

recipes Civil War soldiers would have

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.680 
recipes Civil War soldiers would have
been<00:00:49.170> issued<00:00:49.560> particular<00:00:50.100> rations<00:00:50.880> those

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
been issued particular rations those

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.090 
been issued particular rations those
rations<00:00:52.140> would<00:00:52.260> have<00:00:52.380> included<00:00:52.590> things<00:00:53.040> like

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
rations would have included things like
