00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.050
 Hello, welcome to a new video 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.570
 of the teacher to agree with our 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.880
 website we have hundreds and hundreds and 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.530
 hundreds of exercises to try out 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.170
 very good grades in physical math and 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.450
 good chemistry we continue with the course to 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.289
 learn formulation from scratch to the 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.390
 infinite and beyond yes with hundreds of 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.400
 exercises solved good then this 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.970
 this exercise can make god magnesium 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.850
 example of the exercises or 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.400
 chips that I have in the blog in the blog 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.870
 remember that I 'm leaving you fictitious 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.050
 very heavy and I repeat many things 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.120
 so that it is clear to you 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.000
 I have the chips in there this is an example 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.040
 that in the blog there will be instead of 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.500
 have four contributed will have 12 or 16 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.769
 separated then you do and then comes 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.930
 here solution will come and click there 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.000
 where it puts dissolution and a pdf appears 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.830
 with the solution and buy vice is already 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.980
 you know if anybody out there that does not know or 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.409
 you do not understand then you send a 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.010
 a comment and ask me without any 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.200
 problem 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.630
 come then let's do it then 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.000
 we started step by step I was here 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.860
 I start first doing all four and 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.330
 systematic then do the four in 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.390
 stop and then do the four in 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.950
 traditional voucher order of difficulty 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.259
 then we started systematically that 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.940
 we have to do read upside down simple and 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.860
 plainly then it would be that this would be 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:34.060
 monoxide in remembering 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:37.990
 monkey been good silver 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:41.710
 let's write well it's worth remembering that 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.110
 Oxygens carry the prefix mono vale 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.479
 only the only ones when there is one in front 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.340
 the next one would be very weird monoxide 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.469
 this 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.469
 with those two pits and cobalt 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.570
 and 1 and 2 you repeat it high 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.909
 also this one would be dioxide 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.609
 of gold let's see 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.060
 I'm going to describe well that it seized me and 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:09.060
 with this 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.780
 dicom monoxide 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.409
 to realize that he is reading at 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.159
 reverse monoxide trioxide discovery of 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:27.379
 gold with copper oxide and gold monoxide 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.840
 because the monkey the only one that has monkey 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:32.870
 is the oxygen well then we go in 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.470
 this is put metal oxide and 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.720
 in parentheses the valence of the metal 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.819
 in Roman numerals but only if you have 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.980
 more than one valence is if the valence is 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.500
 only one does not set so let's see 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.890
 oxide of 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.960
 plant well and the silver that valencia 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.600
 has by advances has only one more 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.980
 then it is not necessary to put anything on 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.980
 next would be cobalt oxide 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.580
 cobalt oxide and cobalt that 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.710
 valencia has therefore the cobalt has 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.020
 valencia 2 and 3 with which valencia is 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.720
 acting we look here but we have 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.880
 that give account there is a 1 and the cobalt does not 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.740
 has 1 then that means that 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.740
 is simplify we also is 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.450
 true that we always look and here it has 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.130
 than having a 2 because oxygen always 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.740
 by 1 2 to the other if there is not in this 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.210
 If there is not if simplified here 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.340
 it would not be simplified either and here 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.260
 I would not be simplified here either 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.920
 if then it is simplified with what 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.800
 valencia the cobalt come very well with 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.300
 220 as of now I'm going to put or 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.970
 because it's a bit low when you put 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.170
 rust all the time since that day rust 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.360
 of gold 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.160
 and in parentheses the valence of gold 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.280
 if you have more than one as gold has 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.020
 valence 1 and 3 and in this case is 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.800
 acting with the valence 3 truth then 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:00.230
 you put a 3 between for good and now 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.120
 the next one would be copper oxide and the 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.430
 copper and mercury has in valencia more 1 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.090
 + 2 because it has more than one valence that 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.510
 put it between the mercury going to put 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.510
 copper oxide 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.750
 and with that they go to this area and copper 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.920
 with the shtick that appears there as no 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:21.020
 appears there is no 1 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.020
 and now we go to the traditional one because 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:27.290
 same I will put or rust I hope that 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.420
 be understood at home and now silver 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.580
 as silver has only one valence 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:36.740
 well the traditional nomenclature was 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:38.840
 we put valence oxide and the metal 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.240
 has finished I do not know when he acts with his 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.510
 small valence and in icod when it acts 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.500
 with its large valence for example the 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.300
 iron I always set the example no longer 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.980
 has valence 2 and valence 3 when 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.590
 is acting with valence 2 will be 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.140
 completion in ferrous bear and when 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.120
 until valencia 3 will be a termination in 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:00.340
 icod ferric is worth here in silver 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.070
 and it only has one valence then it 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.710
 can put silver or termination on 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.229
 icod I always put silver has been 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.520
 displaced does not need to be put as alone 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.540
 has a more appearance of lack puts 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.470
 termination 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:17.050
 Unique wallenius is worth the cobalt oxide 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.460
 cobalt cobalt has valence 2 and 3 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.260
 with what valencia is acting valera 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.330
 we have who is exposed but good 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.160
 he is acting with the little one who is 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:29.310
 the 2 then it will be cobalt xa 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.230
 well the next golden oxide the gold 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.330
 has Valencian +1 and +3 with 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:37.400
 valencia is current with the big 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.400
 then it will be aurich 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.680
 well and the last the copper the copper has 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:47.140
 valencia 1 and 2 pallets and copper and mercury 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.600
 valencia + 1 and older to see if 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.980
 listening to me many times 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.620
 you surprise the frame valencia well 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.810
 copper mercury valence plus one plus two 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.000
 and with what valence placing collaborating 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.130
 with the little one with the little one 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.770
 then determination on the shoulders 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.810
 for names sometimes are few 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.570
 radios but the income is not my fault 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.160
 well you have understood it see now 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.840
 in the tabs that I have on the blog 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.430
 I could hit the like button once 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.040
 in when the videos and I know the truth is to 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:18.940
 everyone is better that for me they are a great 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:21.490
 I support now in the blog vais your 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.950
 you download the cards that I have next 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.740
 there will exercise a chip and 3 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:29.020
 very nice for you to do it and 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.820
 then you give it to correct and the 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.600
 solution do not cheat me 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.160
 put before the solution is worth 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.580
 come then see you in the next 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.580
 video
