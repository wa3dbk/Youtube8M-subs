00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
were given organic fertilizer they are

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.500 
were given organic fertilizer they are
both<00:00:31.650> grown<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.130> same<00:00:32.340> types<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.910> soil<00:00:33.149> or

tablespoons of blood meal per gallon of

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.160 
tablespoons of blood meal per gallon of
soil<00:00:49.520> so<00:00:50.520> up<00:00:50.700> first<00:00:51.270> we'll<00:00:51.690> do<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.960> red

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
soil so up first we'll do the red

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.119 
soil so up first we'll do the red
currant<00:00:52.649> tomatoes<00:00:54.710> bring<00:00:55.710> these<00:00:55.890> guys<00:00:56.100> a

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
currant tomatoes bring these guys a

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.380 
currant tomatoes bring these guys a
little<00:00:56.430> closer<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:58.520> you<00:00:59.520> can<00:00:59.789> tell<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
little closer so you can tell that the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.630 
little closer so you can tell that the
no<00:01:00.960> surprise<00:01:01.379> they'll<00:01:01.800> get<00:01:02.039> an<00:01:02.160> organic

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
no surprise they'll get an organic

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.289 
no surprise they'll get an organic
fertilizer<00:01:02.969> plant<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.019> much<00:01:04.379> healthier<00:01:05.299> some

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
fertilizer plant is much healthier some

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.910 
fertilizer plant is much healthier some
of<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.479> biggest<00:01:06.840> differences<00:01:07.439> are<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
of the biggest differences are in the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.450 
of the biggest differences are in the
color<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.490> leaves<00:01:09.080> this<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.619> organic

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
color of the leaves this is the organic

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.870 
color of the leaves this is the organic
fertilizer<00:01:12.060> plant<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.560> has<00:01:13.740> much<00:01:14.130> darker

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
fertilizer plant it has much darker

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.800 
fertilizer plant it has much darker
green<00:01:15.180> leaves<00:01:15.619> then<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:18.350> soil<00:01:19.350> only<00:01:19.619> plant

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
green leaves then the soil only plant

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.600 
green leaves then the soil only plant
another<00:01:21.810> big<00:01:22.080> difference<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.130> yellowing

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
another big difference is the yellowing

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.170 
another big difference is the yellowing
in<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.880> leaves<00:01:24.290> so<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:26.159> plant<00:01:26.909> without

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
in the leaves so the plant without

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.590 
in the leaves so the plant without
organic<00:01:27.900> fertilizer<00:01:28.409> has<00:01:28.890> much<00:01:29.729> yellow<00:01:30.450> or

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
organic fertilizer has much yellow or

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.350 
organic fertilizer has much yellow or
leaves<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.320> lot<00:01:31.500> less<00:01:31.920> healthy<00:01:32.640> than<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
leaves it's a lot less healthy than the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.140 
leaves it's a lot less healthy than the
organic<00:01:33.630> fertilizer<00:01:34.500> plant<00:01:35.150> another

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
organic fertilizer plant another

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.690 
organic fertilizer plant another
difference<00:01:36.720> between<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.320> variety<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
difference between this variety is the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.160 
difference between this variety is the
organic<00:01:39.600> fertilizer<00:01:39.990> plant<00:01:41.420> has<00:01:42.420> much<00:01:42.869> more

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
organic fertilizer plant has much more

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.149 
organic fertilizer plant has much more
flower<00:01:43.979> buds<00:01:44.840> actually<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.200> has<00:01:46.470> flower<00:01:46.860> buds

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
flower buds actually it has flower buds

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.670 
flower buds actually it has flower buds
and<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.670> one<00:01:47.909> doesn't<00:01:48.600> even<00:01:48.780> have<00:01:49.079> any<00:01:49.259> open

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
and this one doesn't even have any open

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.660 
and this one doesn't even have any open
flowers<00:01:50.130> yet

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
flowers yet

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.840 
flowers yet
so<00:01:52.360> that's<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.690> redcurrant<00:01:53.080> tomato<00:01:53.850> no

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
so that's the redcurrant tomato no

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.810 
so that's the redcurrant tomato no
surprise<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.570> organic<00:01:55.990> fertilizer<00:01:56.820> really

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
surprise the organic fertilizer really

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.420 
surprise the organic fertilizer really
benefited<00:01:58.480> the<00:01:58.600> plant<00:01:58.840> on<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.200> left<00:01:59.230> in<00:01:59.830> the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
benefited the plant on the left in the

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.650 
benefited the plant on the left in the
back<00:02:00.670> we<00:02:00.970> have<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.240> beefsteak<00:02:01.690> tomatoes

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
back we have the beefsteak tomatoes

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.640 
back we have the beefsteak tomatoes
these<00:02:04.660> guys<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:07.570> just<00:02:07.810> by<00:02:07.930> looking<00:02:08.260> at<00:02:08.380> them

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:08.650 
these guys so just by looking at them

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.530 
these guys so just by looking at them
you<00:02:08.830> can<00:02:08.860> tell<00:02:09.250> that<00:02:09.460> the<00:02:09.610> plant<00:02:09.880> on<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.119> left

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
you can tell that the plant on the left

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.020 
you can tell that the plant on the left
given<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.960> organic<00:02:11.410> fertilizer<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:12.280> much

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
given the organic fertilizer is much

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.000 
given the organic fertilizer is much
more<00:02:13.300> healthy<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.930> leaves<00:02:14.170> are<00:02:14.440> larger

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
more healthy the leaves are larger

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.150 
more healthy the leaves are larger
there's<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.790> bigger<00:02:16.390> difference<00:02:16.690> in<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.770> color

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
there's a bigger difference in the color

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.750 
there's a bigger difference in the color
of<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.370> leaves<00:02:18.700> then<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:20.110> red<00:02:20.380> currant<00:02:20.830> this

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
of the leaves then the red currant this

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.750 
of the leaves then the red currant this
is<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.090> beefsteak<00:02:22.510> organic<00:02:23.140> fertilizer<00:02:23.760> you

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
is the beefsteak organic fertilizer you

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.780 
is the beefsteak organic fertilizer you
can<00:02:24.790> see<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.420> leaves<00:02:25.600> are<00:02:26.400> really<00:02:27.400> dark

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
can see that the leaves are really dark

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.110 
can see that the leaves are really dark
green<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.540> then<00:02:29.020> if<00:02:29.110> we<00:02:29.320> look<00:02:29.350> over<00:02:29.680> here<00:02:30.120> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
green and then if we look over here the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.780 
green and then if we look over here the
leaves<00:02:31.390> are<00:02:31.660> much<00:02:31.920> lighter<00:02:32.920> green<00:02:33.400> and

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
leaves are much lighter green and

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.050

they're<00:02:34.000> all<00:02:34.150> curled<00:02:35.460> this<00:02:36.460> plant<00:02:36.730> looks<00:02:36.970> a

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
they're all curled this plant looks a

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.830 
they're all curled this plant looks a
lot<00:02:37.240> less<00:02:37.420> healthy<00:02:38.100> these<00:02:39.100> two<00:02:39.600> both<00:02:40.600> have

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
lot less healthy these two both have

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.820 
lot less healthy these two both have
flowers<00:02:41.320> though<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:43.360> also<00:02:43.960> important<00:02:44.740> to

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
flowers though and also important to

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.520 
flowers though and also important to
note<00:02:45.010> also<00:02:45.700> like<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.630> red<00:02:46.840> currant<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:49.530> soil

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
note also like the red currant the soil

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.480 
note also like the red currant the soil
only<00:02:50.770> plant<00:02:51.250> without<00:02:51.670> fertilizer<00:02:53.370> some<00:02:54.370> of

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
only plant without fertilizer some of

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.220 
only plant without fertilizer some of
the<00:02:54.580> leaves<00:02:54.790> have<00:02:55.060> completely<00:02:55.540> died<00:02:55.930> and

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
the leaves have completely died and

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.970 
the leaves have completely died and
dried<00:02:56.530> up<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:58.750> other<00:02:59.020> leaves<00:02:59.230> above<00:02:59.620> it<00:02:59.800> are

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
dried up the other leaves above it are

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.240 
dried up the other leaves above it are
yellowing<00:03:00.940> however<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:02.230> organic<00:03:02.680> fertilizer

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
yellowing however the organic fertilizer

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.180 
yellowing however the organic fertilizer
plant<00:03:03.780> doesn't<00:03:04.780> seem<00:03:05.020> to<00:03:05.170> have<00:03:05.350> that<00:03:05.620> issue<00:03:05.830> at

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
plant doesn't seem to have that issue at

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.479 
plant doesn't seem to have that issue at
all<00:03:06.959> none<00:03:07.959> of<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.230> leaves<00:03:08.440> have<00:03:08.709> died<00:03:08.920> on<00:03:09.280> it

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
all none of the leaves have died on it

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.020 
all none of the leaves have died on it
and<00:03:09.900> there's<00:03:10.900> only<00:03:11.080> slight<00:03:11.560> yellowing<00:03:12.130> on<00:03:12.340> one

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
and there's only slight yellowing on one

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.590 
and there's only slight yellowing on one
leaf<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:15.280> in<00:03:15.910> conclusion<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:18.640> organic

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
leaf so in conclusion the organic

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.160 
leaf so in conclusion the organic
fertilizers<00:03:20.350> do<00:03:20.739> work<00:03:21.870> not<00:03:22.870> really<00:03:22.900> a

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
fertilizers do work not really a

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.060 
fertilizers do work not really a
surprise<00:03:23.410> there<00:03:23.920> but<00:03:24.300> yeah<00:03:25.300> so<00:03:25.690> I<00:03:26.230> recommend

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
surprise there but yeah so I recommend

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.520 
surprise there but yeah so I recommend
using<00:03:27.250> organic<00:03:27.520> fertilizers<00:03:28.230> while<00:03:29.230> growing

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
using organic fertilizers while growing

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.370 
using organic fertilizers while growing
tomatoes<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.730> you<00:03:31.180> can<00:03:31.360> see<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:31.690> benefits<00:03:32.200> of

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
tomatoes and you can see the benefits of

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.460 
tomatoes and you can see the benefits of
this<00:03:32.940> I'll<00:03:33.940> post<00:03:34.239> another<00:03:34.480> experiment

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
this I'll post another experiment

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.640 
this I'll post another experiment
shortly<00:03:35.890> and<00:03:36.130> thanks<00:03:36.489> for<00:03:36.580> watching
