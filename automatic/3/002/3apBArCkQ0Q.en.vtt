00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.519
 the 90 of goalkeeper of striped Robert Dante 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.769
 siboldi first contact with the campus and 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.180
 to the last tiger he said that 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.130
 remains as part of stage as 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.660
 player it should be noted that during the 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.730
 interview the striped technician Victor 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.140
 Manuel Vucetich was very close so 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.910
 that referring to the tigers started to 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.119
 joke when talking loudly about this 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.119
 same theme 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.599
 willing to contribute and help whatever 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.699
 necessary 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.390
 not quiet because I think it's another 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:41.739
 completely different top 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.739
 I was in tigers as a player 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.620
 in this specific case 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.870
 I think there are two things professional and 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.770
 Useful 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.770
 at this time 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.560
 in his time as a player 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.560
 [Music] 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:16.100
 institution I think the hobby equal or 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:19.850
 more we are grateful 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.890
 I have very saved in my heart and 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:32.490
 honey, that's not lost this way 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:36.950
 I say is professional and I'm ready to 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:40.939
 deliver immediately when called 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.660
 developed recalls that the classic 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.790
 martino 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.790
 [Music] 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.130
 so that's why it's the memory of how 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.979
 they are player times 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.000
 they are things that when you pass to the other 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.000
 stage that follows 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.080
 at that time it was very unfortunate for 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.480
 the then state we in tigers 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.620
 for everything that party represented 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.670
 a hobby for a whole classic 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.670
 but good life continues
