00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730

different<00:03:28.150> platforms<00:03:28.600> and<00:03:28.750> whatnot<00:03:29.049> so<00:03:29.079> it

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
different platforms and whatnot so it

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.960 
different platforms and whatnot so it
took<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.739> while<00:03:29.889> but<00:03:30.160> starting<00:03:30.579> early<00:03:30.850> and

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
took a while but starting early and

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.080 
took a while but starting early and
gradually<00:03:31.359> building<00:03:31.690> ah<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:33.280> would<00:03:33.639> say<00:03:33.760> keep

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
gradually building ah I would say keep

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.210 
gradually building ah I would say keep
it<00:03:34.239> simple<00:03:34.569> keep<00:03:34.600> it<00:03:34.930> as<00:03:35.109> self-explanatory<00:03:35.680> as

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
it simple keep it as self-explanatory as

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.830 
it simple keep it as self-explanatory as
possible<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:36.880> that's<00:03:37.030> by<00:03:37.180> having<00:03:37.510> a<00:03:37.600> strong

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
possible and that's by having a strong

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.080 
possible and that's by having a strong
brand<00:03:38.139> I<00:03:38.290> think<00:03:38.680> when<00:03:38.889> potential<00:03:39.609> TV

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
brand I think when potential TV

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.819 
brand I think when potential TV
production<00:03:40.569> companies<00:03:40.900> or<00:03:41.079> advertisers<00:03:41.650> go

production companies or advertisers go
to<00:03:41.889> my<00:03:42.069> site<00:03:42.250> they<00:03:42.670> get<00:03:42.880> right<00:03:43.120> away<00:03:43.329> what<00:03:43.569> I'm

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
to my site they get right away what I'm

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.720 
to my site they get right away what I'm
about<00:03:43.780> what<00:03:44.319> type<00:03:44.500> of<00:03:44.530> audience<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.220> represent

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
about what type of audience I represent

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.580 
about what type of audience I represent
the<00:03:46.090> type<00:03:46.239> of<00:03:46.269> things<00:03:46.510> I<00:03:46.600> do<00:03:46.660> they<00:03:47.139> watch<00:03:47.350> five

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
the type of things I do they watch five

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.740 
the type of things I do they watch five
seconds<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.069> a<00:03:48.160> video<00:03:48.370> clip<00:03:48.549> they<00:03:48.940> get<00:03:49.090> it<00:03:49.239> so<00:03:49.720> I

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
seconds of a video clip they get it so I

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.660 
seconds of a video clip they get it so I
think<00:03:50.170> there's<00:03:50.410> no<00:03:50.560> not<00:03:50.889> necessarily<00:03:51.430> the

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
think there's no not necessarily the

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.610 
think there's no not necessarily the
need<00:03:51.880> to<00:03:52.030> have<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.209> long<00:03:52.510> detailed<00:03:52.989> explanation

need to have a long detailed explanation
sometimes<00:03:54.220> showing<00:03:54.609> is<00:03:54.790> more<00:03:55.120> than<00:03:55.269> telling

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
sometimes showing is more than telling

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.190 
sometimes showing is more than telling

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.270 
generic something dot blogspot com it's
something<00:04:43.840> to<00:04:44.199> consider<00:04:44.320> just<00:04:44.830> for<00:04:45.009> design

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
something to consider just for design
