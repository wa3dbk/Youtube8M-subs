I'm pulling my bun on too I'm going to

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.460 
I'm pulling my bun on too I'm going to
separate<00:03:48.910> this<00:03:49.090> into<00:03:49.150> three<00:03:49.720> strands<00:03:50.200> and<00:03:50.290> do

your regular three strand braid and I'm
going<00:03:53.140> to<00:03:53.200> go<00:03:53.350> all<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.620> way<00:03:53.769> down<00:03:53.830> until<00:03:54.400> I

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
going to go all the way down until I

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.280 
going to go all the way down until I
can't<00:03:54.970> braid<00:03:55.209> anymore

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.479 

secure<00:04:00.290> your<00:04:00.440> ends<00:04:00.739> with<00:04:00.860> a<00:04:00.890> little<00:04:01.160> small

secure your ends with a little small
elastic<00:04:01.819> and<00:04:02.360> then<00:04:02.599> we're<00:04:02.810> going<00:04:03.020> to<00:04:03.170> take

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
elastic and then we're going to take

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.070 
elastic and then we're going to take
that<00:04:04.310> top<00:04:04.580> part<00:04:04.849> where<00:04:05.090> we've<00:04:05.239> twisted<00:04:05.750> on<00:04:05.959> our

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
that top part where we've twisted on our

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.500 
that top part where we've twisted on our
heavier<00:04:06.380> or<00:04:06.470> our<00:04:06.739> fringe<00:04:07.040> side<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:07.730> I'm<00:04:08.180> going

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
heavier or our fringe side and I'm going

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.120 
heavier or our fringe side and I'm going
to<00:04:08.540> take<00:04:09.050> this<00:04:09.260> into<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.680> underneath<00:04:10.069> part

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
to take this into the underneath part

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.160 
to take this into the underneath part
where<00:04:10.459> we<00:04:10.489> haven't<00:04:10.790> braided<00:04:11.239> yet<00:04:11.390> I'm<00:04:11.599> going

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
where we haven't braided yet I'm going

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.620 
where we haven't braided yet I'm going
to<00:04:12.260> incorporate<00:04:12.680> my<00:04:13.310> twist<00:04:13.760> into<00:04:14.030> a<00:04:14.330> regular

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
to incorporate my twist into a regular

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.659 
to incorporate my twist into a regular
three<00:04:15.080> strand<00:04:15.110> braid<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:16.010> I'm<00:04:16.370> going<00:04:16.639> to

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
three strand braid and I'm going to

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.460 
three strand braid and I'm going to
three<00:04:16.910> strand<00:04:17.209> braid<00:04:17.269> this<00:04:17.630> all<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:18.139> way<00:04:18.169> down

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
three strand braid this all the way down

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.349 
three strand braid this all the way down
so<00:04:18.739> it<00:04:18.859> kind<00:04:19.040> of<00:04:19.130> flows<00:04:19.400> from<00:04:19.639> a<00:04:19.760> twist<00:04:20.030> braid

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
so it kind of flows from a twist braid

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.080 
so it kind of flows from a twist braid
down<00:04:20.870> into<00:04:21.320> our<00:04:21.440> three<00:04:21.680> strand<00:04:21.980> braid<00:04:22.070> then<00:04:22.880> go

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
down into our three strand braid then go

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.000 
down into our three strand braid then go
back<00:04:23.240> in<00:04:23.510> with<00:04:23.570> a<00:04:23.750> clear<00:04:24.139> elastic<00:04:24.169> and<00:04:24.980> secure

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
back in with a clear elastic and secure

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.340 
back in with a clear elastic and secure
the<00:04:25.700> very<00:04:25.970> end<00:04:26.180> of<00:04:26.419> it<00:04:26.600> so<00:04:26.840> it<00:04:26.930> doesn't<00:04:26.990> go

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
the very end of it so it doesn't go

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.800 
the very end of it so it doesn't go
anywhere<00:04:27.880> then<00:04:28.880> I'm<00:04:29.000> going<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.270> take<00:04:29.330> both<00:04:29.780> of

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
anywhere then I'm going to take both of

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.750 
anywhere then I'm going to take both of
my<00:04:30.080> braids<00:04:30.380> kind<00:04:30.860> of<00:04:31.010> right<00:04:31.280> next<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.669> each

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
my braids kind of right next to each

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.159 
my braids kind of right next to each
other<00:04:31.910> and<00:04:32.150> I'm<00:04:32.240> going<00:04:32.419> to<00:04:32.479> twirl<00:04:32.690> them<00:04:32.930> back

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
other and I'm going to twirl them back

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.340 
other and I'm going to twirl them back
and<00:04:33.410> away<00:04:33.500> from<00:04:33.889> my<00:04:34.040> face<00:04:34.280> into<00:04:34.639> a<00:04:34.760> circular

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
and away from my face into a circular

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.870 
and away from my face into a circular
motion<00:04:36.350> that<00:04:36.919> way<00:04:37.100> it's<00:04:37.250> going<00:04:37.400> to<00:04:37.520> create<00:04:37.700> our

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
motion that way it's going to create our

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.370 
motion that way it's going to create our
little<00:04:38.090> braids<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:38.510> you<00:04:38.600> can<00:04:38.750> tuck<00:04:38.960> your<00:04:39.110> ends

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
little braids and you can tuck your ends

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.810 
little braids and you can tuck your ends
up<00:04:39.500> and<00:04:39.710> under<00:04:39.950> so<00:04:40.070> you<00:04:40.160> don't<00:04:40.310> have<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.610> worry

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
up and under so you don't have to worry

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.580 
up and under so you don't have to worry
about<00:04:41.030> your<00:04:41.389> straight<00:04:41.690> part<00:04:41.930> spraying<00:04:42.350> out

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
about your straight part spraying out

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.890 
about your straight part spraying out
then<00:04:43.310> all<00:04:43.580> you<00:04:43.700> have<00:04:43.729> to<00:04:44.000> do<00:04:44.120> is<00:04:44.360> grab<00:04:44.570> some

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
then all you have to do is grab some

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.020 
then all you have to do is grab some
hair<00:04:45.110> colored<00:04:45.440> bobby<00:04:45.889> pin<00:04:46.160> and<00:04:46.400> start<00:04:46.820> pinning

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
at the sides until you feel like your

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.190 
at the sides until you feel like your
bun<00:04:49.430> is<00:04:49.610> nice<00:04:49.790> and<00:04:49.970> secure<00:04:50.389> and<00:04:50.419> that<00:04:50.660> it's<00:04:51.050> not

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
bun is nice and secure and that it's not

00:04:51.200 --> 00:05:01.420 
bun is nice and secure and that it's not
going<00:04:51.440> to<00:04:51.560> go<00:04:51.710> anywhere

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.100 

when<00:05:02.150> you're<00:05:02.270> done<00:05:02.420> with<00:05:02.570> that<00:05:02.600> our<00:05:02.900> final

when you're done with that our final

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.780 
when you're done with that our final
step<00:05:03.440> is<00:05:03.590> to<00:05:03.740> go<00:05:03.830> to<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:04.040> other<00:05:04.160> side<00:05:04.490> where<00:05:04.670> we

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
step is to go to the other side where we

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.600 
step is to go to the other side where we
