00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
line that's going around that's where

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.110 
line that's going around that's where
your<00:04:04.410> missiles<00:04:04.709> gonna<00:04:04.890> go<00:04:05.130> so<00:04:05.850> let's<00:04:05.970> go<00:04:06.060> ahead

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
your missiles gonna go so let's go ahead

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
there kill them all right and that is

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.740 
there kill them all right and that is
basically<00:04:11.220> how<00:04:11.609> you<00:04:11.819> play<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.239> game<00:04:12.269> the

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
basically how you play the game the

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.289 
basically how you play the game the
object<00:04:12.900> is<00:04:13.440> to<00:04:14.130> get<00:04:14.280> your<00:04:14.489> humans<00:04:14.880> into<00:04:15.180> the

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
object is to get your humans into the

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.610 
object is to get your humans into the
turret<00:04:15.510> before<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.829> zombies<00:04:17.280> kill<00:04:17.579> you<00:04:17.820> and

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
turret before the zombies kill you and

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.229 
turret before the zombies kill you and
there<00:04:19.620> we<00:04:19.709> go<00:04:19.799> we're<00:04:19.950> on<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.160> second<00:04:20.430> level<00:04:20.549> so

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
there we go we're on the second level so

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.310 
there we go we're on the second level so
now<00:04:21.390> I'm<00:04:21.570> gonna<00:04:21.720> know

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
now I'm gonna know

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.210 
now I'm gonna know
one<00:04:22.800> level<00:04:23.070> three<00:04:23.670> there<00:04:24.180> is<00:04:24.330> 20<00:04:24.960> levels<00:04:25.620> per

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
one level three there is 20 levels per

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.590 
one level three there is 20 levels per
world<00:04:26.490> and<00:04:26.760> I<00:04:26.820> think<00:04:27.060> there's<00:04:27.180> like<00:04:27.330> five

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
world and I think there's like five

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.140
