00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 hello very good everyone I'm a machine and 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.650
 we are here in new video of people like that 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.040
 with line we are here with subscribers and 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.910
 this is a new departure of airplanes 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.009
 or cars plans against platform or 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.809
 a platform against cars and planes 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.240
 birds and I have time to kill someone 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.130
 because it seems to me that there is one up 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.710
 of the platform already and it's not going to let me 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.720
 do absolutely nothing we go there to what 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.810
 kamikaze or first let's do the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.279
 espionage round to see what there is for 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.009
 up here to see if I can pass 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.110
 cleanly so it seems I can not 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.450
 pass clean I can go through the middle and 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.960
 be on both sides that are living 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.860
 that car you are living then they have 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.899
 killed has not killed one but you have 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.370
 What's down, let's go there in guys 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.289
 we have to kill the last one at least 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.100
 if our manager has left me 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.750
 one is left a way by l I go for it 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.920
 come on, love 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.750
 comayagua I love I love having 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:07.270
 killed is not no one else we have 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:09.700
 got that next time I take a 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.530
 car because so it seems the 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.050
 planes are quite difficult we are 3 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.040
 against 3 we have managed to win and we are going 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.220
 to the next round 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.220
 law sca 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.820
 and explosions after we are in the 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.620
 second round we are going to take that precious 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.540
 tell me that there is from before although I believe 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.890
 that is better the perforating gun already 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.240
 that point when there is everything there 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.820
 of everything do not complain machine that says 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.860
 all Mexican shotgun tickets 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.590
 shotguns there's everything I'll start to 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.940
 jump start to be in front we're going to 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.000
 see what they do because I do not know exactly 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.330

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.610
 armored and armored mounted on both 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.310

 because the shotgun is brutal to kill 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.860
 whoever is inside will use 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.840
 the recuperator if I can do something to 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.620

 they are there very well we are here we are going 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.680
 to do that piece of strategy follow 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.480
 co-pilot and self-targeted go there 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.060

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.150
 managed to win now we go to the 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.880
 next round pim pam pim or in the 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.230
 moment as they come get it as 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.000
 come and do the same 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.549
 Shotguns or something even more powerful 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.310
 so that they do not kill us we go there already 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.900

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.130
 everything all everything all everything for me 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.680
 let's try to catch a sniper 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.880
 pull in the eye moment because they are going to 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.410
 start to come they will do the same 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.040
 strategy and three have been mounted in the 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:37.639
 same kid both in the same 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:41.120
 mounts are mounted on it I do not know that 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:44.020
 they are doing that they are going to do I is very 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:52.550
 difficult to burst from here 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:54.110
 because we are eye eye eye rotation is 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.300
 he has put co - pilot I can not do 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.400
 nothing I do not have pointed that is doing 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.560

 dead everything is not going to be perfect good 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.530
 Well, I think this is a bit absurd 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.300
 not the best of three rounds is the one 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.400
