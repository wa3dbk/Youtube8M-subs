00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
decided to get into the theme because

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.270 
decided to get into the theme because
why<00:00:41.100> not<00:00:41.390> why<00:00:42.390> not<00:00:42.559> ha<00:00:43.559> ha

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
why not why not ha ha

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.779

so I also wore my bikini because I

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.369 
so I also wore my bikini because I
figured<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.270> would<00:00:48.360> be<00:00:48.390> easier<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.960> tsa

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
figured it would be easier for the tsa

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.990 
figured it would be easier for the tsa
to<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> search<00:00:50.070> blah<00:00:50.399> blah<00:00:50.520> blah

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
to do a search blah blah blah

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.540 
to do a search blah blah blah
so<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.660> sure<00:00:52.020> hope<00:00:52.289> while<00:00:52.920> we're<00:00:53.039> traveling<00:00:53.219> in

was built by Dom he is someone from our
Channel<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.350> he<00:04:19.530> built<00:04:19.710> the<00:04:19.830> entire<00:04:20.130> map

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
Channel and he built the entire map

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:28.520 
Channel and he built the entire map
and<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:21.870> looks<00:04:22.080> super<00:04:22.620> awesome<00:04:27.260> so<00:04:28.260> what<00:04:28.410> we're

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
and it looks super awesome so what we're

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.710 
and it looks super awesome so what we're
gonna<00:04:28.620> do<00:04:28.860> now<00:04:29.250> is<00:04:29.580> we're<00:04:30.000> going<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.210> split<00:04:30.570> off

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
gonna do now is we're going to split off

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.320 
gonna do now is we're going to split off
into<00:04:30.990> smaller<00:04:31.980> groups<00:04:32.220> because<00:04:32.760> a<00:04:32.910> group<00:04:33.090> of

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
into smaller groups because a group of

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.670 
into smaller groups because a group of
seven<00:04:33.780> is<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:34.170> bit<00:04:34.350> large<00:04:34.680> for<00:04:35.040> a<00:04:35.070> whole<00:04:35.490> episode

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
seven is a bit large for a whole episode

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.670 
seven is a bit large for a whole episode
so<00:04:37.680> I<00:04:37.710> guess<00:04:37.950> we'll<00:04:38.220> we'll<00:04:38.400> see<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:38.640> guys<00:04:38.670> soon
