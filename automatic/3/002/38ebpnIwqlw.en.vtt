00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.720
 good then let's release 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.570
 our terminal 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.820
 that is to say that now I put the link in 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.780
 the comments 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:18.189
 the meter on the page out and 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.880
 here at point 5 where he puts samsung 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:20.880
 galaxy s 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.190
 ice and ice download 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:35.090
 if you download it from your mobile 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.090
 Well, we open 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.510
 application that we have from my file 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.250
 to explore the file 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.250
 we give hard 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.590
 and here we have the application 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.770
 that we have come down 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.770
 we give him 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.610
 we install it 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.730
 we open it 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.570
 he asks us for superuser's permission 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.730
 we give to allow 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.320
 if you open this 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.229
 and we give a crazy 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.650
 and we give first point 1 that we 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.470
 does the backing of him 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.010
 from the folder of the fs that is very 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.450
 important for the subject of mail and others 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.450
 first we gave him yes 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.290
 I already have a copy 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.610
 saying I know what to rename ok 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.610
 then we give 2 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.910
 and it tells us that if we want it 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.910
 unlock we say yes 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.989
 and I think you have to restart 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.560
 effectively 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.870
 it restarts and already once it starts 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.420
 well 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.760
 we already have the released mobile can 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.210
 put any card of any 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.920
 company and ready that easy 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.250
 nothing of her store that costs us a 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.250
 packet
