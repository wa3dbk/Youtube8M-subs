per<00:05:36.460> gallon<00:05:36.759> better<00:05:36.999> v6<00:05:37.629> to<00:05:37.899> v6<00:05:38.110> now<00:05:38.620> there<00:05:38.770> is

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
per gallon better v6 to v6 now there is

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.219 
per gallon better v6 to v6 now there is
a<00:05:38.889> 4-cylinder<00:05:39.879> available<00:05:40.479> but<00:05:40.689> it<00:05:40.960> gets

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
a 4-cylinder available but it gets

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.320

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.929 
basically the same fuel economy as a v6
so<00:05:43.599> why<00:05:43.990> would<00:05:44.349> you<00:05:44.529> ever<00:05:44.860> bother<00:05:45.430> with<00:05:45.699> that
