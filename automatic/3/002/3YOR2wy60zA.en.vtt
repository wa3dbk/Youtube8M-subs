00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
how's it going everyone is GAD it's boy

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:05.990 
how's it going everyone is GAD it's boy
and<00:00:04.799> in<00:00:04.920> this<00:00:04.980> video<00:00:05.130> we'll<00:00:05.310> be<00:00:05.370> taking<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.819> look

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
and in this video we'll be taking a look

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.190 
and in this video we'll be taking a look
at<00:00:06.259> iRobot<00:00:07.259> Ava<00:00:07.589> 500<00:00:08.460> so<00:00:08.670> this<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.510> some<00:00:10.019> sort

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
at iRobot Ava 500 so this is some sort

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.049 
at iRobot Ava 500 so this is some sort
of<00:00:10.260> robotic<00:00:10.590> system<00:00:11.130> it's<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.610> collaboration

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
of robotic system it's a collaboration

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.519 
of robotic system it's a collaboration
with<00:00:12.330> Cisco<00:00:12.840> he<00:00:13.380> uses<00:00:13.679> Cisco's<00:00:14.099> px<00:00:14.670> 60

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:15.529 
with Cisco he uses Cisco's px 60

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:17.540 
with Cisco he uses Cisco's px 60
teleconferencing<00:00:16.529> system<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.220> monitor

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
teleconferencing system so the monitor

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.310 
teleconferencing system so the monitor
we<00:00:17.640> can<00:00:17.670> actually<00:00:17.940> see<00:00:18.270> there<00:00:18.480> he's<00:00:18.900> mounted

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
we can actually see there he's mounted

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.140 
we can actually see there he's mounted
at<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.439> camera<00:00:19.770> rounders<00:00:20.039> at<00:00:20.130> 21.5<00:00:20.640> each

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
at the camera rounders at 21.5 each

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.599 
at the camera rounders at 21.5 each
display<00:00:21.570> we<00:00:22.439> speak<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.949> their<00:00:23.039> microphone

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
display we speak and their microphone

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.820 
display we speak and their microphone
and<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.900> neck<00:00:25.109> action<00:00:25.439> allows<00:00:25.650> it

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
and so on and the neck action allows it

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.640 
and so on and the neck action allows it
to<00:00:25.859> move<00:00:26.070> up<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.400> down<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:26.580> here<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:27.390> a

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
to move up and down so here just a

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.689 
to move up and down so here just a
different<00:00:28.650> eye<00:00:28.740> level<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.279> if<00:00:29.369> you're<00:00:29.519> taller

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
different eye level so if you're taller

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.970 
different eye level so if you're taller
than<00:00:29.820> me<00:00:29.939> or<00:00:30.300> whoever<00:00:30.990> height<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.679> are<00:00:31.800> you'll

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
than me or whoever height you are you'll

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.560 
than me or whoever height you are you'll
be<00:00:32.040> able<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.279> adjust<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.450> all

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
be able to adjust it and this is all

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.120 
be able to adjust it and this is all
controlled<00:00:33.989> by<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.230> actual<00:00:34.590> user<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.040> a

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
controlled by the actual user in a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.280 
controlled by the actual user in a
remote<00:00:35.399> location<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.660> guy<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.079> see<00:00:37.200> on

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
remote location so the guy we can see on

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.170 
remote location so the guy we can see on
the<00:00:37.380> screen<00:00:37.649> now<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.829> actually<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.550> another

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
the screen now is actually in another

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.729 
the screen now is actually in another
part<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> world<00:00:39.660> entirely<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.620> it's

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
part of the world entirely and it's

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.400 
part of the world entirely and it's
communicated<00:00:41.370> with<00:00:41.520> us<00:00:41.550> directly<00:00:42.450> thanks<00:00:43.320> to

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
communicated with us directly thanks to

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.110 
communicated with us directly thanks to
the<00:00:43.500> Wi-Fi<00:00:43.860> connectivity<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.760> internet

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
the Wi-Fi connectivity and internet

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.180 
the Wi-Fi connectivity and internet
connectivity<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.780> general<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:46.980> thing

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
connectivity in general so this thing

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.650 
connectivity in general so this thing
can<00:00:47.340> move<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.760> two<00:00:47.879> different<00:00:48.000> places<00:00:48.360> and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
can move in two different places and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.209 
can move in two different places and
different<00:00:48.750> locations<00:00:48.989> uses<00:00:49.950> different

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
different locations uses different

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.430 
different locations uses different
sensors<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.059> mapping<00:00:51.629> technology<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.289> be

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
sensors and mapping technology to be

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.760 
sensors and mapping technology to be
able<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.800> find<00:00:53.340> his<00:00:53.460> way<00:00:53.489> around<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.420> actual

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
able to find his way around the actual

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.900 
able to find his way around the actual
location<00:00:55.770> where<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:56.100> at<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.309> maybe<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:56.850> in

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
location where it's at so maybe it's in

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.670 
location where it's at so maybe it's in
an<00:00:57.000> office<00:00:57.329> or<00:00:57.930> wherever<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.350> want<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.559> have

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
an office or wherever you want to have

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.439 
an office or wherever you want to have
it<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.920> you'll<00:00:59.340> be<00:00:59.370> able<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.670> move<00:00:59.879> around<00:01:00.059> as

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
it in you'll be able to move around as

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.060 
it in you'll be able to move around as
you<00:01:00.660> wish<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.800> actually<00:01:01.859> be

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
you wish so this can actually be

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.740 
you wish so this can actually be
controlled<00:01:02.399> by<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.059> simple<00:01:03.239> iPad

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
controlled by just a simple iPad

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.710 
controlled by just a simple iPad
application<00:01:04.409> by<00:01:04.830> iRobot<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.820> what<00:01:06.570> this

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
application by iRobot so what this

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.920 
application by iRobot so what this
device<00:01:07.650> itself<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.189> actual<00:01:08.640> robot<00:01:08.930> itself

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
device itself the actual robot itself

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.520 
device itself the actual robot itself
can<00:01:10.200> do<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.740> map<00:01:11.250> its<00:01:11.700> location<00:01:12.450> by<00:01:13.260> just

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
can do is map its location by just

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.080 
can do is map its location by just
scanning<00:01:13.799> around<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.670> can<00:01:14.700> tag

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
scanning around and then you can tag

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.880 
scanning around and then you can tag
different<00:01:15.750> locations<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.470> example<00:01:16.799> you

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
different locations so for example you

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.730 
different locations so for example you
can<00:01:16.979> tag<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.369> stage<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.509> tag<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.320> corner

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
can tag the stage you can tag the corner

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.289 
can tag the stage you can tag the corner
you<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.310> tag<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.729> parts<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.150> lecture

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
you can tag the parts of the lecture

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.999 
you can tag the parts of the lecture
theater<00:01:21.720> for<00:01:21.869> example<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.409> can<00:01:22.560> tag<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.890> all

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
theater for example you can tag it all

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.830 
theater for example you can tag it all
there<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:23.520> easy<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.939> man<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.299> to

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
there so it's easy to man you to

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.080 
there so it's easy to man you to
maneuver<00:01:25.080> around<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.860> all<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.729> need<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.970> do

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
maneuver around and all you need to do

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.120 
maneuver around and all you need to do
is<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.330> make<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.810> call<00:01:28.439> when<00:01:28.650> you're<00:01:28.799> ready<00:01:28.829> to

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
is just make a call when you're ready to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.830 
is just make a call when you're ready to
actually<00:01:29.220> connect<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.000> someone<00:01:30.210> else<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.600> when

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
actually connect to someone else so when

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.300 
actually connect to someone else so when
you're<00:01:30.930> ready<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.590> simply<00:01:31.890> make<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.070> call

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
you're ready you simply make a call

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.700 
you're ready you simply make a call
press<00:01:32.549> GO<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.900> makes<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.229> connection<00:01:34.350> to

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
press GO and it makes a connection to

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.990 
press GO and it makes a connection to
the<00:01:34.799> remote<00:01:35.040> location<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.610> you've<00:01:35.790> selected

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the remote location that you've selected

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.690

on the list of available locations that
you've<00:01:38.880> got<00:01:39.180> which<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.840> pretty<00:01:40.259> nifty

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
you've got which is pretty nifty

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.100 
you've got which is pretty nifty
actually<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.130> really<00:01:41.700> likely<00:01:41.970> system<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.630> mean

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
actually a really likely system I mean

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.990 
actually a really likely system I mean
the<00:01:43.200> potential<00:01:43.649> for<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.100> endless<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.850> mean

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
the potential for this is endless I mean

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.670 
the potential for this is endless I mean
doctors<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.509> use<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.899> for<00:01:46.020> example<00:01:46.290> to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
doctors to use it for example to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.630 
doctors to use it for example to
remotely<00:01:47.610> look<00:01:48.119> at<00:01:48.299> their<00:01:48.450> patients<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.799> a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
remotely look at their patients in a

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.160 
remotely look at their patients in a
nursing<00:01:51.000> home<00:01:51.030> for<00:01:51.149> example<00:01:51.750> doctors<00:01:52.049> don't

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
nursing home for example doctors don't

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.139 
nursing home for example doctors don't
have<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.470> visit<00:01:52.619> very<00:01:53.009> often<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.909> they<00:01:54.000> can

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
have to visit very often and they can

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.270 
have to visit very often and they can
simply<00:01:54.390> map<00:01:54.600> their<00:01:54.780> way<00:01:54.930> out<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.280> connect

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
simply map their way out and connect

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.370 
simply map their way out and connect
remotely<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.880> do<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.360> because<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.229> is

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
remotely and do so because this is

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.020 
remotely and do so because this is
connected<00:01:58.619> via<00:01:58.920> Wi-Fi<00:01:59.159> or<00:01:59.460> Internet<00:01:59.640> in

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
actually see the quality of the display

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.920 
actually see the quality of the display
and<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.430> conversation<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.549> little<00:02:06.299> or<00:02:06.509> no<00:02:06.540> lag

with is the visual quality of the actual
conferencing<00:02:23.209> system<00:02:23.599> there<00:02:23.810> what<00:02:24.170> we<00:02:24.230> can

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
conferencing system there what we can

remote<00:02:30.680> part<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.549> the<00:02:31.609> world<00:02:31.730> which<00:02:32.719> I<00:02:32.989> have<00:02:33.230> no

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
remote part of the world which I have no

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:34.809 
remote part of the world which I have no
idea<00:02:33.680> where<00:02:33.829> that<00:02:33.859> was<00:02:34.069> but<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.459> definitely

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
idea where that was but it definitely

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.390 
idea where that was but it definitely
wasn't<00:02:34.969> in<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.180> building<00:02:35.450> where<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:35.810> was<00:02:36.400> but

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
wasn't in that building where I was but

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.670 
wasn't in that building where I was but
yes<00:02:37.579> you<00:02:37.760> can<00:02:37.819> easily<00:02:38.209> do<00:02:38.389> that<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:38.780> once<00:02:39.530> it's

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
yes you can easily do that so once it's

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.440 
yes you can easily do that so once it's
mapped<00:02:39.889> at<00:02:40.069> these<00:02:40.219> locations<00:02:40.579> using<00:02:41.299> the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
mapped at these locations using the

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.809 
mapped at these locations using the
sensors<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.169> whatnot<00:02:42.530> then<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.400> can<00:02:43.549> control

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
sensors and whatnot then you can control

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.879 
sensors and whatnot then you can control
it<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.150> be<00:02:44.419> whatever<00:02:44.599> you<00:02:44.780> want<00:02:44.959> remotely<00:02:45.409> but

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:45.889 
it and be whatever you want remotely but

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:47.440 
it and be whatever you want remotely but
this<00:02:46.129> conduc<00:02:46.459> itself<00:02:46.849> it<00:02:46.969> lasts<00:02:47.150> for<00:02:47.269> six

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
this conduc itself it lasts for six

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.899 
this conduc itself it lasts for six
hours<00:02:47.569> if<00:02:48.560> companies<00:02:49.159> wanting<00:02:49.519> it<00:02:49.609> can<00:02:49.730> lease

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
hours if companies wanting it can lease

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.550 
hours if companies wanting it can lease
it<00:02:49.939> for<00:02:50.209> between<00:02:50.599> 2000<00:02:51.349> to<00:02:51.609> 2.5<00:02:52.609> k<00:02:53.290> per<00:02:54.290> month

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
it for between 2000 to 2.5 k per month

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.649 
it for between 2000 to 2.5 k per month
so<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.400> do<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.819> map<00:02:56.000> sandwich<00:02:56.359> that's<00:02:56.540> gonna

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
so you do the map sandwich that's gonna

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.599 
so you do the map sandwich that's gonna
work<00:02:56.840> out<00:02:57.019> a<00:02:57.049> year<00:02:57.349> to<00:02:57.980> work<00:02:58.159> out<00:02:58.370> how
