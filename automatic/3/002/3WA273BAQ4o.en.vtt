 What to give a little something to my mother I saw a lot of bulk bags to children's films 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:22.170
 When it is hard to cover, it is a water, sugar, and each white tower is eaten with the defendant's 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:27.449
 It's a replica. Oh, ah, sugar . I used to be familiar with it.

 What are you doing set up these days, even the killer who kills my body? 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:36.870
 I listen to the sound iteusijyo sugar has long lived in the water 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.739
 If you want to live healthily long and healthy longer then you have a lot of sugar 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.210
 Please insert it. 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.829
 I do not need it. That's what matters to me. Oh, that 's it . 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.399
 I knew the business. 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:52.739
 Oh so in the past I ate 2p not the reason that these days so stressed 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.390

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:03.120
 I know too well now so I hammered a typical electronic Sugar Sugar yet 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:08.130
 This is a natural food shipped from sugar cane or tang. 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.729
 Originally it was extracted from there and processed and refined carbohydrates 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.780
 is 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:17.520
 There are a lot of people who do not know that it is a carbohydrate . 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:21.600
 Yes, and carbon and many others, among which glucose and fructose are one to one 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.729
 If you remember the 4th thing that is mixed, there are so many of them. 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.759
 I'm sorry . 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.759
 5 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:34.010
 Oh, yeah. Now , why do you lead to sugar? Sugar is an addict. 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.000
 The 4 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:42.260
 For example, salt is a duplication of salt, which I do not know 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.610
 Go slowly reducing the deokhu per day by eating. It narcissism might dream 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:51.110
 I can cut down a lot of wood in the woods . 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.800
 Even when I eat and keep reducing the food often unknowingly associated with sugar 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.410
 I will eat 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:00.520
 Oh flaw words can say and even how to look cool than ever if progress addiction 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.520
 There ah ah ah 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.740
 5 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:11.260
 The more you eat sugar, the more sugar you lose. 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:17.019
 As there is glucose revealed in the fact that I now director Heb. 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:21.970
 The energy source for that brain and nerve cells is not everything else , it's glucose. 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:26.920
 When you look at it , it seems that eating the sugar makes the prototype better, 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:30.760
 I saw I ate so little feel-good drugs did so the bear will 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:35.560
 That's right. When you eat a bang, your blood sugar rises. 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:40.660
 Now it's because of glucose . When I'm all up in the sugar, 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:44.620
 I've been promoted waenya equalize just enough r100 100 or less 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.959
 If the insulin to go up the street to be a friend of insulin is suspended lost me 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.540
 As insulin lowers blood sugar 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:56.620
 So you 're in hypoglycemia. So, the reason I ate sugar is feeling good. 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:01.120
 Gonna eat you try to use as an energy source is complete Lin mutual friend so cloudy outside party 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:05.950
 And then we're letting it go again. 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:10.510
 I fell right to stand in the blood so that the blood sugar fast foods gathered allocation 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:14.290
 You'll find it. It's also elastic. Sugar. You find something like this. Eat it again. 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:18.190
 Now the collision of the sugar and the argument is a match. 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.120
 Ribbed ingredient per loosen it contains, such as insulin, which live in completely Ching 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.120
 Insulin or minutes 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:29.040
 Oh art, and whatever English is full 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:34.830
 It's a lot of insulin when you are young. 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.989
 Why do I think I'm a little bit difficult to come out with a lot of the artists 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.099
 Parents after a sharp induction 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:44.220
 It gets caught in an adult island, and marshmallow 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:48.989
 Now the pancreas is very difficult, and the vagina gets into the diabetes . 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:53.819
 We see aging as a stage of inflammation . 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:57.720
 By that sugar, that cell of our body will now have a membrane . 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:02.010
 The new array is dead. The fascia causes protein glycosylation. 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.090
 So that's what's going to change, so the function of the cells in our body 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.640
 I'm falling. 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:11.940
 So, it 's a good idea. 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:16.200
 What you did not even look that the sugar preparation 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.100
 But now I thought I should have been more careful as I pointed it at the main place 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.229
 To 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:26.669
 No I'm not Dr. nimdeul we knew bar table set're so bad 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:29.310
 So try out during'll now have not just now say sugar 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:33.510
 When you eat, you feel better and you feel more excited. 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.650
 But those who do not know, those who have a lot of tongue, 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.550
 seams like 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.210
 Oh, you say you eat sugar eat kkotdaji dressed serotonin in the body 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.690
 I am. 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:49.150
 The secretion of serotonin feel so good, then continue reminiscing sweetness eat rattling 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:51.250
 Sweet will be buying Yes So when you feel good tips on each stam past 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.449
 I had to eat a lot of sweetness. 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.160
 If the sweetness you think any problem is to suppress anxiety becomes irritated as next 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:01.539
 Violence is less focused. 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:06.880
 It's called Sugar Coast Depression . 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:12.130
 Oh, well, I guess I'm going to forget about it . Why not? It's insulin. 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:16.780
 Actually, we lower the blood sugar and keep our body. 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:21.639
 If you look at it later, you will develop resistance to insulin. 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:26.860
 Saenggimyeon John Gartner of the sol of both lift the bottles Korean horrible examples later 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:30.250
 It is about twice as bad as cancer or bad disease. 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.880
 5 is not easy to think sugar 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:39.009
 It's been a while since I started changing my age. 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:45.160
 Not yet. 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:47.770
 Going places these days sometimes sell ppokppokyi quality Oh, I'm standing there knowing Line 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.300
 So that's why we 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:55.599
 For me that's plow did not put up one or two dogs life on each librarian 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.020
 But we already have a very addictive joint venture 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.020
 Oligo 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.880
 5 ah
