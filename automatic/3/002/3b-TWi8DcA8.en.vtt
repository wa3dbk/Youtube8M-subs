00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.280
 handling of dental instruments to avoid contamination 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.700
 the first step is the selection of the instruments this can be classified 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.900
 according to its composition 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.849
 metallic 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:14.700
 glasses 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.730
 plastics 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.009
 etc 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:18.300
 to its category 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.300
 microsurgery all in a row 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.160
 operative 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.429
 etc 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:27.089
 or according to the potential risk of infection in critical critics and 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.769
 no critics 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.529
 critical materials 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.950
 are the surgical instruments used for invasive processes in 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:36.150
 soft tissues 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.040
 or that or dental structures including those used to remove the plate 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.000
 calculations 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.280
 the fce tera 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.990
 these instruments must be strictly sterile for each 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.660
 utilization so they must have physical characteristics 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.390
 chemical and mechanical that allow to resist the different treatments 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.740
 sterilization 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.690
 semi-critical materials 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.769
 instruments that do not penetrate soft tissues 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.190
 neither bone nor tooth structures 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.260
 but they are in contact with oral tissues 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.650
 Dynamic instruments hand piece are also included 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.700
 against Angle 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.600
 ultrasound 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.310
 those instruments that may have contact with fluids such as saliva 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.470
 opus blood and even the optical fibers of the photo polymerization lamp 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.520
 non-critical materials are those instruments and devices that have 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.220
 Contact with the intact skin like the surfaces of the unit the lamps 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.510
 except fiber optic x-ray apparatus and others 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.540
 furniture that presents a lower risk of transmission of infection 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.370
 treatment of critical and semi critical material 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.120
 decontamination 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.120
 the objective 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.130
 is to reduce the initial contamination and allow a manipulation of the 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.940
 instrumental without danger 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.440
 in this way to protect the personnel that manipulates and the environment 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.910
 its action is bacteriostatic 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.840
 among the products that can be used for this purpose are the 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.820
 products that juries like sodium hypochlorite 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.200
 etcetera with the inevitable consequence of corrosion 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.790
 the criteria to take into account to choose a useful product from 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.950
 decontamination should be antimicrobial efficacy 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.900
 regarding the physical and chemical characteristics of the material 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.909
 decontaminate 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.060
 no toxicity for staff 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.559
 Stable presentation and ease of handling 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:33.769
 the materials must be decontaminated immediately after their 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.429
 use by complete immersion 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:40.669
 The time will be indicated by the manufacturer of the selected product in 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:43.129
 general 10 to 15 minutes 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.819
 the composite instruments must be disarticulated and impregnated inside 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.899
 with the same product with the help of syringes 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:52.189
 later 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.999
 it is necessary to wash for five minutes with plenty of water and the lower temperature 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:01.479
 at 30 degrees to avoid the risk of fixation of protein substances 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.139
 In this way it is sought that the initial flora is inhibited and the viruses 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.889
 inactivated 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.019
 cleaning 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.650
 the objective of this second step is to obtain an instrumental 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.699
 microscopically clean 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:17.319
 that is, eliminate organic material 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.980
 blood 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.270
 Bone remains 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.180
 dental 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.129
 etc 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.099
 and inorganic waste that can facilitate the storage of 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:26.589
 microorganisms 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:30.569
 some instruments must follow a special process to avoid their 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.149
 deterioration and for this reason the indications given by the manufacturer in 

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:36.599
 The datasheet 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.870
 cleaning can be mechanical 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.759
 use of brushes 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:41.620
 chemistry 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.779
 detergents that only use waste or thermal 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:47.749
 means that accelerate the speed of cleaning 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:52.159
 in the dental office the method used is the manual 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.680
 This should be done with a plastic brush preferably to facilitate 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.889
 disinfection and with a non-corrosive and non-irritating liquid detergent 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.439
 Valid and citron infogis tampico 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.290
 eventually ultrasound can be used especially for the instrumental 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.219
 small 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:13.439
 The duration of the dive is different according to each manufacturer 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:18.479
 approximately 10 minutes followed by thorough washing and drying 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.049
 meticulous 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.930
 in the case of new instruments, a triple wash is always necessary 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.169
 before use 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:28.680
 after cleaning 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.909
 comes the conditioning for sterilization 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:35.870
 you should use a single crepe paper protector 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.780
 plastic polyethylene individual protection packages that allow a 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.100
 permeability of the sterilizing people and ensure the sterile maintenance of 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.979
 instrument 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.729
 until its use 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.270
 Before moving on to the next step, remember that you can not sterilize 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.270
 instrumental but it's perfectly clean 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.379
 sterilization 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:01.009
 the objective is to leave the instrument ready for use 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.889
 the elimination will be of microorganisms including spores 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.849
 among the most used methods September 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:10.689
 the autoclave 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:12.460
 Dry heat 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.279
 chemotherapy 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:18.839
 cold sterilization which should be used as a procedure 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:19.750
 alternative 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.050
 because it will never replace sterilization 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.910
 the control of sterilization cycles must be carried out 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.430
 periodically 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.270
 in the case of the autoclave 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.530
 there are bands that change their color indicating that the conditions of the cycle 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.379
 of sterilization are ideal 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.739
 also in the dry heat the temperature can be controlled by thermometers 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.129
 Finally 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.409
 you should pay attention to storage because it is so important 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.120
 like the same sterilization 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.259
 the storage place should be clean and fresh 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:58.440
 the instruments must be marked with the validity date of the sterile state 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:00.840
 as you can see 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.169
 currently available a range of both physical and chemical means 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:05.750
 broad 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.960
 to ensure our patients once
