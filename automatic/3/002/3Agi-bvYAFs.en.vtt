00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 all right 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.819
 in passive classes we draw the character 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.280
 or goku in all its angles and the day of 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.830
 today we will do a practice about these 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.410
 previous videos 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.779
 to begin we draw three divisions 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.540
 which are in the size of the head of 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.490
 Goku divided three times what 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.710
 we make here again a 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.180
 division the second division is within 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.380
 of the first division for something that 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.420
 we will explain further and therefore 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.880
 we draw this division in 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.030
 dotted and we also draw the line 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.280
 here of proportion and a three divisions 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.489
 more is to say that we will make three bodies of 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.879
 this character the second step will be 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.190
 sketch the shape of the head the shape 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.930
 of the body and the shapes of the legs 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.180
 which we said is a little shorter 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.190
 that the size of the third division well 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.449
 that we draw these legs a little bit 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.339
 shorter and in cylindrical shape we do 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.479
 the same with the second line that 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.400
 we had drawn and the body what 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.659
 we draw inside the head 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.280
 that's why we draw this line in 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.290
 dotted because the outline of the body 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.760
 is inside the head and we do the 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.890
 legs as we said a little bit more 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.630
 short that the third division that 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.270
 we had proposed this leg 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.700
 we seek to draw it in flexed form and 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.020
 we also do the same with the third 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.950
 line of proportion that we had 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.070
 drawn 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.560
 and we make the character in shape 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.780
 slightly sketched and we also do 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.729
 the arms looking for these to have more 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.229
 or less the length of the body and what 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.259
 we select in a very elementary way 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.840
 now we complain about it for it 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.700
 we make three divisions and in the division 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.759
 from up to the bottom of the head we draw 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.950
 two very close dots that are the 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.750
 eyes next we draw the curves 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.819
 that are around the eyes too 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.909
 we complain about the eyebrows and we'll do what 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.740
 same with the other two sketches now 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.299
 we are also going to sketch the shape of the 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.720
 head when we saw the head of three 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.720
 rooms 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.410
 we did this in a lot of detail now just 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.360
 we do it very quickly the nose 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.280
 very close to the eyes mouth too 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.830
 very close to the nose the ears 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.280
 quite large, big and close to the 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.060
 bank of the circle and we do this same 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.680
 with the others of the other two sketches 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.340
 in this case the head in front and here 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.500
 head again three quarters 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.930
 hair we draw on average five or 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.610
 six peaks inside the head and three 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.610
 peaks on one side of the head 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.810
 and after the other side of the head 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.190
 four peaks 1 2 3 and 4 and we do what 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.530
 same with the other sketches 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.750
 then we begin to detail the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.940
 arms and clothes remember that the arms 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.550
 they were made up of three divisions and 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.770
 that the clothes increased the volume a little 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.140
 of the body we also draw the ribbon 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.500
 which is at the center of the body we detail 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.530
 the shoes and we repeat the same process 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.510
 in the other two figures with a camera 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.489
 accelerated 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.010
 to finish we detail the hands of 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.450
 one of our sketches and also 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.060
 we draw the tail that is the last 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.920
 detail that we lacked until this point 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.750
 the most correct thing is that the whole drawing 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.299
 you have done pencil because it is the sketch 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.459
 we add to finish a new sheet 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.409
 to clean and detail one of our 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.329
 sketches we choose for it the sketch 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.129
 that was on our right and what 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.599
 we began to detail almost without leaving 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.390
 of the sketch that we have already drawn 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.250
 initially remember that this class 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.629
 Its purpose is to review and see in 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.359
 practice the videos that previously 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.799
 we saw about this character using of 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.540
 the proportions and forms that before 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.849
 we study we can start moving the 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.690
 figure and achieve amazing drawings in 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.920
 Little time 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.480
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.480
 fun until next time
