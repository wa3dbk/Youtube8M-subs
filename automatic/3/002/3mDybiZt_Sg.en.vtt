00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
hole and then I put in some you know

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.549 
hole and then I put in some you know
2-inch<00:00:49.860> screws<00:00:50.160> very<00:00:51.149> simple<00:00:51.629> not<00:00:51.960> difficult

2-inch screws very simple not difficult
so<00:00:52.620> far<00:00:53.100> little<00:00:53.430> math<00:00:53.760> countersink<00:00:54.570> them<00:00:54.719> now

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
so far little math countersink them now

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.410 
so far little math countersink them now
we're<00:00:55.320> gonna<00:00:55.440> do<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.739> floor<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.280> base<00:00:56.940> part

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
we're gonna do the floor the base part

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.720 
we're gonna do the floor the base part
of<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.289> floor<00:00:58.890> if<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.250> will<00:00:59.430> I

red<00:01:33.360> actually<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.140> allergic<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.590> red<00:01:34.860> you

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
red actually this is allergic to red you

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.620 
red actually this is allergic to red you
can<00:01:35.189> use<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.549> with<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> little<00:01:36.210> tip<00:01:36.360> when<00:01:36.479> you're

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
can use it with a little tip when you're

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.719 
can use it with a little tip when you're
drilling<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.229> going<00:01:38.070> slow<00:01:38.310> because<00:01:38.610> you'll

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
drilling in going slow because you'll

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.550 
drilling in going slow because you'll
want<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.939> split<00:01:39.150> your<00:01:39.329> wood<00:01:39.509> okay<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.439> you're

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
want to split your wood okay if you're

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.319 
want to split your wood okay if you're
going<00:01:40.650> too<00:01:40.950> fast<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.490> kind<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:41.970> drill

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
going too fast that kind of that drill

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.670 
going too fast that kind of that drill
that<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.630> wall<00:01:42.810> could<00:01:43.079> go<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.380> and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
that the wall could go in and

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.780 
that the wall could go in and
countersinking<00:01:44.220> else<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.579> start

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
countersinking else and you start

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.819 
countersinking else and you start
splitting<00:01:45.090> your<00:01:45.240> wood<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.689> now<00:01:46.560> we're<00:01:46.710> gonna

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
splitting your wood and now we're gonna

put<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.549> legs<00:01:47.939> now<00:01:48.270> these<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:48.899> all

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
put on the legs now these have all

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.020 
put on the legs now these have all
thread<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.950> them<00:01:50.100> already<00:01:50.250> bought<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.820> legs

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
thread in them already bought the legs

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.580 
thread in them already bought the legs
at<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> hardware<00:01:51.600> store<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.079> we<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.380> do<00:01:52.470> is

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
at a hardware store so we have to do is

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.790 
at a hardware store so we have to do is
get<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.890> hardware<00:01:53.159> put<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.450> then

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
get the hardware put it in and then

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.700 
get the hardware put it in and then
and<00:01:54.890> screw<00:01:55.760> in<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.810> bottom<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.230> see<00:01:57.260> the<00:01:57.410> legs

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
and screw in the bottom you see the legs

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.140 
and screw in the bottom you see the legs
are<00:01:57.950> already<00:01:58.190> done<00:01:58.370> you<00:01:58.490> can<00:01:58.580> just<00:01:58.610> bring<00:01:59.060> them

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
are already done you can just bring them

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.270 
are already done you can just bring them
in<00:01:59.240> now<00:01:59.390> here's<00:01:59.960> a<00:02:00.020> little<00:02:00.200> tip<00:02:00.350> make<00:02:00.980> sure<00:02:01.010> you

in now here's a little tip make sure you

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.410 
in now here's a little tip make sure you
get<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.430> little<00:02:01.730> torpedo<00:02:03.880> level<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.180> make<00:02:05.300> sure

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
get a little torpedo level and make sure

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.480 
get a little torpedo level and make sure
they're<00:02:05.600> straight<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.350> then<00:02:06.860> it's<00:02:07.130> adding

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
they're straight and then it's adding

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.950 
they're straight and then it's adding
some<00:02:07.670> hardware<00:02:08.000> just<00:02:08.270> put<00:02:08.420> on<00:02:08.510> a<00:02:08.540> couple<00:02:08.900> of

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
some hardware just put on a couple of

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.780 
some hardware just put on a couple of

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
little dorm room and um and then we're

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.910 
little dorm room and um and then we're
just<00:02:41.750> gonna<00:02:41.930> add<00:02:42.020> this<00:02:42.320> hardware<00:02:42.710> on<00:02:42.830> the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
just gonna add this hardware on the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.070 
just gonna add this hardware on the
outside<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:43.670> love<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.570> way<00:02:44.660> it<00:02:44.750> looks<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.050> looks

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
outside I love the way it looks it looks

so distressed I think yeah it's almost
like<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.540> little<00:02:47.840> shadow<00:02:48.290> box<00:02:48.650> if<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.040> will<00:02:49.190> and

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
like a little shadow box if you will and

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.000 
like a little shadow box if you will and
you<00:02:49.550> can<00:02:49.580> display<00:02:50.060> stuff<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:51.010> because

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010
