migration demo by using the file copy vm
and<00:03:05.110> on<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.440> vm<00:03:06.300> we<00:03:07.300> saw<00:03:07.480> just<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.840> basic<00:03:08.280> file

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
and on that vm we saw just a basic file

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.420 
and on that vm we saw just a basic file
share<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:11.580> here<00:03:12.580> in<00:03:12.790> our<00:03:13.000> scvmm<00:03:13.660> library

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
which is our f drive we have a template

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.310 
which is our f drive we have a template
vhd<00:03:20.769> that's<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.489> little<00:03:21.850> over<00:03:22.120> 2<00:03:22.269> gig<00:03:22.600> and<00:03:22.930> we're

vhd that's a little over 2 gig and we're

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.570 
vhd that's a little over 2 gig and we're
going<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.470> copy<00:03:23.769> it<00:03:24.070> onto<00:03:24.570> that<00:03:25.570> file<00:03:25.900> share<00:03:26.580> so

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
going to copy it onto that file share so

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.100 
going to copy it onto that file share so
let's<00:03:27.790> go<00:03:28.000> into<00:03:28.570> that<00:03:28.720> virtual<00:03:29.200> machine<00:03:29.560> and

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
let's go into that virtual machine and

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.190 
let's go into that virtual machine and
confirm<00:03:32.110> the<00:03:32.140> IP<00:03:32.410> address<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:34.049> then<00:03:35.049> we'll

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
confirm the IP address and then we'll

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.940 
confirm the IP address and then we'll
come<00:03:35.410> back<00:03:35.440> over<00:03:35.980> to<00:03:36.930> our<00:03:37.930> scvmm<00:03:38.530> system

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
come back over to our scvmm system

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.720 
come back over to our scvmm system
browse<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.610> that<00:03:39.640> IP<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:43.140> copy<00:03:44.140> over<00:03:44.500> that

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
browse to that IP and copy over that

00:03:44.730 --> 00:04:02.020 
browse to that IP and copy over that
that<00:03:45.730> large<00:03:45.970> v<00:03:46.209> HD

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.550 

so<00:04:02.810> there's<00:04:03.050> the<00:04:03.319> share<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:05.050> go<00:04:06.050> back<00:04:06.290> into

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
so there's the share and go back into

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:16.150 
so there's the share and go back into
our<00:04:06.770> library<00:04:07.250> do<00:04:08.240> a<00:04:09.790> basic<00:04:10.790> copy<00:04:11.240> paste

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.220 

so<00:04:16.790> there<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.060> files<00:04:17.269> copying<00:04:17.750> over<00:04:18.019> and

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
so there the files copying over and

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.470 
so there the files copying over and
let's<00:04:18.380> go<00:04:18.530> ahead<00:04:18.620> quickly<00:04:19.130> initiate<00:04:20.000> a<00:04:20.180> lot<00:04:20.420> of

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
let's go ahead quickly initiate a lot of

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.760 
let's go ahead quickly initiate a lot of
migration<00:04:21.880> and<00:04:23.230> we're<00:04:24.230> going<00:04:24.350> to<00:04:24.380> live<00:04:24.560> right

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
migration and we're going to live right

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.200 
migration and we're going to live right

that<00:04:34.460> virtual<00:04:34.910> machine<00:04:35.180> vibe<00:04:35.360> migrates<00:04:35.840> over

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
that virtual machine vibe migrates over

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.100 
that virtual machine vibe migrates over
to<00:04:36.170> the<00:04:36.260> other<00:04:36.350> node<00:04:40.480> so<00:04:41.480> there's<00:04:41.660> your<00:04:41.750> file

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
to the other node so there's your file

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.580 
to the other node so there's your file
copy<00:04:42.880> wrapping<00:04:43.880> up<00:04:44.060> and<00:04:44.360> right<00:04:45.290> about<00:04:45.380> the

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.200 
configuration not really important what
the<00:05:15.560> content<00:05:15.980> is<00:05:16.100> but<00:05:16.490> just<00:05:16.640> wanted<00:05:16.910> to<00:05:17.000> show

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
the content is but just wanted to show

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.390 
the content is but just wanted to show
you<00:05:17.320> it's<00:05:18.320> a<00:05:18.380> way<00:05:18.500> of<00:05:18.530> displaying<00:05:18.890> kind<00:05:19.220> of<00:05:19.310> the

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
you it's a way of displaying kind of the

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.030 
you it's a way of displaying kind of the
continuous<00:05:19.940> availability<00:05:20.470> during<00:05:21.470> that<00:05:21.800> live

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
continuous availability during that live

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.160 
continuous availability during that live
migration<00:05:22.670> operation<00:05:23.330> so<00:05:25.060> once<00:05:26.060> again<00:05:26.180> go

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.170 
migration operation so once again go

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:32.500 
migration operation so once again go
look<00:05:27.470> at<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:28.480> IP<00:05:29.480> address<00:05:29.770> and<00:05:30.910> browse<00:05:31.910> to<00:05:32.330> the

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
look at the IP address and browse to the

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:47.750 
look at the IP address and browse to the
to<00:05:33.020> the<00:05:33.050> share

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.030 

so<00:05:48.270> there's<00:05:48.450> a<00:05:48.540> share<00:05:48.840> and<00:05:48.870> here's<00:05:49.260> that<00:05:49.710> video

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
so there's a share and here's that video

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.820 
so there's a share and here's that video
that<00:05:50.220> I<00:05:50.250> mentioned<00:05:50.460> go<00:05:50.940> ahead<00:05:51.120> and<00:05:51.650> start<00:05:52.650> up

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
that I mentioned go ahead and start up

00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:01.490 
that I mentioned go ahead and start up
that<00:05:53.010> video

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.710 

and<00:06:02.040> you<00:06:02.130> kind<00:06:02.340> of<00:06:02.430> move<00:06:02.910> things<00:06:03.210> around<00:06:03.330> here

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
and you kind of move things around here

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.490 
and you kind of move things around here
so<00:06:03.930> you<00:06:04.020> can<00:06:04.170> see<00:06:04.200> the<00:06:04.410> video<00:06:05.180> although<00:06:06.180> my

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
so you can see the video although my

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:15.480 
so you can see the video although my
migration<00:06:07.500> is<00:06:07.650> being<00:06:07.920> initiated

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.059 

so<00:06:16.060> we're<00:06:16.210> also<00:06:16.300> going<00:06:16.539> to<00:06:16.630> move<00:06:16.750> this<00:06:16.870> one

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:17.069 
so we're also going to move this one

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:19.740 
so we're also going to move this one
over<00:06:18.069> to<00:06:18.190> the<00:06:18.310> other<00:06:18.430> available<00:06:18.639> node<00:06:19.060> node

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
over to the other available node node

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:30.520 
over to the other available node node
one

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.620 

so<00:06:31.530> you<00:06:31.590> can<00:06:31.710> see<00:06:31.830> the<00:06:32.270> virtual<00:06:33.270> machine<00:06:33.360> is

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
so you can see the virtual machine is

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.380 
so you can see the virtual machine is
migrating<00:06:34.140> over<00:06:34.200> the<00:06:34.380> other<00:06:34.530> node<00:06:34.710> and<00:06:35.390> the

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390 
migrating over the other node and the

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.090 
migrating over the other node and the
video<00:06:36.630> is<00:06:36.780> still<00:06:36.960> running<00:06:37.230> let's<00:06:37.770> go<00:06:37.950> ahead

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
video is still running let's go ahead

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.410 
video is still running let's go ahead
and<00:06:38.190> move<00:06:38.280> around<00:06:38.400> live<00:06:38.760> in<00:06:38.880> the<00:06:38.970> video<00:06:39.210> just

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:39.420 
and move around live in the video just

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.410 
and move around live in the video just
to<00:06:39.480> show<00:06:40.220> the<00:06:41.220> availability<00:06:41.820> that<00:06:41.970> we<00:06:42.090> have<00:06:42.240> of

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420 
to show the availability that we have of

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.700 
to show the availability that we have of
that<00:06:42.450> file<00:06:43.580> lab<00:06:44.580> migration<00:06:45.060> is<00:06:45.150> complete<00:06:45.710> so

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
that file lab migration is complete so

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.110 
that file lab migration is complete so
that<00:06:46.830> wraps<00:06:46.980> up<00:06:47.190> the<00:06:47.370> first<00:06:47.610> portion<00:06:47.850> of<00:06:48.060> this

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 
that wraps up the first portion of this

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.390 
that wraps up the first portion of this
video<00:06:48.530> on<00:06:49.530> the<00:06:49.620> next<00:06:49.830> portion<00:06:49.980> of<00:06:50.130> the<00:06:50.190> video

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
video on the next portion of the video

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.620 
video on the next portion of the video
we're<00:06:50.580> going<00:06:50.670> to<00:06:50.730> look<00:06:50.880> at<00:06:51.000> other<00:06:51.180> ways<00:06:51.420> to

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630 
we're going to look at other ways to

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.360 
we're going to look at other ways to
initiate<00:06:52.050> live<00:06:52.200> migration<00:06:52.680> outside<00:06:53.130> of<00:06:53.280> the

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
scvmm management console will be looking

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.790 
scvmm management console will be looking
