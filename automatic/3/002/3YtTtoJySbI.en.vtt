00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
the front of this thing make sure it's

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.710 
the front of this thing make sure it's
up<00:02:13.170> all<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.470> way<00:02:13.560> there<00:02:13.739> we

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
up all the way there we

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.480

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
and then do the same thing on the back

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.940 
and then do the same thing on the back
the<00:02:17.730> back<00:02:17.760> when<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.090> kind<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:18.360> go<00:02:18.510> off<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.530> to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
the back when I kind of go off to the to

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.720 
the back when I kind of go off to the to
the<00:02:20.040> back<00:02:20.220> side<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:22.459> they<00:02:23.459> go<00:02:23.580> on

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
the back side of it they go on

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.510 
the back side of it they go on
relatively<00:02:24.470> easy<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.800> little<00:02:26.069> bit<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.280> finger

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
relatively easy a little bit of finger

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.870 
relatively easy a little bit of finger
dexterity<00:02:27.060> always<00:02:27.720> helps<00:02:28.489> but<00:02:29.489> then<00:02:29.640> just

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
dexterity always helps but then just

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.610 
dexterity always helps but then just
that<00:02:30.030> tab<00:02:30.239> goes<00:02:30.480> off<00:02:30.660> onto<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.050> back<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.530> have

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
that tab goes off onto the back you have

your your your both your hydration

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.580 
your your your both your hydration
bladders<00:02:34.440> are<00:02:34.560> in<00:02:35.000> this<00:02:36.000> top<00:02:36.270> piece<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:37.200> just

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
bladders are in this top piece it just

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.449 
bladders are in this top piece it just
goes<00:02:38.069> on<00:02:38.220> by<00:02:38.400> friction<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.930> did<00:02:40.319> notice<00:02:40.620> you

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
goes on by friction I did notice you

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.860 
goes on by friction I did notice you
know<00:02:41.580> you've<00:02:42.269> got<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.450> little<00:02:42.600> bit<00:02:42.780> of

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
know you've got a little bit of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.530 
know you've got a little bit of
adjustment<00:02:43.349> with<00:02:43.440> your<00:02:43.530> arrow<00:02:43.680> bars<00:02:43.950> here<00:02:44.540> as

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
adjustment with your arrow bars here as

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.240 
adjustment with your arrow bars here as
far<00:02:45.720> as<00:02:45.780> your<00:02:45.959> attachment<00:02:46.500> but<00:02:46.650> this<00:02:47.010> just

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
far as your attachment but this just

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.210 
far as your attachment but this just
basically<00:02:47.610> slides<00:02:48.090> on<00:02:48.300> by<00:02:48.510> friction<00:02:49.010> goes<00:02:50.010> in

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
basically slides on by friction goes in

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.259 
basically slides on by friction goes in
snaps<00:02:50.550> in<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.930> helps<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.350> kind<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.590> just<00:02:53.269> give

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
snaps in it helps to kind of just give

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.940 
snaps in it helps to kind of just give
the<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.780> top<00:02:54.989> of<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.260> unit<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.530> little<00:02:55.739> bit<00:02:55.860> of

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
the the top of the unit a little bit of

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.710 
the the top of the unit a little bit of
support<00:02:56.100> but<00:02:56.610> man<00:02:57.030> once<00:02:57.209> that<00:02:57.390> thing<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.569> in

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
support but man once that thing is in

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.090 
support but man once that thing is in
there's<00:02:58.080> enough<00:02:58.290> tension<00:02:58.620> on<00:02:58.709> there<00:02:58.830> that<00:02:58.980> if

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
there's enough tension on there that if

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.539 
there's enough tension on there that if
the<00:02:59.190> bladders<00:02:59.549> were<00:02:59.730> full<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.920> know<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.220> ain't

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
the bladders were full you know it ain't

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.630 
the bladders were full you know it ain't
coming<00:03:02.850> off<00:03:02.970> at<00:03:03.180> all<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:03.980> but<00:03:04.980> just<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.610> know

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
coming off at all so but just you know

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.670 
coming off at all so but just you know
real<00:03:05.910> nice<00:03:06.090> setup<00:03:06.299> real<00:03:06.600> easy<00:03:06.780> was<00:03:07.470> kind<00:03:07.650> of

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
real nice setup real easy was kind of

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.809 
real nice setup real easy was kind of
surprised<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.130> lot<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.250> people<00:03:08.340> complained

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
surprised a lot of people complained

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.520

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
it so far maybe your two velcro straps

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.680 
it so far maybe your two velcro straps
that<00:03:13.709> go<00:03:13.920> through<00:03:14.220> these<00:03:14.850> two<00:03:15.120> tabs<00:03:15.330> on<00:03:15.600> the

that go through these two tabs on the
back<00:03:16.160> back<00:03:17.160> here<00:03:17.489> your<00:03:18.390> hoses<00:03:18.630> basically<00:03:19.170> come

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
back back here your hoses basically come

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.560 
back back here your hoses basically come
up<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.769> through<00:03:20.280> there<00:03:20.940> is<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.120> little<00:03:21.390> piece

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
up and through there is a little piece

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.650 
up and through there is a little piece
of<00:03:21.600> velcro<00:03:21.900> on<00:03:22.230> here<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:23.250> once<00:03:23.579> this<00:03:24.180> bottom

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
of velcro on here that once this bottom

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.080 
of velcro on here that once this bottom
tab<00:03:24.900> goes<00:03:25.200> in<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:26.280> have<00:03:26.430> your<00:03:26.579> velcro<00:03:26.760> and

that kind of you know holds your your
water<00:03:29.370> lines<00:03:29.640> in<00:03:29.850> place<00:03:30.000> which<00:03:30.209> I<00:03:30.329> thought<00:03:30.480> was

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
water lines in place which I thought was

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.180 
water lines in place which I thought was
you<00:03:30.810> know<00:03:30.900> kind<00:03:31.109> of<00:03:31.170> nice<00:03:31.350> nice<00:03:31.650> nice<00:03:32.130> thought
