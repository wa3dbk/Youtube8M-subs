how do I get this to work well there are
several<00:00:19.310> things<00:00:19.640> that<00:00:19.760> are<00:00:19.940> happening<00:00:20.060> at<00:00:20.480> the

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
several things that are happening at the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.970 
several things that are happening at the
same<00:00:20.720> time<00:00:21.020> that<00:00:21.230> I'm<00:00:21.320> doing<00:00:21.470> here<00:00:21.740> that<00:00:21.890> you

same time that I'm doing here that you
may<00:00:22.160> or<00:00:22.280> may<00:00:22.400> not<00:00:22.430> see<00:00:23.920> one<00:00:24.920> is<00:00:25.250> that<00:00:26.150> my<00:00:26.330> pelvis

may or may not see one is that my pelvis
is<00:00:27.460> lifted<00:00:28.460> slightly<00:00:28.789> toward<00:00:29.600> me<00:00:29.930> so<00:00:30.680> I'm<00:00:30.980> kind

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
is lifted slightly toward me so I'm kind

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.400 
is lifted slightly toward me so I'm kind
of<00:00:31.430> have<00:00:31.760> my<00:00:32.090> butt<00:00:33.079> is<00:00:33.260> not<00:00:33.289> flat<00:00:33.470> on<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.790> pad

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
of have my butt is not flat on the pad

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.470 
of have my butt is not flat on the pad
my<00:00:36.410> lower<00:00:36.620> back<00:00:36.950> is<00:00:37.160> on<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:37.370> pad<00:00:37.579> and<00:00:37.820> this<00:00:38.210> leg

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
my lower back is on the pad and this leg

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.770 
my lower back is on the pad and this leg
up<00:00:38.720> is<00:00:38.989> keeping<00:00:39.860> everything<00:00:40.309> angled<00:00:41.059> toward

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
up is keeping everything angled toward

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.960 
up is keeping everything angled toward
me<00:00:42.050> this<00:00:42.320> way<00:00:42.559> it's<00:00:43.250> kind<00:00:43.460> of<00:00:43.579> creating<00:00:43.910> a

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
me this way it's kind of creating a

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.479 
me this way it's kind of creating a
crunch<00:00:44.329> from<00:00:44.540> underneath<00:00:44.840> it's<00:00:45.710> up<00:00:45.920> to<00:00:45.950> me<00:00:46.280> to

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
crunch from underneath it's up to me to

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.250 
crunch from underneath it's up to me to
create<00:00:46.880> the<00:00:47.030> crunch<00:00:47.329> from<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:47.660> top<00:00:47.960> so<00:00:48.230> that

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
create the crunch from the top so that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.990 
create the crunch from the top so that
the<00:00:48.469> abs<00:00:48.649> are<00:00:48.890> actually<00:00:49.280> sitting<00:00:49.550> on<00:00:49.730> top<00:00:49.969> of

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
the abs are actually sitting on top of

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.389 
the abs are actually sitting on top of
each<00:00:50.210> other<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:50.660> that's<00:00:51.230> how<00:00:51.380> I<00:00:51.410> can<00:00:51.710> get<00:00:51.860> an

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
each other and that's how I can get an

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.119 
each other and that's how I can get an
enormous<00:00:52.760> contraction<00:00:53.750> see<00:00:54.500> if<00:00:54.590> I<00:00:54.710> do<00:00:54.770> this

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
enormous contraction see if I do this

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.850 
enormous contraction see if I do this
I'm<00:00:56.090> really<00:00:56.360> not<00:00:56.570> doing<00:00:56.750> much<00:00:56.989> I<00:00:57.350> mean<00:00:57.710> this<00:00:57.800> is

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
I'm really not doing much I mean this is

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.260 
I'm really not doing much I mean this is
the<00:00:58.040> traditional<00:00:58.489> crunch<00:00:58.730> this<00:00:58.910> is<00:00:59.030> how<00:00:59.120> most

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
the traditional crunch this is how most

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.420 
the traditional crunch this is how most
people<00:00:59.600> are<00:00:59.690> doing<00:00:59.930> it<00:01:00.020> I<00:01:00.170> challenge<00:01:00.890> you<00:01:01.219> to

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
people are doing it I challenge you to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.790 
people are doing it I challenge you to
drop<00:01:01.850> one<00:01:02.149> leg<00:01:02.390> put<00:01:03.170> another<00:01:03.260> leg<00:01:03.590> on<00:01:03.710> the

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
drop one leg put another leg on the

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.130 
drop one leg put another leg on the
floor<00:01:04.009> and<00:01:04.189> keep<00:01:04.369> this<00:01:04.640> leg<00:01:04.939> up<00:01:05.180> here<00:01:05.659> this

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
floor and keep this leg up here this

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.469 
floor and keep this leg up here this
will<00:01:06.320> drive<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:06.890> lower<00:01:07.100> back<00:01:07.400> into<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.240> pad

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
will drive the lower back into the pad

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.710 
will drive the lower back into the pad
much<00:01:09.290> more<00:01:09.560> solidly<00:01:10.100> and<00:01:10.490> you'll<00:01:11.360> be<00:01:11.479> able<00:01:11.600> to

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
much more solidly and you'll be able to

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.020 
much more solidly and you'll be able to
come<00:01:11.960> up<00:01:11.990> create<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.590> contraction<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:13.460> then

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
come up create a contraction and then

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.820 
come up create a contraction and then
come<00:01:14.210> on<00:01:14.330> back<00:01:14.390> down<00:01:14.750> now<00:01:15.380> you'll<00:01:15.530> see<00:01:15.710> I'm

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
come on back down now you'll see I'm

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.469 
come on back down now you'll see I'm
kind<00:01:16.070> of<00:01:16.159> holding<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:16.610> contraction<00:01:17.210> throughout

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
kind of holding a contraction throughout

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.840 
kind of holding a contraction throughout
the<00:01:17.630> entire<00:01:17.930> exercise<00:01:18.320> I'm<00:01:18.770> not<00:01:19.310> coming<00:01:19.610> all

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
the way down I'm taking tension away

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.760 
the way down I'm taking tension away
from<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.640> biceps<00:01:23.119> of<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.689> the<00:01:24.290> abs<00:01:24.470> what<00:01:24.710> I'm

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
from the biceps of the the abs what I'm

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.320 
from the biceps of the the abs what I'm
doing<00:01:25.070> that<00:01:25.220> so<00:01:25.729> what<00:01:25.880> I<00:01:25.909> want<00:01:26.150> to<00:01:26.210> do<00:01:26.299> is

doing that so what I want to do is
actually<00:01:26.689> train<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.799> ABS<00:01:28.010> as<00:01:28.369> if<00:01:28.970> I'm

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
actually train the ABS as if I'm

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.830

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.179 
training the biceps I'm pumping them
pumping<00:01:32.840> them<00:01:32.990> up<00:01:35.439> the<00:01:36.439> mistake<00:01:36.799> most<00:01:37.009> people

make the mistake most people make is to

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.770 
make the mistake most people make is to
do<00:01:41.060> 5<00:01:41.780> sets<00:01:41.810> of<00:01:42.229> 10<00:01:42.470> five<00:01:43.310> sets<00:01:43.610> of<00:01:43.729> twenty<00:01:44.090> five

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780
