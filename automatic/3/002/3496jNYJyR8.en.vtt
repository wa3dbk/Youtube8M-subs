00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
it is through terminal and it doesn't

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.430 
it is through terminal and it doesn't
run<00:01:00.489> in<00:01:00.640> a<00:01:00.730> window<00:01:01.120> and<00:01:01.450> if<00:01:01.870> you<00:01:01.989> have<00:01:02.110> the<00:01:02.260> app

run in a window and if you have the app
in<00:01:02.800> a<00:01:02.980> folder<00:01:03.489> I<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:05.110> would<00:01:05.229> be<00:01:05.379> essentially

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
in a folder I it would be essentially

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.680 
in a folder I it would be essentially
impossible<00:01:06.400> for<00:01:06.940> them<00:01:07.030> to<00:01:07.090> turn<00:01:07.390> it<00:01:07.450> off

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
impossible for them to turn it off

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.890 
impossible for them to turn it off
unless<00:01:08.110> they<00:01:08.260> near<00:01:08.410> the<00:01:08.440> terminal<00:01:08.740> command<00:01:09.250> um

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
unless they near the terminal command um

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.969 
unless they near the terminal command um
mind<00:01:10.900> you<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.080> does<00:01:11.229> turn<00:01:11.410> off<00:01:11.560> when<00:01:11.770> you

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979
