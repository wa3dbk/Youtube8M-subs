for<00:00:47.570> crickets<00:00:48.559> because<00:00:48.920> I've<00:00:49.399> been<00:00:49.579> getting<00:00:49.850> a

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
for crickets because I've been getting a

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.639 
for crickets because I've been getting a
lot<00:00:50.149> of<00:00:50.210> crickets<00:00:50.629> in<00:00:50.809> my<00:00:51.079> containers<00:00:51.530> they're

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
lot of crickets in my containers they're

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.509 
lot of crickets in my containers they're
pretty<00:00:51.890> small<00:00:52.540> so<00:00:53.920> I'll<00:00:54.920> start<00:00:55.129> off<00:00:55.309> with<00:00:55.399> the

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
pretty small so I'll start off with the

small one what you basically need to do
is<00:01:00.190> just<00:01:01.190> take<00:01:01.460> your<00:01:01.489> lids<00:01:02.710> marked<00:01:03.710> off<00:01:04.210> I'm

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
is just take your lids marked off I'm

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.760 
is just take your lids marked off I'm
just<00:01:05.269> gonna<00:01:05.420> eyeball<00:01:05.660> it<00:01:05.929> because<00:01:06.229> I<00:01:06.500> can't

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
just gonna eyeball it because I can't

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.080 
just gonna eyeball it because I can't
find<00:01:07.130> a<00:01:07.250> ruler<00:01:07.610> anywhere<00:01:08.240> in<00:01:08.539> this<00:01:08.720> house<00:01:10.090> what

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
find a ruler anywhere in this house what

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.770 
find a ruler anywhere in this house what
you<00:01:11.210> should<00:01:11.390> do<00:01:12.220> let's<00:01:13.220> take<00:01:13.490> it<00:01:13.729> about<00:01:14.390> an

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
you should do let's take it about an

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.109 
you should do let's take it about an
inch<00:01:15.520> draw<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:16.550> line<00:01:16.909> all<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.420> way<00:01:17.509> around<00:01:17.869> so

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
inch draw a line all the way around so

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.499 
inch draw a line all the way around so
stick<00:01:20.119> tune<00:01:21.009> the<00:01:22.060> stick<00:01:23.060> around<00:01:23.149> I'll<00:01:23.479> show

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
stick tune the stick around I'll show

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.870 
stick tune the stick around I'll show
you<00:01:23.659> that<00:01:25.690> okay<00:01:26.690> so<00:01:26.750> once<00:01:27.170> you've<00:01:27.380> got<00:01:27.679> your

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
you that okay so once you've got your

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.630 
you that okay so once you've got your
lines<00:01:28.880> drawn<00:01:29.590> you<00:01:30.590> can<00:01:30.770> barely<00:01:31.100> see<00:01:31.340> it<00:01:31.429> but

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
lines drawn you can barely see it but

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.210 
lines drawn you can barely see it but
all<00:01:31.759> these<00:01:31.940> squigglies<00:01:32.800> that's<00:01:33.800> your<00:01:34.039> waste

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
all these squigglies that's your waste

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.520 
all these squigglies that's your waste
material<00:01:34.759> so<00:01:35.060> after<00:01:35.659> you<00:01:35.750> cut<00:01:35.929> that<00:01:36.080> out<00:01:36.140> you

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
material so after you cut that out you

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.830 
material so after you cut that out you
really<00:01:37.219> don't<00:01:37.490> need<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:38.540> all<00:01:38.659> you're

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
really don't need it and all you're

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.810 
really don't need it and all you're
going<00:01:38.930> to<00:01:38.990> be<00:01:39.110> left<00:01:39.290> with<00:01:39.560> is<00:01:39.740> this<00:01:40.369> one-inch

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
going to be left with is this one-inch

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.310 
going to be left with is this one-inch
margin<00:01:41.390> around<00:01:41.840> here<00:01:43.479> so<00:01:44.479> just<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.079> show<00:01:45.259> you

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
margin around here so just to show you

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.249 
margin around here so just to show you
that<00:01:45.740> it<00:01:45.890> out<00:01:46.009> of<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.250> did<00:01:46.850> that<00:01:47.110> should<00:01:48.110> be

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
that it out of that did that should be

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.940 
that it out of that did that should be
easier<00:01:48.740> to<00:01:48.860> see<00:01:49.039> on<00:01:49.130> this<00:01:49.340> one<00:01:50.259> inch<00:01:51.259> all<00:01:51.920> the

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
easier to see on this one inch all the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.639 
easier to see on this one inch all the
way<00:01:52.039> around<00:01:52.869> and<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:53.930> reason<00:01:54.259> for<00:01:54.289> doing<00:01:54.500> so

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
way around and the reason for doing so

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.959 
way around and the reason for doing so
is<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:55.670> can<00:01:56.090> overlap<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:58.100> mesh<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.840> the

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
is so you can overlap the mesh and the

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.630 
is so you can overlap the mesh and the
reason<00:02:01.969> why<00:02:02.090> you<00:02:02.149> want<00:02:02.450> wire<00:02:02.750> mesh<00:02:03.219> versus<00:02:04.219> any

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
reason why you want wire mesh versus any

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.889 
reason why you want wire mesh versus any
other<00:02:04.850> thing<00:02:06.070> let's<00:02:07.070> say<00:02:07.280> nylon<00:02:07.789> mesh<00:02:08.060> from

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
other thing let's say nylon mesh from

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.449 
other thing let's say nylon mesh from
like<00:02:09.320> doors<00:02:09.709> like<00:02:10.640> screen<00:02:10.970> doors<00:02:12.459> the

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
like doors like screen doors the

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.720 
like doors like screen doors the
crickets<00:02:14.269> if<00:02:15.200> they<00:02:15.500> climb<00:02:15.950> high<00:02:16.160> enough<00:02:16.190> like

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
crickets if they climb high enough like

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.210 
crickets if they climb high enough like
let's<00:02:17.060> say<00:02:17.209> they're<00:02:17.390> on<00:02:17.540> top<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.220> paper

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
let's say they're on top of the paper

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.750 
let's say they're on top of the paper
towel<00:02:19.519> tubes<00:02:19.880> or<00:02:20.450> whatever<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:21.590> use<00:02:22.220> like<00:02:22.549> egg

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
towel tubes or whatever you use like egg

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.080 
towel tubes or whatever you use like egg
crates<00:02:23.060> they<00:02:23.959> get<00:02:24.140> high<00:02:24.650> enough<00:02:24.950> and<00:02:25.880> then

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
crates they get high enough and then

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.420 
crates they get high enough and then
they<00:02:26.180> start<00:02:26.420> crawling<00:02:27.410> on<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.829> ceiling<00:02:27.859> don't

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
they start crawling on the ceiling don't

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.370 
they start crawling on the ceiling don't
chew<00:02:28.730> right<00:02:29.000> through<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:29.420> nylon<00:02:29.840> mesh<00:02:30.109> so

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
chew right through that nylon mesh so

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.740 
chew right through that nylon mesh so
you<00:02:30.440> don't<00:02:30.680> want<00:02:30.890> to<00:02:30.980> use<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:32.269> that's<00:02:32.570> why

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
you don't want to use that so that's why

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.400 
you don't want to use that so that's why
you<00:02:32.810> want<00:02:33.109> wire<00:02:33.950> mesh<00:02:35.350> okay<00:02:36.380> so<00:02:37.220> stick<00:02:37.820> around

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
you want wire mesh okay so stick around

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.140 
you want wire mesh okay so stick around
I'll<00:02:39.410> come<00:02:39.739> back<00:02:39.890> with<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.160> next<00:02:40.400> part<00:02:40.790> which

I'll come back with the next part which

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.700 
I'll come back with the next part which
is<00:02:41.390> just<00:02:41.810> cutting<00:02:42.409> these<00:02:42.680> out

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.480

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
you tube if you are going to do this for
