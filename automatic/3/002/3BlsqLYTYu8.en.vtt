00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.410
 Welcome, but a video I'll demonstrate. 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.050
 how to invert the digits of a year 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:25.450
 using our forum and operator 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:28.000
 module we will need four 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:32.739
 variables of type long one to receive 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.230
 the amount charged this afternoon to the 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:39.850
 Inverse value one that material value 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.530
 saying unchanged and another to 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.340
 remember what was said in the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.340
 typed value 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.829
 in the formatting of a long integer we use 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.760
 the percent symbol and the magazines 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.760
 elle ed 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:19.549
 the keep variable will store the value 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:19.880
 cited only to show it at the end of 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.130
 forum 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.929
 we need only indicate the value 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.530
 minimum of the variable and none within the 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:29.479
 forum 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:35.840
 the remember variable receives the rest of the 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:38.390
 division of n 1 by ten with each repetition 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.100
 the inverse variable receives its own 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:47.450
 value multiplied by ten 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:50.000
 added to the value of the remember and 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:58.310
 finally the variable in one receives its 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.049
 own value divided by 10 outside the 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.209
 loop are shown the value as it was 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.209
 dictation its inverted version 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.480
 to test or enter the simple number 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.810
 let's analyze the code 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:01.260
 in line 9 the variable remember receives 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:04.080
 the rest of 834/10 which is 4 on the line 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.360
 2011 the inverse variable receives itself 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.350
 since the 10 most value of the variable 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:15.570
 remember that on line 21 and none receive 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:20.060
 herself / 10 becoming worth 83 and 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.060
 so on until no avail 0 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.260
 I'll type a large number to test 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.849
 Thank you for watching, if you like me.
