00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
the pressure you can pop it and kind of

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.440 
the pressure you can pop it and kind of
give<00:01:08.279> it<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:09.020> this<00:01:10.020> kind<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.289> motion

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:31.840 

it's<00:01:13.780> like<00:01:13.990> that

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.609 

so<00:01:32.479> we're<00:01:32.630> learning<00:01:32.719> this<00:01:32.929> trick<00:01:33.140> will<00:01:33.590> help

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
so we're learning this trick will help

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.480 
so we're learning this trick will help
you<00:01:33.829> out<00:01:33.859> is<00:01:34.219> maybe<00:01:34.429> doing<00:01:34.609> a<00:01:34.729> stationary<00:01:35.179> and

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
you out is maybe doing a stationary and

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.120 
you out is maybe doing a stationary and
just<00:01:37.490> kind<00:01:38.030> of<00:01:38.469> find<00:01:39.469> your<00:01:39.530> shoulders<00:01:39.890> up<00:01:40.039> like

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
just kind of find your shoulders up like

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.149 
just kind of find your shoulders up like
you<00:01:40.310> would<00:01:40.429> do<00:01:40.549> it<00:01:41.170> you're<00:01:42.170> stationary<00:01:42.530> your

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
you would do it you're stationary your

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.770 
you would do it you're stationary your
back<00:01:43.729> foots<00:01:43.969> part<00:01:44.149> not<00:01:44.210> going<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.420> land<00:01:44.539> on<00:01:44.630> it

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
back foots part not going to land on it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.209 
back foots part not going to land on it
and<00:01:44.929> that<00:01:45.289> might<00:01:45.350> help<00:01:45.469> you<00:01:45.619> out<00:01:45.740> in<00:01:46.039> the

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
and that might help you out in the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.389 
and that might help you out in the
learning<00:01:46.459> process

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
learning process

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.590 
learning process
just<00:01:49.399> do<00:01:49.520> that<00:01:49.640> all<00:01:49.909> times

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
just do that all times

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.660 
just do that all times
and<00:01:50.890> eventually<00:01:51.890> you<00:01:52.130> can<00:01:52.219> start<00:01:52.429> doing<00:01:52.490> it

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
and eventually you can start doing it

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.859 
and eventually you can start doing it
fakie<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.060> moving<00:01:53.270> around<00:01:53.359> and<00:01:53.689> okay<00:01:55.689> so<00:01:56.689> once

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
fakie and moving around and okay so once

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.449 
fakie and moving around and okay so once
you<00:01:57.020> get<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.200> thank<00:01:57.709> you<00:01:57.740> point<00:01:58.009> goes<00:01:58.219> down

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:58.459 
you get a thank you point goes down

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:00.550 
you get a thank you point goes down
that's<00:01:59.329> possible<00:01:59.719> place<00:01:59.899> you<00:02:00.020> can<00:02:00.140> do<00:02:00.229> biz<00:02:00.470> in

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
that's possible place you can do biz in

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:14.120 
that's possible place you can do biz in
live<00:02:00.709> traffic

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.190 

you
