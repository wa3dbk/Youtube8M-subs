00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.540 
and you can actually define it and
change<00:01:23.960> it<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:24.260> I<00:01:24.950> thought<00:01:25.100> it<00:01:25.220> was<00:01:25.340> really

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
change it and I thought it was really

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.580 
change it and I thought it was really
that<00:01:26.240> was<00:01:26.300> a<00:01:26.390> very<00:01:26.540> brave<00:01:26.870> thing<00:01:26.900> to<00:01:27.290> want<00:01:27.470> to

well<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:15.010> know<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.519> overarching<00:02:16.299> thing<00:02:16.750> is

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
well you know the overarching thing is

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.449 
well you know the overarching thing is
that<00:02:17.049> the<00:02:17.140> world<00:02:17.319> is<00:02:17.530> probably<00:02:17.890> moving<00:02:18.250> in<00:02:18.370> a

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
that the world is probably moving in a

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.270 
that the world is probably moving in a
better<00:02:18.670> direction<00:02:19.319> do<00:02:20.319> you<00:02:20.410> think<00:02:20.590> that's

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
better direction do you think that's

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.949 
better direction do you think that's
kind<00:02:21.489> of<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.610> different<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.120> difficult<00:02:22.690> message

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
kind of a different a difficult message

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.630 
kind of a different a difficult message
to<00:02:23.110> sell<00:02:23.290> in<00:02:23.380> some<00:02:23.500> ways<00:02:23.620> because<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.069> you

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
to sell in some ways because it is you

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.130 
to sell in some ways because it is you
know<00:02:24.730> some<00:02:24.910> people<00:02:25.120> might<00:02:25.269> be<00:02:25.390> overwhelmed<00:02:26.019> by

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
know some people might be overwhelmed by

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.660 
know some people might be overwhelmed by
it<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.470> think<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:26.739> can't<00:02:27.069> make<00:02:27.190> a<00:02:27.310> difference

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
it and think I can't make a difference

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.250 
it and think I can't make a difference
but<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.940> key<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.330> new<00:02:28.480> movie<00:02:29.019> is<00:02:29.110> that

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
but the key of the new movie is that

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.990 
but the key of the new movie is that
every<00:02:29.830> one<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.010> us<00:02:30.220> can<00:02:30.430> make<00:02:30.519> a<00:02:30.580> difference

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
every one of us can make a difference

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.640 
every one of us can make a difference
well<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.180> think<00:02:31.239> that<00:02:31.540> that's<00:02:31.660> we've<00:02:32.319> learned

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
well I think that that's we've learned

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.070 
well I think that that's we've learned
over<00:02:33.360> generations<00:02:34.360> of<00:02:34.540> seeing<00:02:34.780> how<00:02:35.019> we

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
over generations of seeing how we

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.900 
over generations of seeing how we
actually<00:02:35.590> have<00:02:35.980> made<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.430> difference

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
actually have made a difference

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.030 
actually have made a difference
individuals<00:02:37.569> that<00:02:38.170> we<00:02:38.319> do<00:02:38.500> know<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.860> that's

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
individuals that we do know that that's

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.520 
individuals that we do know that that's
true<00:02:39.250> it's<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:40.450> know<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:41.769> the<00:02:41.799> trouble<00:02:42.610> with
