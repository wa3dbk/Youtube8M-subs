00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hi girls how are you in this video les 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.420
 I want to show an idea about how 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.950
 Fix your hair especially because 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.809
 right here where I live is being a 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.639
 little bit of heat and I'm looking for 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.920
 hairstyles where I can keep my hair 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.690
 picked up let's see how this is done 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.369
 hairstyle as always starts 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.590
 moistening my hair a little 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.420
 handle it more easily at once I'll 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.539
 to apply a little fixative spray to 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.640
 moderate my hair I took a lock of 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:32.309
 the back and one in front and 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.290
 the crosses from there we're going to weave 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.480
 and every time we weave we add a 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.079
 super thin hair both in front 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.079
 like from behind 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.470
 and that's all we have to do until 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.160
 get to the tips 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.160
 ah 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.400
 Take care that the strands that you are going to add 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.400
 come as far back as possible 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.140
 At first our hairstyle is going to 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.580
 look a bit like the bohemian braid that 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.580
 we did in a previous tutorial 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.090
 at the end of knitting you'll see that we get 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.090
 something different 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.110
 ah 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.650
 for this hairstyle I'm using my 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.850
 hair extensions so that I stay 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.850
 a super long braid 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.610
 already finished reminds me a little to the 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.200
 elsa braid of pros in just that is 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.200
 a version for Chinese hair 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.000
 and then when we get to the tips we put 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.000
 a little league 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.149
 ah 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.720
 in the end I decided that I was missing another 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.720
 little bit of fixative spray and ready 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.950
 to me the truth I like very much this 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.530
 30 because I think it looks like this super 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.760
 Chubby super flashy but it is not 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.410
 like you talk in the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.600

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.730
