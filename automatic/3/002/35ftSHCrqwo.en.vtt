00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:07.400 
you see this car going around the track

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.620 
you see this car going around the track
and<00:00:08.400> it's<00:00:08.580> got<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.730> little<00:00:09.000> bit<00:00:09.090> of<00:00:09.179> lean<00:00:09.330> if<00:00:09.540> you

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
and it's got a little bit of lean if you

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.350 
and it's got a little bit of lean if you
look<00:00:09.809> close<00:00:10.309> as<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.519> goes<00:00:11.670> around<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.940> corners

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
look close as it goes around the corners

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.400 
look close as it goes around the corners
let<00:00:12.509> me<00:00:12.599> give<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.929> better<00:00:13.200> shot<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.590> this

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.470 

okay<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.470> I'm<00:00:19.710> exaggerate<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.520> course<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:21.090> as

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
okay so I'm exaggerate of course but as

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.660 
okay so I'm exaggerate of course but as
it<00:00:21.630> goes<00:00:21.779> into<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.170> corner<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:23.100> body<00:00:23.369> leans

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
it goes into this corner the body leans

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.089 
it goes into this corner the body leans
heavily<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:24.930> straightens<00:00:25.350> back<00:00:25.500> out<00:00:25.800> as

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
heavily and it straightens back out as

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.890 
heavily and it straightens back out as
it<00:00:26.220> comes<00:00:26.430> back<00:00:26.609> out<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> turn<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:29.900> it

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
it comes back out of the turn and it

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.240 
it comes back out of the turn and it
leans<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.199> other<00:00:31.349> way<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:31.890> given<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.189> a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
leans the other way so it's given you a

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.940 
leans the other way so it's given you a
realistic<00:00:32.640> kind<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.239> chassis<00:00:33.950> suspension

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
realistic kind of a chassis suspension

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.900 
realistic kind of a chassis suspension
feel<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.260> vehicle<00:00:37.309> now<00:00:38.309> I'm<00:00:38.370> not<00:00:38.520> showing

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
feel to the vehicle now I'm not showing

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.459 
feel to the vehicle now I'm not showing
every<00:00:39.149> little<00:00:39.390> bit<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.809> because<00:00:40.170> part<00:00:40.440> of

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
every little bit of this because part of

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.420 
every little bit of this because part of
this<00:00:40.590> tutorial<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.390> written<00:00:42.390> down<00:00:42.620> on<00:00:43.620> my

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
this tutorial is written down on my

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.610 
this tutorial is written down on my
website<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.030> HTML<00:00:45.660> tutorial<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.440> there's

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
website on HTML tutorial but there's

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.069 
website on HTML tutorial but there's
things<00:00:46.860> about<00:00:47.010> keyframing<00:00:47.640> they<00:00:47.850> don't<00:00:48.090> show

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
things about keyframing they don't show

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.560 
things about keyframing they don't show
well<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.739> an<00:00:49.950> HTML<00:00:50.489> document<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:51.149> that's<00:00:51.360> why

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
well on an HTML document so that's why

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.060 
well on an HTML document so that's why
I'm<00:00:51.690> doing<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.050> video<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.410> go<00:00:52.530> with<00:00:52.559> it

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
I'm doing the video to go with it

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.479 
I'm doing the video to go with it
so<00:00:53.640> first<00:00:54.629> thing<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:54.870> should<00:00:54.930> say<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:56.010> this

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
so first thing I should say is that this

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.250 
so first thing I should say is that this
is<00:00:56.670> what<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> hierarchy<00:00:57.090> looks<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.780> yet<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
is what the hierarchy looks like yet the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.860 
is what the hierarchy looks like yet the
chassis<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.489> king<00:00:59.730> then<00:01:00.420> you've<00:01:00.539> got<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
chassis is the king then you've got the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.439 
chassis is the king then you've got the
car<00:01:01.079> body<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.859> four<00:01:02.190> wheels<00:01:02.460> are<00:01:03.000> children

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
car body in the four wheels are children

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.329 
car body in the four wheels are children
of<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.409> then<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.739> path<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.220> it

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
of that and then I have a path that it

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.240 
of that and then I have a path that it
follows<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:07.110> that's<00:01:07.470> all<00:01:07.650> described<00:01:08.100> pretty

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
follows and that's all described pretty

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.590 
follows and that's all described pretty
well<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.439> HTML<00:01:10.439> tutorial<00:01:10.979> that's<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.600> 3d

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
well in the HTML tutorial that's on 3d

however<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.970> body<00:01:15.150> leans<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> tough<00:01:15.840> thing

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
however the body leans the tough thing

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.990 
however the body leans the tough thing
and<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.740> animation<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.490> wheels<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.970> a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
and the animation of the wheels is a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.149 
and the animation of the wheels is a
little<00:01:18.180> tricky<00:01:18.450> too<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.930> let<00:01:19.619> me<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:19.890> go<00:01:20.100> to

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
little tricky too so let me just go to

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.090 
little tricky too so let me just go to
this<00:01:20.610> body<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.390> take<00:01:22.049> these<00:01:22.200> keyframes<00:01:22.830> out

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
this body and take these keyframes out

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.550 
this body and take these keyframes out
in<00:01:23.430> fact<00:01:24.140> you<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.350> see<00:01:25.650> here<00:01:26.960> this<00:01:27.960> lean<00:01:28.259> from

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
in fact you can see here this lean from

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.499 
in fact you can see here this lean from
frame<00:01:30.140> 5200<00:01:31.140> now<00:01:31.560> let's<00:01:31.770> say<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.159> 150<00:01:32.909> let's

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
frame 5200 now let's say like 150 let's

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.300 
frame 5200 now let's say like 150 let's
just<00:01:33.659> get<00:01:33.810> rid<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:33.990> those<00:01:34.110> keyframes<00:01:37.250> okay<00:01:38.250> so

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
just get rid of those keyframes okay so

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.039 
just get rid of those keyframes okay so
now<00:01:38.640> there's<00:01:38.909> no<00:01:39.060> lean<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.479> just<00:01:39.630> goes<00:01:39.780> around

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
now there's no lean it just goes around

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.800 
now there's no lean it just goes around
like<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.290> regular<00:01:40.500> car<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.759> right<00:01:42.090> about<00:01:42.329> 50

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
like a regular car so right about 50

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.810 
like a regular car so right about 50
what<00:01:42.960> I'm<00:01:43.079> gonna<00:01:43.229> do<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:43.860> nudge<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.759> a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
what I'm gonna do is just nudge this a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.539 
what I'm gonna do is just nudge this a
little<00:01:45.030> bit<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.420> I'm<00:01:45.479> gonna<00:01:45.570> go<00:01:45.720> frame<00:01:46.020> 50<00:01:46.549> I'm

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
little bit so I'm gonna go frame 50 I'm

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.670 
little bit so I'm gonna go frame 50 I'm
gonna<00:01:47.670> select<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.060> body<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.960> I'm<00:01:49.320> gonna<00:01:49.439> turn

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
gonna select the body and I'm gonna turn

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.609 
gonna select the body and I'm gonna turn
on<00:01:49.799> AutoKey<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.610> I'm<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:52.049> use<00:01:52.590> my

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
on AutoKey and I'm just going to use my

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.300 
on AutoKey and I'm just going to use my
rotate<00:01:53.430> tool<00:01:57.140> now<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.229> can<00:01:58.409> see<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.860> I've

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
rotate tool now you can see that I've

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.639 
rotate tool now you can see that I've
got<00:01:59.369> angular<00:02:00.030> snap<00:02:00.329> on<00:02:00.570> rotate<00:02:00.990> turned<00:02:01.259> on<00:02:01.469> up

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
got angular snap on rotate turned on up

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.030 
got angular snap on rotate turned on up

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.030 
here
I'm<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.689> standard<00:02:03.689> toolbar<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.469> I'll<00:02:04.890> go<00:02:04.979> to

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
I'm a standard toolbar so I'll go to

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.819 
I'm a standard toolbar so I'll go to
remote<00:02:05.250> rotate<00:02:05.850> now<00:02:06.600> making<00:02:06.840> sure<00:02:07.140> also<00:02:07.590> that

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
remote rotate now making sure also that

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.620 
remote rotate now making sure also that
my<00:02:08.099> coordinate<00:02:09.000> system<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.450> set<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.810> local

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
my coordinate system is set to local

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.320 
my coordinate system is set to local
okay<00:02:10.990> so<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:11.440> way<00:02:11.590> it'll<00:02:11.800> turn<00:02:12.670> with<00:02:13.120> the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
okay so that way it'll turn with the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.420 
okay so that way it'll turn with the
body<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.780> car<00:02:13.990> so<00:02:14.740> what<00:02:14.860> am<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.040> gonna<00:02:15.190> do

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
body of the car so what am I gonna do

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.790 
body of the car so what am I gonna do
here<00:02:15.640> I'm<00:02:16.090> gonna<00:02:16.330> rotate<00:02:16.570> five<00:02:17.080> degrees<00:02:17.440> and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
here I'm gonna rotate five degrees and

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.040 
here I'm gonna rotate five degrees and
then<00:02:17.890> back<00:02:18.100> and<00:02:18.790> all<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:18.940> really<00:02:19.360> does<00:02:19.660> is

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
then back and all that really does is

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.830 
then back and all that really does is
hold<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.710> zero<00:02:21.040> rotation<00:02:21.880> until<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:22.540> frame

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
hold the zero rotation until that frame

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.040 
hold the zero rotation until that frame
so<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:24.010> when<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:24.760> go<00:02:25.060> here<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.510> like<00:02:25.840> the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
so that when I go here to like the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.960 
so that when I go here to like the
height<00:02:26.320> of<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.680> turn<00:02:26.950> let's<00:02:27.820> say<00:02:28.000> right<00:02:28.210> there

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
height of the turn let's say right there

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.600 
height of the turn let's say right there
and<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.120> rotate<00:02:31.630> it<00:02:31.890> because<00:02:32.890> now<00:02:33.040> it's<00:02:33.220> leaning

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
and I rotate it because now it's leaning

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.020 
and I rotate it because now it's leaning
up<00:02:34.620> let's<00:02:35.620> say<00:02:35.890> 15<00:02:36.460> degrees<00:02:36.730> just<00:02:36.760> to

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
up let's say 15 degrees just to

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.390 
up let's say 15 degrees just to
exaggerate<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:39.450> it's<00:02:40.450> gonna<00:02:40.630> start<00:02:41.020> that

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
exaggerate it it's gonna start that

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.200 
exaggerate it it's gonna start that
rotation<00:02:42.400> at<00:02:42.940> frame<00:02:43.330> 50<00:02:43.870> but<00:02:44.050> not<00:02:44.200> before<00:02:45.210> now

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
rotation at frame 50 but not before now

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.610 
rotation at frame 50 but not before now
if<00:02:46.300> you<00:02:46.450> don't<00:02:46.660> put<00:02:46.900> in<00:02:47.020> that<00:02:47.140> little<00:02:47.410> nudge

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
if you don't put in that little nudge

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.220 
if you don't put in that little nudge
frame<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:49.300> really<00:02:49.540> doesn't<00:02:49.750> do<00:02:49.930> anything

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
frame that really doesn't do anything

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.370 
frame that really doesn't do anything
but<00:02:50.410> lock<00:02:50.650> down<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.820> previous<00:02:52.180> value<00:02:52.540> then

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
but lock down the previous value then

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.980 
but lock down the previous value then
you're<00:02:53.500> gonna<00:02:53.620> get<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:53.920> slow<00:02:54.430> rotation<00:02:54.880> from<00:02:55.630> 0

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
you're gonna get a slow rotation from 0

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.870 
you're gonna get a slow rotation from 0
to<00:02:56.110> 100<00:02:56.590> it's<00:02:56.710> not<00:02:56.890> gonna<00:02:56.980> look<00:02:57.070> realistic<00:02:57.430> and

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
to 100 it's not gonna look realistic and

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.610 
to 100 it's not gonna look realistic and
then<00:02:58.570> here<00:02:58.780> it's<00:02:58.930> coming<00:02:59.260> out<00:02:59.410> of<00:02:59.440> the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
then here it's coming out of the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.860 
then here it's coming out of the
rotation<00:03:00.160> so<00:03:00.340> what<00:03:00.490> I'll<00:03:00.580> do<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:00.760> just<00:03:00.940> come

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
rotation so what I'll do is just come

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.730 
rotation so what I'll do is just come
back<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:03.700> did<00:03:03.970> 15<00:03:04.360> before<00:03:04.570> so<00:03:04.990> I'll<00:03:05.080> do<00:03:05.260> 15

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
back to I did 15 before so I'll do 15

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:13.890 
back to I did 15 before so I'll do 15
again<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:11.200> come<00:03:12.190> straight<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.450> then<00:03:13.720> it's

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
again and come straight and then it's

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.360 
again and come straight and then it's
gonna<00:03:14.050> go<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.320> little<00:03:14.470> bit<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.800> left<00:03:15.010> so<00:03:15.220> right

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
gonna go a little bit to left so right

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.040 
gonna go a little bit to left so right
here<00:03:15.520> I'll<00:03:15.610> probably<00:03:15.730> nudge<00:03:16.090> it<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:18.780> then<00:03:19.780> in

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
here I'll probably nudge it and then in

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.940 
here I'll probably nudge it and then in
this<00:03:20.200> corner<00:03:20.760> make<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:21.910> go<00:03:22.030> this<00:03:22.210> way<00:03:25.770> since<00:03:26.770> I

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
this corner make it go this way since I

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.400 
this corner make it go this way since I
think<00:03:27.460> that<00:03:27.760> gives<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.180> an<00:03:28.300> idea<00:03:28.450> let<00:03:29.170> me<00:03:29.260> show

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
think that gives you an idea let me show

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.430 
think that gives you an idea let me show
you<00:03:29.470> how<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.680> wheels<00:03:29.920> work<00:03:30.160> now<00:03:30.370> let's<00:03:31.440> turn

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
you how the wheels work now let's turn

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.720 
you how the wheels work now let's turn
off<00:03:32.620> auto<00:03:32.860> key<00:03:33.130> because<00:03:33.400> this<00:03:33.520> isn't

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
off auto key because this isn't

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.150 
off auto key because this isn't
requiring<00:03:34.690> an<00:03:34.870> animation<00:03:35.290> like<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:35.860> normally

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
requiring an animation like you normally

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.610 
requiring an animation like you normally
need<00:03:36.310> on<00:03:36.460> a<00:03:36.490> wheel<00:03:36.810> I'm<00:03:37.810> going<00:03:38.080> to<00:03:38.170> this<00:03:38.320> wheel

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
need on a wheel I'm going to this wheel

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.710 
need on a wheel I'm going to this wheel
the<00:03:39.010> way<00:03:39.160> this<00:03:39.340> is<00:03:39.520> done<00:03:39.760> is<00:03:39.790> on<00:03:40.270> a<00:03:40.330> motion

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
the way this is done is on a motion

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.330 
the way this is done is on a motion
panel<00:03:41.730> under<00:03:42.730> a<00:03:42.970> sign<00:03:43.420> controller

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
panel under a sign controller

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.960 
panel under a sign controller
under<00:03:45.340> rotation<00:03:46.560> what<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:47.770> want<00:03:48.040> for<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.700> Y

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
under rotation what you want for the Y

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.150 
under rotation what you want for the Y
rotation<00:03:49.270> if<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:50.170> make<00:03:50.410> your<00:03:50.590> wheels<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:51.010> way

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
rotation if you make your wheels the way

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.120 
rotation if you make your wheels the way
I<00:03:51.190> did<00:03:51.490> in<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.820> HTML<00:03:52.480> tutorial<00:03:53.020> go<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:53.920> Y

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
I did in the HTML tutorial go to Y

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.550 
I did in the HTML tutorial go to Y
rotation<00:03:54.400> click<00:03:55.270> it<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:55.959> you're<00:03:56.200> gonna<00:03:56.290> use<00:03:56.530> a

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
rotation click it and you're gonna use a

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.590 
rotation click it and you're gonna use a
float<00:03:56.950> expression<00:03:57.670> okay<00:03:58.209> so<00:03:58.270> I've<00:03:58.480> already

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
float expression okay so I've already

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.120 
float expression okay so I've already
changed<00:03:59.050> it<00:03:59.080> to<00:03:59.170> flow<00:03:59.350> expression<00:03:59.860> but<00:04:00.010> it's

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
changed it to flow expression but it's

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.370 
changed it to flow expression but it's
easy<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.520> change<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:00.940> back<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.270> forth<00:04:01.510> so<00:04:02.320> I

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
easy to change it back and forth so I

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.620 
easy to change it back and forth so I
can<00:04:02.530> go<00:04:02.650> to<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.130> flow<00:04:03.280> expression<00:04:03.790> here<00:04:04.120> and

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
can go to the flow expression here and

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.120 
can go to the flow expression here and
I'll<00:04:04.750> make<00:04:04.930> this<00:04:05.110> a<00:04:05.170> Bezier<00:04:05.590> float<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:06.010> just

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
I'll make this a Bezier float and just

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.500 
I'll make this a Bezier float and just
go<00:04:06.250> back<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.490> what<00:04:06.760> it<00:04:06.850> was<00:04:06.880> so<00:04:07.180> you<00:04:07.209> can<00:04:07.360> see

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
go back to what it was so you can see
