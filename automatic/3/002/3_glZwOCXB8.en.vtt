00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:47.620 

this<00:00:36.350> is<00:00:36.500> an<00:00:36.620> emulator

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.290 

this<00:00:48.230> is

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.439 

Super<00:00:52.300> Nintendo<00:00:52.440> 64<00:00:53.440> maybe

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.840 

so<00:00:56.780> there's<00:00:56.989> a<00:00:57.050> bunch<00:00:57.199> of<00:00:57.440> HN<00:00:57.859> with<00:00:58.219> an<00:00:58.370> emoji

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
so there's a bunch of HN with an emoji

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:12.490 
so there's a bunch of HN with an emoji
inside<00:00:59.420> no<00:01:01.989> with<00:01:02.989> a<00:01:03.019> mali-400<00:01:03.620> GPU<00:01:05.470> here<00:01:11.500> rocks

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
inside no with a mali-400 GPU here rocks

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.179 
inside no with a mali-400 GPU here rocks
chipiya

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
chipiya

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.090 
chipiya
so<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.549> has<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> martini<00:01:15.270> 406<00:01:16.079> AGP<00:01:16.619> newer<00:01:16.799> thing

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
so it has a martini 406 AGP newer thing

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.529 
so it has a martini 406 AGP newer thing
so<00:01:17.909> there's<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.179> cop

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
so there's a cop

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.899 
so there's a cop
this<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.840> 5-inch<00:01:19.229> resisting<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:20.429> five<00:01:20.700> inch

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
this is 5-inch resisting this five inch

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.789 
this is 5-inch resisting this five inch
capacity<00:01:22.700> this<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:24.479> capacity<00:01:27.619> this<00:01:28.619> one

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
capacity this this capacity this one

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.800 
capacity this this capacity this one
looks<00:01:28.950> capacity<00:01:31.939> so<00:01:32.939> there's<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.179> fool<00:01:33.359> and<00:01:33.539> red

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
not 4.0 yet this mouse you know this

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.630 
not 4.0 yet this mouse you know this
moons<00:01:45.469> down<00:01:46.469> here<00:01:46.649> right<00:01:46.829> now<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.129> 2.3<00:01:49.640> you

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
moons down here right now it's 2.3 you

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.520 
moons down here right now it's 2.3 you
see<00:01:50.849> here

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
see here

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.190 
see here
there's<00:01:53.100> also<00:01:53.250> three<00:01:53.540> 4.3<00:01:54.540> inch<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:55.050> is<00:01:55.170> a

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
there's also three 4.3 inch this is a

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.470 
there's also three 4.3 inch this is a
smaller<00:01:55.440> one<00:01:55.610> is<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.790> capacitive<00:01:57.390> or

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
smaller one is this capacitive or

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.890 
smaller one is this capacitive or
resistive<00:01:58.820> resistive<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.480> how<00:02:00.600> much<00:02:00.690> is<00:02:00.810> it

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
resistive resistive so how much is it

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.470 
resistive resistive so how much is it
this<00:02:01.380> one<00:02:01.620> 1,000<00:02:02.430> pieces<00:02:03.920> in<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.040> -<00:02:05.430> no<00:02:06.000> no

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
this one 1,000 pieces in this - no no

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.320 
this one 1,000 pieces in this - no no
price<00:02:06.750> here<00:02:07.820> so<00:02:08.820> if<00:02:08.880> people<00:02:09.030> want<00:02:09.300> more
