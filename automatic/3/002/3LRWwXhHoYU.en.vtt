 rounding and a little shock 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.720
 heading beyond paris we will change the

 bluecar of the city of paris here we do not 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.460
 not with only 80 places 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.150
 parking available the repair must 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.030
 be completed in 48 hours maximum 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.500
 we have about 50 cars a day that 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.810
 enter the center for 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.880
 repairs 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.340
 various ie vandalism 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.040
 little vandalism of the diagnosis the analysis 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.460
 on the engine the battery you can have 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.159
 shocks from serious accidents so from 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.860
 the bodywork and then the breakdown 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.149
 mechanical I 'll go classic that looks 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.090
 at the mechanical breakdown of a car 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.830
 thermal the batteries when they do not 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.350
 are not repaired on this site 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.170
 the bollorÃ© group made the choice of 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.590
 lithium metal polymer a battery of 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.140
 300 kilos of autonomy of 250 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.700
 kilometers at this stage none has yet 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.250
 reaches 1000 recharge cycles 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.159
 expected but the accidents can 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.600
 damaging all these batteries are in 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.149
 waiting for a carrier we will 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.039
 send back to our factory behind guy 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.840
 Gaberic next to quimper in the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.299
 battery we have a lot of sensors 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.890
 all these sensors you are masters of 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:18.390
 information and we in case of 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.230
 of information jacky us by a small 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.819
 not very delicate 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.409
 we will dismount the battery pack on 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.460
 send back to brittany where there is going to be 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.460
 analysis 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.430
 remy reconditioned if needed and after 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.680
 will get back in the car 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.230
 that's it for the repairs the waste 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.000
 as for them are sorted and shipped to 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.830
 recyclers 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.960
 it must be said that the fluids are not 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.810
 so many in an electric vehicle 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.430
 fluids from us we have very little of 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.900
 do not have oil 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.700
 practically in our car on 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.500
 our electric motor has the advantage of 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.150
 power purpose so we actually have one 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.480
 half liter of oil in the box 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.270
 speeds and the only leaks we're going 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.280
 to have it going to be the windshield washer 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.570
 optionally brake fluid although 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.850
 it's pretty rare was small 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.010
 quantities and then the liquid of 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.990
 engine cooling thanks to 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.690
 the activity of this garage the rate of 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.430
 autolib repair remains under control and 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.640
 does not impact the available fleet 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.310
 for the lease a fleet that should 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.790
 reach the 3000 vehicles by the time 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.790
 end of the year
