00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.750
 Let's see 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.180
 it's for you 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.580
 hello very good everyone today I bring you 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.730
 a video about 15 curiosities of the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.619
 simpson good we started 15 the creator 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.480
 of the matt groening series used the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.490
 names of your own family for 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.369
 characters in the series but replaced his 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.350
 own name by that of bart simpson is 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.570
 as if you will recreate your family in the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.420
 series I practically think that's where that came from 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.630
 the idea of the simpsons 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.760
 14 springfield the city where the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.280
 popular family does not reference 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.470
 specific to a de facto USA place 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.470
 there are cities called that in 30 states 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.420
 from that country hahahaha this means 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.210
 that there are like 30 cities called 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.030
 springfield 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.649
 13 there is a clause in the contract of 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.780
 the series that prohibits managers 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.059
 of the fox censuren do not make cuts in 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.940
 some episode this allows there to be 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.769
 many ridicules about the string to threads of 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.870
 the fox and the stars to the eggs of 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.570
 those teasing 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.360
 where the only character who has five 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.760
 fingers in the series is god in an episode 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.640
 Lisa told him to span 5000 years on 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.200
 man would have five fingers of fable 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.780
 the reverent boy replied 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.850
 11 the homero and marge benders in 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.070
 France philippe mathieu and verón and that 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.670
 boring or married in real life in 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.759
 2001 after being known in 1989 recording the 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.240
 series what more incredible coincidence the 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.409
 true 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:42.960
 et marie was born on August 19, 1985 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:46.320
 Lisa on January 25 , 1982 and bar on 17 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.259
 December 1979 although these do not 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.659
 they grow up with good reason I've seen the 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.750
 simpson and the only one who gets old is me and 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.020
 they continue as if nothing 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.090
 in this there are two theories one is that the 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.860
 simpson are yellow because the paper in 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.050
 the one that groening the drawings for the first 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.000
 once it was that color and the other that 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.710
 yellow color of his characters had 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.600
 as a purpose in principle that at 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.380
 switch between channels out of easy 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.380
 distinction 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.640
 8 you know what is the age of homero and 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.490
 Flanders then I'll tell you that, homero 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.740
 averages 41 years and ned flanders 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.590
 is 60 years old shit this yes they are 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.470
 old not fuck peronnet flanders do not know 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.260
 he notices how old he is 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.420
 7 Matt is said to groan the brain 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.180
 behind the simpsons he created the drawings 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.040
 in just 15 minutes I would have done it 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.320
 while waiting to enter a meeting 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.000
 with one of the suit executives you'd 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.880
 man show 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.100
 6 well you know how many times it has been 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.820
 rejected moe moe has been rejected by 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:54.940
 110 women there and I complaining when 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:57.760
 they reject me this is to have bad luck 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.980
 5 favorite beer 2 of homero 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.950
 simpson is sold in real version in a 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.050
 tour of the series in universal studios 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.060
 there I have to go to that place I will not be able 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.700
 live in peace without having to be 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.670
 tried one 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.440
 4 Juan Mole has been killed several 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.569
 times in the series or has been a victim of 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.400
 accidents and to also add how much 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.489
 x has a city ​​of men mole in 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.470
 the poor springfield sewers 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.230
 man mole the young at every moment 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.450
 after the episode where there has grown a 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.920
 elephant was based on a true story 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.960
 happened in 1956 because this means 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.890
 that real life is even more 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.810
 surprising that the same fiction 2 this 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.610
 it's crazy to take the hybrid between a 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.280
 tomato and the tobacco that homero creates in 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.730
 actually there are tomatoes that have 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.010
 nicotine in shit I wonder 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.470
 where can I get more than one of 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.980
 those plants the truth I never imagined 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.750
 that this was real and the first word 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.730
 of maggie simpson was paper and in the 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.280
 english version was elizabeth taylor 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.680

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.690

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.940
