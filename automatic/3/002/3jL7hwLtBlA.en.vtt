 in agreement we go to this page it is worth 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:40.230

 find knows to find the goals 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.940
 Lyon not knowing how to find and at the end 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.810
 is that it is very good and now look 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.470
 moment 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.470
 how 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.960
 although here at home we have an iphone 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.890
 I had to wait for the iphone 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.619
 5 s and here as you see the model there 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.690
 here in Spain at least in Spain 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.680
 well here you can find the furniture 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.390

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.690
 that spain 14 14 57 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.790

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.630

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.980

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:42.220
 and downloaded 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.810
 I'm going to stop this 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.670
 because I downloaded one that was not and 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.180
