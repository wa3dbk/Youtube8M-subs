00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
here's the bad thing about this game it

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.490 
here's the bad thing about this game it
tells<00:05:42.340> you<00:05:42.580> if<00:05:42.940> something<00:05:43.419> is<00:05:43.750> equippable<00:05:44.259> why

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
tells you if something is equippable why

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.110 
tells you if something is equippable why
somebody<00:05:44.889> but<00:05:45.430> doesn't<00:05:45.699> tell<00:05:45.820> you<00:05:45.940> if<00:05:46.030> it's

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
somebody but doesn't tell you if it's

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.140 
somebody but doesn't tell you if it's
actually<00:05:46.479> better<00:05:46.750> than<00:05:46.900> what<00:05:47.169> you<00:05:47.289> have<00:05:47.440> now

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
actually better than what you have now

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.060 
actually better than what you have now
so<00:05:49.150> I<00:05:49.180> really<00:05:49.300> wish<00:05:50.050> that<00:05:50.349> wasn't<00:05:50.650> the<00:05:50.860> case

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
so I really wish that wasn't the case

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.649 
so I really wish that wasn't the case
but<00:05:51.539> whatever<00:05:52.539> i<00:05:52.630> guess<00:05:53.909> the<00:05:54.909> steel<00:05:55.150> sword<00:05:55.449> is

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:55.659
