00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
ok now we're going to forward our router

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:38.869 
ok now we're going to forward our router
or<00:03:33.540> what<00:03:34.049> pull<00:03:34.199> it<00:03:34.319> I<00:03:34.379> guess<00:03:37.669> you'll<00:03:38.669> be<00:03:38.729> able

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
or what pull it I guess you'll be able

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.280 
or what pull it I guess you'll be able
to<00:03:38.970> do<00:03:39.090> this<00:03:39.209> on<00:03:39.389> your<00:03:39.419> wrist<00:03:39.599> most<00:03:39.930> likely

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
to do this on your wrist most likely

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.949 
to do this on your wrist most likely
most<00:03:40.799> likely<00:03:41.159> because<00:03:41.370> our<00:03:42.120> names<00:03:42.750> and

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
most likely because our names and

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.490 
most likely because our names and
passwords<00:03:43.229> are<00:03:43.560> different<00:03:44.720> and<00:03:45.720> all<00:03:46.379> the

passwords are different and all the
riders<00:03:46.680> are<00:03:46.949> different<00:03:47.870> so<00:03:48.870> click<00:03:49.260> login<00:03:49.500> and

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
riders are different so click login and

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:55.129 
riders are different so click login and
then<00:03:50.129> put<00:03:50.400> firewall<00:03:50.940> settings<00:03:51.389> and<00:03:52.260> yes<00:03:54.139> port

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
then put firewall settings and yes port

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.569 
then put firewall settings and yes port
forwarding<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:56.299> then<00:03:57.299> we'll<00:03:57.540> go<00:03:57.689> start<00:03:58.579> what

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
forwarding and then we'll go start what

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.719
