00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.480 
is eleven point eight fluid ounces which
i<00:00:11.460> think<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.790> perfect<00:00:12.269> for<00:00:12.480> nano<00:00:12.780> tanks<00:00:13.490> my

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490

getting ready to use this bottle go

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.190 
getting ready to use this bottle go
ahead<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.610> shake<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.939> up<00:01:06.060> real<00:01:06.270> good<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
ahead and shake it up real good on the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.390 
ahead and shake it up real good on the
way<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.500> they<00:01:07.619> measure<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.390> do<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> cap<00:01:09.810> fool

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
way that they measure is do the cap fool

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.469 
way that they measure is do the cap fool
you're<00:01:11.400> supposed<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.670> look<00:01:11.820> at<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> threads

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
you're supposed to look at the threads

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.810 
you're supposed to look at the threads
on<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.110> cap<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.560> each<00:01:13.979> thread<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.520> supposed

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
on the cap and each thread is supposed

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.840 
on the cap and each thread is supposed
to<00:01:14.880> equal<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.450> 2<00:01:15.659> milliliters<00:01:16.640> you<00:01:17.640> need<00:01:17.820> a

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
to equal to 2 milliliters you need a

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.270 
to equal to 2 milliliters you need a
total<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.390> 7<00:01:18.780> milliliters<00:01:19.259> per<00:01:19.290> every<00:01:19.920> 30

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
total of 7 milliliters per every 30

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.330 
total of 7 milliliters per every 30
gallons<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.659> tank<00:01:22.380> volume<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.159> have

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
gallons of a tank volume that you have

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.380 
gallons of a tank volume that you have
um<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.900> 120<00:01:25.350> gallon<00:01:25.860> tank<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.000> went

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
um I have a 120 gallon tank so I went

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.770 
um I have a 120 gallon tank so I went
ahead<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.770> use<00:01:28.770> 30<00:01:29.130> milliliters<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.540> best

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
ahead and use 30 milliliters the best

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.899 
ahead and use 30 milliliters the best
way<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.950> pre<00:01:32.340> measure<00:01:32.549> and

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
way to do this is to pre measure and

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.120 
way to do this is to pre measure and
then<00:01:33.720> pour<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.229> into<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.500> separate<00:01:35.009> container

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
then pour it into a separate container

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.120 
then pour it into a separate container
because<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.119> using<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> cap<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.740> kind<00:01:38.040> of

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
because the using the cap is kind of

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.240 
because the using the cap is kind of
clumsy<00:01:38.780> when<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.810> get<00:01:40.530> ready<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.829> dose<00:01:41.070> this

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
clumsy when I get ready to dose this

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.889 
clumsy when I get ready to dose this
product<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.880> don't<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.360> turn<00:01:42.509> off<00:01:42.689> your

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
product you don't have to turn off your

product you don't have to turn off your
protein<00:01:43.560> skimmer<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.159> go<00:01:44.280> ahead<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.640> go

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
protein skimmer you can go ahead and go

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.910 
protein skimmer you can go ahead and go
sit<00:01:44.939> into<00:01:45.060> your<00:01:45.149> tank<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:46.259> was<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.560> method<00:01:46.740> I

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
sit into your tank this was the method I

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.950 
sit into your tank this was the method I
use<00:01:47.100> or<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> first<00:01:47.579> used<00:01:47.850> was<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.210> target<00:01:48.659> feed
