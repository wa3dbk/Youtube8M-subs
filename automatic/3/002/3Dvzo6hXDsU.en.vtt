00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:10.860
 Hello 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:12.920
 Doing for the combination and whether One of odd-lot of permutations of the case of mathematics a math is Okamura today 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.420
 I do not want to go 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:23.180
 Well first I think I'm going to go a bit from the story of this word, but 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.200
 Do I think we have is what people who do not know to say if it is possible to say that the permutation combination Mata 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.730
 In I think 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:33.620
 We'll look Well Jun'etsu this 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:38.540
 Is this not a sense that I read, as the say? This order in the order of character 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:42.470
 I'm meaning, such as Tteyuu Toka fish in the Toka that over Ichiru 2 What this column 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.539
 In fact, this means in order 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.670
 Please have an image of 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:53.600
 Dekun 's It is a city that I combination is a combination here that 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:58.090
 I'm not lined here, in fact I'm not . 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.090
 Sensory sense has a choice 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.070
 so 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.650
 It is people Well First 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:11.590
 No longer I know I am well and say risk people to study that Tangyou is 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.220
 Well before is because I do not know of I mean Tsu to use permutations and combinations This Which by the problem 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.610
 There is 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.880
 Today I will try to explain how to identify the Great Genie 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.970
 Yes 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:26.080
 Well then first of all this 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:29.850
 You some luggage are I come in words and both came out the same words it is real is 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.850
 So when the nice selfish say the same words 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.000
 It is such a word 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.310
 I'd changed in the wind of choosing a walk from n schools 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.380
 For example yeah 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.380
 Well Well from 10 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.890
 5 pieces 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.430
 Choose 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:11.510
 This n and early is more than numbers 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.560
 And of course this n's ro contains big numbers 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.680
 Like 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:21.069
 I remember this way it will come out absolutely in common 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.670
 In because yo different integration absolutely here is 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.670
 Line up 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.720
 The keyword absolutely 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.190
 If you put a keyword put this side by side tom almost what I say that Tom 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.430
 Please judge that it is a permutation 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.860
 I just choose the reverse combination 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.860
 There is no keyword Tteyuu arranged in what 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:50.299
 Well, I think that it makes sense to identify everyone 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.340
 It is not possible to line up It is both to choose 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.370
 I do not see why 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.390
 Here please judge in 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:02.810
 In a little by using a cold agent 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:06.800
 I have four problems now, so it's about a minute 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.790
 Then think about which one is ready and the birds combine . 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.790
 Please start 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.060
 It is about 30 seconds 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.780
 Please try to select while burning a little keyword a while ago 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.540
 Then I will check for a moment 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.170
 First of all 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.870
 So please look at the brackets biggest problem 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.209
 How about this 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:25.150
 Do you have a key 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:28.470
 I think there will be a keyword to line up here 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.520
 Yes, this is 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.520
 It is a permutation 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:44.330
 It is the third and how about this when it is arranged 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:47.770
 When you go to see and choose, how to choose is written and I do not arrange it 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.770
 That is a combination of this 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.639
 It is the third and how about this 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.900
 Six different 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.380
 Colored paper 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.580
 Is a combination'm is written I divided into three sets 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.580
 Arranging There is no 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.200
 Hey This How about I'd have catered to more than I am # 4 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:15.710
 I think there are many people who got lost 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:20.900
 It is a four-digit number of integer which is made by taking the four digits from seven digits 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:24.560
 If it is this, there is no keyword such as bell, but when making that 4 digit number 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:27.050
 8, for example So from 1 to 7 digits 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:33.020
 And Goto 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:34.970
 I think you make 4 digits or side by side this Once you have chosen to say I eh 6 and 9 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:40.350
 For example 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:43.850
 As it is arranged in the feeling called 396, this means that it is actually arranged is included 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.850
 It was permutation 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.000
 How about that 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.720
 To say 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.680
 Once it is a long time how to distinguish this permutation or combination 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:02.690
 It follows that were the talk guess that the next time 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:05.470
 This is because I'm going to talk about how to calculate and ask . 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:08.760
 I will never forget 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.760
 Thank you so much
