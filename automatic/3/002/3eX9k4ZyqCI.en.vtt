00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.810
 we are in the stable santo domingo- 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.770
 as you can appreciate is a stable 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.250
 dairy 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:27.820
 the time of these animals is the one that goes 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:31.330
 to make by means of the biodigester 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.330
 come with me please 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.980
 this biodigester has a system of 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.030
 application which I am going to show you 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.309
 This is a steel gate as 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.320
 inside this gate was a 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.510
 agitator with a steel mast 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.040
 stainless that agitator what's going to 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.410
 do is remove the manure that is 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.660
 within the digester so that 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.339
 there are suspended particles and those 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.270
 suspended particles are going to make 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:01.020
 the biogas is generated more quickly 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.050
 the lagoon is covered by a material 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.610
 synthetic called membrane that is the one 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.930
 store the biogas as you can see it is 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.660
 specific digester already has a lot 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.660
 stored biogas please tell me please 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.050
 As you can see it is very resistant 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.050
 but it's kind of weird they knew him 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.670
 you have to be careful not going to give it away 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.610
 this is a relief valve in given 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.190
 If the biodigester is full of 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.290
 biogas and its capacity was released this 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.360
 valve so there is no problem 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.150
 and we can not have some kind of 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.650
 accident usually that must happen 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.390
 first by a burner but in given 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.070
 case it is very 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.810
 serious the problem of being too 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.140
 inflated to not have any 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.940
 contingency the Libyan valve opens 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.310
 next let's see what they are 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.920
 the mud lines usually what 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.080
 we know how shots are made of 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.640
 a high polyethylene material 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.640
 density follow me please 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.720
 ah 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.170
 These shots are 4 inches open 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.090
 with these plugs are going to open here 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.239
 connects a sludge extraction pump 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.950
 these muds 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.769
 they are very rich in humus, therefore the 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.819
 you can water be in your fields and the 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.010
 it's also a good alternative 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.010
 for those who use fertilizers 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.910
 of solid type curtain made in 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.910
 stainless steel 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.450
 then we go with the call 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.430
 can appreciate the charge the battery of 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.010
 monitoring equipment 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.320
 here we are monitoring the data and the 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.320
 smoke that is having our digester 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:28.390
 this magic flow is telling us 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.390
 how many cubic meters are generating 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.600
 then we passed by company 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.310
 It is a patented system 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.410
 our burner costs like a grate 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.630
 to be able to control the air that is 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.360
 the scammer and being able to control the flow of 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.520
 the combustion that we are going to have 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.490
 as you can see in the distance is 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.050
 Serbian I said I'm with all your driving 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.090
 after the biodigester we turn to 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.590
 a secondary union by means of a 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:15.430
 treatment is going to discard the water to 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.430
 fields
