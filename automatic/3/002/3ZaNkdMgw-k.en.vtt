the<00:01:01.500> density<00:01:01.979> of<00:01:02.009> the<00:01:02.250> gash<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.930> I'm<00:01:03.930> just

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the density of the gash and I'm just

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.760 
the density of the gash and I'm just
applying<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:05.549> random<00:01:06.270> areas<00:01:06.900> around<00:01:07.350> my

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770

this<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.700> another<00:01:14.970> easy<00:01:15.270> way<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.630> apply<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.320> you

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
this is another easy way to apply it you

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.740 
this is another easy way to apply it you
basically<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.579> some<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:17.909> your<00:01:18.000> spatula<00:01:18.540> and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
basically get some on your spatula and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.030 
basically get some on your spatula and
you<00:01:19.259> run<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.770> through<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:22.590> kind<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.860> like

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
you run it through and it kind of like

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.190 
you run it through and it kind of like
makes<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.670> gash<00:01:23.850> for<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.630> then<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.990> just

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
makes the gash for you and then you just

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.749 
makes the gash for you and then you just
blend<00:01:25.470> out<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.920> edges<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.369> always<00:01:28.759> third

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
blend out the edges as always third

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.219 
blend out the edges as always third
degree<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.060> very<00:01:30.329> shiny<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.960> you're<00:01:31.079> going<00:01:31.200> to

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
degree is very shiny so you're going to

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.039 
degree is very shiny so you're going to
want<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.469> apply<00:01:31.969> colored<00:01:32.969> face<00:01:33.270> powder<00:01:33.569> to<00:01:33.899> it

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.789 
want to apply colored face powder to it
so<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.249> it<00:01:35.520> doesn't<00:01:35.999> appear<00:01:36.270> shiny<00:01:36.799> and

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
so that it doesn't appear shiny and

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.200 
so that it doesn't appear shiny and
might<00:01:38.249> as<00:01:38.340> well<00:01:38.429> do<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.670> rest<00:01:38.789> of<00:01:38.969> your<00:01:39.060> face
