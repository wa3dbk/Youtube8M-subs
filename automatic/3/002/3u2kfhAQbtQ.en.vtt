00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.210

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.650
 is ok right now now nothing is missing 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.930
 open the poster what 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.730
 I do not know if it's this western but I'm going to 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.880
 open this me to see what happens 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:08.620
 although since we already have what is the 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:12.610
 poster or this program well is in 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:15.320
 this language fuck I had it in Spanish 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.700
 as they come to pass it Spanish we are going to 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.950
 click here in the third option 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.770
 then here and we're going to give the Spanish 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.170
 Latin or 'Spain block and well already 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.450
 we have our program created and in 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.060
 Spanish 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.060
 well now what we need is a usb 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.519
 which will connect and we will give 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.950
 click here where it says add let's 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.349
 select here the device or in 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.780
 case the usb and there we will select 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.480
 than the cache size or the size of 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.950
 ram memory and we want to assign in this 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.650
 case I recommend that it be a 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.650
 memory of a giga do not overdo it either 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.879
 because they can damage the equipment and 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.110
 its processor ok so well I think 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.440
 that would be all in this video 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.290
 tutorial to good fast select here 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.910
 the device select the quantity 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.630
 of cache or size here tells them you 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.420
 they give ok 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.370
 and will start working with what is the 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.210
 cache and when you finish you will have your 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.410
 usb memory right now just do not go to 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.410
 what is this 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.519
 do not go to remove the usb because the 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.879
 they can damage there they must close 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:29.360
 first the booster ok and eye the usb not 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.590
 must have no file I think that 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.860
 that would be all in this video tutorial 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.439
