 milk in there blows one of the steam a 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.230
 once you've made a cell and we're going 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.730

 milk in the coffee is a hand 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:19.689
 from high enough to keep a 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.249
 surface marl brown tones 6 or background 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:26.560
 of the cup and leave the surface of the 

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:28.060
 immaculate coffee december the sin at 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.469
 level of the surface by holding the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.130
 beginning is not hesitated to rely on
