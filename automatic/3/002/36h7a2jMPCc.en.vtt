but<00:01:17.549> we'll<00:01:17.729> be<00:01:17.850> testing<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.509> I'm<00:01:19.170> probably

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
but we'll be testing this I'm probably

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.109 
but we'll be testing this I'm probably
going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.799> test<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.159> with<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.340> Panasonic

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119

audio<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:27.450> my<00:01:27.750> convert<00:01:28.229> but<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.740> can

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
audio in for my convert but you can

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.429 
audio in for my convert but you can
obviously<00:01:29.369> test<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.030> with<00:01:30.360> pretty<00:01:30.930> much<00:01:31.110> any

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
obviously test this with pretty much any

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.039 
obviously test this with pretty much any
camcorder<00:01:32.070> or<00:01:32.579> DSLR<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.600> has<00:01:34.020> a

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
three-and-a-half millimeter mic input so

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.510 
three-and-a-half millimeter mic input so
this<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.380> how<00:01:37.500> its<00:01:37.650> presented<00:01:37.799> when<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.340> take

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
this is how its presented when you take

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.850 
this is how its presented when you take
it<00:01:38.640> out<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.850> packaging<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:40.110> think<00:01:40.470> from

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
it out of the packaging and I think from

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.090 
it out of the packaging and I think from
memory<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.840> undo<00:01:42.840> these<00:01:43.110> side<00:01:43.470> ones<00:01:43.740> first

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
memory you undo these side ones first

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.940 
memory you undo these side ones first
and<00:01:44.369> then<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.270> peel<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.659> forwards<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.409> we've

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and then we peel this forwards and we've

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.859 
and then we peel this forwards and we've
got<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.280> little<00:01:47.399> box<00:01:47.700> or<00:01:47.970> little<00:01:48.360> package<00:01:48.689> of

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
got a little box or little package of

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.280 
got a little box or little package of
goodies<00:01:49.829> there<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.460> then<00:01:51.119> we<00:01:51.600> can<00:01:51.630> take<00:01:52.110> this

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
goodies there and then we can take this

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.740 
goodies there and then we can take this
off<00:01:52.500> I've<00:01:53.369> actually<00:01:53.549> gained<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.240> microphone

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.149 
a bit greater detail we have also got
some<00:02:02.719> instructions<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.990> they're<00:02:04.979> pretty

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
some instructions and they're pretty

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.670 
some instructions and they're pretty
well<00:02:05.759> laid<00:02:06.030> out<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.420> I've<00:02:07.320> used<00:02:07.500> these

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
well laid out and I've used these

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.010 
well laid out and I've used these
instructions<00:02:08.310> before<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.940> they<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:09.599> guide

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
instructions before and they just guide

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.690 
instructions before and they just guide
you<00:02:10.229> through<00:02:10.530> some<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.250> soft<00:02:11.459> features

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
you through some of the soft features

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.759 
you through some of the soft features
and<00:02:12.209> settings<00:02:12.420> except

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
and settings except

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.240 
and settings except
on<00:02:14.769> to<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.280> actual<00:02:16.230> microphone<00:02:17.230> itself<00:02:17.590> let's

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
on to the actual microphone itself let's

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.690 
on to the actual microphone itself let's
just<00:02:18.459> kill<00:02:18.760> this<00:02:18.909> back<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.959> we<00:02:23.519> can<00:02:24.519> have<00:02:24.670> a

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
just kill this back and we can have a

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.259 
just kill this back and we can have a
look<00:02:24.879> at<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.299> MK<00:02:25.569> 200<00:02:26.530> before<00:02:27.489> we<00:02:27.609> do<00:02:27.760> so<00:02:28.000> we

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
look at the MK 200 before we do so we

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.449 
look at the MK 200 before we do so we
just<00:02:28.450> point<00:02:29.170> out<00:02:29.379> you<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.069> do<00:02:30.250> get

just point out you that you do get

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.970 
just point out you that you do get
batteries<00:02:31.060> included<00:02:31.599> it<00:02:31.689> runs<00:02:31.930> off<00:02:32.109> of<00:02:32.139> to

here see the little hole here and then
this<00:03:07.840> organ<00:03:08.200> capsule<00:03:08.680> AIT's<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:09.040> whole

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
this organ capsule AIT's the whole

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.149 
this organ capsule AIT's the whole
microphone<00:03:09.969> so<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.599> sort<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:10.870> carry<00:03:11.139> case<00:03:11.469> come

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
microphone so I sort of carry case come

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.500 
microphone so I sort of carry case come
windshield<00:03:13.030> that<00:03:13.750> is<00:03:14.139> molting<00:03:14.709> on<00:03:14.950> my<00:03:15.430> desk<00:03:15.730> so

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
windshield that is molting on my desk so

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.449 
windshield that is molting on my desk so
probably<00:03:16.870> give<00:03:16.989> this<00:03:17.109> a<00:03:17.260> good<00:03:17.440> shake<00:03:17.470> before

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
probably give this a good shake before

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.210 
probably give this a good shake before
you<00:03:19.120> use<00:03:19.419> it<00:03:19.449> near<00:03:20.349> your<00:03:20.470> lenses<00:03:20.919> and<00:03:21.129> then

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
you use it near your lenses and then

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.530 
you use it near your lenses and then
we've<00:03:21.370> got<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.639> two<00:03:21.790> batches<00:03:22.209> which<00:03:22.359> would

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
we've got the two batches which would

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.479 
we've got the two batches which would
pop<00:03:22.690> off<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.989> one<00:03:23.109> side<00:03:23.139> it's<00:03:23.979> do<00:03:24.129> a<00:03:24.159> little<00:03:24.310> bit

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
pop off to one side it's do a little bit

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.339 
pop off to one side it's do a little bit
of<00:03:24.579> cleaning<00:03:25.239> before<00:03:25.569> we<00:03:25.900> show<00:03:26.109> you<00:03:26.169> the

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
of cleaning before we show you the

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.490 
of cleaning before we show you the
microphone<00:03:26.889> and<00:03:27.129> this<00:03:28.120> is<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.419> hem<00:03:28.629> k200

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
microphone and this is the hem k200

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.170 
microphone and this is the hem k200
itself<00:03:29.829> I<00:03:29.979> really<00:03:30.010> wasn't<00:03:30.400> expecting<00:03:30.970> that

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
itself I really wasn't expecting that

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.569 
itself I really wasn't expecting that
so<00:03:31.810> we<00:03:31.989> have<00:03:32.139> got<00:03:32.379> an<00:03:32.739> additional<00:03:33.250> sort<00:03:33.489> of

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
so we have got an additional sort of

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.330 
so we have got an additional sort of
sponge<00:03:34.299> type<00:03:34.689> shield<00:03:35.500> on<00:03:35.829> the<00:03:35.979> front<00:03:36.189> of<00:03:36.250> the

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
sponge type shield on the front of the

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.759 
sponge type shield on the front of the
mic<00:03:36.519> and<00:03:36.819> this<00:03:37.269> is<00:03:37.449> the<00:03:37.720> sort<00:03:38.199> of<00:03:38.229> electric

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
mic and this is the sort of electric

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.129 
mic and this is the sort of electric
pickups<00:03:39.280> on<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:40.060> side<00:03:40.269> here<00:03:40.510> so<00:03:40.569> stereo

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
pickups on the side here so stereo

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.759 
pickups on the side here so stereo
pickups<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:41.889> a<00:03:42.639> metal<00:03:43.060> plating<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:44.259> these<00:03:44.500> or

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
pickups and a metal plating to these or

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.569 
pickups and a metal plating to these or
front<00:03:45.099> end<00:03:45.310> or<00:03:45.579> the<00:03:45.930> mic<00:03:46.930> portion<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.949> the<00:03:48.250> MK

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
front end or the mic portion of the MK

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.629 
front end or the mic portion of the MK
200<00:03:49.269> and<00:03:49.449> then<00:03:50.049> this<00:03:50.169> dish<00:03:50.739> slides<00:03:51.069> on<00:03:51.280> really

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
200 and then this dish slides on really

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.300 
200 and then this dish slides on really
nicely<00:03:51.819> and<00:03:52.449> then<00:03:53.019> we<00:03:53.290> have<00:03:53.470> got<00:03:53.650> some<00:03:53.709> sort<00:03:54.280> of

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
nicely and then we have got some sort of

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.679 
nicely and then we have got some sort of
shock<00:03:54.549> mount<00:03:54.819> as<00:03:55.000> well<00:03:55.030> actually<00:03:55.299> let<00:03:55.599> me

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
shock mount as well actually let me

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:57.059 
shock mount as well actually let me
remove<00:03:55.989> this<00:03:56.169> again<00:03:56.500> so<00:03:56.650> you<00:03:56.739> can<00:03:56.829> see<00:03:57.040> a

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
remove this again so you can see a

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.659 
remove this again so you can see a
little<00:03:57.280> bit<00:03:57.459> clearer<00:03:57.759> in<00:03:58.569> here<00:03:59.530> is<00:03:59.799> or<00:04:00.400> rubber

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:00.669 
little bit clearer in here is or rubber

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.420 
little bit clearer in here is or rubber
silicone<00:04:00.909> and<00:04:01.389> this<00:04:01.900> stops<00:04:02.709> vibrations

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
silicone and this stops vibrations

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.979 
silicone and this stops vibrations
coming<00:04:03.759> through<00:04:04.000> from<00:04:04.239> your<00:04:04.269> camera<00:04:04.810> or<00:04:04.959> your

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
coming through from your camera or your

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.670 
coming through from your camera or your
tripod<00:04:05.790> and<00:04:06.790> really<00:04:07.209> being<00:04:07.389> recorded<00:04:07.750> in<00:04:08.109> the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
tripod and really being recorded in the

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.369 
tripod and really being recorded in the
audio<00:04:09.159> you're<00:04:09.699> picking<00:04:10.030> up<00:04:10.150> with<00:04:10.269> the<00:04:10.359> MK<00:04:10.689> 200

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
audio you're picking up with the MK 200

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.770 
audio you're picking up with the MK 200
so<00:04:12.099> nice<00:04:12.549> way<00:04:12.790> of<00:04:12.879> doing<00:04:13.120> this<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:13.479> this<00:04:13.540> goes

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
so nice way of doing this and this goes

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.420 
so nice way of doing this and this goes
through<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:14.169> the<00:04:14.379> back<00:04:14.560> as<00:04:14.739> well<00:04:14.889> so<00:04:15.220> we've<00:04:15.310> got

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
through to the back as well so we've got

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.969 
through to the back as well so we've got
some<00:04:15.669> shot<00:04:16.030> protection<00:04:16.630> all<00:04:17.229> the<00:04:17.500> way<00:04:17.650> through

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
some shot protection all the way through

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.279 
some shot protection all the way through
and<00:04:18.220> some<00:04:18.669> extra<00:04:19.000> foam<00:04:19.239> in<00:04:19.810> here<00:04:19.840> as<00:04:20.169> well

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
and some extra foam in here as well

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.860 
and some extra foam in here as well
again<00:04:20.560> to<00:04:20.739> dissipate<00:04:21.190> any<00:04:21.459> unwanted<00:04:22.210> sounds

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
again to dissipate any unwanted sounds

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.200 
again to dissipate any unwanted sounds

back panel you can see here we've got a

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.220 
back panel you can see here we've got a
road

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
want to save battery life and then we've

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.990 
want to save battery life and then we've
got<00:04:35.990> some<00:04:36.200> gain<00:04:36.470> sensitivity<00:04:36.800> on<00:04:37.490> this<00:04:37.700> switch

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
very sort of noisy environment and you

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.880 
very sort of noisy environment and you
don't<00:04:44.390> want<00:04:44.570> any<00:04:44.750> distortion<00:04:45.380> in<00:04:45.440> your<00:04:45.590> audio

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
don't want any distortion in your audio

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.060 
don't want any distortion in your audio
then<00:04:46.430> we've<00:04:46.580> got<00:04:46.670> a<00:04:46.700> normal<00:04:46.970> 0<00:04:47.530> DB<00:04:48.530> setting<00:04:48.950> in

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
then we've got a normal 0 DB setting in

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.620 
then we've got a normal 0 DB setting in
the<00:04:49.190> middle<00:04:49.430> there<00:04:49.670> and<00:04:49.790> then<00:04:50.360> we've<00:04:50.510> got<00:04:50.600> a

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
the middle there and then we've got a

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.740 
the middle there and then we've got a
+10<00:04:51.320> DB<00:04:51.560> setting<00:04:52.220> here<00:04:52.520> now<00:04:53.390> what<00:04:53.570> this<00:04:53.690> allows

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
+10 DB setting here now what this allows

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.300 
+10 DB setting here now what this allows
you<00:04:54.140> to<00:04:54.230> do<00:04:54.350> as<00:04:54.470> well<00:04:54.680> is<00:04:54.710> really<00:04:55.130> take

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
you to do as well is really take

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.340 
you to do as well is really take
advantage<00:04:55.820> of<00:04:55.940> the<00:04:56.060> better<00:04:56.270> mic<00:04:56.600> pick<00:04:56.840> up<00:04:57.020> in

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
advantage of the better mic pick up in

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.740 
advantage of the better mic pick up in
here<00:04:57.770> and<00:04:58.040> turn<00:04:58.490> down<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:58.880> audio<00:04:59.030> levels<00:04:59.570> in

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
here and turn down the audio levels in

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.120 
here and turn down the audio levels in
your<00:04:59.900> camera<00:05:00.290> so<00:05:00.590> if<00:05:00.650> you've<00:05:00.770> got<00:05:00.890> a<00:05:00.920> camera

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
your camera so if you've got a camera

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.550 
your camera so if you've got a camera
allows<00:05:01.580> you<00:05:01.730> to<00:05:01.880> adjust<00:05:01.940> audio<00:05:02.510> levels<00:05:02.870> do

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
allows you to adjust audio levels do

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.620 
allows you to adjust audio levels do
experiment<00:05:04.340> with<00:05:04.460> that<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:05.090> lower<00:05:05.300> you<00:05:05.510> can

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
experiment with that the lower you can

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.530 
experiment with that the lower you can
get<00:05:05.780> it<00:05:05.870> in<00:05:05.990> camera<00:05:06.290> the<00:05:07.390> potentially<00:05:08.390> the

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
get it in camera the potentially the

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.970 
get it in camera the potentially the
better<00:05:08.810> quality<00:05:09.080> sound<00:05:09.590> you're<00:05:09.770> going<00:05:09.800> to

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
better quality sound you're going to

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.160 
better quality sound you're going to
achieve<00:05:10.070> and<00:05:10.640> then<00:05:11.270> we've<00:05:11.420> got<00:05:11.510> an<00:05:11.600> LED<00:05:11.990> light

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
achieve and then we've got an LED light

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.900 
achieve and then we've got an LED light
here<00:05:12.560> which<00:05:13.100> is<00:05:13.280> going<00:05:13.400> to<00:05:13.460> give<00:05:13.640> you<00:05:13.730> some

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
here which is going to give you some

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.610 
here which is going to give you some
feedback<00:05:14.090> when<00:05:14.540> the<00:05:14.630> mics<00:05:14.840> on<00:05:15.140> or<00:05:15.350> when<00:05:15.500> the

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
feedback when the mics on or when the

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.010 
feedback when the mics on or when the
battery's<00:05:16.010> low<00:05:16.220> we've<00:05:17.210> got<00:05:17.390> a<00:05:17.420> built-in<00:05:17.780> cable

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
battery's low we've got a built-in cable

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.570 
battery's low we've got a built-in cable
it's<00:05:18.380> quite<00:05:18.620> short<00:05:18.890> the<00:05:19.130> built-in<00:05:19.400> cable

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
it's quite short the built-in cable

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.010 
it's quite short the built-in cable
where<00:05:19.850> it<00:05:19.940> shouldn't<00:05:20.210> be<00:05:20.300> an<00:05:20.390> issue<00:05:20.510> with<00:05:20.780> most

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
where it shouldn't be an issue with most

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.720 
where it shouldn't be an issue with most
cameras<00:05:21.470> you<00:05:21.770> can<00:05:21.890> always<00:05:21.980> use<00:05:22.250> an<00:05:22.340> extension

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
cameras you can always use an extension

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.390 
cameras you can always use an extension
if<00:05:22.940> you<00:05:23.030> need<00:05:23.240> to<00:05:23.450> and<00:05:23.720> then<00:05:23.860> we<00:05:24.860> have<00:05:25.070> got<00:05:25.250> this

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
if you need to and then we have got this

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.490 
if you need to and then we have got this
portion<00:05:25.850> here<00:05:26.180> which<00:05:26.360> allows<00:05:27.020> you<00:05:27.200> to<00:05:27.350> mount

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
portion here which allows you to mount

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.340 
portion here which allows you to mount
this<00:05:27.680> to<00:05:27.950> a<00:05:27.980> hot<00:05:28.280> shoe<00:05:28.550> and<00:05:28.970> then<00:05:29.360> we<00:05:29.870> can<00:05:30.080> screw

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
this to a hot shoe and then we can screw

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.410 
this to a hot shoe and then we can screw
this<00:05:30.500> down<00:05:30.710> to<00:05:30.890> tighten<00:05:31.220> it<00:05:31.340> and<00:05:31.490> again<00:05:32.060> some

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
this down to tighten it and again some

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.060 
this down to tighten it and again some
sort<00:05:32.660> of<00:05:32.750> a<00:05:32.930> shock<00:05:33.230> absorption<00:05:33.620> in<00:05:33.950> this

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
sort of a shock absorption in this

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.920 
sort of a shock absorption in this
portion<00:05:34.490> as<00:05:34.610> well<00:05:34.640> they<00:05:35.270> really<00:05:35.570> thought<00:05:35.750> that

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
portion as well they really thought that

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.900 
portion as well they really thought that
out<00:05:36.080> and<00:05:36.710> then<00:05:36.830> we've<00:05:36.950> got<00:05:37.070> a<00:05:37.100> standard<00:05:37.430> thread

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
out and then we've got a standard thread

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.700 
out and then we've got a standard thread
here<00:05:38.120> so<00:05:38.360> we<00:05:38.480> can<00:05:38.630> attach<00:05:38.900> this<00:05:39.050> to<00:05:39.110> a<00:05:39.260> lighting

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
here so we can attach this to a lighting
