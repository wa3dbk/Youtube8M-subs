experience emotions that we don't even
have<00:02:07.830> access<00:02:08.430> to<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.940> believe<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.930> humans

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
have access to I believe that humans

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.560 
have access to I believe that humans
have<00:02:10.740> a<00:02:11.040> range<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.490> emotion<00:02:11.970> that's<00:02:12.120> probably

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
have a range of emotion that's probably

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.780 
have a range of emotion that's probably
greater<00:02:12.930> than<00:02:13.440> any<00:02:13.650> other<00:02:13.890> animal<00:02:14.220> but<00:02:14.580> when

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
greater than any other animal but when

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.240 
greater than any other animal but when
it<00:02:14.940> comes<00:02:15.210> to<00:02:15.450> intensity<00:02:16.200> there's<00:02:16.830> some

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
it comes to intensity there's some

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.370 
it comes to intensity there's some
animals<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:18.000> are<00:02:18.180> our<00:02:18.390> superior<00:02:19.050> but<00:02:19.350> I

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
animals that are our superior but I

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.550 
animals that are our superior but I
believe<00:02:19.740> for<00:02:20.040> example<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.940> dogs<00:02:21.560> experience

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
believe for example the dogs experience

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.960 
believe for example the dogs experience
friendship<00:02:23.220> more<00:02:23.790> intensely<00:02:24.390> than<00:02:24.480> we<00:02:24.780> do
