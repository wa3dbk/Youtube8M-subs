hey<00:00:47.800> guys<00:00:48.220> today<00:00:48.520> in<00:00:48.640> this<00:00:48.730> video<00:00:48.910> I<00:00:49.090> want<00:00:49.270> to

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
hey guys today in this video I want to

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.150 
hey guys today in this video I want to
cover<00:00:49.390> old<00:00:49.720> catch<00:00:49.960> cans<00:00:50.350> what<00:00:50.649> they<00:00:50.770> are<00:00:50.920> how

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
cover old catch cans what they are how

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.819 
cover old catch cans what they are how
they<00:00:51.190> work<00:00:51.340> and<00:00:51.879> in<00:00:52.480> my<00:00:53.079> opinion<00:00:53.230> if<00:00:53.680> they're

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
they work and in my opinion if they're

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:54.810 
they work and in my opinion if they're
worth<00:00:53.980> it<00:00:54.190> or<00:00:54.280> not

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
worth it or not

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.210 
worth it or not
what<00:00:55.660> animal<00:00:55.930> catch<00:00:56.110> can<00:00:56.410> is<00:00:56.620> is<00:00:56.890> a<00:00:56.920> device

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
what animal catch can is is a device

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.430 
what animal catch can is is a device
just<00:00:57.489> like<00:00:57.610> this<00:00:57.940> it's<00:00:58.180> it's<00:00:58.420> a<00:00:58.510> can<00:00:58.780> and<00:00:59.079> it's

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
just like this it's it's a can and it's

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.400 
just like this it's it's a can and it's
got<00:00:59.559> to<00:00:59.890> an<00:01:00.550> input<00:01:01.000> and<00:01:01.239> an<00:01:01.510> output<00:01:01.600> nipple<00:01:02.260> on

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
got to an input and an output nipple on

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.619 
got to an input and an output nipple on
it<00:01:02.440> and<00:01:02.949> what<00:01:03.430> that<00:01:03.580> does<00:01:03.790> is<00:01:04.059> it<00:01:04.269> takes<00:01:04.300> the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
it and what that does is it takes the

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:05.999 
it and what that does is it takes the
line<00:01:04.869> from<00:01:05.140> your<00:01:05.259> positive<00:01:05.710> crankcase

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
line from your positive crankcase

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.030 
line from your positive crankcase
ventilation<00:01:06.400> in<00:01:07.000> your<00:01:07.300> valve<00:01:07.930> cover<00:01:08.050> and<00:01:08.440> you

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
ventilation in your valve cover and you

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.070 
ventilation in your valve cover and you
basically<00:01:09.280> splice<00:01:09.909> this<00:01:10.150> unit<00:01:10.509> into<00:01:10.780> it<00:01:10.900> so

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
basically splice this unit into it so

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.300 
basically splice this unit into it so
it'll<00:01:11.290> instead<00:01:11.619> of<00:01:11.710> just<00:01:11.830> being<00:01:11.979> a<00:01:12.100> hose<00:01:12.280> that

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
it'll instead of just being a hose that

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.399 
it'll instead of just being a hose that
goes<00:01:12.520> from<00:01:12.790> there<00:01:13.030> and<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.270> your<00:01:13.390> intake<00:01:13.810> you

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
goes from there and to your intake you

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.290 
goes from there and to your intake you
would<00:01:14.560> just<00:01:14.680> cut<00:01:14.920> it<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.700> in<00:01:15.850> line<00:01:16.090> would<00:01:16.240> come

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
would just cut it the in line would come

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.359 
would just cut it the in line would come
in<00:01:16.479> to<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.659> inlet<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.229> and<00:01:17.950> then<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.220> other

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
in to the inlet the and then the other

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.190 
in to the inlet the and then the other
end<00:01:18.729> of<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:18.970> hose<00:01:19.090> would<00:01:19.360> come<00:01:19.600> to<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:19.810> outlet

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
end of the hose would come to the outlet

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.050 
end of the hose would come to the outlet
of<00:01:20.289> this<00:01:20.470> and<00:01:20.680> basically<00:01:21.310> what<00:01:21.520> this<00:01:21.700> does<00:01:21.910> is

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
of this and basically what this does is

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.060 
of this and basically what this does is
it<00:01:22.210> catches<00:01:22.539> all<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.750> vapor<00:01:23.200> or<00:01:23.590> supposedly

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
it catches all the vapor or supposedly

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.820 
it catches all the vapor or supposedly
catches<00:01:24.640> all<00:01:24.759> the<00:01:24.789> vapor<00:01:25.090> from<00:01:25.990> your<00:01:26.380> your

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
catches all the vapor from your your

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.480 
catches all the vapor from your your
your<00:01:27.490> crankcase<00:01:27.940> ventilation<00:01:28.180> valve

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
your crankcase ventilation valve

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.620 
your crankcase ventilation valve
especially<00:01:30.490> important<00:01:30.880> on<00:01:30.940> a<00:01:31.000> boosted<00:01:31.390> car

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
especially important on a boosted car

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.550 
especially important on a boosted car
because<00:01:31.840> you're<00:01:31.929> putting<00:01:32.140> a<00:01:32.170> lot<00:01:32.289> of<00:01:32.320> pressure

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
because you're putting a lot of pressure

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.010 
because you're putting a lot of pressure
in<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.039> internals<00:01:33.490> of<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.670> motor<00:01:33.910> that<00:01:34.210> can

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
in the internals of the motor that can

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.070 
in the internals of the motor that can
multiply<00:01:35.649> those<00:01:36.009> vapors<00:01:36.280> so<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:37.720> reason<00:01:37.990> this

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
multiply those vapors so the reason this

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.529 
multiply those vapors so the reason this
is<00:01:38.140> important<00:01:38.740> in<00:01:38.890> my<00:01:39.070> opinion<00:01:39.100> is<00:01:39.700> because

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
is important in my opinion is because

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.330 
is important in my opinion is because
you<00:01:41.080> know<00:01:41.200> we<00:01:41.380> don't<00:01:41.500> want<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.740> introduce<00:01:42.100> all

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
you know we don't want to introduce all

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.450 
you know we don't want to introduce all
that<00:01:42.840> blow-by<00:01:43.840> back<00:01:44.380> into<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.860> intake<00:01:45.190> of<00:01:45.340> the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
that blow-by back into the intake of the

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.969 
that blow-by back into the intake of the
motor<00:01:45.700> I<00:01:46.390> pulled<00:01:47.020> my<00:01:49.320> throttle<00:01:50.320> body<00:01:50.470> off<00:01:50.740> and

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
motor I pulled my throttle body off and

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.740 
motor I pulled my throttle body off and
look<00:01:51.189> you<00:01:51.400> know<00:01:51.490> down<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.790> intake<00:01:52.150> and<00:01:52.450> and

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
look you know down the intake and and

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.450 
look you know down the intake and and
you<00:01:53.110> know<00:01:53.200> it's<00:01:53.380> really<00:01:53.530> sooty<00:01:54.040> and<00:01:54.280> I<00:01:54.310> was

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
you know it's really sooty and I was

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.679 
you know it's really sooty and I was
wondering<00:01:54.850> you<00:01:54.909> know<00:01:54.939> where<00:01:55.180> a<00:01:55.240> lot<00:01:55.450> of<00:01:55.479> this

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
wondering you know where a lot of this

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.780 
wondering you know where a lot of this
stuff<00:01:55.900> was<00:01:56.049> coming<00:01:56.259> from<00:01:56.530> so<00:01:57.009> I<00:01:57.040> took<00:01:57.340> a<00:01:57.490> whim

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
stuff was coming from so I took a whim

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.060 
stuff was coming from so I took a whim
and<00:01:58.030> I<00:01:58.600> installed<00:01:58.990> this<00:01:59.140> old<00:01:59.320> catch-can<00:01:59.860> and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
and I installed this old catch-can and

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.420 
and I installed this old catch-can and
lo<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.119> behold<00:02:01.210> you<00:02:02.049> can<00:02:02.229> see<00:02:02.470> that<00:02:02.680> it's

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
lo and behold you can see that it's

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.280 
lo and behold you can see that it's
about<00:02:03.579> halfway<00:02:03.850> full<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.570> this<00:02:04.659> is<00:02:04.810> only

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
about halfway full and this is only

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:13.089 
about halfway full and this is only
about<00:02:05.500> four<00:02:05.950> thousand<00:02:06.670> miles

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.459 

and<00:02:13.609> that<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:13.849> nasty<00:02:14.569> stuff<00:02:14.599> that<00:02:15.200> we<00:02:15.439> just

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:15.469 
and that is nasty stuff that we just

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.550 
and that is nasty stuff that we just
saved<00:02:15.980> from<00:02:16.280> going<00:02:16.549> into<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.879> intake<00:02:17.749> the

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
saved from going into the intake the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.369 
saved from going into the intake the
motor<00:02:19.010> so<00:02:19.790> in<00:02:20.239> my<00:02:20.599> opinion<00:02:21.079> this<00:02:21.170> thing

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
motor so in my opinion this thing

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.500 
motor so in my opinion this thing
absolutely<00:02:21.590> is<00:02:22.549> worth<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:22.939> especially<00:02:23.239> on<00:02:23.420> a

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
absolutely is worth it especially on a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.089 
absolutely is worth it especially on a
turbo<00:02:23.900> car<00:02:24.139> I<00:02:24.170> mean<00:02:24.260> look<00:02:24.469> how<00:02:24.560> much<00:02:24.709> stuff<00:02:24.950> we

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
turbo car I mean look how much stuff we

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.190 
turbo car I mean look how much stuff we
caught<00:02:25.310> in<00:02:25.430> only<00:02:25.609> 4000<00:02:26.299> miles<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.749> don't<00:02:26.959> know

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
caught in only 4000 miles I don't know
