00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.990
 you see here the Nokia c3 only one more device from the c-serie which 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.520
 is addressed to the masses and it is the successor to the 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.999
 Nokia c3 0 0 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:22.089
 why you also a test report on our page www Handy - principle and de 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:23.199
 can find 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.779
 Here we see Nokia c3 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.249
 and here the model Nokia c3 0 1 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:35.120
 the already time on the back finds the two models silver and gray and 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.420
 then we have here some technical data it is meant as I said 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.559
 already has dough device and how the operation works exactly it 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.739
 I'll show you in the other videos 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.050
 First, look at how the first impression of the device is the device 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.670
 in the fourth quarter of 2010 appeared 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.610
 and I take it out of the box 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.610
 dpa 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.900
 yes this is the device 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.960
 it's a very slim reminder that Nokia is usually one 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.220
 but a very well made we have little raw material here 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.710
 So it's very narrow 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.700
 he lies very well in the hand that you rounded 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.920
 and for years so that they are also very precious out of this is the gray one 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.040
 Version Â»of the device he was from the first impression percent really felt 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.800
 very good and looks very nice 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.590
 the device costs only five or ten euros more than the Nokia x3 0 2 which 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.210
 also a patient hype device the EHRR here 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.040
 the difference is unique here this rally will give us here 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.880
 to have 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.960
 here we have no ddp-lsa and also how you look 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.340
 this session is more stable here is much more plastic here 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.460
 been processed 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.570
 and that is just stable 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.510
 "Looks like a Leader outside, percent looks rather so 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.330
 Nadal makes this recovery small price difference but one percent 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.680
 big difference 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.239
 at five to ten euros more and you get this device 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.629
 What that affects the operation of her, we looked at each other 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.519
 another video 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.359
 yes what the transmitter here from the outside who more mass hundreds of 11 millimeters 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.350
 sometimes 48 millimeters 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.049
 May 11 millimeters at the thickest point 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.799
 but in the end look on top then we find here once more to the 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.240
 Connector for the charger this is a proprietary charger 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.550
 unfortunately still not so nice device from Nokia because he should be slow 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.359
 the councils are all charged via micro sp 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.760
 Nokia still wants to collect diesels percent proprietary port per man 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:49.239
 This Nokia Chargers at home and do not remember what to do with it 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.989
 Should then we have a wider 5-millimeter jack for headphones then 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.709
 you can take the included or his own 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.109
 and we have a muni quo here is like a gang 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.240
 on the right you will find it here 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.930
 the volume rocker then we have here once the key lock 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.940
 and we have them quickly instead of just the camera or the 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.559
 trigger 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:14.039
 on the left side find nothing 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:17.379
 and Nassau nothing we have the microphone installed 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.910
 and if we look on the backside, we find a 5-megapixel camera 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.349
 and unanimous criticism 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.379
 yes so much the topic from the outside does not look us is in the scope of delivery 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.379
 but I take the stuff off here 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:36.909
 and then the first units are home feels more and more 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.709
 Had hours 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.109
 Here you will find the problem of the charger 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:47.919
 and we now have headphones with 3 2 mm jack 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.809
 Besides, you have the possibility to call Iran with this purchase here 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:53.439
 we have a button 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:56.719
 among others they are not 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:01.569
 Actually, two gigabytes of memory are shipped from the factory, which is now true 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.670
 our trial here is not the case 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.880
 but stands for those that Theres expandable up to 32 gigabytes and us 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.049
 have an internal memory of 48 MW here 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.109
 yes, I see the battery now use once I'm behind here 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.109
 this tells flap a puller 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.180
 this mix well 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.309
 Son then we have our sim card here 

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:36.360
 and can now continue here and then after code percent 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:42.049
 here you have the opportunity to insert a Nico SCK 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.080
 that is not present as I said 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.909
 Honey will push the battery cover back on it with the socket 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.949
 and percent very very stable Mittal 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.800
 I push her too 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.419
 and now the device is one hundred grams 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.580
 So that's really relatively easy 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.240
 that is the ethical fits well in your pocket can be quickly 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.860
 take off in the bottom rail quickly yes it's easy 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.610
 Percent beautiful Nokia device 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.639
 and they said it in part 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.490
 and the operation I show them more videos 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.610
 more we have the opportunity to buy the device as silver costs 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.819
 it's around the hundred and forty euros 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:28.349
 or in gray at that time should then for about one hundred 54 euros
