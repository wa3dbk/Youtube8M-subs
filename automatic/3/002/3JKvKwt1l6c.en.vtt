00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.780
 hello to all I am ally from 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.490
 today for a girl who had me 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.380
 asked so how to make a woman 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.440
 Indian or African we are called that 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.780
 very healthy said she at home but I 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.750
 seen on youtube where most of 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.369
 you call its African braid 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.800
 So it's exactly the same thing there 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.289
 no problem so here I am 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.180
 execute me in the request 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.270
 this is my first video so I do not know 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.660
 at all what will my voice give on the 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.960
 video 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:36.010
 I hope it will not be too shitty 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.440
 so is good video to all and then so 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.479
 I'm going to turn around to see you 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:46.809
 better what I 'm doing behind this is 

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:49.719
 will be more convenient so we start 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.989
 like in fact if you were doing one 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:56.649
 half-tail in the first game on top 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.329
 then in function and is nice and the 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.149
 matches larger or smaller I'm going 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.670
 try to make them relatively small 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:08.980
 story to close my stress enough 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:13.330
 gross stop not more than three kilometers 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.040
 namÃ¨che I tried the time to do in 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.570
 so that it does not happen to die 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.840
 and when I turn around and everything to 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:23.190
 the time I have hair at the base 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.190
 curly that I managed 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.370
 leave a little can happen in them 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.480
 dry styling 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.440
 when I was advised against hairdresser 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:39.460
 but hey it's okay 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.230
 so that's it so you start a very 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.690
 long by taking the highlights on 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.690
 sides it's not the chrome bones 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:58.990
 we see once you've done 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:02:02.689
 this first press you will take 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.729
 my locks on the sides so there I 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.719
 took this one a little too big so the 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.719
 snow and make it very small 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:18.260
 so here I continue the braid like 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:23.420
 if the shonen is normal because the 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:28.660
 machine is my loan I'm going to do 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.660
 like to grow bigger than to create 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.409
 so I do not know if you silhouette 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:45.709
 that she accepts well mu have managed 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:49.739
 September watching the video 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.299
 otherwise sorry bah I will not be better 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.170
 because I think it's a problem 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:59.480
 with m it does not move too much 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:04.769
 this is how I made three communes 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.750
 once you're done but from 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.230
 get all your locks for 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.150
 continue as a normal braid the ars 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.819
 depending on the size of your hair 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.980
 red they are not very long so the a13 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:22.650
 necessarily and not very long but you 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.739
 have more or less time to acer 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.750
 press and saw that you have arms 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.159
 behind it is possible that after one 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.620
 trackpad began to have some 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:38.489
 cramps in the months but you it's 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:43.129
 nothing insurmountable in more calm 13 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.129
 like as between his name marked to 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.379
 never on his side to be able to 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.379
 finish better 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.200
 is found at the same time 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.100
 sajoo is what it gives in front of it 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:15.090
 not catastrophic for once i'm 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:15.090
 rather happy or that's it 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.950
 I will turn thai for you 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.030
 can you see what this gives a 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:33.010
 besieged moment by means also for me 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:34.810
 to control yes so here I hope that 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.940
 you liked this video I'm going to 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.960
 return a second time so that 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.960
 you can see 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.800
 better to make some sort of stop on 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.220
 the mat and you can see more 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.020
 easily what that gives behind 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.810
 once I manipulate the 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.210
 hair i hope you liked my 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:01.590
 video and then good day to all and 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:04.780
 then in hand this is what it gives 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.979
 the rest is the leader of the timeline alas 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.979
 our impulses like that 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.039
 Well, no, I have more than 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.539
 say goodbye again and a next 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.539
 times maybe lease
