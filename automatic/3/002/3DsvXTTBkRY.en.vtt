00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
video is going to be about the mega

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.740 
video is going to be about the mega
evolution<00:00:05.310> of<00:00:05.430> three<00:00:05.640> pokémon<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.359> first

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
evolution of three pokémon and the first

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.700 
evolution of three pokémon and the first
program<00:00:06.960> we're<00:00:07.170> going<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.350> be<00:00:07.410> talking<00:00:07.529> about

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
program we're going to be talking about

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.850 
program we're going to be talking about
is<00:00:08.240> the<00:00:09.240> mega<00:00:09.450> evolution<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:10.080> Meganium<00:00:10.590> as<00:00:10.769> you

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
is the mega evolution of Meganium as you

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.120 
is the mega evolution of Meganium as you
see<00:00:10.980> on<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.099> screen<00:00:11.219> so<00:00:11.820> yeah<00:00:12.000> mega<00:00:12.480> Meganium

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 
see on the screen so yeah mega Meganium

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.109 
see on the screen so yeah mega Meganium
is<00:00:14.130> probably<00:00:15.030> going<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.269> be<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:16.670> exclusive<00:00:17.670> to

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
is probably going to be a exclusive to

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.640 
is probably going to be a exclusive to
pokemon<00:00:18.539> eggs<00:00:18.779> through<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.140> fat<00:00:19.350> guy<00:00:19.470> on<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
pokemon eggs through the fat guy on the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.650 
pokemon eggs through the fat guy on the
right<00:00:19.740> side<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:19.980> Meganium<00:00:20.550> its<00:00:20.820> Pokemon<00:00:21.150> X<00:00:21.539> and

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
right side of Meganium its Pokemon X and

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.750 
right side of Meganium its Pokemon X and
a<00:00:21.779> pokemon<00:00:22.140> X&amp;Y<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:23.010> yeah<00:00:23.130> might<00:00:23.400> be<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.550> mega

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
a pokemon X&amp;Y so yeah might be a mega

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.230 
a pokemon X&amp;Y so yeah might be a mega
evolution<00:00:24.410> 4x<00:00:25.410> only<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.039> when<00:00:26.760> i'm<00:00:26.880> looking

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
evolution 4x only and when i'm looking

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.910 
evolution 4x only and when i'm looking
at<00:00:27.330> mega<00:00:27.810> Meganium<00:00:28.289> there's<00:00:28.529> not<00:00:28.650> really<00:00:28.769> much

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
at mega Meganium there's not really much

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.439 
at mega Meganium there's not really much
of<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.130> difference<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.820> only<00:00:30.000> thing<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.179> can<00:00:30.300> see

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
of a difference the only thing I can see

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.510 
of a difference the only thing I can see
is<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:30.869> more<00:00:31.410> blossom<00:00:31.980> missing<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.369> say

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
is that it's more blossom missing to say

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.060 
is that it's more blossom missing to say
so<00:00:32.579> sort<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:32.969> like<00:00:33.090> Venus<00:00:33.360> or<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:34.170> width<00:00:34.559> vs<00:00:34.890> or

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
so sort of like Venus or the width vs or

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.740 
so sort of like Venus or the width vs or
sprite<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.850> little<00:00:36.210> bit<00:00:36.329> different<00:00:36.690> from

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
sprite is a little bit different from

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.569 
sprite is a little bit different from
its<00:00:36.989> mega<00:00:37.200> evolution<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> fact<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.280> it's

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
its mega evolution to the fact that it's

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.280 
its mega evolution to the fact that it's
more<00:00:38.760> blossom<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.600> ad<00:00:39.719> they're<00:00:39.870> both<00:00:40.020> kind

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
more blossom so the ad they're both kind

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.830 
more blossom so the ad they're both kind
of<00:00:40.350> different<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:41.190> mega<00:00:41.520> pagadian<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.600> see

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
of different with mega pagadian you see

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.260 
of different with mega pagadian you see
that<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:44.430> flowers<00:00:45.000> more

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
that it's it's like flowers more

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.869 
that it's it's like flowers more
blossomed<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.410> also<00:00:46.770> just<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.700> whole

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
blossomed and it's also just the whole

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.490 
blossomed and it's also just the whole
whole<00:00:48.390> entire<00:00:48.600> mecha<00:00:48.870> volition<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.350> just

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
whole entire mecha volition is just

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.799 
whole entire mecha volition is just
broader<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.280> more<00:00:50.370> Baker<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:51.270> more<00:00:51.480> broadly

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
broader and more Baker just more broadly

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.560 
broader and more Baker just more broadly
I<00:00:51.989> guess<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.379> say<00:00:52.820> its<00:00:53.820> tail<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.539> longer

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
I guess you can say its tail is longer

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.229 
I guess you can say its tail is longer
and<00:00:55.020> bushier<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:55.980> bigger<00:00:56.219> than<00:00:56.789> 10<00:00:57.120> on

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
and bushier and just bigger than 10 on

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.209 
and bushier and just bigger than 10 on
top<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.629> his<00:00:57.719> hair<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.379> head<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.829> bigger

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
top of his hair to the head is bigger

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.290 
top of his hair to the head is bigger
it's<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.480> yeah<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.500> yeah<00:01:02.219> what's<00:01:03.030> what<00:01:03.210> I'm

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
it's it yeah so yeah what's what I'm

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.420 
it's it yeah so yeah what's what I'm
seeing<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.960> what<00:01:04.320> I'm<00:01:04.350> seeing<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.220> mega

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
seeing this and what I'm seeing the mega

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.850 
seeing this and what I'm seeing the mega
evolution<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.909> meganium<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.530> that<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:07.710> an

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
evolution of meganium and that it's an

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.100 
evolution of meganium and that it's an
exclusive<00:01:08.070> FX<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.939> I'm<00:01:09.450> also<00:01:09.600> seeing<00:01:09.900> that

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
exclusive FX and I'm also seeing that

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.810 
exclusive FX and I'm also seeing that
Blaziken<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.920> game<00:01:11.040> already<00:01:11.280> I'm

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
Blaziken is in the game already I'm

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.780 
Blaziken is in the game already I'm
guessing<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.330> once<00:01:12.659> they<00:01:12.869> put<00:01:13.229> another

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
guessing that once they put another

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.580 
guessing that once they put another
another<00:01:14.790> patch<00:01:15.119> for<00:01:15.420> mega<00:01:15.630> evolutions<00:01:16.080> that

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590

is going to be a mega Empoleon forge in

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.969 
is going to be a mega Empoleon forge in
for<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.140> might<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.439> an<00:01:19.500> exclusive

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
for and that that might be an exclusive

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.010

now<00:01:33.670> for<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.000> next<00:01:34.150> picture<00:01:35.070> looks<00:01:36.070> like

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
now for the next picture looks like

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.250 
now for the next picture looks like
pictures<00:01:37.060> put<00:01:37.330> together<00:01:37.720> I<00:01:37.810> guess<00:01:38.020> you<00:01:38.140> can

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
pictures put together I guess you can

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.520 
pictures put together I guess you can
say<00:01:38.430> are<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.700> mega<00:01:39.940> evolutions<00:01:40.479> of<00:01:40.630> latios

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
say are the mega evolutions of latios

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.219 
say are the mega evolutions of latios
and<00:01:41.560> latias<00:01:42.040> so<00:01:42.880> yeah<00:01:43.360> and<00:01:43.840> you<00:01:43.930> can<00:01:44.080> see

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
and latias so yeah and you can see

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.050 
and latias so yeah and you can see
they're<00:01:44.710> basically<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.340> same<00:01:45.400> thing<00:01:45.610> that

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
they're basically the same thing that

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.790 
they're basically the same thing that
this<00:01:46.390> fight<00:01:46.630> looks<00:01:46.840> no<00:01:47.050> different<00:01:47.080> except

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
this fight looks no different except

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.100 
this fight looks no different except
latias<00:01:48.610> is<00:01:48.910> like<00:01:49.090> more<00:01:49.450> down<00:01:49.660> to<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:49.930> ground

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
latias is like more down to the ground

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.160 
latias is like more down to the ground
and<00:01:50.729> also<00:01:51.729> it's<00:01:51.880> more<00:01:52.060> slouched<00:01:52.479> over<00:01:52.750> I<00:01:52.990> guess

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
and also it's more slouched over I guess

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.100 
and also it's more slouched over I guess
you<00:01:53.290> can<00:01:53.410> say<00:01:53.590> so<00:01:54.190> yeah<00:01:54.700> what<00:01:55.600> I'm<00:01:55.720> guessing<00:01:55.869> is

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
you can say so yeah what I'm guessing is

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.540 
you can say so yeah what I'm guessing is
that<00:01:56.290> since<00:01:56.500> they're<00:01:56.680> both<00:01:56.710> look<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.369> same

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
that since they're both look the same

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.430 
that since they're both look the same
nor<00:01:58.030> both<00:01:58.210> practically<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.750> same<00:01:58.930> Pokemon

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
nor both practically the same Pokemon

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.520 
nor both practically the same Pokemon
I'm<00:01:59.830> guessing<00:02:00.190> that<00:02:00.220> latias<00:02:01.180> might<00:02:01.930> be<00:02:02.140> for

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
I'm guessing that latias might be for

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.499 
I'm guessing that latias might be for
Pokemon<00:02:03.160> wise<00:02:03.399> since<00:02:03.759> you<00:02:03.910> know<00:02:04.030> I<00:02:04.270> don't<00:02:04.450> know

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
Pokemon wise since you know I don't know

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.050 
Pokemon wise since you know I don't know
as<00:02:04.690> a<00:02:04.720> female<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:05.470> it<00:02:05.710> was<00:02:05.920> red<00:02:06.220> when<00:02:06.729> it<00:02:06.790> was

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
as a female and it was red when it was

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.620 
as a female and it was red when it was
not<00:02:07.570> mega<00:02:07.840> evolution<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:09.009> you<00:02:09.550> know<00:02:09.700> red<00:02:10.330> and

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
not mega evolution so you know red and

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.900 
not mega evolution so you know red and
why<00:02:10.780> then<00:02:11.260> body<00:02:11.500> else<00:02:11.709> is<00:02:11.920> blue<00:02:12.220> was<00:02:12.640> blue

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
why then body else is blue was blue

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.990 
why then body else is blue was blue
before<00:02:13.420> now<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.900> might<00:02:14.020> be<00:02:14.170> on<00:02:14.260> X<00:02:14.560> so<00:02:15.280> yeah<00:02:15.850> this

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
before now it might be on X so yeah this

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.160 
before now it might be on X so yeah this
is<00:02:16.150> something<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.480> scare<00:02:16.690> in<00:02:16.810> mind<00:02:16.959> isn't

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
is something to scare in mind isn't

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.740 
is something to scare in mind isn't
something<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.560> just<00:02:18.280> thought<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:19.150> yeah

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
something I just thought of so yeah

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
something I just thought of so yeah
there's<00:02:19.959> not<00:02:20.050> really<00:02:20.170> like<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.500> said<00:02:20.650> there's

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
there's not really like I said there's

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
there's not really like I said there's
not<00:02:20.860> really<00:02:20.950> much<00:02:21.100> of<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.250> difference<00:02:21.550> between

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
not really much of a difference between

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.720 
not really much of a difference between
these<00:02:21.910> two<00:02:22.590> but<00:02:23.590> when<00:02:23.739> i<00:02:23.770> do<00:02:23.890> mega<00:02:24.250> evolution

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
these two but when i do mega evolution

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.520 
these two but when i do mega evolution
they<00:02:25.060> both<00:02:25.450> turn<00:02:25.750> purple<00:02:26.020> so<00:02:26.290> i'm<00:02:26.350> guessing

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
they both turn purple so i'm guessing

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.280 
they both turn purple so i'm guessing
that<00:02:26.739> they<00:02:27.070> somehow<00:02:27.430> fuse<00:02:27.910> during<00:02:28.330> an<00:02:28.540> event

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
that they somehow fuse during an event

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.740 
that they somehow fuse during an event
or<00:02:29.590> like<00:02:29.830> some<00:02:30.010> updaters<00:02:30.580> something<00:02:31.360> happens

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
or like some updaters something happens

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.600 
or like some updaters something happens
something<00:02:32.080> happens<00:02:32.290> in<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.830> turns<00:02:33.040> makes

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
something happens in the turns makes

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.060 
something happens in the turns makes
them<00:02:33.760> like<00:02:33.970> fuse<00:02:34.269> with<00:02:34.450> each<00:02:34.600> other<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:35.070> yeah

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
them like fuse with each other so yeah

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.060 
them like fuse with each other so yeah
i'm<00:02:36.549> guessing<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.360> how<00:02:38.200> they<00:02:38.350> fuse<00:02:38.650> might<00:02:38.920> be

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
i'm guessing that how they fuse might be

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.740 
i'm guessing that how they fuse might be
with<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.610> DNA<00:02:39.940> splicers<00:02:40.060> i<00:02:40.510> don't<00:02:40.660> know<00:02:40.720> i

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
with the DNA splicers i don't know i

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.020 
with the DNA splicers i don't know i
don't<00:02:40.930> know<00:02:41.080> did<00:02:41.440> it<00:02:41.560> break<00:02:41.769> in<00:02:42.070> june<00:02:42.280> five<00:02:42.519> put

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
don't know did it break in june five put

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
my black and white too I can't remember

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.229 
my black and white too I can't remember
but<00:02:44.620> yeah<00:02:45.400> there's<00:02:45.610> something<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.090> camera

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
but yeah there's something to the camera

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.180 
but yeah there's something to the camera
mine<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:46.780> might<00:02:46.930> be<00:02:46.959> like<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.230> black<00:02:47.530> cure<00:02:48.040> on

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
mine so it might be like a black cure on

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.590 
mine so it might be like a black cure on
the<00:02:48.340> white<00:02:48.489> kiram<00:02:48.820> type<00:02:48.970> thing<00:02:49.180> going<00:02:49.420> on

the white kiram type thing going on

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.509 
the white kiram type thing going on
there<00:02:49.930> so<00:02:50.500> yeah<00:02:50.799> it's<00:02:50.980> pretty<00:02:51.100> is<00:02:51.340> pretty
