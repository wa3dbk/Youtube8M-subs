hello everybody and welcome backs is all

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.080 
hello everybody and welcome backs is all
over<00:00:10.469> here<00:00:10.770> so<00:00:11.040> today<00:00:11.430> we're<00:00:11.670> taking<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:12.059> look

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
over here so today we're taking a look

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.560 
over here so today we're taking a look
at<00:00:12.360> biomes<00:00:12.750> that<00:00:13.500> were<00:00:14.000> converted<00:00:15.000> over<00:00:15.090> using

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
at biomes that were converted over using

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.720 
at biomes that were converted over using
the<00:00:15.660> pc<00:00:15.840> to<00:00:16.139> xbox<00:00:16.470> converter<00:00:16.860> in<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.340> puzzle

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
the pc to xbox converter in a puzzle

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.980 
the pc to xbox converter in a puzzle
piece<00:00:17.910> mod<00:00:18.119> program<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:19.380> i<00:00:19.410> used<00:00:19.980> MCEdit<00:00:20.640> to

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
piece mod program so i used MCEdit to

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.540 
piece mod program so i used MCEdit to
make<00:00:21.990> one<00:00:22.259> of<00:00:22.380> these<00:00:22.470> chunks<00:00:23.070> or<00:00:23.279> each

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
make one of these chunks or each

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.950 
make one of these chunks or each
individual<00:00:24.119> chunk<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.599> separate<00:00:25.410> biome<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.430> i'm

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
individual chunk a separate biome so i'm

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.269 
individual chunk a separate biome so i'm
rather<00:00:27.960> interested<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.649> hell<00:00:28.800> by<00:00:28.980> them<00:00:29.189> to

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
rather interested in the hell by them to

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.200 
rather interested in the hell by them to
be<00:00:29.369> honest<00:00:29.640> because<00:00:29.700> there's<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.029> rather

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
be honest because there's a rather

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.190 
be honest because there's a rather
unique<00:00:30.540> feature<00:00:31.410> with<00:00:31.649> that<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.899> if<00:00:33.899> we<00:00:33.989> come

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
unique feature with that so if we come

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.500 
unique feature with that so if we come
down<00:00:34.230> we<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.620> take<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> look<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.460> few<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.450> these

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
down we can take a look a few of these

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.970 
down we can take a look a few of these
biomes<00:00:36.870> are<00:00:36.989> really<00:00:37.200> doing<00:00:37.380> anything<00:00:37.649> which

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
biomes are really doing anything which

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.490 
biomes are really doing anything which
is<00:00:38.130> kind<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.430> useful<00:00:38.610> for<00:00:39.000> separate<00:00:39.360> things<00:00:39.600> so

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
is kind of useful for separate things so

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.030 
is kind of useful for separate things so
this<00:00:40.650> first<00:00:40.830> one<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.870> sky<00:00:42.870> biome<00:00:43.320> obviously

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
this first one is a sky biome obviously

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.270 
this first one is a sky biome obviously
used<00:00:44.310> in<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.970> end<00:00:45.290> but<00:00:46.290> he<00:00:46.440> changes<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.890> sky

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
used in the end but he changes the sky

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.030 
used in the end but he changes the sky
it<00:00:47.850> completely<00:00:48.390> get<00:00:48.690> rid<00:00:48.720> of<00:00:48.930> them<00:00:49.290> the

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
it completely get rid of them the

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.069 
it completely get rid of them the
daylight<00:00:50.460> kind<00:00:50.790> of<00:00:50.910> very<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.420> sense<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.810> it<00:00:51.930> I

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
daylight kind of very like sense of it I

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.040 
daylight kind of very like sense of it I
just<00:00:52.770> turns<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.190> into<00:00:53.310> you<00:00:53.760> know<00:00:53.880> 24<00:00:54.480> 7<00:00:54.810> night

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
just turns it into you know 24 7 night

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.710 
just turns it into you know 24 7 night
but<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> Sun<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.520> looks<00:00:56.820> out<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.060> place<00:00:57.180> it's

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
but the Sun just looks out of place it's

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.170 
but the Sun just looks out of place it's
so<00:00:57.870> cool<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:59.400> know<00:00:59.520> night<00:00:59.760> just<00:01:00.000> looks

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
of like one of you walk into a changes

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.969 
of like one of you walk into a changes
the<00:01:05.790> night<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.299> saw<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:06.990> guy<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.470> weird<00:01:07.799> but

the night I saw this guy so weird but
it's<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.250> cool<00:01:08.460> at<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.579> same<00:01:08.640> time<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.930> want

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
it's so cool at the same time so I want

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:11.390 
it's so cool at the same time so I want
to<00:01:10.140> jump<00:01:10.259> straight<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.800> cool<00:01:10.950> ones<00:01:11.190> will

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
to jump straight in the cool ones will

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.730 
to jump straight in the cool ones will
get<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.550> the<00:01:11.610> bottom<00:01:11.670> ones<00:01:12.000> at<00:01:12.120> the<00:01:12.180> end<00:01:12.740> so

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
get to the bottom ones at the end so

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.250 
get to the bottom ones at the end so
this<00:01:13.860> one<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:15.210> other<00:01:15.780> dimension

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
this one here is the other dimension

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.820 
this one here is the other dimension
which<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.220> than<00:01:17.640> ever<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.840> as<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.470> can<00:01:19.590> see

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
which is than ever so as you can see

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.920 
which is than ever so as you can see
we're<00:01:20.100> getting<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.340> lot<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.520> spawns<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.210> zombie

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
we're getting a lot of spawns of zombie

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.590 
we're getting a lot of spawns of zombie
pigmen<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.530> that's<00:01:23.010> because<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.280> course<00:01:23.600> this

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
pigmen and that's because of course this

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.080 
pigmen and that's because of course this
is<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.140> nether<00:01:25.530> biome<00:01:25.830> or<00:01:26.040> technically<00:01:26.940> it's

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
is the nether biome or technically it's

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.200 
is the nether biome or technically it's
called<00:01:27.120> the<00:01:27.360> hell<00:01:27.570> biome<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.350> still<00:01:29.010> a<00:01:29.520> nice

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
called the hell biome but still a nice

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.420 
called the hell biome but still a nice
even<00:01:30.450> spawning<00:01:30.930> some<00:01:31.380> ghasts<00:01:31.979> which<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.340> were

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
even spawning some ghasts which you were

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.420 
even spawning some ghasts which you were
built<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.700> see<00:01:32.900> so<00:01:33.900> if<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.650> look<00:01:34.950> very<00:01:35.010> closely

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
built to see so if you look very closely

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.620 
built to see so if you look very closely
just<00:01:35.970> looking<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> sky<00:01:36.479> right<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.680> ready

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
just looking to the sky right you ready

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.600 
just looking to the sky right you ready
you<00:01:39.630> see<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.960> there's<00:01:40.830> a<00:01:40.979> slight<00:01:41.220> color

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
you see that there's a slight color

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.830 
you see that there's a slight color
change<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.470> so<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:44.610> sky<00:01:44.940> actually<00:01:45.570> looks

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
change and so the sky actually looks

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.060 
change and so the sky actually looks
brighter<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:47.190> a<00:01:47.220> brighter<00:01:47.520> blue<00:01:47.840> when<00:01:49.070> you

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
brighter like a brighter blue when you

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.060 
brighter like a brighter blue when you
are<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.700> am<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.570> hell<00:01:51.720> by<00:01:51.869> am<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.830> that's

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
are in the am the hell by am so that's

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.530 
are in the am the hell by am so that's
pretty<00:01:53.280> cool<00:01:53.369> then<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.939> struck<00:01:54.150> her<00:01:54.299> this

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
pretty cool then I struck her this

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.390 
pretty cool then I struck her this
little<00:01:54.659> modern<00:01:55.049> stick<00:01:55.350> here<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.830> I<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:55.979> fall

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
little modern stick here so I can fall

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.640 
little modern stick here so I can fall
on<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:57.439> niley<00:01:58.439> all<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.860> them<00:01:59.010> I<00:01:59.220> don't<00:01:59.670> know<00:01:59.880> why

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
on a niley all of them I don't know why

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.850
