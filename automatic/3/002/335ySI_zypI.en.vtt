had him like I'm a compute of a very

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.560 
had him like I'm a compute of a very
very<00:00:39.570> long<00:00:39.840> time<00:00:39.899> now<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:41.059> this<00:00:42.059> was<00:00:42.300> got<00:00:42.540> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
very long time now and this was got a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.479 
very long time now and this was got a
long<00:00:42.960> time<00:00:43.320> ago<00:00:43.590> even<00:00:44.520> before<00:00:46.010> before<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.250> was

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
long time ago even before before I was

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.970 
long time ago even before before I was
moving<00:00:47.730> Guffin<00:00:48.239> everything<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.620> was

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
moving Guffin everything so it was

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.549 
moving Guffin everything so it was
obviously<00:00:50.129> played<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> escalation<00:00:51.930> TDM

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
obviously played on the escalation TDM

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.229 
obviously played on the escalation TDM
and<00:00:53.660> pretty<00:00:54.660> much<00:00:54.750> i'm<00:00:55.050> using<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> spas-12

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
and pretty much i'm using the spas-12

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.610 
and pretty much i'm using the spas-12
silenced<00:00:57.239> as<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.629> usually<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.350> because

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
silenced as you usually do because

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.500 
silenced as you usually do because
there's<00:00:58.920> only<00:00:59.129> touch<00:00:59.640> went<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
there's only touch went for it is the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.170 
there's only touch went for it is the
silencer<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.289> that's<00:01:02.280> what<00:01:02.430> I'm<00:01:02.550> perceived<00:01:03.000> to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
silencer so that's what I'm perceived to

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.960 
silencer so that's what I'm perceived to
be<00:01:03.300> using<00:01:03.930> but<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.830> next<00:01:05.129> first<00:01:05.339> 12<00:01:05.670> gameplay

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
be using but the next first 12 gameplay

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.969 
be using but the next first 12 gameplay

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
that being said right I was thinking

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.400 
that being said right I was thinking
about<00:04:28.280> going<00:04:29.000> through<00:04:29.360> every<00:04:29.870> single<00:04:30.050> one<00:04:30.380> of

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
about going through every single one of

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.140 
about going through every single one of
the<00:04:30.650> shotguns<00:04:31.130> right<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.669> trying<00:04:31.910> to<00:04:32.060> get

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
the shotguns right and trying to get

the shotguns right and trying to get
identical<00:04:33.050> games<00:04:33.290> with<00:04:33.650> them<00:04:33.770> and<00:04:34.780> generally

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
identical games with them and generally

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.310 
identical games with them and generally
just<00:04:36.020> see<00:04:36.380> like<00:04:37.030> the<00:04:38.030> differences<00:04:38.780> in<00:04:38.810> like

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
just see like the differences in like

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.950 
just see like the differences in like
guns<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:40.070> stuff<00:04:40.160> because<00:04:40.400> obviously<00:04:40.960> when

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
guns and stuff because obviously when

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.260 
guns and stuff because obviously when
you're<00:04:42.200> using<00:04:42.530> the<00:04:42.889> guns<00:04:43.160> like<00:04:43.550> on<00:04:43.880> a<00:04:43.940> regular

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
you're using the guns like on a regular

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.150 
you're using the guns like on a regular
basis<00:04:44.930> and<00:04:44.960> you<00:04:45.169> try<00:04:45.380> and<00:04:45.410> compare<00:04:45.710> them

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
basis and you try and compare them

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.250 
basis and you try and compare them
against<00:04:46.550> each<00:04:46.669> other<00:04:46.940> in<00:04:47.120> similar<00:04:47.600> types<00:04:47.810> of

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
against each other in similar types of

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.830 
against each other in similar types of
games<00:04:49.250> and<00:04:49.669> stuff<00:04:49.910> like<00:04:50.120> that<00:04:50.180> you<00:04:50.480> can<00:04:50.630> see

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
games and stuff like that you can see

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.230 
games and stuff like that you can see
where<00:04:51.139> the<00:04:51.830> guns<00:04:52.100> farewell<00:04:52.820> and<00:04:52.970> where<00:04:53.120> they

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
where the guns farewell and where they

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.060 
where the guns farewell and where they
don't<00:04:53.510> fare<00:04:53.810> well<00:04:53.840> in<00:04:54.080> ever<00:04:54.350> for<00:04:54.590> murder<00:04:54.800> and

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
don't fare well in ever for murder and

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.100 
don't fare well in ever for murder and
seeing<00:04:55.940> so<00:04:56.210> there<00:04:56.419> is<00:04:56.570> only<00:04:56.840> far<00:04:57.500> shotguns<00:04:58.400> and
