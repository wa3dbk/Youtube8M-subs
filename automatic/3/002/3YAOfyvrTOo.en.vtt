00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello her love i am suite amira and 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.919
 today with a valentines day special for 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.660
 Christmas day is coming soon 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.190
 and if you have some women with you now 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.900
 you your dearest or your dearest 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.639
 I can surprise and have here 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.760
 now the perfect idea for you and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.130
 Although red velvet cupcakes in the color 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.109
 the dear natural red quite simply 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.660
 made super fast and easy 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.970
 heavenly first we have to 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.949
 again the dry ingredients with each other 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.949
 I have the flour here for the sugar 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:43.469
 the cocoa and then we drive it all 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.059
 already at work with each other and ask 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.300
 Now go to the page and take care of it 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.010
 the other ingredients 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.020
 First we have the mother 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.120
 I want to beat me creamy now 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.050
 You can do that for about a minute 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.050
 let fishing time 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.110
 we can do it slowly now 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.770
 add the eggs and that you have the 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.770
 exactly 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:21.149
 and next come one 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:22.799
 tablespoon of butter milk and 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.899
 of course, the color should I use here go 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.579
 color I think that works 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.439
 especially good if you have dark dough 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.360
 must dye what yes with us the case 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.310
 is the best chocolate to have in there 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.899
 You can also do it with liquid paint 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.390
 try but you will do a lot 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.560
 I need more and I am not 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.439
 sure if the color is so beautiful 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.429
 it becomes intense about one of them 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.429
 teaspoon 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.030
 Now we take our mix again 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.649
 at hand and now comes in slowly 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.069
 small floating to our liquid 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.069
 mass to it 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.400
 if you do that then you realize that 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.869
 color is still too dark or 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.460
 not strong enough from the bread here 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.780
 you can also like in hindsight 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.780
 what he had to do 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.890
 Last but not least I have here now 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.020
 still natron and apple cider vinegar and the 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.820
 I'm still giving away senat from apple vinegar 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.860
 and if I'm all that beautiful 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.270
 it is resolved that the game is so 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:36.460
 a bit then we admit that 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:36.460
 our dough still goes there 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.600
 I already have a finished one here 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.310
 cupcake mold with frank fitsch and now 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.740
 the day comes in about three 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.560
 quarter full before then the whole for 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:59.260
 circulated at 180 degrees for about 20 minutes 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:03:01.390
 In the oven , the cupcakes and done 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.520
 cooled and now we need 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.970
 of course, the classic vanilla 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.640
 frosting what belongs and love for it 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.450
 We first fresh this and butter 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.650
 beat the criticism together and afterwards 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.140
 let me slowly the beloved 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.460
 icing sugar azzurri are resp 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.460
 in between comes the stick away 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.760
 I've almost ever 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.659
 bottled in a sachet 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.989
 actually wanted with a small one 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:41.450
 school on the front and I take it here 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:49.370
 a round mouth at this time and made 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:50.989
 now a nice white topping on the 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.079
 Now you can leave it all over again 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.890
 or you still do that little 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.890
 Actions 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.480
 and that they are now the finished red 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.970
 World cup cakes with a wonderful 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.760
 fluffy juicy chocolate vanilla dough 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.709
 and a wonderful frosting on top 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.840
 in exactly the right amount rather than 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.709
 topping and how could now like her 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.630
 are giving away 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.780
 I hope you enjoyed it and
