00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.650
 today let's see how to transfer to contacts 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:20.990
 through an application developed by 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:23.090
 nokia from your android to windows phone 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.830
 or to one eye in this case lumia 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:32.300
 620 then we turn on the two terminals 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:37.280
 devices unlock on we notice 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.110
 then nokia is met with 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.920
 an application to render the whole 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.290
 very very very simple that 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:51.410
 the application this qua transfer ever 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:54.950
 data ok that works via bluetooth 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:59.230
 so we activate long and everything can and 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.230
 everything we stick to 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.090
 let's go stall they are looking for it 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.009
 windows phone here it is 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:26.370
 then contrary to the pd corresponds to 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:29.690
 ending ok to pair an effect the two 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.690
 devices are connected now 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.560
 copy then background you will pass yours 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.480
 contacted with have already calls to 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:49.080
 allow access 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:51.270
 ok ok now the operation will take about 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:58.320
 a minute worked the whole rubric for 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:00.200
 all my contacts to via we put the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.200
 bank on don't ask for more 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.200
 ok 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.539
 and I'm copying the whole column 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.850
 i nokia with this application 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.650
 certainly already greatly simplified 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.650
 switch from android to windows phone 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.330
 nokia thanks to this application I would say 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.070
 which made life so much easier 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.840
 who wanted to transfer all his people 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:46.880
 contacts from his android device has 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:51.310
 a nokia with windows 8 comparison 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.310
 it takes little time there is a minute 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:10.160
 we have a nexus 4 lg nexus 4 against a 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:12.050
 nokia lumia 620 complimented i 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.380
 contents have been copied from yours 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.750
 old phone on the new one 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.600
 perfect now this point on the contacts 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.610
 now she shows privacy anyway 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.160
 we can guarantee we have 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.450
 all the contacts we had on ourselves 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.370
 our android device e 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.760
 perfectly synchronized on ours 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.080
