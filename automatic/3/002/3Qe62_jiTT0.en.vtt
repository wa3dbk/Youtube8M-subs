clashing all at the same time and the
piece<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.229> set<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.729> like<00:01:11.729> an<00:01:11.880> encore<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:12.390> kind

piece is set up like an encore it's kind

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.620 
piece is set up like an encore it's kind
of<00:01:12.659> short<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.950> has<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> big<00:01:14.520> climax<00:01:15.000> and

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
of short and it has a big climax and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.289 
of short and it has a big climax and
stuff<00:01:15.810> like<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.070> actual<00:01:17.700> material

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
stuff like that but the actual material

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.289 
stuff like that but the actual material
is<00:01:18.509> kind<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.520> treated<00:01:20.520> like<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.640> variations

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
is kind of treated like a variations

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.300 
is kind of treated like a variations
that<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.140> there's<00:01:22.439> like<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.680> bird<00:01:22.950> theme

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
that so there's like a bird theme

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.820 
that so there's like a bird theme
birdsong<00:01:24.030> theme<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.509> beginning<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.320> that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
birdsong theme in the beginning and that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.219 
birdsong theme in the beginning and that
gets<00:01:26.100> created<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.880> all<00:01:27.540> these<00:01:27.720> different<00:01:28.080> kind

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
gets created to all these different kind

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.690 
gets created to all these different kind
of<00:01:28.290> modifications<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.130> some<00:01:29.340> piece<00:01:29.490> goes

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
of modifications that some piece goes

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.109 
of modifications that some piece goes
along<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.920> still<00:01:32.070> relatively<00:01:32.610> short

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
along and it's still relatively short

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.160 
along and it's still relatively short
though<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.420> there's<00:01:33.600> maybe<00:01:33.689> like<00:01:33.990> four

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
though so there's maybe like four

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.420 
though so there's maybe like four
variations<00:01:34.439> there's<00:01:34.920> something<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.189> goes

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
variations there's something that goes

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.600 
variations there's something that goes
through<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.380> really<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.530> how<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.890> how<00:01:38.460> it

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
through I really like how it how it

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.340 
through I really like how it how it
develops<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.750> don't<00:01:39.840> think<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.170> sounds

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
develops and I don't think it sounds

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.819 
develops and I don't think it sounds
necessarily<00:01:41.130> like<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.700> bird<00:01:42.450> piece<00:01:42.810> but<00:01:43.140> when<00:01:43.680> I

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
necessarily like a bird piece but when I

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.100 
necessarily like a bird piece but when I
because<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.220> didn't<00:01:44.490> know<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.000> was<00:01:45.149> about

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
because I didn't know that it was about

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.569 
because I didn't know that it was about
birds<00:01:46.470> when<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.829> got<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.220> cuz<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.399> didn't<00:01:47.549> know

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
birds when I got it cuz I didn't know

know<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.540> makes<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.750> lot<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.899> sense<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.649> then

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
know that makes a lot of sense and then

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.420 
know that makes a lot of sense and then
hearing<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.170> talk<00:02:01.619> about<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.009> just<00:02:02.159> now<00:02:02.369> you

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
hearing you talk about it just now you

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.179 
hearing you talk about it just now you
know<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.759> just<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.149> realized<00:02:03.920> that<00:02:04.920> there

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
know you just I realized that there

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.830 
know you just I realized that there
actually<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> lot<00:02:05.880> more<00:02:06.030> structure<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.540> it

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
actually is a lot more structure to it

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.740 
actually is a lot more structure to it
than<00:02:07.290> just<00:02:07.399> birds<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.879> bird<00:02:09.060> thing<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.479> is

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
than just birds but the bird thing is is

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.390 
than just birds but the bird thing is is
obviously<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.470> know<00:02:10.560> noticeable<00:02:11.039> throughout

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
obviously you know noticeable throughout

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.309 
obviously you know noticeable throughout
but<00:02:12.209> do<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.450> think<00:02:12.750> that

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
but do you think that

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.899 
but do you think that
bird<00:02:13.650> stuff<00:02:14.189> translates<00:02:14.760> well<00:02:15.000> into<00:02:15.030> violin

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
bird stuff translates well into violin

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.330 
bird stuff translates well into violin
well<00:02:17.909> if<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.269> was<00:02:18.569> able<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.810> do<00:02:19.019> a<00:02:19.049> lot<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.340> kind

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
well if I was able to do a lot of kind

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.500 
well if I was able to do a lot of kind
of<00:02:20.430> really<00:02:21.000> fast

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
of really fast

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.360 
of really fast
tremolo<00:02:21.719> kind<00:02:22.439> of<00:02:22.530> sounds<00:02:22.769> that<00:02:22.829> birds<00:02:23.099> make

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
tremolo kind of sounds that birds make

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.660 
tremolo kind of sounds that birds make
and<00:02:23.730> they<00:02:24.120> can<00:02:24.269> do<00:02:24.409> depending<00:02:25.409> on<00:02:25.500> how<00:02:25.680> its<00:02:25.890> how

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
and they can do depending on how its how

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.069 
and they can do depending on how its how
the<00:02:26.730> gestures<00:02:27.239> written<00:02:27.540> they<00:02:27.659> can<00:02:27.810> do<00:02:27.930> these

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
the gestures written they can do these

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.649 
the gestures written they can do these
quickly<00:02:28.409> fast<00:02:28.680> articulations<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:30.450> can<00:02:30.569> be

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
quickly fast articulations and it can be

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.240 
quickly fast articulations and it can be
kind<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:30.900> high<00:02:31.170> squeaky<00:02:31.560> sounds<00:02:32.069> with

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
kind of high squeaky sounds with

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.580 
kind of high squeaky sounds with
harmonics<00:02:32.849> and<00:02:33.090> stuff<00:02:33.989> like<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.319> so<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.500> think

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
harmonics and stuff like that so I think

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.699 
harmonics and stuff like that so I think
it's<00:02:34.890> it's<00:02:35.370> pretty<00:02:35.519> well<00:02:35.730> death<00:02:36.030> or<00:02:36.709> making

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
it's it's pretty well death or making

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.929 
it's it's pretty well death or making
burn-like<00:02:38.420> sounds<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.510> think<00:02:40.010> Gatto<00:02:41.010> has<00:02:41.909> a

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
burn-like sounds I think Gatto has a

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.080 
burn-like sounds I think Gatto has a
little<00:02:42.269> hard<00:02:42.420> time<00:02:43.519> and<00:02:44.519> there<00:02:45.000> are<00:02:45.030> some

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
little hard time and there are some

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.979 
little hard time and there are some
challenges<00:02:45.689> with<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:45.900> but<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:47.389> think<00:02:48.389> violin

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
challenges with that but I think violin

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.569 
challenges with that but I think violin
has<00:02:49.109> the<00:02:49.230> capability<00:02:49.829> that<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.129> could<00:02:50.280> do<00:02:50.400> all

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
has the capability that it could do all

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.490 
has the capability that it could do all
these<00:02:50.730> weird<00:02:51.269> little<00:02:51.419> articulations<00:02:52.109> these

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
these weird little articulations these

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.319 
these weird little articulations these
really<00:02:52.739> quick<00:02:52.980> gesture<00:02:53.730> articulations

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
really quick gesture articulations

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.080 
really quick gesture articulations
pretty<00:02:54.959> well<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:56.549> like<00:02:56.700> what<00:02:56.849> you<00:02:56.939> said

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
pretty well and it's like what you said

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.520 
pretty well and it's like what you said
it<00:02:57.329> doesn't<00:02:57.480> necessarily<00:02:58.169> have<00:02:58.319> to<00:02:58.349> be

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
it doesn't necessarily have to be

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.379 
it doesn't necessarily have to be
thought<00:02:59.069> up<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.430> sounding<00:02:59.790> like<00:02:59.909> words<00:03:00.180> I

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
thought up and sounding like words I

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.539 
thought up and sounding like words I
mean<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.599> didn't<00:03:00.840> take<00:03:00.959> actual<00:03:01.379> birdsong<00:03:01.950> it

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
mean I didn't take actual birdsong it

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.809 
mean I didn't take actual birdsong it
was<00:03:02.639> more<00:03:02.849> like<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.269> idea<00:03:03.629> of<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:05.280> gestures

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
was more like the idea of the gestures

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.479 
was more like the idea of the gestures
that<00:03:06.180> came<00:03:07.079> into<00:03:07.590> my<00:03:07.709> mind<00:03:08.010> when<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.280> thought

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
that came into my mind when I thought

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.309 
that came into my mind when I thought
about<00:03:08.549> birds<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:10.579> Beck<00:03:11.579> and<00:03:11.879> it<00:03:12.060> just<00:03:13.019> gave<00:03:13.139> me

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
about birds and Beck and it just gave me

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.319 
about birds and Beck and it just gave me
ideas<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.980> come<00:03:14.129> up<00:03:14.250> with<00:03:14.370> my<00:03:14.549> own<00:03:14.609> music<00:03:15.209> I

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
ideas to come up with my own music I

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.449 
ideas to come up with my own music I
guess<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:16.739> how<00:03:17.340> would<00:03:17.519> you<00:03:17.729> say<00:03:19.129> well<00:03:20.129> was<00:03:20.310> it

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
guess and how would you say well was it

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.369 
guess and how would you say well was it
was<00:03:20.729> it<00:03:20.849> an<00:03:20.940> easy<00:03:21.209> piece<00:03:21.359> to<00:03:21.419> write<00:03:21.810> was<00:03:22.139> it

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
was it an easy piece to write was it

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.399 
was it an easy piece to write was it
challenging<00:03:23.389> how<00:03:24.389> are<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.659> how<00:03:25.049> did<00:03:25.109> you<00:03:25.199> feel

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
challenging how are you how did you feel

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.740 
challenging how are you how did you feel
about<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:26.040> like<00:03:26.639> keeping<00:03:27.060> it<00:03:27.180> in<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.389> encore

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
about the like keeping it in the encore

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.360 
about the like keeping it in the encore
time<00:03:27.959> frame<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:30.019> was<00:03:31.019> okay<00:03:31.349> I'm<00:03:32.069> used<00:03:32.250> to

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
time frame that was okay I'm used to

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.550 
time frame that was okay I'm used to
writing<00:03:32.579> I've<00:03:33.060> written<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.359> lot<00:03:33.479> of<00:03:33.540> each<00:03:34.169> that

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
writing I've written a lot of each that

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.750 
writing I've written a lot of each that
are<00:03:34.709> in<00:03:34.799> movements<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.340> they<00:03:35.400> have<00:03:35.519> sharp

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
are in movements and they have sharp

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.490 
are in movements and they have sharp
movements<00:03:36.239> like<00:03:36.389> two<00:03:36.540> three<00:03:36.989> minutes<00:03:37.199> what's

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
movements like two three minutes what's

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.360 
movements like two three minutes what's
up<00:03:37.680> yeah<00:03:38.780> it<00:03:39.780> also<00:03:40.319> was<00:03:40.769> good<00:03:40.949> because<00:03:41.129> it

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
up yeah it also was good because it

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.280 
up yeah it also was good because it
gives<00:03:41.400> me<00:03:41.639> a<00:03:41.790> trajectory<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.540> shoot<00:03:42.750> for<00:03:42.989> and

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
gives me a trajectory to shoot for and

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.530 
gives me a trajectory to shoot for and
for<00:03:44.129> a<00:03:44.159> shorter<00:03:44.430> piece<00:03:44.669> that<00:03:45.030> it's<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.359> little

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
for a shorter piece that it's a little

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.449 
for a shorter piece that it's a little
bit<00:03:45.659> easier<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:46.049> reach<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.650> trajectory<00:03:46.919> if

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
bit easier to reach that trajectory if

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.860 
bit easier to reach that trajectory if
I'm<00:03:47.609> writing<00:03:48.000> like<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.150> 20<00:03:48.479> minute<00:03:48.690> piece

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
I'm writing like a 20 minute piece

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.020 
I'm writing like a 20 minute piece
sometimes<00:03:49.079> it's<00:03:49.889> easy<00:03:50.099> to<00:03:50.190> get<00:03:50.400> lost<00:03:50.639> you<00:03:50.940> know

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
sometimes it's easy to get lost you know

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.420 
sometimes it's easy to get lost you know
ten<00:03:51.209> minutes<00:03:51.239> in<00:03:51.690> not<00:03:51.959> really<00:03:52.260> know<00:03:52.440> how<00:03:53.400> to

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
ten minutes in not really know how to

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.399 
ten minutes in not really know how to
keep<00:03:53.669> it<00:03:53.819> going<00:03:54.090> or<00:03:54.209> something<00:03:54.359> but<00:03:55.139> with<00:03:55.379> a

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
keep it going or something but with a

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.140 
keep it going or something but with a
short<00:03:55.650> piece<00:03:55.859> that's<00:03:56.099> just<00:03:56.159> relatively<00:03:56.760> easy

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
short piece that's just relatively easy

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.899 
short piece that's just relatively easy
to<00:03:57.329> map<00:03:57.510> out<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.959> few<00:03:58.139> sections<00:03:58.379> and<00:03:58.859> break<00:03:59.760> it

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
to map out a few sections and break it

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:01.520 
to map out a few sections and break it
in<00:04:00.000> usually<00:04:00.629> bring<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:00.900> down<00:04:01.019> into<00:04:01.260> smaller

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
in usually bring it down into smaller

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.619 
in usually bring it down into smaller
bits<00:04:01.799> and<00:04:02.040> put<00:04:02.159> them<00:04:02.250> together<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:03.389> it<00:04:03.569> was

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
bits and put them together so it was

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.390 
bits and put them together so it was
easy<00:04:03.810> with<00:04:04.019> this<00:04:04.169> kind<00:04:04.409> of<00:04:04.439> variations<00:04:05.099> idea

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
easy with this kind of variations idea

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.099 
easy with this kind of variations idea
of<00:04:05.519> where<00:04:05.669> I<00:04:05.699> was<00:04:05.939> thinking<00:04:06.239> here's<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.900> theme

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
of where I was thinking here's the theme

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.899 
of where I was thinking here's the theme
and<00:04:07.349> then<00:04:07.470> hits<00:04:07.680> another<00:04:07.829> variation<00:04:08.220> so<00:04:08.669> forth

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
and then hits another variation so forth

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.050 
and then hits another variation so forth
even<00:04:09.150> if<00:04:09.959> it's<00:04:10.139> not<00:04:10.319> exactly<00:04:11.129> with<00:04:11.370> my<00:04:11.609> kids

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
even if it's not exactly with my kids

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.999 
even if it's not exactly with my kids
variation<00:04:12.569> one<00:04:12.750> two<00:04:13.019> three<00:04:13.379> but<00:04:13.620> that's<00:04:13.829> how<00:04:13.979> I

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:14.009 
variation one two three but that's how I

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:15.460 
variation one two three but that's how I
conceived<00:04:14.519> of<00:04:14.609> it<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:14.970> help<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.299> either

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
conceived of it and help you either

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.370 
conceived of it and help you either
instruct<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.560> PISA<00:04:16.829> that<00:04:17.190> suppose<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.789> more

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
instruct the PISA that suppose a more

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.709 
instruct the PISA that suppose a more
efficient<00:04:19.380> way<00:04:19.820> mm-hmm<00:04:20.909> is<00:04:21.359> there<00:04:21.539> anything

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:21.719 
efficient way mm-hmm is there anything

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:23.260 
efficient way mm-hmm is there anything
else<00:04:21.930> you'd<00:04:22.139> like<00:04:22.200> people<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.650> know<00:04:22.770> about<00:04:22.800> it

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
else you'd like people to know about it

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.920 
else you'd like people to know about it
just<00:04:24.270> about<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.690> origins<00:04:25.139> and<00:04:25.529> spur

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
just about the origins and spur

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.779 
just about the origins and spur
anything<00:04:26.350> like<00:04:26.470> that<00:04:27.389> um<00:04:29.490> we're<00:04:30.490> just<00:04:30.520> kind<00:04:30.759> of

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
anything like that um we're just kind of

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.969 
anything like that um we're just kind of
funny<00:04:31.000> is<00:04:31.150> that<00:04:31.180> it<00:04:31.870> has<00:04:32.050> Angry<00:04:32.470> Birds<00:04:32.680> in<00:04:32.889> the

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
funny is that it has Angry Birds in the

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.520 
funny is that it has Angry Birds in the
title<00:04:33.400> and<00:04:33.669> actually<00:04:34.479> after<00:04:34.870> I<00:04:34.900> wrote<00:04:35.350> the

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
title and actually after I wrote the

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.810 
title and actually after I wrote the
piece<00:04:35.740> because<00:04:36.009> I<00:04:36.070> knew<00:04:36.220> that<00:04:36.370> how<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.580> game

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
piece because I knew that how the game

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.210 
piece because I knew that how the game
but<00:04:37.090> I<00:04:37.330> never<00:04:37.840> played<00:04:38.139> it<00:04:38.259> so<00:04:38.380> after<00:04:38.530> I<00:04:39.009> wrote

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
but I never played it so after I wrote

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.920 
but I never played it so after I wrote
the<00:04:39.310> piece<00:04:39.460> I<00:04:39.639> got<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:39.940> game<00:04:40.090> downloaded<00:04:40.630> and

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
the piece I got the game downloaded and

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.810 
the piece I got the game downloaded and
I<00:04:41.020> got<00:04:41.380> fully<00:04:41.979> addicted<00:04:42.160> that<00:04:42.340> kept<00:04:42.639> playing

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
I got fully addicted that kept playing

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.090 
I got fully addicted that kept playing
every<00:04:43.210> single<00:04:43.240> level<00:04:43.840> and<00:04:44.380> then<00:04:44.500> after<00:04:44.770> I<00:04:44.800> feed

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
every single level and then after I feed

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.680 
every single level and then after I feed
every<00:04:45.430> leveled<00:04:45.789> and<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.030> wanted<00:04:46.360> to<00:04:46.419> go<00:04:46.539> back

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
every leveled and I wanted to go back

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.480 
every leveled and I wanted to go back
and<00:04:46.870> try<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.020> get<00:04:47.380> three<00:04:47.620> stars<00:04:47.949> on<00:04:48.220> every

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
and try to get three stars on every

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.659 
and try to get three stars on every
single<00:04:48.639> level<00:04:48.880> -<00:04:49.360> Evan<00:04:49.690> done<00:04:50.169> that<00:04:50.320> but<00:04:50.800> it's

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
single level - Evan done that but it's

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.580 
single level - Evan done that but it's
pretty<00:04:51.789> addictive<00:04:52.240> I<00:04:52.539> think<00:04:53.169> you<00:04:53.259> kind<00:04:53.500> of

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
pretty addictive I think you kind of

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.050 
pretty addictive I think you kind of
rule<00:04:53.800> all<00:04:54.100> the<00:04:54.130> other<00:04:54.400> people<00:04:54.729> who<00:04:54.910> have

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
rule all the other people who have

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.029 
rule all the other people who have
gotten<00:04:55.900> addicted<00:04:56.139> to<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.470> game<00:04:56.680> because<00:04:57.009> you

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
gotten addicted to the game because you

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.700 
gotten addicted to the game because you
wrote<00:04:57.280> a<00:04:57.310> piece<00:04:57.639> but<00:04:58.060> reference<00:04:59.050> is<00:04:59.289> it<00:04:59.470> I
