00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
you know that's pretty much that game

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.490 
you know that's pretty much that game
it's<00:02:05.679> pretty<00:02:05.890> good<00:02:06.099> for<00:02:06.640> a<00:02:06.670> free<00:02:06.849> game<00:02:07.319> ok<00:02:08.319> the

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
it's pretty good for a free game ok the

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.759 
it's pretty good for a free game ok the
next<00:02:08.530> game<00:02:08.950> is<00:02:09.160> hole<00:02:09.399> in<00:02:09.700> wool<00:02:10.019> HD<00:02:11.019> and<00:02:11.560> this

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
next game is hole in wool HD and this

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.940 
next game is hole in wool HD and this
game<00:02:12.069> is<00:02:12.310> really<00:02:13.260> hard<00:02:14.260> if<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.620> go<00:02:14.799> to<00:02:14.859> the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
game is really hard if you go to the

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.430 
game is really hard if you go to the
advanced<00:02:15.370> one<00:02:15.489> but<00:02:15.879> basic<00:02:16.359> is<00:02:16.480> like<00:02:17.170> average

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
advanced one but basic is like average

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.949 
advanced one but basic is like average
okay<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:18.340> anyways<00:02:18.760> basically<00:02:19.540> there's<00:02:19.870> a

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
okay so anyways basically there's a

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.449 
okay so anyways basically there's a
shape<00:02:20.170> in<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.349> wool<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.829> you've<00:02:20.950> got<00:02:21.069> to<00:02:21.220> turn

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
shape in the wool and you've got to turn

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.449 
shape in the wool and you've got to turn
these<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.720> keep<00:02:23.049> turning<00:02:23.500> until<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:24.040> can

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
these and keep turning until you can

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:25.979 
these and keep turning until you can
make<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.849> shape<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:25.329> it<00:02:25.359> fit<00:02:25.660> through<00:02:25.900> the

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
make the shape so it fit through the

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.879 
make the shape so it fit through the
wall<00:02:26.230> with<00:02:26.440> that<00:02:26.680> crashing<00:02:27.190> like<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.889> and

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:29.889 
wall with that crashing like that and

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.069 
wall with that crashing like that and
whatever<00:02:30.220> tubes<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.359> get<00:02:31.599> through<00:02:31.870> that's

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
whatever tubes you get through that's

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.500 
whatever tubes you get through that's
like<00:02:32.319> I<00:02:32.440> think<00:02:32.980> it's<00:02:33.069> like<00:02:33.220> 100<00:02:33.669> points<00:02:34.450> per

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
like I think it's like 100 points per

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.140 
like I think it's like 100 points per
cube<00:02:34.959> or<00:02:35.109> something<00:02:35.440> or<00:02:35.799> no<00:02:36.400> it's<00:02:36.579> 10<00:02:36.790> points

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
cube or something or no it's 10 points

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.949 
cube or something or no it's 10 points
per<00:02:37.299> cube<00:02:37.569> so<00:02:38.230> if<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:39.000> like<00:02:40.000> stuff<00:02:40.450> up<00:02:40.720> and

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
per cube so if you like stuff up and

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.170 
per cube so if you like stuff up and
some<00:02:41.769> cubes<00:02:42.130> get<00:02:42.400> knocked<00:02:42.609> off<00:02:42.819> then<00:02:43.090> you

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
some cubes get knocked off then you

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.960 
some cubes get knocked off then you
don't<00:02:43.389> get<00:02:43.720> points<00:02:43.930> for<00:02:44.079> those<00:02:44.290> cubes<00:02:44.970> so

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
don't get points for those cubes so

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.520 
don't get points for those cubes so
that's<00:02:46.090> pretty<00:02:46.329> much<00:02:46.389> that<00:02:46.870> game<00:02:47.139> the

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530
