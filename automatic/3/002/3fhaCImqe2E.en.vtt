00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.420
 amir from android grows with the new one 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.010
 nexus 5 and what do we have here an old one 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.060
 Nexus 4 and the two devices want 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.490
 just compare how 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.689
 differ externally and then 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.439
 Just come here in this one 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.410
 view 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.390
 and then we'll see each other 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.690
 So, of course, that you are white 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.660
 nexus five that here the nexus 4 with the 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.000
 glass back and this one 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.590
 interesting moldy optics underneath 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.770
 Of course this is the glass 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.360
 main difference in the haptic 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.800
 Just this is such a soft touch 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.120
 surface feels very good 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.100
 Feels very valuable not so 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.960
 like plastic but almost like metal and 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.610
 this is just glass that you know 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.890
 then we also see the 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.940
 loudspeaker at nexus 4 is here 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.649
 on the back of the back 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.530
 speakers these two speakers 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.930
 opening at nexus 5 are here 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.640
 In the lowlands they both have an 8 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.920
 megapixel camera, however, has the from 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.050
 nexus 5 a image stabilizer one 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.520
 I integrated the results 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.660
 shot a couple of photos hew me 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.460
 not too crazy of that now 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.530
 stool is basically a good one 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.350
 camera headphone jack it at both 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.240
 get yourself up there at the top 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.890
 same place and then we look 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.830
 they still do it on the front 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.810
 so maybe it'll look like 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.000
 the display is I have to look 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.950
 how much was locked up was like that 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.330
 and there is nothing to unlock here 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.520
 I 'm both on full time 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.170
 brightness then we'll just see if 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.270
 because there are differences so the display 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.830
 I like the nexus five so much 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.750
 well that is already full of brightness 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.509
 you look at things in brightness take the 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.280
 not so much but that's it 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.750
 sufficiently bright with both devices and 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.520
 the display has like said 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.409
 me very nice with the full hd with the 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.689
 full hd resolution also the colors that 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.979
 Everything is very nice to look at 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.329
 There are technical differences 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.520
 of course here in the next 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:01.850
 Five works as a snapdragon 800 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.920
 with 2.27 gigahertz while in the nexus for 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.899
 four only one snapdragon s4 pro with 1 5 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.820
 gigahertz the display works like 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.709
 said the nexus 4g hd screen at 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.890
 nexus 5 again 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.690
 at the nexus 5 1 full hd display with 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.440
 of course a much higher one 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.970
 pixel density on the nexus 5 we have there 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.599
 445 or something like that are on the nexus 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.330
 4 6 320 that's not overly 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:33.180
 noticeably difference the discussion 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.560
 what's the eye between 720 and 1080p 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.870
 such a small screen we had 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.049
 but in any case quite like 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.879
 good here on the nexus 565 comes in 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.799
 memory variants of 16 and 32 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.250
 gigabyte the nexus 4 was only available then 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.200
 in 8 or 16 gb you have 2 gigabytes of ram 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.730
 both and the battery their next five 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.860
 is a bit bigger that we have 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.099
 in 2300 milliamp battery during 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.349
 in the nexus 40 2100 milliamp battery 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.420
 drinne of course is also the 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.190
 display larger and higher resolved so 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.780
 we should not be that many 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.849
 take first experiences as with the 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.459
 nexus 5 with me is battery life is 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.650
 not overly good but first 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.420
 okay and you have to wait and see how 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.250
 this then in everyday life and the next 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.540
 Shaping the dimensions and dimensions 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.640
 the dimensions may still be whole 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.379
 short so the next 5 is even though it is 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.450
 bigger is actually nine grams 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.879
 easier the next four weighs 139 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.620
 gram the next 5 is only 130 grams 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.049
 and you can see that when I see you directly 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.959
 next to each other, keep the nexus 5 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.340
 a little bit longer that's 138 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.349
 millimeter long because that existing 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.359
 134 mm is so long now 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.090
 rounded everything up a bit and in 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:41.099
 the width they are both at 69 and 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.470
 but the nexus is five for that, too 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.739
 a piece is more stupid the was only 8.6 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.109
 mm thin while the nexus 491 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.700
 millimeter thin the lexus 4 is yes 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.470
 not in place anymore 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.090
 So google lets that all 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.380
 Probably after expire now 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.599
 sometimes there are still devices included 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.669
 but some traders get in the 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.130
 Place one tolerates only the nexus 5 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:06.569
 and that for just 349 euros for the 16 gb 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.160
 variant or for 399 euros for the 230 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.810
 gigabyte variant I bought myself 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.419
 have quite useful because the device yes 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.190
 no micro sd card slot has and you 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.959
 so far for every gigabyte of memory 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.120
 can be more grateful 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.579
 yes that was our little comparison of the 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.280
 last year's nexus flagship and the 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:26.160
 this year's brand new smartphones 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.020
 the next nexus 5 vs nexus 4 both 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.569
 By the way, this would not be built by LG 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.009
 So, there google was at least aware 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:34.679
 once again witness this year 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.509
 look who builds the next nexus device 

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:38.369
 that was me from android lex becomes one 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:40.110
 Comparison of the nexus 4 and the nexus 50 

00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:41.399
 licon liked sharon and in android 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.580
 read next until next time 

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:43.580
 bye
