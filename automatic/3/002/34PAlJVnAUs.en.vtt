 and formica mauro recognized that blue cross 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.250

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.380

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.690

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.879
 I am a little anxious and eager 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.830
 there are many teams playing a tournament like this 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.810
 only few are in the club world 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.119
 we do not have to take advantage we do not have to 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.550
 enjoy it and we have to try the 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.880
 town of dsquared to adapt it of my 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.880

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.750
 we have 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.710
 a complicated opponent if you can say 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.229
 when he resigns 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.500
 We will try to do our best and go to 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.540
 step and good this game would be very 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.880
 important to us since after 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.280
