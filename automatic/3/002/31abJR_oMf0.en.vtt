gonna do the figure eight kind of like

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.850 
gonna do the figure eight kind of like
this<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.659> so<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.140> plant<00:01:10.380> has<00:01:10.590> enough

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
room in between the pole and it doesn't

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.600 
room in between the pole and it doesn't
get<00:01:12.299> twisted<00:01:12.540> or<00:01:13.220> damaged<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.370> any<00:01:14.580> way

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
figure eight and we're just going to tie

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.609 
figure eight and we're just going to tie
it<00:01:37.950> off<00:01:38.130> onto<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.729> post<00:01:38.909> like<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:40.560> you

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.560 
can do this about every two feet up with
your<00:01:43.619> raspberry<00:01:44.010> plant<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.640> you'll<00:01:45.360> also

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
your raspberry plant and you'll also

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.510 
your raspberry plant and you'll also
want<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.049> continuously<00:01:46.500> do<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.310> grows

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
want to continuously do it as it grows

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.120 
want to continuously do it as it grows
just<00:01:50.520> like<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.150> then<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.080> can<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.350> go<00:01:52.619> up

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
just like so and then you can just go up

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.340 
just like so and then you can just go up
again<00:01:53.610> bunching<00:01:54.360> them<00:01:54.509> together<00:01:54.689> kind<00:01:55.290> of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
again bunching them together kind of

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.190 
again bunching them together kind of
loosely<00:01:55.650> around<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.880> pole<00:01:57.150> and<00:01:57.630> you'll<00:01:58.049> just

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
loosely around the pole and you'll just

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.170 
loosely around the pole and you'll just
be<00:01:58.290> able<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.470> take<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.799> all<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:58.979> way<00:01:59.130> up<00:01:59.280> but

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
be able to take it all the way up but

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.160 
be able to take it all the way up but
like<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.450> said<00:02:00.509> there's<00:02:00.750> tons<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.049> different

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
like I said there's tons of different

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.649 
like I said there's tons of different
ways<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.470> sustain<00:02:02.369> them<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.119> do<00:02:03.479> your<00:02:03.630> research

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
ways to sustain them so do your research

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.450 
ways to sustain them so do your research
and<00:02:04.079> do<00:02:04.290> your<00:02:04.439> own<00:02:04.590> way<00:02:04.740> which<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.040> best<00:02:05.280> for

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
and do your own way which is best for
