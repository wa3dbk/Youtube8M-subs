00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
basically how it works is it gives you

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.530 
basically how it works is it gives you
the<00:00:21.770> Android<00:00:22.340> lockscreen<00:00:22.910> on<00:00:23.119> your<00:00:23.329> iDevice

lastly<00:01:20.540> iOS<00:01:21.290> which<00:01:22.159> is<00:01:22.310> this<00:01:22.520> last<00:01:22.729> option

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
lastly iOS which is this last option

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.640 
lastly iOS which is this last option
here<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:25.310> that<00:01:26.180> looks<00:01:26.299> pretty<00:01:26.420> clean<00:01:26.870> it<00:01:27.260> does

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
here and that looks pretty clean it does

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.370 
here and that looks pretty clean it does
have<00:01:28.130> that<00:01:28.310> iOS<00:01:28.640> look<00:01:29.120> to<00:01:29.510> it<00:01:29.720> I<00:01:29.840> could<00:01:30.020> say<00:01:30.229> as

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
have that iOS look to it I could say as

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.640
