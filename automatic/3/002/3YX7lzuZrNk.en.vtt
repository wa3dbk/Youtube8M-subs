going to be hard to see until if I mean
until<00:01:38.970> know<00:01:39.150> until<00:01:39.570> we<00:01:39.689> get<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.990> H<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.380> two

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
until know until we get the H I two

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.740 
until know until we get the H I two
images<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.250> takes<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.610> couple<00:01:41.790> days<00:01:41.970> they'll

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
images it takes a couple days they'll

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.289 
images it takes a couple days they'll
show<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.229> close-up<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> approach<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:45.119> it

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
show the close-up of the approach but it

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.450 
show the close-up of the approach but it
looks<00:01:45.509> like<00:01:45.570> almost<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.619> something<00:01:46.979> struck

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
looks like almost like something struck

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.420 
looks like almost like something struck
it<00:01:47.579> from<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> back<00:01:48.320> I'm<00:01:49.320> going<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.770> look

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
it from the back I'm going to and look

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.249 
it from the back I'm going to and look
at<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.820> does<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.390> sound<00:01:51.630> unusual<00:01:51.899> that

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
at that does that sound unusual that

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.230 
at that does that sound unusual that
broke<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.770> filament<00:01:53.430> then<00:01:53.820> look<00:01:54.090> at<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
broke that filament then look at the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.249 
broke that filament then look at the
debris<00:01:55.110> thrown<00:01:55.560> out<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.340> small<00:01:57.259> section

7-foot tsunami and of course a followed
by<00:03:18.540> oh<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:19.229> don't<00:03:19.409> even<00:03:19.500> know<00:03:19.709> how<00:03:19.889> many

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
by oh I don't even know how many

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.780 
by oh I don't even know how many
earthquakes<00:03:20.759> after<00:03:21.569> that<00:03:21.720> followed<00:03:22.590> by<00:03:22.709> a<00:03:22.790> 7.6

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
earthquakes after that followed by a 7.6

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.460 
earthquakes after that followed by a 7.6
earthquake<00:03:24.359> in<00:03:24.540> chile<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.900> next<00:03:25.139> day<00:03:25.370> 6.2<00:03:26.370> 6.5

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
earthquake in chile the next day 6.2 6.5

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.629 
earthquake in chile the next day 6.2 6.5
probably<00:03:28.470> close<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.709> 100<00:03:29.220> earthquakes<00:03:29.729> over<00:03:30.439> 5

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
probably close to 100 earthquakes over 5

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.240 
probably close to 100 earthquakes over 5
so<00:03:32.639> this<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:33.599> this<00:03:33.629> is<00:03:34.019> why<00:03:34.169> when<00:03:34.439> he<00:03:34.949> talks

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
so this so this is why when he talks

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.369 
so this so this is why when he talks
about<00:03:35.370> an<00:03:35.579> event<00:03:35.699> like<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.299> again<00:03:37.049> I'll<00:03:37.079> put

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
about an event like this again I'll put

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:38.809 
about an event like this again I'll put
the<00:03:37.500> link<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.859> this<00:03:37.979> video<00:03:38.340> for<00:03:38.609> you<00:03:38.669> to<00:03:38.790> watch

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
it you need to see how that thing erupts

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:48.649 
it you need to see how that thing erupts
but<00:03:42.180> now<00:03:42.359> he<00:03:42.720> did<00:03:43.019> a<00:03:43.049> video<00:03:43.759> also<00:03:47.659> saturday

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 
but now he did a video also saturday

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.089 
but now he did a video also saturday
about<00:03:49.290> these<00:03:50.280> for<00:03:50.729> incoming<00:03:51.739> CMEs<00:03:52.739> and

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
about these for incoming CMEs and

about these for incoming CMEs and
especially<00:03:54.090> i<00:03:54.569> wanted<00:03:55.169> to<00:03:55.259> find<00:03:55.500> out<00:03:55.680> his<00:03:56.280> view

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:56.699 
especially i wanted to find out his view

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.749 
especially i wanted to find out his view
of<00:03:56.729> the<00:03:57.209> sea<00:03:57.509> me<00:03:57.719> from<00:03:58.139> that<00:03:58.409> big<00:03:58.739> explosion<00:03:59.609> on

00:03:59.749 --> 00:03:59.759 
of the sea me from that big explosion on
