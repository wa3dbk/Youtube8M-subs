hey<00:00:00.269> guys<00:00:00.480> astronomers<00:00:01.380> have<00:00:01.410> estimated<00:00:01.979> that

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
hey guys astronomers have estimated that

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.249 
hey guys astronomers have estimated that
there<00:00:02.370> are<00:00:02.520> at<00:00:02.639> least<00:00:02.669> 100<00:00:03.149> billion<00:00:03.750> galaxies

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
there are at least 100 billion galaxies

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.590 
there are at least 100 billion galaxies
in<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.470> observable<00:00:05.009> universe<00:00:05.190> well<00:00:06.180> they<00:00:06.420> can

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
in the observable universe well they can

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.509 
in the observable universe well they can
make<00:00:06.750> that<00:00:06.899> 100<00:00:07.140> billion<00:00:07.740> in<00:00:07.859> one<00:00:08.010> galaxies

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
make that 100 billion in one galaxies

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.129 
make that 100 billion in one galaxies
now<00:00:08.700> because<00:00:09.059> they<00:00:09.210> miss<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.540> ones<00:00:09.690> i<00:00:09.809> just

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
now because they miss the ones i just

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.440 
now because they miss the ones i just
created<00:00:10.290> on<00:00:10.620> my<00:00:10.710> nails<00:00:11.090> let's<00:00:12.090> get<00:00:12.300> these

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
created on my nails let's get these

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.350 
created on my nails let's get these
galaxies<00:00:12.960> nails<00:00:13.139> started<00:00:14.000> begin<00:00:15.000> by<00:00:15.120> applying

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
galaxies nails started begin by applying

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.670 
galaxies nails started begin by applying
a<00:00:15.570> base<00:00:15.599> coat<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:15.960> all<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.379> your<00:00:16.470> nails

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
nail polish I'm only showing you the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.029 
nail polish I'm only showing you the
first<00:00:24.630> coat<00:00:24.840> because<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.140> totally<00:00:25.590> forgot<00:00:25.859> to

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
first coat because I totally forgot to

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.839 
first coat because I totally forgot to
film<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.340> second<00:00:26.699> one<00:00:26.820> whoops<00:00:28.550> if<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.730> have

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
film the second one whoops if you have

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.310 
film the second one whoops if you have
ever<00:00:30.029> been<00:00:30.240> able<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.599> look<00:00:30.750> up<00:00:30.869> into<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> sky

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
ever been able to look up into the sky

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.530 
ever been able to look up into the sky
when<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.009> completely<00:00:32.489> dark<00:00:32.880> out<00:00:33.059> with<00:00:33.270> no

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
when it is completely dark out with no

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.360 
when it is completely dark out with no
lights<00:00:33.809> nearby<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.559> can<00:00:34.800> see<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.160> there<00:00:35.340> is

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
lights nearby you can see that there is

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.040 
lights nearby you can see that there is
an<00:00:35.670> infinite<00:00:35.910> amount<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.540> stars<00:00:36.840> that

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
an infinite amount of stars that

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.650 
an infinite amount of stars that
completely<00:00:37.500> cover<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.070> sky<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:39.090> easiest<00:00:39.450> way

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
completely cover the sky the easiest way

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.299 
completely cover the sky the easiest way
to<00:00:39.719> recreate<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.590> by<00:00:40.739> applying<00:00:41.070> a

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
to recreate that is by applying a

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.069 
to recreate that is by applying a
glitter<00:00:41.579> polish<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.120> small<00:00:42.420> silver<00:00:42.809> flecks

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
glitter polish with small silver flecks

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.680 
glitter polish with small silver flecks
for<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> actual<00:00:44.340> galaxy<00:00:44.910> design<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.510> was

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
for the actual galaxy design I was

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.150 
for the actual galaxy design I was
inspired<00:00:45.930> by<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.320> picture<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> calendar

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
inspired by the picture in the calendar

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.619 
inspired by the picture in the calendar
that<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.520> showed<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.120> beginning<00:00:48.300> of

that I showed you in the beginning of
this<00:00:48.780> video<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.379> used<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.039> same<00:00:50.219> colors<00:00:50.579> from

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
