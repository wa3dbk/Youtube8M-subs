00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.880 

and<00:00:48.030> at<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.390> point<00:00:48.629> my<00:00:48.809> hair<00:00:49.140> was<00:00:49.410> growing

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
and at this point my hair was growing

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.270 
and at this point my hair was growing
pretty<00:00:50.309> fast<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:51.390> know<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.840> was<00:00:52.620> noticing<00:00:53.190> an

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
pretty fast you know I was noticing an

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.020 
pretty fast you know I was noticing an
increase<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:54.079> length<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.640> I<00:00:56.640> was<00:00:56.820> learning

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
increase in length and I was learning

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.389 
increase in length and I was learning
more<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.510> more<00:00:57.600> about<00:00:57.809> my<00:00:58.079> hair<00:00:58.590> as<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.160> time

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
more and more about my hair as the time

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.799 
more and more about my hair as the time
goes<00:00:59.640> on<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> some<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.940> protective<00:01:03.510> style

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
goes on so some of the protective style

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.039 
goes on so some of the protective style
my<00:01:04.470> hair<00:01:04.619> was<00:01:04.769> really<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.460> coarse<00:01:05.850> then

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.219 

this<00:01:10.049> was<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> braid<00:01:10.920> out<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.960> was<00:01:13.110> my

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
this was a braid out and this was my

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.990 
this was a braid out and this was my
first<00:01:13.409> protective<00:01:13.950> style<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.970> really

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
first protective style and I really

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
first protective style and I really
liked<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.840> myself<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.990> a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
liked that it in myself and this is a

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:33.929 
liked that it in myself and this is a
twist<00:01:19.619> out<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:20.159> believe<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:21.479> been<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.720> while

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.539 

so<00:01:34.539> this<00:01:34.689> is<00:01:34.840> after<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.229> year<00:01:35.649> from<00:01:36.069> when<00:01:36.249> I<00:01:36.310> big

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
so this is after a year from when I big

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.809 
so this is after a year from when I big
chop<00:01:36.850> to<00:01:37.119> a<00:01:37.479> year<00:01:37.960> of<00:01:38.140> being<00:01:38.740> natural<00:01:39.359> and<00:01:40.590> I

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:41.819 
chop to a year of being natural and I

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:43.980 
chop to a year of being natural and I
think<00:01:42.819> this<00:01:42.939> is<00:01:43.090> about<00:01:43.240> a<00:01:43.420> year<00:01:43.689> and<00:01:43.780> a<00:01:43.840> half

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
think this is about a year and a half

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:52.889 
think this is about a year and a half
mark<00:01:50.459> so<00:01:51.459> that<00:01:51.729> was<00:01:51.850> my<00:01:52.000> first<00:01:52.240> length<00:01:52.569> check

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
mark so that was my first length check

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.230 
mark so that was my first length check
that<00:01:53.140> I<00:01:53.170> did<00:01:53.500> and<00:01:53.770> I<00:01:53.920> think<00:01:53.979> I<00:01:54.219> was<00:01:54.399> a<00:01:54.429> year<00:01:55.000> and

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
that I did and I think I was a year and

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.490 
that I did and I think I was a year and
a<00:01:55.420> half<00:01:55.599> there<00:01:55.899> no<00:01:56.679> no<00:01:56.829> two<00:01:57.009> years<00:01:57.219> I'm<00:01:57.369> sorry

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.649 

it's<00:02:02.500> really<00:02:02.709> hard<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.130> keep<00:02:03.280> track<00:02:03.340> so<00:02:06.659> this

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
it's really hard to keep track so this

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.080 
it's really hard to keep track so this
was<00:02:07.840> my<00:02:08.019> first<00:02:08.049> flat<00:02:08.619> twist<00:02:08.979> out<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:09.640> loved

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
was my first flat twist out and I loved

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.250 
was my first flat twist out and I loved
it<00:02:10.829> and<00:02:11.829> this<00:02:12.670> was<00:02:12.849> a<00:02:12.879> braid<00:02:13.269> out<00:02:13.299> which<00:02:14.140> I

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
it and this was a braid out which I

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.259 
it and this was a braid out which I
didn't<00:02:14.470> like<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.620> much<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:18.640> blew<00:02:18.879> my<00:02:19.060> hair

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
didn't like that much and I blew my hair

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.309 
didn't like that much and I blew my hair
out<00:02:19.299> because<00:02:19.629> I<00:02:19.840> was<00:02:19.989> getting<00:02:20.110> my<00:02:20.290> hair

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319

out because I was getting my hair
braided<00:02:20.890> at<00:02:21.040> this<00:02:21.370> point<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:23.610> this<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:24.760> a

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
braided at this point and this is a

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.030 
braided at this point and this is a
twist<00:02:25.180> out<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:25.629> I<00:02:25.660> put<00:02:25.989> into<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.260> pineapple<00:02:26.590> at

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.190 
twist out that I put into a pineapple at
night<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:28.660> this<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.410> just<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.829> flat<00:02:30.069> twist<00:02:31.200> updo

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
night and this is just a flat twist updo

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.430 
night and this is just a flat twist updo
I<00:02:34.650> straighten<00:02:35.650> my<00:02:35.709> hair<00:02:35.799> January<00:02:37.019> 2012<00:02:38.019> and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
I straighten my hair January 2012 and

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.180 
I straighten my hair January 2012 and
this<00:02:38.950> was<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.280> picture<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:41.650> is<00:02:41.769> a<00:02:41.799> holder

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
this was the picture this is a holder

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:50.780 
this was the picture this is a holder
picture<00:02:42.549> actually<00:02:43.030> this<00:02:44.019> one<00:02:44.260> right<00:02:44.410> here

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:58.670 

I<00:02:52.129> think<00:02:53.129> this<00:02:53.280> was<00:02:53.930> 2<00:02:54.930> years<00:02:57.019> yes<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.379> can<00:02:58.530> see

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
I think this was 2 years yes you can see

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.780 
I think this was 2 years yes you can see
the<00:02:58.799> pictures<00:02:59.099> are<00:02:59.250> not<00:02:59.370> really<00:02:59.670> in

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
the pictures are not really in

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.380 
the pictures are not really in
chronological<00:03:00.209> order<00:03:00.769> as<00:03:01.769> much<00:03:02.760> but<00:03:03.120> they<00:03:03.239> are

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.929 

and<00:04:11.110> this<00:04:11.319> is<00:04:11.560> getting<00:04:11.950> closer<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.670> the

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:12.939
