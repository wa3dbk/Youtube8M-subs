00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.750
 on a horizontal straight line placed 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.700
 two fairly distant points one of 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.530
 the other 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.690
 the second will serve for the second 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.230
 video with the two-point perspective 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.480
 leak 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.099
 in this first video we will see 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.770
 perspective at a vanishing point 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.509
 we start by drawing the road to 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.930
 it is necessary to draw two lines as 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.930
 this 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.699
 the final distance between the two lines 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.399
 costs of where you place them your point 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.969
 of view then draw the lines 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.969
 power plant 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.340
 then makes the contrast for the road 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.870
 you can quite imagine that the 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.580
 vanishing point starts outside the 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.930
 leaf 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.880
 in this case the technique is the same 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.880
 we must always start from this same point 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.350
 draw the edge of the road 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.200
 now we are going to draw some 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.090
 trees all along the road 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.829
 for perspective, the more 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.840
 trees are close rains are great 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.659
 and large rains are far apart they 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.310
 become small drawn the east along 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.409
 of the line that reaches the point of 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.950
 escape and for their authors you can 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.539
 refer to the horizontal line 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.280
 when you draw the trees you have to 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.819
 draw them perpendicular to the 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.819
 horizontal line 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.890
 of course it will also depend on the form 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.890
 you want to give to your tree 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.110
 to draw the branches is a dash 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.110
 that you divide and repeat again aim again 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.170
 now you have a good point of view 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.210
 of the road 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.830
 if you want to add an element that 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.870
 is not in the continuity of the road 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.730
 it will be necessary to use the second point of 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.360
 escape this is what we will see in 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.360
 a second video
