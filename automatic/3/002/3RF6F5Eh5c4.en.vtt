00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
first game they're probably going to

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.840

need<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.899> come<00:01:52.439> out<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.770> attack<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.549> little<00:01:53.759> bit

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
need to come out and attack a little bit

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.340 
need to come out and attack a little bit
more<00:01:53.970> than<00:01:54.090> Sweden<00:01:54.390> did<00:01:54.479> tonight<00:01:54.659> perhaps<00:01:55.140> so

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
more than Sweden did tonight perhaps so

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.840 
more than Sweden did tonight perhaps so
that<00:01:55.740> might<00:01:55.890> make<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.070> more<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.369> an<00:01:56.460> open<00:01:56.729> game

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
that might make it more of an open game

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.310 
that might make it more of an open game
which<00:01:57.000> could<00:01:57.149> suitors<00:01:57.509> yeah<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.049> might<00:01:58.170> be<00:01:58.290> a

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
which could suitors yeah it might be a

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.730 
which could suitors yeah it might be a
tougher<00:01:58.619> game<00:01:58.649> than<00:01:59.490> we<00:01:59.520> face<00:01:59.729> today<00:02:00.710> but<00:02:01.710> I

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
tougher game than we face today but I
