 received information about the citizens even 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.410
 through network games 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.940
 against the background of these scandals Russian 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.730
 lawmakers are seriously worried 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.949
 threats that come from modern 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.720
 communications and very soon 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.730
 officials will not be able to communicate each 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.250
 friend using the so-called 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.390

 exposure of the authorities of many states 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.540
 proposed to protect officials from 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.280
 too smart phones to use 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.559
 iPhones have already banned all deputies 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.660
 Bundestag barrack Obama admitted that his 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.760
 own guard service does not allow

 he even has apple gadgets in russia 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.570
 the situation is exactly the opposite 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.059
 dangerous smartphones 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.770
 and is it possible to make them safer with it 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.350
 the question was seriously challenged in the council 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.170
 federation to conduct research first 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.570
 and which smartphones at the moment 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.299
 are safe if there are any 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.869
 this is the first for this we will create 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.270
 working group of experts on asking 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.340
 take part 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.130
 and share with us there open 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.179
 data of representatives of special services on 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.820
 to this direction 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.310
 Generally understand the vulnerability of certain 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.110
 Smartphone is now unreliable 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.909
 read all smartphones that have 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.590
 access to a worldwide network of modern 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.719
 devices sync with remote 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.939
 servers literally all contacts 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.630
 message photos and video mail 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.939
 correspondence 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.069
 besides constantly seeing the location 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.869
 user all data is transmitted through 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:43.459
 internet and can if desired and 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.100
 certain technical skills 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:48.439
 intercepted by this used nb 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.979
 blogger Valentine took advantage of this 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.170
 roosters

 his wife now see for wife on 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.229
 Plus do not need most of the best 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.789
 insecure features manufacturers 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.860
 gadgets justify just 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.750
 security for example there is such an option 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.739
 how to find lost or stolen 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.149
 iphone and 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:07.189
 user having a serial number 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.810
 the machine can get remote access 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.940
 to him and control all that 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.400
 going on with the phone ie program 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.230
 tracking is built in already at the factory you need it 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.180
 just activate it now 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.920
 more or less full - time function which 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.810
 available to everyone if there is 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.870
 desire by mutual consent or 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.310
 on the sly it can be arranged 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.680
 The last word in protecting this information 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.870
 encryption of transmitted data but weak 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.310
 place any cipher eva customer so 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.709
 most of the world's protected 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.840
 protocols created in the us now 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.970
 It turns out many at the behest of cera 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.680
 however, even independent American 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.250
 companies had to certify 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.799
 own codes 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.049
 the structures of the special service for a long time this 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.359
 nobody was bothered intelligence was considered 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.250
 the guarantor of security is now peace 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:51.799
 encryption got upside down a 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.810
 the largest smartphone makers are looking for 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.230
 new shirfin beyond reach 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.720
 cr and 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.120
 great attention to the Russian protocol 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.609
 but while the phrases are safe 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.209
 smartphone remains oxymoron am igor 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.980
 starlings 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.340
