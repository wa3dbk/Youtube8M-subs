00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
really top-notch and it's just 25,000

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.719

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
something you don't get in other

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.780 
something you don't get in other
colleges<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.290> Doha<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.740> city<00:01:07.950> well<00:01:08.400> first

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
colleges in Doha in the city well first

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.380 
colleges in Doha in the city well first
of<00:01:08.909> all<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.060> think<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:10.070> campus<00:01:11.070> life<00:01:11.390> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
of all I think it's campus life the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.310 
of all I think it's campus life the
university<00:01:12.960> offers<00:01:13.909> great<00:01:14.909> campus<00:01:15.299> life<00:01:15.479> even

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
university offers great campus life even

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.840 
university offers great campus life even
looking<00:01:16.740> at<00:01:16.799> other<00:01:16.950> schools<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.490> she<00:01:17.700> chose

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
looking at other schools like she chose

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.499 
looking at other schools like she chose
UC<00:01:18.150> over<00:01:18.570> other<00:01:18.720> ones<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:20.210> primarily<00:01:21.210> because

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
UC over other ones and primarily because

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.999 
UC over other ones and primarily because
it<00:01:21.869> seemed<00:01:22.049> like<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> most<00:01:22.439> modern<00:01:22.799> course

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
it seemed like the most modern course

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.700 
it seemed like the most modern course
and<00:01:23.369> because<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.180> all<00:01:24.470> marginalized<00:01:25.470> here

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
and because it's all marginalized here

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.800 
and because it's all marginalized here
and<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.009> seems<00:01:26.220> very<00:01:26.310> well<00:01:26.610> split<00:01:26.790> off<00:01:26.970> UCD<00:01:27.600> has

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
and it seems very well split off UCD has

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.440 
and it seems very well split off UCD has
a<00:01:27.840> great<00:01:28.170> research<00:01:28.770> facility<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.579> feel<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:29.970> it

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
a great research facility I feel like it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.200 
a great research facility I feel like it
would<00:01:31.170> really<00:01:31.380> offer<00:01:31.790> opportunities<00:01:32.790> if<00:01:33.060> I

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
would really offer opportunities if I

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.240 
would really offer opportunities if I
feel<00:01:33.450> like<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.780> want<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.079> do<00:01:34.290> clinical<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.979> could

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
feel like I want to do clinical I could

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.490 
feel like I want to do clinical I could
go<00:01:35.400> do<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:35.990> medicine<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.110> not<00:01:37.229> just

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
go do that but medicine is not just

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.200 
go do that but medicine is not just
about<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:38.040> there's<00:01:38.430> also<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.820> research

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
about that there's also the research

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.569 
about that there's also the research
side<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.200> felt<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.470> UCD<00:01:41.070> would<00:01:41.400> be

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
side of it and I felt that UCD would be

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.889 
side of it and I felt that UCD would be
able<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.820> provide<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.450> kind<00:01:42.840> of

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
able to provide you that kind of

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:43.510 
able to provide you that kind of
experience

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
experience

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.210 
experience
