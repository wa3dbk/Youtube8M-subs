00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:11.960
 remove the trim on and sydney one look at 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.059
 we are under this stub 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.660
 turns away bat t20 asterisk 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:23.039
 two screws here under this plate and and 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.000
 we need to pick up the bottom better 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.000
 use a spatula 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:36.629
 speak from this side now 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.210
 explain why because she's here with 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.879
 these edges have these here 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.220
 guns that can be broken very easily 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.839
 and it is attached here by these 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.839
 three clamps 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:55.079
 two screws here him here 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.059
 turn away then remove the bubble 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.059
 this triangle under the speaker 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.680
 holding on 1 clip 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.700
 she stayed here 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.260
 and begin to pick a paw trim 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:26.250
 sitting on clips clip armored 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.250
 holding a rag to death 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.740
 -one 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.010
 so after all the clips from 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.140
 clicked 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:04.070
 Begin to carefully lift the trim 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.680
 up can be removed 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:11.300
 more accurately removed very tight to do 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.030
 all as carefully as possible all removed 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:19.100
 then lifting up this tongue 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.310
 upside down side 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:28.080
 removed the cable well and then turn off all 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.150
 connectors remove the window banana 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.510
 here are two such dental 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.780
 spatulas as they erupt here is one 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.050
 and it is desirable to bend a little bit 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.920
 the procedure is quite peculiar and 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:48.630
 we shove one shoulder blade 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:51.230
 centered second on the other hand need 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.680
 so she went exactly here on 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:59.690
 centimeters somewhere and 2 scapula and and 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:05.480
 little is pushed aside as if 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:08.690
 the opposite is still easy to take out 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.670
 explain the principle on this side 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.269
 in June, click off and not like it will interfere 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.820
 latch but from this side here 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.280
 holding a plastic tooth i.e. 1 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:25.670
 we turn it down with a spatula 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:28.700
 It turns out here and the other spatula 2 we 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:32.370
 pushing the window out 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.410
 something like that is better used here 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.350
 such because it is surgical steel 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.430
 she is very strong and elastic at the same 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.720
 time does not break plastic soft 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.239
 hush up can be very easy so 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.340
 everything is done as carefully as possible 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.750
 for 10 we'll get removed even easier under 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.700
 by the corner 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:56.230
 shove shovel and all 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:00.690
 she jumps out fixed here 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:03.989
 tongue shove my shovel squeeze 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.170
 here and he keeps here for this 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.680
 element 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.680
 everything
