00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.080 

okay<00:00:01.420> COBOL<00:00:01.840> form<00:00:02.110> so<00:00:02.440> here<00:00:02.710> is<00:00:02.920> my<00:00:03.280> problem

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.090 
okay COBOL form so here is my problem

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.710 
okay COBOL form so here is my problem
it's<00:00:04.960> pretty<00:00:05.710> dark<00:00:06.100> in<00:00:06.580> my<00:00:07.120> car<00:00:07.359> right<00:00:07.390> now

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:07.720 
it's pretty dark in my car right now

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.129 
it's pretty dark in my car right now
even<00:00:07.870> though<00:00:08.080> I've<00:00:08.230> got<00:00:08.260> both<00:00:08.590> the<00:00:08.860> lights<00:00:09.100> on

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
even though I've got both the lights on

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.230 
even though I've got both the lights on
anyway<00:00:12.030> there<00:00:13.030> is<00:00:13.559> my<00:00:14.559> shifter<00:00:15.070> at<00:00:15.940> the<00:00:16.090> boot

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 
anyway there is my shifter at the boot

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.130 
anyway there is my shifter at the boot
off<00:00:16.420> right<00:00:16.630> now<00:00:17.730> see<00:00:18.730> well<00:00:19.420> it's<00:00:19.570> too<00:00:19.720> dark<00:00:19.990> to

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
off right now see well it's too dark to

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.630 
off right now see well it's too dark to
see<00:00:20.169> down<00:00:20.500> into<00:00:20.769> the<00:00:20.859> linkage<00:00:21.160> very<00:00:21.369> wall

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
see down into the linkage very wall

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.489 
see down into the linkage very wall
right<00:00:21.849> now<00:00:22.000> but<00:00:22.269> here<00:00:22.509> is<00:00:22.630> the<00:00:22.779> problem<00:00:22.929> it's

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:23.499 
right now but here is the problem it's

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:27.989 
right now but here is the problem it's
pretty<00:00:24.070> obvious<00:00:24.609> okay<00:00:25.300> so<00:00:25.660> I<00:00:26.249> go<00:00:27.249> you<00:00:27.970> know

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:27.999 
pretty obvious okay so I go you know

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:29.069 
pretty obvious okay so I go you know
neutral<00:00:28.599> right<00:00:28.720> now

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:29.079 
neutral right now

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:38.240 
neutral right now
I<00:00:29.730> go<00:00:30.730> to<00:00:30.789> put<00:00:31.089> the<00:00:31.179> car<00:00:31.390> in<00:00:31.509> first<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:36.510> okay<00:00:37.510> so

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
I go to put the car in first and okay so

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.150 
I go to put the car in first and okay so
I'm<00:00:39.250> not<00:00:39.489> sure<00:00:39.670> if<00:00:39.760> you<00:00:39.850> heard<00:00:40.000> that<00:00:40.059> sound<00:00:40.510> but

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
I'm not sure if you heard that sound but

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.380 
I'm not sure if you heard that sound but
now<00:00:42.160> I<00:00:42.550> don't<00:00:43.059> have<00:00:43.239> anything

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.389 

the<00:00:48.019> linkage<00:00:48.499> has<00:00:48.710> popped<00:00:49.039> off<00:00:50.289> and<00:00:51.289> I'm<00:00:52.219> not

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
the linkage has popped off and I'm not

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.110 
the linkage has popped off and I'm not
sure<00:00:53.199> if<00:00:54.199> anything<00:00:54.500> is<00:00:54.800> severely<00:00:55.339> damaged<00:00:55.940> in

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
sure if anything is severely damaged in

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.669 
sure if anything is severely damaged in
there<00:00:56.390> but<00:00:57.699> if<00:00:58.699> I<00:00:58.940> take<00:00:59.359> the<00:00:59.899> linkage<00:01:00.350> and

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
there but if I take the linkage and

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.250 
there but if I take the linkage and
sorry<00:01:01.399> for<00:01:01.699> my<00:01:02.120> hands<00:01:02.420> being<00:01:02.629> all<00:01:02.809> weird<00:01:02.989> here

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
sorry for my hands being all weird here

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.450 
sorry for my hands being all weird here
I<00:01:04.000> take<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.239> linkage<00:01:05.659> and<00:01:05.930> pop<00:01:06.439> it<00:01:06.649> back<00:01:06.920> in

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
I take the linkage and pop it back in

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.210 
I take the linkage and pop it back in
just<00:01:10.460> have<00:01:10.670> to<00:01:10.759> find<00:01:11.210> where<00:01:11.600> to<00:01:11.750> fall<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.380> it's

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
just have to find where to fall and it's

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.380 
just have to find where to fall and it's
hard<00:01:13.369> to<00:01:13.460> do<00:01:13.549> with<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.759> can<00:01:13.909> we<00:01:14.060> set<00:01:14.270> the

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
hard to do with the can we set the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:24.350 
hard to do with the can we set the
camera<00:01:14.689> down<00:01:15.070> sorry<00:01:16.070> for<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.369> darkness

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.730 

I<00:01:24.480> go<00:01:25.230> ahead<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.920> snap<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.060> back<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.620> there<00:01:28.620> we

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
I go ahead and snap it back in there we

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.220 
I go ahead and snap it back in there we
go<00:01:28.890> back<00:01:29.250> together<00:01:29.540> now<00:01:30.540> if<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.870> want<00:01:31.110> to

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
go back together now if I want to

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.310 
go back together now if I want to
actually<00:01:31.410> get<00:01:31.770> into<00:01:32.040> first<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.910> have<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.020> hold

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
actually get into first I have to hold

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.950 
actually get into first I have to hold
my<00:01:34.590> hand<00:01:34.620> down<00:01:35.490> here<00:01:35.550> under<00:01:36.390> where<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.750> cup

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
my hand down here under where the cup

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.620 
my hand down here under where the cup
holder<00:01:37.290> should<00:01:37.470> be<00:01:37.620> and<00:01:38.090> hold<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.300> linkage

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
holder should be and hold the linkage

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.340 
holder should be and hold the linkage
together<00:01:40.110> while<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> get<00:01:41.160> it<00:01:41.250> into<00:01:41.490> first<00:01:41.930> now<00:01:42.930> I

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
together while I get it into first now I

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.660 
together while I get it into first now I
think<00:01:44.840> my<00:01:45.840> car<00:01:46.080> still<00:01:46.440> has<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> warranty<00:01:47.370> that

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
think my car still has a warranty that

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.200 
think my car still has a warranty that
expires<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.450> year<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:50.040> I'm<00:01:50.130> I'm<00:01:50.340> hoping<00:01:51.060> that

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
expires this year so I'm I'm hoping that

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.650 
expires this year so I'm I'm hoping that
I<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.360> get<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.720> free<00:01:52.620> but<00:01:53.370> if<00:01:53.729> not<00:01:54.120> I<00:01:54.420> was

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
I can get this free but if not I was

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.580 
I can get this free but if not I was
wondering<00:01:55.170> if<00:01:55.470> anyone<00:01:55.830> has<00:01:56.190> any<00:01:57.380> price<00:01:58.380> range

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
wondering if anyone has any price range

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.890 
wondering if anyone has any price range
on<00:01:59.040> what<00:01:59.220> they<00:01:59.340> shifter<00:01:59.880> linkage<00:02:00.090> costs

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
on what they shifter linkage costs

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.720 
on what they shifter linkage costs
because<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.820> obviously<00:02:02.820> need<00:02:03.540> one
