00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
sometimes I'm a child can get annoying

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:31.970 
sometimes I'm a child can get annoying
because<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:31.139> can<00:02:31.319> be<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> little<00:02:31.799> bit

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
because it can be a little bit

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.809 
because it can be a little bit
repetitive<00:02:32.750> but<00:02:33.750> says<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.799> is<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:34.980> demo<00:02:35.370> and

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
repetitive but says this is the demo and

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.940 
repetitive but says this is the demo and
since<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.750> wheel<00:02:36.930> game<00:02:37.230> has<00:02:37.409> already<00:02:37.560> came

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
since the wheel game has already came

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.879 
since the wheel game has already came
out<00:02:38.450> well<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.840> think<00:02:40.290> there<00:02:40.439> might<00:02:40.620> be<00:02:40.680> an
