00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.660
 the wine 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.360
 the news for me is complicated because 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.270
 I believe a lot in the project or at least 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.630
 until now but the news is that we 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.630
 has bought and wants to close the company 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.630
 completely 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.109
 the least we could do was 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.280
 close a good offer for the 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.829
 customers that we have with the new 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.570
 company is what they offer us is 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.180
 offer them to you and to all 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.460
 Customers that we have right now 50 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.710
 euros to change to your new company 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.500
 online the question a little bit that's 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.640
 I would change that company to a company 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.640
 online for 50 euros 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.040
 they are offering money by the end 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.970
 fifty euros then just for going to 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.970
 the new company 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.410
 although you tell me look 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:44.000
 and of course I would change them and be company 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.000
 50 euros 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.360
 and photovoltaics with efficiency 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.890
 energetic fighting for a generation 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.050
 distributed and the only thing that we have a 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.160
 possible distributed marketing and 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:09.420
 after betting that it was the first 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.420
 what we had 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.730
 on-line 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.520
 I hope it does not taste bad but this is a 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.960
 joke is a camera back you have a 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.960
 camera here and another camera 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.489
 ah 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.650
 sorry for this joke but of 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.299
 I think we really want to know if 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.709
 Customers are happy and we want 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.269
 that you have super clear that we continue 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.640
 being independent and that this 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.950
 we hope that the change will never be 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.520
 philosophy are something that has come to 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.810
 break the rules of the game 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.810
 and it will remain that way
