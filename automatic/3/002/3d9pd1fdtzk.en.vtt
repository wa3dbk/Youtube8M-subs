box what you'll find is my knees tend to

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.780

track<00:00:44.320> a<00:00:44.350> little<00:00:44.589> bit<00:00:44.680> more<00:00:44.890> far<00:00:45.100> forward<00:00:45.580> so

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
shown a couple times before but I want

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.759

you<00:01:00.549> to<00:01:00.670> just<00:01:00.850> see<00:01:01.089> where<00:01:01.390> my<00:01:01.629> legs<00:01:01.900> are<00:01:02.199> now

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
ideally I'd actually want my toes and

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.530 
ideally I'd actually want my toes and
feet<00:01:05.229> a<00:01:05.290> little<00:01:05.650> bit<00:01:05.799> wider<00:01:05.910> just<00:01:06.910> my<00:01:07.060> hips<00:01:07.330> are

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
feet a little bit wider just my hips are

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.060 
feet a little bit wider just my hips are
really<00:01:07.780> tight<00:01:08.110> so<00:01:08.290> that's<00:01:08.470> something<00:01:08.860> I'm

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
really tight so that's something I'm

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.310 
really tight so that's something I'm
going<00:01:09.310> to<00:01:09.430> need<00:01:09.760> to<00:01:10.000> work<00:01:10.210> on<00:01:10.450> you<00:01:10.990> can<00:01:11.140> also

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
going to need to work on you can also

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.440 
going to need to work on you can also
see<00:01:11.770> that<00:01:11.800> my<00:01:12.100> stance<00:01:12.460> is<00:01:12.610> actually<00:01:13.030> a<00:01:13.060> little

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
see that my stance is actually a little

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.020 
see that my stance is actually a little
bit<00:01:13.660> off<00:01:13.870> it's<00:01:14.170> not<00:01:14.350> very<00:01:14.650> even<00:01:15.100> as<00:01:15.280> you<00:01:15.880> can

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
bit off it's not very even as you can

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.030 
bit off it's not very even as you can
see<00:01:16.240> from<00:01:16.420> this<00:01:16.660> shot<00:01:16.930> maybe<00:01:17.200> even<00:01:17.710> I<00:01:17.890> don't

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
see from this shot maybe even I don't

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.620 
see from this shot maybe even I don't
even<00:01:18.220> think<00:01:18.370> the<00:01:18.640> box<00:01:18.850> is<00:01:19.060> straight<00:01:19.330> so<00:01:19.450> I<00:01:19.480> need

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
even think the box is straight so I need

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.000 
even think the box is straight so I need
to<00:01:19.720> do<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:19.840> better<00:01:20.020> job<00:01:20.140> of<00:01:20.350> lining<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:20.950> up

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
to do a better job of lining that up

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.130 
to do a better job of lining that up
because<00:01:21.820> it's<00:01:21.970> leading<00:01:22.180> me<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.630> have<00:01:22.780> a<00:01:22.810> little

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
because it's leading me to have a little

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.510 
because it's leading me to have a little
bit<00:01:23.260> off<00:01:23.470> of<00:01:23.500> a<00:01:23.770> stance<00:01:24.040> so<00:01:24.250> there<00:01:24.400> you<00:01:24.460> see

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
bit off of a stance so there you see

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.120 
bit off of a stance so there you see
again<00:01:24.940> not<00:01:25.210> a<00:01:25.360> typically<00:01:25.810> even<00:01:26.080> stance<00:01:26.590> I'm

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
again not a typically even stance I'm

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.710 
again not a typically even stance I'm
not<00:01:27.340> really<00:01:27.520> too<00:01:27.880> worried<00:01:28.150> about<00:01:28.240> it<00:01:28.450> right

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
not really too worried about it right

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.080 
not really too worried about it right
here<00:01:29.020> but<00:01:29.260> I<00:01:29.290> want<00:01:29.650> you<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:29.800> see<00:01:30.100> again<00:01:30.460> how

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
here but I want you to see again how

notice<00:01:41.260> that<00:01:41.409> on<00:01:41.740> these<00:01:41.980> I'm<00:01:42.310> going<00:01:42.670> with<00:01:42.850> a

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
notice that on these I'm going with a

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.630 
notice that on these I'm going with a
fairly<00:01:43.360> slow<00:01:43.960> motion<00:01:44.620> on<00:01:44.770> this<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.220> that's

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
fairly slow motion on this and that's

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.969 
fairly slow motion on this and that's
because<00:01:46.060> I'm<00:01:46.270> really<00:01:46.690> really<00:01:47.500> trying<00:01:47.800> to

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
because I'm really really trying to

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.190 
because I'm really really trying to
convince<00:01:48.190> myself<00:01:48.610> to<00:01:48.940> push<00:01:49.420> my<00:01:49.659> butt<00:01:49.930> out<00:01:50.140> and

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
convince myself to push my butt out and

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.450 
convince myself to push my butt out and
sit<00:01:50.860> back<00:01:51.159> again<00:01:51.820> instead<00:01:52.750> of<00:01:52.810> down<00:01:53.280> now<00:01:54.280> as

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
sit back again instead of down now as

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.130 
sit back again instead of down now as
part<00:01:54.670> of<00:01:54.850> this<00:01:54.970> what<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:55.300> would<00:01:55.479> do<00:01:55.659> is<00:01:55.840> after

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
part of this what I would do is after

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.170 
part of this what I would do is after
each<00:01:56.350> set<00:01:56.680> that<00:01:56.860> I<00:01:56.920> recorded<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:57.700> would<00:01:57.970> watch

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
each set that I recorded I would watch

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.910 
each set that I recorded I would watch
it<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.630> try<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:58.870> pick<00:01:59.170> up<00:01:59.350> things<00:01:59.590> that<00:01:59.770> I'm

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
it and try to pick up things that I'm

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.430 
it and try to pick up things that I'm
doing<00:02:00.100> wrong<00:02:00.430> so<00:02:00.790> in<00:02:01.330> this<00:02:01.570> case<00:02:01.900> my<00:02:02.229> knees

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
doing wrong so in this case my knees

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.020 
doing wrong so in this case my knees
tend<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:02.920> come<00:02:03.100> a<00:02:03.130> little<00:02:03.310> bit<00:02:03.520> more<00:02:03.729> far

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
tend to come a little bit more far

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.580 
tend to come a little bit more far
forward<00:02:04.479> than<00:02:04.659> they<00:02:04.810> had<00:02:04.990> been<00:02:05.229> in<00:02:05.440> the

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
forward than they had been in the

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.740 
forward than they had been in the
previous<00:02:05.860> sets<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:06.790> again<00:02:07.390> I'm<00:02:07.510> not<00:02:07.690> really

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
previous sets and again I'm not really

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.050 
previous sets and again I'm not really
focusing<00:02:08.530> on<00:02:08.649> pushing<00:02:09.159> my<00:02:09.280> butt<00:02:09.519> out<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:09.849> looks

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
focusing on pushing my butt out it looks

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.180 
focusing on pushing my butt out it looks
like<00:02:10.149> in<00:02:10.450> this<00:02:10.750> sense<00:02:11.050> so<00:02:11.680> part<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.130> the

like in this sense so part of the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.770 
like in this sense so part of the
problem<00:02:12.580> with<00:02:12.730> this<00:02:12.910> is<00:02:13.180> there's<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.480> lot<00:02:13.660> of
