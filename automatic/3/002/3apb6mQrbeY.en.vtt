but I try to shave them the most

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.960 
but I try to shave them the most
important<00:02:24.000> thing<00:02:24.240> is<00:02:24.450> well<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:26.370> bottom<00:02:26.760> line

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
important thing is well the bottom line

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.960 
important thing is well the bottom line
and<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.740> clear<00:02:28.740> out<00:02:28.980> that's<00:02:29.250> where<00:02:29.520> most<00:02:29.700> of

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
and to clear out that's where most of

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.400 
and to clear out that's where most of
the<00:02:30.150> stray<00:02:30.750> hair<00:02:31.050> hairs<00:02:31.410> grow<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.410> you

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
the stray hair hairs grow and the you

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.760 
the stray hair hairs grow and the you
just<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:36.360> difficult<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.990> explain<00:02:37.050> because<00:02:37.590> I

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
just I so difficult to explain because I

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.720 
just I so difficult to explain because I
have<00:02:37.950> just<00:02:38.160> learned<00:02:38.850> by<00:02:39.390> like<00:02:39.690> every<00:02:40.110> time<00:02:40.320> I

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
have just learned by like every time I

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.080 
have just learned by like every time I
kind<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.880> tweeze<00:02:42.420> my<00:02:42.450> eyebrows<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.380> I<00:02:43.890> just<00:02:44.820> look

kind of tweeze my eyebrows I I just look
and<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.450> think<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.890> this<00:02:47.490> is<00:02:47.760> what<00:02:48.150> I'm<00:02:48.240> after

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
and I think that this is what I'm after

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.020 
and I think that this is what I'm after
and<00:02:48.960> how<00:02:49.770> can<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.130> do<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:52.760> eyebrows<00:02:53.760> are

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
and how can I do this and eyebrows are

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.750 
and how can I do this and eyebrows are
not<00:02:54.180> supposed<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:54.750> end<00:02:54.870> here<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:56.280> eyebrows

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
not supposed to end here and eyebrows

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.040 
not supposed to end here and eyebrows
are<00:02:56.910> not<00:02:57.060> supposed<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.420> end<00:02:57.600> in<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.930> middle

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
are not supposed to end in the middle

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.970 
are not supposed to end in the middle
here<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:59.930> that's<00:03:00.930> something<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:01.740> would<00:03:01.920> be

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
here and that's something that would be

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.420 
here and that's something that would be
good<00:03:02.220> for<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.550> couple<00:03:02.580> people<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.180> know<00:03:03.360> and

and they they can afford to start a

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.610 
and they they can afford to start a
little<00:03:56.100> bit<00:03:56.420> closer<00:03:57.420> together<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:58.170> make<00:03:58.380> it

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
little bit closer together to make it

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.140

Swedish slim nose you can make them a
little<00:04:03.090> bit<00:04:03.740> like<00:04:04.850> further<00:04:05.850> apart<00:04:06.360> but<00:04:06.660> not<00:04:06.930> a

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
little bit like further apart but not a

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.080 
little bit like further apart but not a
lot<00:04:07.380> just<00:04:07.410> a<00:04:08.010> little<00:04:08.040> bit<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:09.290> the<00:04:10.290> arch<00:04:11.090> in

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
lot just a little bit and the arch in

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.180 
lot just a little bit and the arch in
Kansas<00:04:12.660> this<00:04:12.990> is<00:04:13.170> not<00:04:13.410> something<00:04:13.980> that's

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
Kansas this is not something that's

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.849 
Kansas this is not something that's
super<00:04:14.760> important<00:04:15.720> like<00:04:15.990> the<00:04:16.140> arch<00:04:16.320> can<00:04:16.650> be

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
super important like the arch can be

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.070 
super important like the arch can be
kind<00:04:17.790> of<00:04:17.880> where<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.269> want<00:04:18.480> then<00:04:18.750> it<00:04:18.840> can<00:04:18.959> be

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
kind of where you want then it can be

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.800 
kind of where you want then it can be
sharp<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.859> it<00:04:19.920> came<00:04:20.100> over<00:04:20.130> came<00:04:20.489> around<00:04:20.820> but

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
sharp and it came over came around but

of<00:04:42.030> like<00:04:42.530> how<00:04:43.530> I<00:04:43.560> think<00:04:43.740> that<00:04:44.130> as<00:04:44.310> long<00:04:44.340> as

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
of like how I think that as long as

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.640 
of like how I think that as long as
beginning<00:04:45.390> and<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:46.710> ends<00:04:47.160> are<00:04:47.430> kind<00:04:47.790> of<00:04:48.650> where

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
beginning and the ends are kind of where

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.980 
beginning and the ends are kind of where
they<00:04:49.770> should<00:04:50.010> be<00:04:50.040> the<00:04:50.940> arch<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:51.510> can't<00:04:51.690> afford

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
they should be the arch you can't afford

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.020 
they should be the arch you can't afford
to<00:04:52.440> be<00:04:52.590> a<00:04:52.620> couple<00:04:53.100> of<00:04:53.190> millimeters<00:04:53.790> off

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
to be a couple of millimeters off

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.530 
to be a couple of millimeters off
whatever<00:04:54.800> and<00:04:55.800> as<00:04:56.669> you<00:04:56.850> can<00:04:56.970> see<00:04:57.030> you<00:04:57.210> mine<00:04:57.390> are
