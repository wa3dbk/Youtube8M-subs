00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 welcome to this course of w7 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.340
 where we will learn to use autocad 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.830
 to develop a project 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.500
 architectural complete 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.289
 this course is organized in modules 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.810
 where it contains classes with explanations of 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.670
 concepts and examples and 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.670
 evaluative exercises 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.900
 in the first module we will learn about 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.500
 concepts of architectural design 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.500
 standards, thicknesses and types of 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.440
 lines sheets of drawing margins and 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.930
 subtitles being the last subject addressed 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.949
 in the module the concept of scales in 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.949
 architectural projects 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.739
 in module 2 we will learn how to use the 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.430
 main autocad tools for the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.809
 project development 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.120
 architectural 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.129
 Let's learn how to work with layers. 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.920
 blocks and ashura 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.880
 let's also know the tools of 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:10.680
 autocad precision these tools 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.680
 facilitate the development of projects 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.020
 in module 3 we will learn the concept of 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.710
 main drawings used in the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.830
 presentation of building projects 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.750
 ground floor cuts facades so much of 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.140
 coverage among others 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.390
 in module 4 we will know the file 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.090
 standard that will be used in the development 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.780
 of the basic course design 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.510
 still in this module we will create the laws that 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.170
 used in the development of the 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.170
 project 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.230
 in module 5 we will start the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.200
 project development 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.380
 in this module we will design the plant 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.380
 low 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.960
 in the module we will raise the cuts 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.569
 in module 7 we will create the faÃ§ades of 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.569
 project 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.970
 in the penultimate module we will draw the 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.470
 coverage plant implantation cuts and 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.470
 roof facades 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.860
 in the last module we will configure the 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.800
 scale in autocad we will configure 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.569
 also the layout and insert the format 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.510
 standardized sheet 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.510
 Let's also insert the drawings in the 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.010
 sheets and adjust the scale in the project 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.069
 to finish 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.069
 we will fight the project in pdf files 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.629
 this course offers all the knowledge 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.790
 necessary for the student to be able to 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:43.610
 develop very dynamically all and 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.610
 any type of architectural design the 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.849
 more elaborate architectural design 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:53.030
 autocad is currently the most 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.819
 used by architects and designers 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.810
 civil engineers for the preparation of 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.500
 home 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.060
 we finish here this introductory class 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.060
 Wishing you a great travel
