00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:05.440
 I am Snook he hourly percent not yet the freight times because 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.449
 If I'm just so incisive with them now, my oldest will be very 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:11.509
 for me, too, a question of courtesy 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.509
 I'm there with them on the radio so do not appear 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.050
 Radio FFH I am here I do not disturb Yes I do not want them at all 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.230
 I hold each time is precious 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.830
 So long, you never have to live with a negative less 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.420
 Picture it goes it all over Â«Nigeria still has so much in front of him and does not say 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:30.149
 more 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.699
 Kolze in front of the radio more earlier, it was not so fast or 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.950
 he used to take his time 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.710
 At the bank there are old testers who have been hit for that is 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.010
 something like Landau 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.620
 also percent lie 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.670
 distorted facial expression country 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.300
 and Sam looking forward 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.620
 only he put it on his knees beside the bushes still that lasted forever 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.400
 Guth today 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.539
 dead when both have no time left 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.719
 some things were better early on, teens were still in the 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:00.250
 bus 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.330
 I was looking for an older place but they still do it for him today 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.560
 to hit on the face 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.300
 it's not nice I try to be polite personally 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.119
 I hold to the three great commandments that are free 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.450
 from Knigge I do not smoke I do not shoot 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.409
 I do not jump in the air you do not do it the way you used to be 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:20.820
 things 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.100
 you do not do that 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.590
 did not blow up 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.800
 Hanke and I am 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.580
 then at home and Lena lunchtime young people are very partial about what it is 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.469
 Lunchtime is the time you do not blow up 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.570
 because of the disturbance disturbing the explosion is so synonymous by name so that 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:37.880
 you too maximum 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.670
 Once a year, self-annoying blowing is also the other one told me 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.330
 It would be embarrassing for religious reasons, yes only to go to paradise 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.090
 So come from deep 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.150
 in good this between motives that's disgusting what 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.369
 who, of course, the anger guardians are angry citizens 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.800
 they are angry and then that makes me that is 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.460
 an underestimated advantage 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.549
 of democracy 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:01.999
 that you vote 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:05.710
 instead of blowing up, that's why I find the parliamentary one 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.290
 Democracy everything very fast 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.459
 So put it just moderately tuned just every few years 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.899
 "And not if none of them get angry 

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:16.229
 and in the meantime, the rage citizen can still be at stations 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:22.149
 and Neurath Power Station loudly roared Kooths but without vuf 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:23.040
 Inter 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.119
 mostly 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.839
 it is
