scroll<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:07.950> thought<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.400> was<00:01:08.520> really<00:01:08.850> cool

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060

scroll so I thought that was really cool
these<00:01:09.630> are<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:10.110> supposed<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590

instructions<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> game<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:11.790> there's

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
instructions for the game so there's

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.679 
instructions for the game so there's
nothing<00:01:12.299> really<00:01:12.450> crazy<00:01:13.110> about<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.689> then

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
nothing really crazy about that and then

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.690 
nothing really crazy about that and then
I'll<00:01:16.500> actually<00:01:16.799> just<00:01:17.250> go<00:01:17.369> through<00:01:17.580> these

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
the way all the pieces were actually

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.830 
the way all the pieces were actually
made<00:04:00.000> like<00:04:00.030> slump<00:04:00.360> from<00:04:00.510> steel<00:04:00.810> and

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
made like slump from steel and

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.050 
made like slump from steel and
handcrafted<00:04:01.830> so<00:04:02.250> I<00:04:02.280> thought<00:04:02.490> that<00:04:02.670> was<00:04:02.760> really

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
handcrafted so I thought that was really

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.180 
handcrafted so I thought that was really
cool<00:04:03.260> uh<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:06.840> get<00:04:06.990> little<00:04:07.140> villages<00:04:07.620> these

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
cool uh so you get little villages these

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.860 
cool uh so you get little villages these
are<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.430> villa<00:04:08.610> villager<00:04:09.120> things<00:04:09.390> that

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
are the villa villager things that

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.900 
are the villa villager things that
instead<00:04:10.170> of<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.410> houses<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:11.100> then<00:04:11.640> right

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
instead of the houses and then right

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.360 
instead of the houses and then right
here<00:04:11.940> is<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.600> actual<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:13.500> guess<00:04:14.100> these<00:04:14.310> are

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
here is the actual I guess these are

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.520 
here is the actual I guess these are
like<00:04:14.670> bigger<00:04:15.150> city<00:04:15.630> like<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.080> bigger<00:04:16.260> hotels

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
like bigger city like the bigger hotels

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.490 
like bigger city like the bigger hotels
or<00:04:16.950> cities<00:04:17.359> it's<00:04:18.359> actually<00:04:18.810> like<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:18.989> keep<00:04:19.320> I

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
or cities it's actually like a keep I

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.599 
or cities it's actually like a keep I
think<00:04:19.739> it's<00:04:19.859> called<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.100> keep<00:04:20.340> as<00:04:20.489> the

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
think it's called the keep as the

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.990 
think it's called the keep as the
official<00:04:21.000> word<00:04:21.120> so<00:04:21.359> that

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
official word so that

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.140 
official word so that
i<00:04:24.760> well

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
i well

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.550 
i well
