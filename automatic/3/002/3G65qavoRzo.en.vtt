 the scene of victorian london 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.020
 an alternative timeline brute 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.240
 Covering ball and the very cinematic 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.680
 staging should be in the interplay for 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.310

 really the hoped for playstation 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.480
 bang or maybe just 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.280
 Substantial cellphone is in the order et 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.280
 Six turns who would have thought that 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.680
 everything about the eponymous mysterious 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.420
 Knights the Victorian

 secret police carry the names of 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.199
 Grail Knight of King Artus and 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.270
 operate from Westminster Palace 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.250
 Out in the order of the crown 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.170
 Usually the knights take care of themselves 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.070
 the destruction of supernatural beings like 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.930
 the japanese 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.579
 but now it is a rebellion 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.000
 to beat back the one united 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.680
 The kingdom threatens knights galahad das 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.720
 This is extremely masculine 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.700
 schnauzbartträger here comes here 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.680
 unaware of a conspiracy on the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.490
 It is dangerous for the whole world 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.490
 means 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.680
 Developer ready at dawn relies on one 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.360
 tremendously cinematic staging why 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.160
 under also more time-stressed so 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.980
 you will spend between sequences 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.770
 to watch as really active to gamble 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.810
 but that is not a broken leg because the 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.670
 film sequences are well staged and 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.010
 go seamlessly into the gameplay 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.140
 notorious story gone wrong 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.940
 but annoying because even after 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.560
 you will play through in further 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.030
 Traversing the scenes forced 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.440
 to stop watching is not possible 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.390
 once the game overrides you 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.640
 lets you move into a tight level 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.690
 hoses that are so idiot-proof designs 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.030
 are that nobody really 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.200
 can run and which guarantees you 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.180
 to a firefight with 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.580
 Cover possibilities and approaching 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.020
 enemy hordes lead 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.450
 after the proven duck and cover 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.850
 principle, you offer everything around what yourself 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.500
 moves thanks to the impeccable control 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.870
 the shootings even feel something 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.530
 more dynamic than colleague gears 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.450
 of war 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.459
 while you are attacking all sorts of things 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.740
 conventional shotguns and pistols 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.690
 even more unusual models like the 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.700
 Thermite throwers with her one 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.680
 flammable fog shoots her up 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.930
 button print together with everything in it 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.940
 can ignite or the lightning 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.050
 can do without that takes a bit longer 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.510
 to recharge 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.070
 the waiting but with bursting heads 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.890
 and thus one hit kills 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.989
 unarmored foot troops rewarded yet 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.820
 no matter to which of the numerous weapons 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.709
 you are always coming back to it 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.540
 situations in which you simply too 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.120
 many opponents are lacking 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.159
 around you air to give her sets 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.260
 the so-called black view 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:57.079
 on keystroke you have the 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.340
 time while automatically receives goals in 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.930
 Sight on grain takes 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.430
 that's also handy if you have one 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.890
 thicker pounding in front of the gun is running 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.470
 because you 're so quick to fire on him 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.450
 can concentrate or if someone 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.670
 you explosive greetings by hand 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.959
 Canadian the black light indicator 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.120
 loads afterwards during the fighting 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.799
 slowly back up and also if you 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.480
 but somebody has knocked you down 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.549
 the chance of your magic black water 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.439
 what is that and what ever 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.329
 where it comes from would be easy stories 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.889
 That's why dollars only mean so much 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.780
 you are on the ground 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.599
 can you drink from the many and you 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.680
 again himself around occasionally expected 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.260
 the game also from you that you 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.180
 sneaks this very simple of 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.109
 Frequencies are always explicit 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.150
 requires 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.069
 You can not decide for yourself 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.930
 you behave in the other levels 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.489
 you always wanted to go too 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.870
 quicktime events and mini games 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.389
 exist partially in the 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.010
 between sequences partly but also in the 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.109
 normal game are required 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.780
 that is never really hard 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:56.979
 even quicktime dyslexics should 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.979
 get along well here 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.410
 Well, what are you going to do great 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.460
 except that it's just great 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.820
 looks 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.290
 im serious like or kinetics thats 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.720
 the most beautiful game for a long time 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.340
 has come and not because of 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.070
 the gray again in gray and 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.049
 color palette but because of the incredible 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.810
 detailed environment and figures 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.940
 the transitions between film sequences and 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.650
 Games are so flowing that you often do 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.410
 does not realize that it goes on 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.420
 Fabric movement finest details and 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.100
 amazingly real-looking facial features 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.360
 with successful facial expressions breathe the 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.850
 characters live on 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.370
 Almost photorealistic 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.990
 look where you look there's here 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.850
 to discover funny details 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.860
 that ranges from the unprecedented fine 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.870
 designed clothes and faces up 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.880
 out to little hair from modeled 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.730
 bone when a head from 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.040
 Body Trend Yes the last example is 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.020
 maybe something tasteless shows but 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.270
 how much do the development team love in the 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.500
 optics of the game you've got 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.450
 it's easy with a bloody one 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.880
 Leave texture on the polygon body 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.380
 Can notorious naggers be yourself 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.420
 though over the cinemascope bars 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.010
 echauffieren which provide for cinema feeling 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.700
 and by the way the hardware something 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.770
 relieve 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.600
 but like a movie we go to 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.950
 home watch the black ones fall 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.170
 stripes at the top and bottom 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.480
 screen edge after a few minutes even 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.830
 no longer on because we are completely in 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.980
 deepen the game 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.110
 and honestly prefer to beam and 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.910
 stable frame rate city ​​jerking and 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.910
 stutter in the middle of the firefight or 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.940
 the order tsx is wonderful 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.949
 staged mobile phone and shows 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.680
 impressive to what the playstation 4 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:42.259
 capable of action and film sequences 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.180
 keep the balance well and with about 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.069
 Eight to ten hours is the game for 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.550
 What it does not want to do too 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:49.699
 short 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.400
 great before you the full 70 euros for it 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:54.110
 but you should definitely spend 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.599
 be clear that it is after the 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.220
 play through any incentive gives the 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:01.699
 order again 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:04.520
 no multiplayer no basket no 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.930
 apart from that, unlockable goodies 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.789
 However, we are of the opinion that 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.770
 Every ps4 has a hard time 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:13.280
 entertaining game necessarily times 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:16.360
 should look to the emergency halt after 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.360
 the price reduction
