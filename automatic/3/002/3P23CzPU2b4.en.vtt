00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
try to do this exact same movement but

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.700 
try to do this exact same movement but
now<00:00:49.410> there's<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.770> POI<00:00:50.840> but<00:00:51.840> really<00:00:52.230> try<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.469> not

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
now there's a POI but really try to not

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.610 
now there's a POI but really try to not
lose<00:00:53.010> anything<00:00:53.370> its<00:00:53.789> nose<00:00:54.420> ear<00:00:54.930> back<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.440> head

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
lose anything its nose ear back the head

lose anything its nose ear back the head
keep<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.670> posture<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.480> as<00:00:57.660> good<00:00:57.809> as<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.050> was

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
keep the posture just as good as it was

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.889 
keep the posture just as good as it was
without<00:00:58.620> ploy<00:00:58.920> keep<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.059> chin<00:01:00.270> up<00:01:00.449> all<00:01:00.690> those

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
without ploy keep the chin up all those

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.840 
without ploy keep the chin up all those
same<00:01:01.230> things<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.829> point<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.460> doing<00:01:02.609> it

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
same things the point of doing it

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.329 
same things the point of doing it
without<00:01:03.239> poi<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.650> gives<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.890> such<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> good

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
without poi is it gives you such a good

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.550 
without poi is it gives you such a good
opportunity<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:06.360> develop<00:01:06.540> good<00:01:06.900> good<00:01:07.200> habits

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
opportunity to develop good good habits

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.050 
opportunity to develop good good habits
so<00:01:08.369> keep<00:01:08.850> those<00:01:09.180> once<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.320> let<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.060> poi

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
so keep those once you let the poi

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.690 
so keep those once you let the poi
become<00:01:12.540> part<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> equation<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.490> can

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
become part of the equation so you can

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.850 
become part of the equation so you can
start<00:01:15.000> saying<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.930> know<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.380> would<00:01:16.560> be<00:01:16.680> your

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
start saying you know this would be your

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.640 
start saying you know this would be your
left<00:01:17.009> hand<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.580> outwards<00:01:18.320> if<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.439> want<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
left hand going outwards if you want to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.840 
left hand going outwards if you want to
mirror<00:01:19.799> me<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:23.250> that'll<00:01:23.520> take<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.670> little

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
mirror me and that'll take a little

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.640 
mirror me and that'll take a little
practice<00:01:24.420> before<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.869> flowing<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.500> don't

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
practice before it's flowing so don't

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.690 
practice before it's flowing so don't
worry<00:01:25.710> look<00:01:26.220> um<00:01:27.170> then<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.320> take<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:29.670> other

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
worry look um then you take the other

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.940 
worry look um then you take the other
one<00:01:30.210> which<00:01:30.420> will<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.630> inwards<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.380> we<00:01:31.500> up<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
one which will be inwards and we up the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.340 
one which will be inwards and we up the
side<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.579> back<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.060> head<00:01:33.240> up<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.140> side

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the back of the head you add a poi up

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.870 
the back of the head you add a poi up
the<00:01:39.479> side<00:01:39.689> back<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.290> head<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.250> side<00:01:41.490> back

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
the side back the head up the side back

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.249 
the side back the head up the side back
the<00:01:42.030> head<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.450> again<00:01:42.659> make<00:01:42.869> sure<00:01:43.110> you're

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
the head and again make sure you're

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.889

going<00:01:43.439> past<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.070> ear<00:01:44.390> pops<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.570> ear<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
going past the ear pops the ear in the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.690 
going past the ear pops the ear in the
nose<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.439> right<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.009> focus<00:01:47.340> point<00:01:47.579> so

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
nose and right up to that focus point so

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.819 
nose and right up to that focus point so
don't<00:01:47.850> don't<00:01:48.270> suddenly<00:01:48.689> cut<00:01:48.869> corners<00:01:49.229> right

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
don't don't suddenly cut corners right

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.950 
don't don't suddenly cut corners right
that'll<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:50.369> some<00:01:50.520> trouble<00:01:50.820> try<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.659> really

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
that'll get some trouble try to really

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.840 
that'll get some trouble try to really
go<00:01:52.140> through<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.409> same<00:01:52.619> movement<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.460> focus

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
go through the same movement and focus

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.630 
go through the same movement and focus
on<00:01:53.939> what<00:01:54.030> your<00:01:54.149> arm<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.630> doing<00:01:54.780> not<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.140> point

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
the play will follow your arm so I can I

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.800 
the play will follow your arm so I can I
mean<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.270> practice<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.750> lot<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.229> course<00:02:01.500> it
