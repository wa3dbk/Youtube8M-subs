00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.060
 Sinister

 have a thousand dollars in titles paying 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.760

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.809
 however this loan had a 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.809
 trap 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.570

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.160
 bird loose rockefeller and his coleguis 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.200
 they silently withdrew from the bag 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.110

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.110
 claim the loans en masse go what 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.810
 chance this caused instantly 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.930
 a massive sale in the market given that 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.790
 everyone had to cover their loans 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.539

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.840
 ridiculous and to me that all this sounds to me 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.840
 Of something 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.939

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.550

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.740
 I found this on the wikipedia 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.700
 and here put that long since 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.700
