00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
don't know something about it kind of

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.490 
don't know something about it kind of
bugs<00:02:42.720> me<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:43.260> guess<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:46.250> coyote<00:02:47.250> on<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.959> angle

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
bugs me I guess a coyote on the angle

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.920 
bugs me I guess a coyote on the angle
you<00:02:49.709> look<00:02:49.740> at<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.550> from<00:02:51.330> because<00:02:51.750> obviously

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
you look at it from because obviously

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.030 
you look at it from because obviously
supposed<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.770> be<00:02:52.890> looking<00:02:53.040> down<00:02:53.250> on<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:54.000> but<00:02:54.360> I

supposed to be looking down on you but I
don't<00:02:56.040> know<00:02:57.320> but<00:02:58.320> yeah<00:02:59.220> that's<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:02.670> base

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.400 

again<00:03:07.340> pretty<00:03:08.340> cool<00:03:08.640> base<00:03:08.880> it's<00:03:09.239> got<00:03:09.480> Susanoo

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
again pretty cool base it's got Susanoo

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.110 
again pretty cool base it's got Susanoo
on<00:03:10.890> there<00:03:12.709> so<00:03:13.709> that's<00:03:13.950> pretty<00:03:14.250> awesome<00:03:14.340> again

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
on there so that's pretty awesome again

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.670 
on there so that's pretty awesome again
it<00:03:15.330> is<00:03:15.480> still<00:03:15.870> really<00:03:17.600> really<00:03:18.600> big<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:19.170> mean<00:03:19.410> if

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
it is still really really big I mean if

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.250 
it is still really really big I mean if
you<00:03:19.860> look<00:03:20.070> at<00:03:20.310> how<00:03:20.970> much<00:03:21.209> space<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.900> actual

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
you look at how much space the actual

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.280 
you look at how much space the actual
failure<00:03:22.680> takes<00:03:22.950> up<00:03:23.250> off<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.640> base<00:03:24.110> it's<00:03:25.110> quite

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
failure takes up off the base it's quite

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.310 
failure takes up off the base it's quite
a<00:03:25.350> bit<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.709> space<00:03:26.690> unfortunately<00:03:27.690> though<00:03:27.989> he

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
a bit of space unfortunately though he

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.100 
a bit of space unfortunately though he
doesn't<00:03:28.640> stand<00:03:29.640> on<00:03:30.060> his<00:03:30.360> own<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:32.630> it's<00:03:33.630> kind

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
doesn't stand on his own and it's kind

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.670 
doesn't stand on his own and it's kind
of<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.350> worst<00:03:35.209> possible<00:03:36.209> way<00:03:36.600> to<00:03:36.780> not<00:03:37.290> stand

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
of the worst possible way to not stand

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.400 
of the worst possible way to not stand
by<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.430> he<00:03:38.700> means<00:03:38.910> forward<00:03:39.660> so<00:03:40.020> you<00:03:40.080> can't

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
by that he means forward so you can't

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.570 
by that he means forward so you can't
really<00:03:40.500> leave

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
really leave

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.120 
really leave
and<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:42.360> back<00:03:42.660> of<00:03:42.960> your<00:03:43.110> bookshelf<00:03:43.890> or

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
and the back of your bookshelf or

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.570 
and the back of your bookshelf or
whatever<00:03:45.110> so<00:03:46.460> you<00:03:47.460> have<00:03:47.580> to<00:03:48.440> kind<00:03:49.440> of<00:03:49.650> be

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
whatever so you have to kind of be

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.930 
whatever so you have to kind of be
tricky<00:03:51.180> if<00:03:51.210> you<00:03:51.570> want<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:52.760> display<00:03:53.760> them
