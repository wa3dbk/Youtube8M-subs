crumbling<00:00:37.250> whatever<00:00:37.700> so<00:00:38.540> this<00:00:39.380> is<00:00:39.560> the<00:00:39.710> pest

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
crumbling whatever so this is the pest

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
the way that it has been built is really

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.950 
the way that it has been built is really
nice<00:00:42.950> there's<00:00:43.310> only<00:00:43.520> two<00:00:43.940> pieces<00:00:44.570> that<00:00:44.810> have

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
nice there's only two pieces that have

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.590 
nice there's only two pieces that have
been<00:00:45.140> welded<00:00:45.350> together<00:00:45.739> really<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:46.600> that

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
bottle jet to do that it comes with a

handle and in this case my handle

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.089 
handle and in this case my handle
actually<00:02:27.489> came<00:02:28.030> as<00:02:28.239> a<00:02:28.299> two-part<00:02:29.140> piece<00:02:29.470> where

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
actually came as a two-part piece where

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.880 
actually came as a two-part piece where
I<00:02:30.129> could<00:02:30.579> then<00:02:30.730> extend<00:02:31.450> this<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.650> have

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
I could then extend this and I have

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.309 
I could then extend this and I have
actually<00:02:33.159> some<00:02:33.640> more<00:02:33.790> leverage<00:02:34.299> where<00:02:34.870> I<00:02:34.900> can

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
actually some more leverage where I can

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.300 
actually some more leverage where I can
then<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:36.599> raise<00:02:37.599> and<00:02:37.870> lower<00:02:37.900> faster<00:02:38.769> if<00:02:39.069> I

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
then I raise and lower faster if I

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.110 
then I raise and lower faster if I
needed<00:02:39.519> to<00:02:40.409> so<00:02:41.409> to<00:02:41.470> raise<00:02:41.920> this<00:02:42.310> what<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:42.819> would

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
needed to so to raise this what I would

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.869 
needed to so to raise this what I would
do<00:02:43.269> is<00:02:43.420> just<00:02:43.450> come<00:02:43.840> in<00:02:43.989> here<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.890> slowly<00:02:45.489> but

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
do is just come in here and slowly but

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.050 
do is just come in here and slowly but
surely<00:02:45.909> add<00:02:46.769> more<00:02:47.769> pressure<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:49.030> can

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
surely add more pressure and you can

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.000 
surely add more pressure and you can
might<00:02:49.840> be<00:02:50.019> able<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.290> see<00:02:50.440> this<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.769> don't<00:02:50.950> know

it's<00:02:51.190> not<00:02:51.340> going<00:02:51.909> too<00:02:52.209> fast<00:02:52.510> but<00:02:53.379> the<00:02:53.680> RAM<00:02:53.920> here

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340

that<00:03:11.470> you<00:03:11.620> were<00:03:11.769> doing<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:13.450> release<00:03:13.959> the

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
that you were doing to release the

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.740 
that you were doing to release the
pressure<00:03:15.099> from<00:03:15.670> your<00:03:17.370> your<00:03:18.370> bottle<00:03:19.120> jack<00:03:19.419> here

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
pressure from your your bottle jack here

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.599 
pressure from your your bottle jack here
there's<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.349> little<00:03:20.680> release<00:03:21.040> valve<00:03:21.400> and

there's a little release valve and

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.360 
there's a little release valve and
typically<00:03:22.569> you<00:03:23.079> just<00:03:23.319> take<00:03:23.530> your<00:03:23.739> handle<00:03:24.129> it's

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
typically you just take your handle it's

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.180 
typically you just take your handle it's
got<00:03:24.549> a<00:03:24.579> pinched<00:03:25.000> edge<00:03:25.269> put<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:26.230> back<00:03:26.440> on<00:03:26.739> to
