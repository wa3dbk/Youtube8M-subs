00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.360
 I am flo floor tried my recipes today 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.970
 I brought you a recipe that is delicious 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.430
 ideal for breakfast or snack are 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.360
 easy are quick they are fluffy to me 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.369
 I love them they finished and they are accompanied by 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.820
 jam that we are also going to learn to 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.079
 do 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.079
 they are called hot cakes 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.730
 these are the hot cakes that we are going to 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.520
 prepare what do you think if I started 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.620
 let's prepare the dough to start 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.660
 we beat the egg whites until riding with a 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.700
 little sugar and add the yolks 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.700
 and the rest of the sugar we mix 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.160
 we mix soft so you have a lot 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.469
 air this preparation and the hot cakes 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.469
 fit well it comes with 2 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.440
 it's very easy to memorize now 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.150
 we add a cup of milk and a cup 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.740
 from flour to flour you have to add 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.080
 2 teaspoons of the baking powder 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.590
 Easy to memorize a cup and a cup 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.960
 add again, do not forget to add the 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.330
 baking powder to flour we mix 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.159
 and we add it to the preparation I'm going to 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.830
 put half to incorporate 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.289
 better and this added half the cup 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.289
 of milk now if we keep mixing 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.660
 now we incorporate the rest of the flour 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.440
 and milk 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.440
 we keep mixing 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.960
 finally I will add the butter is 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.240
 important that it's melted so that 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.520
 was incorporated well added in the form of 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.070
 thread and I'm mixing so we do not lower the 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.020
 preparation I'm ready to start 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.820
 to cook our hot cakes of accounts 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.590
 where are we going to use them for that I have the 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.300
 Teflon pan that can be a 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.160
 pan or a bread you want is very 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.410
 important so they do not stick to you 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.030
 cooking we put them in a pan of 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.970
 Teflon a little plant spray 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.670
 add a spoonful of the mixture 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.020
 we spread we hope that the 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.729
 borders 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.489
 Now it's time to go around 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.879
 See how we lasted edges 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.879
 turns 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.890
 it was time to make our 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.600
 jams I tell you that your elegy is 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.730
 speaks of red fruits but following 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.890
 all the steps you can make it taste 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.020
 that you like the first thing that I'm going to 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.360
 do is add the sugar to the fruits 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.350
 reds I'm not going to let you marinate for 3 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.350
 hours in the refrigerator 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.370
 after three hours of maceration 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.970
 look how you have to stay 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.530
 lengthen a lot of games like this but now 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.390
 what do you think we already took it to 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.270
 cooking this I'm going to do in a 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.650
 pan over medium heat until the 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.650
 texture we like 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.040
 we are very careful never to put 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.220
 strong photos because you can burn from 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.410
 a very easy way 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.770
 I show you how we have left the sea veiled 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.380
 this is the point look 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.620
 so it has to stay and then it 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.620
 cool 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.299
 and ready our hot is ready 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.299
 cakes 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.250
 what did you think I love them and 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.470
 I hope that you too and remember that 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.690
 if you like to cook very easy recipes 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.200
 although sweet there are a lot of videos 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.200
 over here 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.980
