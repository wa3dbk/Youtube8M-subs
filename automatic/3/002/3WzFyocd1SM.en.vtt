00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
for each class but the nice thing about

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.510 
for each class but the nice thing about
is<00:01:36.700> that<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:38.020> doesn't<00:01:38.770> matter<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.159> gall<00:01:39.340> those

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
is that it doesn't matter the gall those

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.260 
is that it doesn't matter the gall those
classes<00:01:40.119> I<00:01:41.399> mean<00:01:42.399> all<00:01:42.520> those<00:01:42.640> four<00:01:42.880> characters

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
classes I mean all those four characters

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.089 
classes I mean all those four characters
share<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.899> same<00:01:44.049> level<00:01:44.289> so<00:01:44.590> it<00:01:44.920> doesn't

00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:45.099 
share the same level so it doesn't

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:48.120 
share the same level so it doesn't
matter<00:01:45.220> who<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:45.580> use<00:01:46.259> you'll<00:01:47.259> still<00:01:47.560> gain

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
matter who you use you'll still gain

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.499 
matter who you use you'll still gain
experience<00:01:48.640> in<00:01:48.670> that<00:01:48.819> class<00:01:49.030> that<00:01:49.060> everybody

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
experience in that class that everybody

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:56.520 
experience in that class that everybody
else<00:01:49.659> shares<00:01:49.959> and<00:01:53.670> there<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:54.819> go<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:56.380> only

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
else shares and there you go the only

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.839 
else shares and there you go the only
difference<00:01:56.709> is<00:01:56.920> that<00:01:56.979> you<00:01:57.280> know<00:01:57.369> each<00:01:57.580> of<00:01:57.729> them

00:01:57.839 --> 00:01:57.849 
difference is that you know each of them

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:59.449 
difference is that you know each of them
have<00:01:57.970> their<00:01:58.000> own<00:01:58.149> specific<00:01:58.390> abilities<00:01:58.869> so

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
have their own specific abilities so

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:02.370 
have their own specific abilities so
level<00:02:00.459> up<00:02:00.549> all<00:02:00.670> your<00:02:00.789> classes<00:02:01.360> you<00:02:02.259> know

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
level up all your classes you know

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.330 
level up all your classes you know
because<00:02:02.560> you<00:02:02.649> never<00:02:02.770> know<00:02:02.890> when<00:02:03.069> you<00:02:03.159> need<00:02:03.189> to

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
because you never know when you need to

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.639 
because you never know when you need to
switch<00:02:03.729> up<00:02:03.759> a<00:02:04.030> class<00:02:04.240> to<00:02:04.780> even<00:02:05.049> things<00:02:05.289> up<00:02:05.439> and

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
switch up a class to even things up and

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:06.660
