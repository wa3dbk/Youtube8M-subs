techniques to get the best Kate

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.330 
techniques to get the best Kate
basically<00:00:17.109> we're<00:00:17.260> using<00:00:17.380> epics<00:00:17.800> home<00:00:17.949> vision

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
basically we're using epics home vision

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.130 
basically we're using epics home vision
lab<00:00:18.460> studio<00:00:18.880> software<00:00:19.180> to<00:00:19.720> do<00:00:20.050> the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
lab studio software to do the

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.500 
lab studio software to do the
compositing<00:00:20.770> the<00:00:21.340> effects<00:00:21.699> and<00:00:21.970> muzzle

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
compositing the effects and muzzle

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.810 
compositing the effects and muzzle
flashes<00:00:22.960> and<00:00:23.140> but<00:00:23.920> this<00:00:24.039> all<00:00:24.310> these<00:00:24.519> effects

flashes and but this all these effects
can<00:00:24.910> be<00:00:25.000> accomplished<00:00:25.539> using<00:00:25.600> the

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
can be accomplished using the

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.080 
can be accomplished using the
combination<00:00:26.230> of<00:00:26.710> composite<00:00:27.340> lab<00:00:27.490> pro<00:00:27.820> and

combination of composite lab pro and
effects<00:00:28.449> lab<00:00:28.660> pro<00:00:29.019> I've<00:00:29.710> basically<00:00:30.099> just

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
effects lab pro I've basically just

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.220 
effects lab pro I've basically just
imported<00:00:31.029> our<00:00:31.210> source<00:00:31.570> footage<00:00:31.869> with<00:00:32.140> the

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
imported our source footage with the

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.380 
imported our source footage with the
green<00:00:32.470> screen<00:00:32.500> and<00:00:32.980> I<00:00:33.790> have<00:00:33.940> adjusted<00:00:34.360> the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
green screen and I have adjusted the

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.450 
green screen and I have adjusted the
canvas<00:00:34.870> side<00:00:35.110> to<00:00:35.290> be<00:00:35.410> able<00:00:35.559> to<00:00:35.649> size<00:00:36.100> to<00:00:36.340> be

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
canvas side to be able to size to be

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.880 
canvas side to be able to size to be
able<00:00:36.489> to<00:00:36.700> see<00:00:36.880> the<00:00:37.030> entire<00:00:37.149> clip<00:00:37.770> now<00:00:38.770> I've

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
able to see the entire clip now I've

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.560 
able to see the entire clip now I've
gone<00:00:39.040> on<00:00:39.280> to<00:00:39.430> the<00:00:39.520> left<00:00:39.879> side<00:00:40.059> of<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.239> timeline

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
gone on to the left side of the timeline

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.650 
gone on to the left side of the timeline
and<00:00:41.129> selected<00:00:42.129> garbage<00:00:42.670> matte<00:00:42.910> under<00:00:43.329> the<00:00:43.450> mat

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
and selected garbage matte under the mat

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.590 
and selected garbage matte under the mat
na<00:00:43.989> heading<00:00:44.500> and<00:00:44.649> I've<00:00:45.520> just<00:00:45.550> decided<00:00:46.149> to<00:00:46.360> drag

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
na heading and I've just decided to drag

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.240 
na heading and I've just decided to drag
them<00:00:46.840> off<00:00:46.989> to<00:00:47.200> on<00:00:47.379> the<00:00:47.590> side<00:00:47.800> there<00:00:48.039> to

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
them off to on the side there to

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.340 
them off to on the side there to
eliminate<00:00:48.910> the<00:00:49.090> spots<00:00:49.390> that<00:00:49.510> we<00:00:49.660> do<00:00:49.809> not<00:00:49.899> need

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
eliminate the spots that we do not need

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.639 
eliminate the spots that we do not need
in<00:00:50.620> our<00:00:50.739> final<00:00:51.070> video<00:00:51.760> clip<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:53.379> basically

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
in our final video clip so basically

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:54.750 
in our final video clip so basically
this<00:00:53.800> is<00:00:53.890> going<00:00:54.070> to<00:00:54.129> leave<00:00:54.250> us<00:00:54.280> with<00:00:54.550> a

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
this is going to leave us with a

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.150 
this is going to leave us with a
rectangular<00:00:55.420> space<00:00:56.170> with<00:00:56.500> just<00:00:56.680> the<00:00:56.800> actor

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
rectangular space with just the actor

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.520 
rectangular space with just the actor
and<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.399> green<00:00:57.910> screen<00:00:58.180> our<00:00:58.660> clip<00:00:59.199> is<00:00:59.320> very

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
and the green screen our clip is very

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.959 
and the green screen our clip is very
short<00:00:59.800> it's<00:00:59.949> only<00:01:00.100> two<00:01:00.280> or<00:01:00.399> three<00:01:00.579> seconds

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
short it's only two or three seconds

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.900 
short it's only two or three seconds
long<00:01:01.180> but<00:01:01.930> it's<00:01:02.170> going<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.410> vary<00:01:03.129> listen<00:01:03.670> show

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
long but it's going to vary listen show

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.480 
long but it's going to vary listen show
us<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.260> techniques<00:01:05.260> very<00:01:05.590> well<00:01:05.799> on<00:01:06.100> how<00:01:06.430> to

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
us the techniques very well on how to

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.880 
us the techniques very well on how to
accomplish<00:01:06.880> in<00:01:07.750> effect<00:01:08.049> and<00:01:08.500> they<00:01:08.619> can<00:01:08.770> all<00:01:08.860> be

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
accomplish in effect and they can all be

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.910 
accomplish in effect and they can all be
applied<00:01:09.280> to<00:01:09.549> a<00:01:09.580> larger<00:01:10.240> production<00:01:10.920> so

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
applied to a larger production so

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.830 
applied to a larger production so
basically<00:01:12.430> I'm<00:01:12.700> just<00:01:12.760> adjusting<00:01:13.180> it<00:01:13.630> here

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
basically I'm just adjusting it here

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.929 
basically I'm just adjusting it here
it's<00:01:14.229> a<00:01:14.290> little<00:01:14.500> difficult<00:01:14.710> I've<00:01:15.070> got<00:01:15.340> I'm<00:01:15.760> on

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
it's a little difficult I've got I'm on

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.340 
it's a little difficult I've got I'm on
a<00:01:15.970> different<00:01:16.299> computer<00:01:16.360> in<00:01:16.780> my<00:01:16.869> primary

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
a different computer in my primary

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.620 
a different computer in my primary
editing<00:01:17.890> desktop<00:01:18.310> so<00:01:18.880> it<00:01:19.000> has<00:01:19.119> a<00:01:19.150> laptop

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
editing desktop so it has a laptop

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.120 
editing desktop so it has a laptop
trackpad<00:01:20.200> on<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:21.119> multimedia<00:01:22.290> keyboard<00:01:23.290> so

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
trackpad on the multimedia keyboard so

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.770 
trackpad on the multimedia keyboard so
it's<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.340> little<00:01:24.430> bit<00:01:24.549> of<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.729> pain<00:01:24.939> but<00:01:25.270> we'll

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
it's a little bit of a pain but we'll

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.679 
it's a little bit of a pain but we'll
manage<00:01:26.250> now<00:01:27.250> I<00:01:27.280> have<00:01:27.520> gone<00:01:27.670> under<00:01:28.000> key<00:01:28.360> grade

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
manage now I have gone under key grade

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.410 
manage now I have gone under key grade
and<00:01:28.960> I<00:01:29.439> have<00:01:29.560> selected<00:01:30.090> saturation<00:01:31.090> and<00:01:31.240> have

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
and I have selected saturation and have

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.569 
and I have selected saturation and have
just<00:01:31.600> raised<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:32.020> saturation<00:01:32.740> a<00:01:32.829> bit<00:01:32.979> don't

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
just raised the saturation a bit don't

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.850 
just raised the saturation a bit don't
worry<00:01:33.759> if<00:01:33.939> your<00:01:34.090> actor<00:01:34.479> and<00:01:34.720> green<00:01:35.590> screen

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
worry if your actor and green screen

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.530 
worry if your actor and green screen
looks<00:01:36.040> a<00:01:36.159> little<00:01:36.280> bit<00:01:36.460> strange<00:01:36.850> because<00:01:37.299> this

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
looks a little bit strange because this

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.120 
looks a little bit strange because this
will<00:01:37.659> be<00:01:37.780> corrected<00:01:38.020> as<00:01:38.350> we<00:01:38.500> continue<00:01:38.950> in<00:01:39.040> the

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
will be corrected as we continue in the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.190 
will be corrected as we continue in the
tutorial<00:01:39.460> so<00:01:40.240> now<00:01:40.360> I've<00:01:40.509> gone<00:01:40.689> under<00:01:40.960> key

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
tutorial so now I've gone under key

tutorial so now I've gone under key
selected<00:01:41.920> color<00:01:42.189> difference<00:01:42.610> set<00:01:43.119> it<00:01:43.210> to

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
selected color difference set it to

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.280 
selected color difference set it to
green<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:43.810> i<00:01:44.020> have<00:01:44.200> now<00:01:44.740> lowered<00:01:45.189> the<00:01:45.399> white

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
green and i have now lowered the white

involved<00:03:36.060> these<00:03:36.299> are<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.570> liars<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:37.620> they're

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
involved these are the liars so they're

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.800 
involved these are the liars so they're
all<00:03:37.980> even<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.400> our<00:03:38.730> green<00:03:39.060> screen<00:03:39.390> clip<00:03:39.420> which

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
all even to our green screen clip which

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.259 
all even to our green screen clip which
is<00:03:40.489> 1.17<00:03:42.320> it<00:03:43.320> was<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:44.250> duration<00:03:44.940> on<00:03:45.060> that

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
is 1.17 it was the the duration on that

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.880 
is 1.17 it was the the duration on that
and<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:45.870> has<00:03:45.989> to<00:03:46.019> do<00:03:46.200> with<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.440> frame<00:03:46.709> rate

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
and it has to do with the frame rate

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.400 
and it has to do with the frame rate
which<00:03:47.130> was<00:03:47.280> 24<00:03:47.880> frames<00:03:48.150> per<00:03:48.269> second<00:03:48.780> in<00:03:48.959> 1080p

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
which was 24 frames per second in 1080p

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.590 
which was 24 frames per second in 1080p
see<00:03:50.340> I've<00:03:50.519> gone<00:03:50.640> under<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:51.090> effects<00:03:51.390> tab

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
see I've gone under the effects tab

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.870

selected<00:03:52.470> muzzle<00:03:52.769> flashes<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.370> chosen<00:03:53.579> one

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
selected muzzle flashes and chosen one

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.750 
selected muzzle flashes and chosen one
of<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.120> assault<00:03:54.570> rifle<00:03:54.660> flames<00:03:55.640> that'll<00:03:56.640> look

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
of the assault rifle flames that'll look

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.240 
of the assault rifle flames that'll look
really<00:03:56.819> good<00:03:57.150> with<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.329> m16<00:03:57.959> assault<00:03:58.440> rifle

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
really good with the m16 assault rifle

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.309 
really good with the m16 assault rifle
so<00:03:59.790> I've<00:03:59.910> just<00:03:59.940> used<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.510> emitter<00:04:00.840> properties

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
so I've just used the emitter properties

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.770 
so I've just used the emitter properties
to<00:04:01.530> do<00:04:01.650> I<00:04:01.680> get<00:04:01.950> in<00:04:02.100> front<00:04:02.310> of<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.549> gun<00:04:02.780> where

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
to do I get in front of the gun where

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.199 
to do I get in front of the gun where
we'd<00:04:03.930> like<00:04:04.079> to<00:04:04.350> have<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.920> muzzle<00:04:05.250> flash<00:04:05.280> one

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
we'd like to have the muzzle flash one

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.120 
we'd like to have the muzzle flash one
thing<00:04:06.329> that<00:04:06.450> we<00:04:06.510> forgot<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:06.810> do<00:04:07.049> in<00:04:07.260> production

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
thing that we forgot to do in production

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.729 
thing that we forgot to do in production
was<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.640> have<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.420> light<00:04:09.720> flash<00:04:10.049> on<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.380> actor

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
was to have a light flash on the actor

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.500 
was to have a light flash on the actor
where<00:04:11.160> we<00:04:11.310> wanted<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:11.760> muzzle<00:04:12.060> flash<00:04:12.090> to

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
where we wanted the muzzle flash to

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.530 
where we wanted the muzzle flash to
begin<00:04:13.100> just<00:04:14.100> add<00:04:14.310> more<00:04:14.519> of<00:04:14.639> a<00:04:14.730> realism<00:04:15.090> in

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
begin just add more of a realism in

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.300 
begin just add more of a realism in
which<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:16.019> muzzle<00:04:16.440> flash<00:04:16.470> of<00:04:16.859> light<00:04:17.039> up<00:04:17.190> the

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
which the muzzle flash of light up the

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.940 
which the muzzle flash of light up the
environment<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.030> actor<00:04:18.450> behind<00:04:19.049> it<00:04:19.200> but

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
environment and the actor behind it but

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.009 
environment and the actor behind it but
this<00:04:20.519> is<00:04:20.579> mostly<00:04:20.970> done<00:04:21.150> for<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.450> compositing

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
this is mostly done for the compositing

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.930 
this is mostly done for the compositing
techniques<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.740> not<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:23.550> much<00:04:23.610> for<00:04:23.880> the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
techniques and not so much for the

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.170 
techniques and not so much for the
effect<00:04:24.330> so<00:04:24.990> we've<00:04:25.110> gone<00:04:25.229> under<00:04:25.500> grade<00:04:25.860> and

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
effect so we've gone under grade and

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.710 
effect so we've gone under grade and
selected<00:04:27.180> born

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
selected born

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.470 
selected born
identity<00:04:28.230> grading<00:04:29.190> which<00:04:29.340> adds<00:04:29.820> a<00:04:30.030> darker

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
identity grading which adds a darker

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.550 
identity grading which adds a darker
blue<00:04:30.870> tint<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.180> clip<00:04:33.510> I'm<00:04:34.350> just

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
blue tint to the to the clip I'm just

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.410 
blue tint to the to the clip I'm just
gonna<00:04:34.740> adjust<00:04:35.100> to<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.520> color<00:04:35.760> and<00:04:35.970> intensity

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
gonna adjust to the color and intensity

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.380 
gonna adjust to the color and intensity
properties<00:04:37.490> just<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.610> make<00:04:38.730> it<00:04:38.760> look<00:04:38.910> a<00:04:39.150> little

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
properties just to make it look a little

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.990 
properties just to make it look a little
bit<00:04:39.600> lighter<00:04:40.070> a<00:04:41.070> little<00:04:41.250> bit<00:04:41.610> more<00:04:41.790> of<00:04:41.910> a

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
bit lighter a little bit more of a

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.880 
bit lighter a little bit more of a
greenish<00:04:42.450> blue<00:04:42.780> instead<00:04:43.260> of<00:04:43.410> just<00:04:43.590> bright

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
greenish blue instead of just bright

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.000 
greenish blue instead of just bright
blue<00:04:44.180> so<00:04:45.180> in<00:04:45.960> here<00:04:46.260> we<00:04:46.290> distract<00:04:46.770> at<00:04:46.920> the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
blue so in here we distract at the

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.130 
blue so in here we distract at the
beginning<00:04:47.310> of<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.640> clip<00:04:47.850> we've<00:04:48.510> changed<00:04:48.900> the

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
beginning of the clip we've changed the

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.340 
beginning of the clip we've changed the
duration<00:04:50.040> to<00:04:50.250> 1.17<00:04:51.180> again<00:04:51.540> to<00:04:51.840> match<00:04:52.020> our

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
duration to 1.17 again to match our

duration to 1.17 again to match our
source<00:04:52.860> media<00:04:53.280> and<00:04:53.490> now<00:04:54.270> you<00:04:54.330> can<00:04:54.540> see<00:04:54.690> it<00:04:54.780> all
