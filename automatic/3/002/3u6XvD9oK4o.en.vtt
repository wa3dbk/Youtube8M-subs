00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.450
 and that coffee has to be cold because 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.020
 it has to be cold we can save it all 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.170
 buying refrigerator or refrigerator 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.080

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.120
 right flavor in our life then 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.420

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:55.300
 teaspoons of sugar initial bonus without 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:55.300
 sugar if they had sugar 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.010
 today we put them 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.630
 two ounces of pisco any kind of 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.170
 pisco but that is pisco peruano 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.170
 already 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.480
 I do not call it lemon, it was lemon 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.790
 to alter the taste of coffee what 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.430
 We need you to be dominated by coffee 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.810
 if we lick lemon walter starts in 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.790
 that lemon does not help to predominate 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.959
 flavors we harvest the ice 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.959
 the five games 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.650
 and that is some 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.069
 we have egg whites then 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.760
 we have already 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.599
 from the block 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.209
 the coffee if you like where it can be with 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.760
 coffee liqueur if they did not have pisco 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.950
 you can pour pisco coffee liqueur and 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.709
 but the same ingredients the I'm 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.510
 setting to establish then we can 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.510
 make our young 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.389
 then we go one more lap 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.990
 and so 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.319
 and we proceed to make video 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.070
 we proceed to serve our shower and the 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.070
 coffee 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:04.300
 and go have coffee flavor 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.960
 let's hope it's done now let's 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.110
 put a little detail 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.690
 ah 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.910
 when we serve, try not to serve 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.940
 very well because he told them at the time of 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.530
 drink no no we do not enjoy which 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.140
 I would lie that's why it's usually the 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.410
 glasses are suddenly served to a point 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:27.530
 half already then let's hope that saying is 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.840
 sacred also some suggestions that 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.320
 we give them we do not see a new sequence 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.480
 of recipes and your Peruvian cuisine puntocom 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.600
 then there we have our taste of 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.600
 coffee
