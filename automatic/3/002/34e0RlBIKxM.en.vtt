of<00:03:03.860> course<00:03:04.100> you<00:03:04.190> can<00:03:04.310> screw<00:03:04.489> it<00:03:04.610> off<00:03:04.730> is<00:03:05.000> that's

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
of course you can screw it off is that's

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.550 
of course you can screw it off is that's
pen<00:03:06.940> screw<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.180> then<00:03:08.329> on<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.989> bottom<00:03:09.109> BB

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
pen screw and then on the bottom BB

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.890 
pen screw and then on the bottom BB
that's<00:03:09.950> where<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.220> primer<00:03:10.430> will<00:03:10.640> be<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.750> this

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
that's where the primer will be and this

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.380 
that's where the primer will be and this
is<00:03:12.079> a<00:03:12.109> super<00:03:12.980> glue<00:03:13.390> cap<00:03:14.769> yeah<00:03:15.769> so<00:03:16.040> this<00:03:16.850> one<00:03:17.120> you

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
is a super glue cap yeah so this one you

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.060 
is a super glue cap yeah so this one you
can<00:03:17.750> actually<00:03:17.870> take<00:03:18.200> it<00:03:18.230> up<00:03:18.440> are<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:18.799> you<00:03:18.890> pull

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
can actually take it up are so you pull

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.420 
can actually take it up are so you pull
that<00:03:19.190> pin<00:03:19.400> out<00:03:19.519> there<00:03:19.850> goes<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.390> spring<00:03:21.430> this

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
that pin out there goes to spring this

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
that pin out there goes to spring this
is<00:03:22.579> basically<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.180> striker<00:03:23.570> in<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.440> spring

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
is basically the striker in the spring

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.180 
is basically the striker in the spring
which<00:03:26.450> I'm<00:03:26.720> not<00:03:26.900> sure<00:03:27.079> where<00:03:27.290> I<00:03:27.320> got<00:03:27.500> it<00:03:27.590> from<00:03:27.620> I

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
which I'm not sure where I got it from I

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.880 
which I'm not sure where I got it from I
think<00:03:29.030> is<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.390> video<00:03:29.660> tape<00:03:29.930> yeah<00:03:30.560> video

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
think is that the video tape yeah video

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.740 
think is that the video tape yeah video
T<00:03:31.130> spring<00:03:32.470> so<00:03:33.470> there<00:03:33.680> that<00:03:34.250> goes<00:03:34.430> together

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
T spring so there that goes together

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.009 
T spring so there that goes together
somehow<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:37.180> actually<00:03:38.180> have<00:03:38.299> a<00:03:38.329> whip<00:03:38.570> link<00:03:38.840> to

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
somehow and actually have a whip link to

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.470 
somehow and actually have a whip link to
it<00:03:39.170> so<00:03:39.380> I'll<00:03:39.890> probably<00:03:40.850> put<00:03:41.090> that<00:03:41.150> up<00:03:41.450> there

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
it so I'll probably put that up there

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.770 
it so I'll probably put that up there
too<00:03:41.840> so<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:42.769> guys<00:03:42.799> can<00:03:43.100> see<00:03:43.340> how<00:03:43.489> it<00:03:43.640> works<00:03:43.850> so

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
too so you guys can see how it works so

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.750 
too so you guys can see how it works so
yeah<00:03:44.930> that's<00:03:45.260> that

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
yeah that's that

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.020 
yeah that's that
and<00:03:46.760> finally<00:03:47.590> my

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
and finally my

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.309 
and finally my
current<00:03:49.330> school<00:03:49.920> project<00:03:50.920> yay<00:03:51.880> I'm<00:03:52.720> making<00:03:53.200> a

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
current school project yay I'm making a

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.080 
current school project yay I'm making a
type<00:03:53.890> seven<00:03:54.330> you<00:03:55.330> vote<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:56.910> there's<00:03:57.910> this

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
type seven you vote and there's this

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.760 
type seven you vote and there's this
schematic<00:03:58.690> that<00:03:58.930> about<00:03:59.410> and<00:04:01.260> since<00:04:02.260> making<00:04:02.530> it

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
schematic that about and since making it

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.610 
schematic that about and since making it
you<00:04:02.860> bow<00:04:03.040> it's<00:04:03.790> kind<00:04:04.090> of<00:04:04.150> plain<00:04:04.630> I<00:04:04.780> decided<00:04:05.410> to

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
you bow it's kind of plain I decided to

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.610 
you bow it's kind of plain I decided to
make<00:04:05.770> it<00:04:05.950> a<00:04:06.069> cutaway<00:04:06.550> so<00:04:07.239> there's<00:04:08.230> some<00:04:08.470> of<00:04:08.560> the

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
make it a cutaway so there's some of the

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.860 
make it a cutaway so there's some of the
inside<00:04:09.010> it's<00:04:09.790> kind<00:04:10.060> of<00:04:10.120> thoughts<00:04:10.330> it's<00:04:10.540> really

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
inside it's kind of thoughts it's really

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.809 
inside it's kind of thoughts it's really
hard<00:04:11.050> to<00:04:11.140> see<00:04:11.290> but<00:04:11.470> I'm<00:04:12.250> going<00:04:12.459> to<00:04:12.489> put<00:04:12.670> little

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
hard to see but I'm going to put little

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.820 
hard to see but I'm going to put little
model<00:04:13.239> lightbulbs<00:04:14.080> in<00:04:14.230> there<00:04:14.380> so<00:04:14.590> it<00:04:14.709> actually

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
model lightbulbs in there so it actually

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.940 
model lightbulbs in there so it actually
lights<00:04:15.130> up<00:04:15.310> inside<00:04:15.730> so<00:04:16.630> yeah<00:04:16.780> I<00:04:17.109> think<00:04:17.739> it's

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
lights up inside so yeah I think it's

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.190 
lights up inside so yeah I think it's
gonna<00:04:18.040> look<00:04:18.130> pretty<00:04:19.290> neat<00:04:20.519> yes

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
gonna look pretty neat yes

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.300 
gonna look pretty neat yes
so<00:04:23.200> yeah<00:04:23.320> that's<00:04:23.530> pretty<00:04:23.710> much<00:04:23.830> it<00:04:24.040> on<00:04:24.160> the

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
so yeah that's pretty much it on the

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.810 
so yeah that's pretty much it on the
update<00:04:25.150> really<00:04:25.980> so<00:04:27.630> stay<00:04:28.630> tuned
