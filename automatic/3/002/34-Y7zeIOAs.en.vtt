 man thanks to the meat 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.860
 the human brain developed when 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.750
 our predecessors added to their 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.730
 diet large amounts of protein 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.720
 that they got from red meat 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.240
 when the salt arrives the sausages are created 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.920
 especially pork chorizo 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.330
 sausages and hams are mentioned in

 canned foods are born in 1795 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.790
 in France in the hands of a pastry chef 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.140
 called nicolás appert who devised a 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.680
 food preservation system 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.260
 as vegetables legumes fruits and for 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.360
 course or meats 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.880
 the valley of bored was for many years 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.800
 from the colony a cattle herd when the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.880
 capital of the province was the city of 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.550
 santafe de antioquia 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.950
 that's why illustrious characters of the 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.900
 nascent villa de Medellin were dedicated 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.460
 to livestock 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.920

 ospina vázquez inherited the tradition 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.900
 livestock of the family and exercised 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.120
 especially in the region to sinú 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.620
 beginning of the 50s acquires some 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.110
 vacant lots on the road that connects 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.580
 to medellín with the municipality of beautiful with 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.710
 the goal of building a factory 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.540
 to industrialize the process of 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.909
 meat in Medellin 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.560
 the name of the company is born as a 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.939
 tribute that its founders decide 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.549
 make it to the region that served 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:37.230
 seat to his livestock activity was 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.420
 inhabited by the tribe of the Hindus 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.269
 whose river was named in their language 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.549
 native as breast the assembly of the new 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.579
 factory was left to eduardo ospina 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.340
 ospina son of don pedro nel who was 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.579
 qualified as the breast brain 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.769
 unfortunately don eduardo dies in 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.389
 1954 and his brother Alberto assumes the 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.280
 mission to complete the installation of the 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.980

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.290
 company that would start producing the 19 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.720
 August 1957 in stores 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.180
 I found cal little pot of Vienna and so not 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.340
 they identified him precisely for that 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.000
 little pot the people in asia if they 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.169
 not already so 50 collaborators 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.870
 materialized the first sausages 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:24.390
 Viennese type and Frankfurt liver pasta 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.200
 devil meat and ham eta 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.640
 when the decade of the 70s arrived 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.030
 chicharrones chorizo ​​sausage 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.200
 brewer and even beans with bacon 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.880
 began to be marketed in a 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.459
 market as traditional as that of 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.010
 Medellin a decade later 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:45.200
 produced about 80 references and its 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.569
 Daily volume was 50 tons 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.209
 It was not the first Colombian company 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.910
 of processed meats in using the packaging 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.160
 vacuum and thermo formed what 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.790
 guaranteed standardization in all 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.019
 its references in 2004 the companies of the 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.000
 food industry group 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.220
 Antioquian businesses unify the 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.590
 business of the branch in the national group 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.209
 of chocolates is not part of the 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.489
 meat business that brings together five 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.680
 companies in the sector between national and 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.239
 international organizations contributing their 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.709
 experience and the variety of 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.290
 products that characterize it 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.750
 the meat business with the national group 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.840
 of chocolates is actually our 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.360
 biggest business besides leader in panama and 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.970
 second in Venezuela therefore has 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.580
 a great international projection with 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.139
 companies in three Latin American countries 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.780
 and more than 40 percent of the market 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.310
 national is not launched to the initiative 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.460
 to have a modern center of 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.620
 research and development 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.569
 issues such as compatibility between 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.940
 product and packaging and analysis 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:48.370
 gastronomic for the design of menus 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.900
 dishes ready for consumption are part 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.000
 of the investigations that the 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.710
 center to feed with confidence has been 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.599
 always our commitment and it will be 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.569
 our commitment to the consumer in 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.970
 if we do not have a packaging site that 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:03.789
 we call white room and in 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.190
 this site we have replicated the safety 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:09.789
 of a surgery room in addition to 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:13.539
 this we have the system of 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:15.669
 ISO9001 quality that guarantees us from 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.169
 the acquisition of the raw material until 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:20.349
 the distribution of the finished product 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.940
 The highest quality standards are 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.800
 does not all have a management model 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.080
 based on the consumer and his 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.389
 satisfaction and that's why all the 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.940
 people company processes technology 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.680
 and infrastructure are at the service of 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.810

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.630
 on stone walls becomes a reality 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.450
 today in an unsuspected way 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.940
 It shows that Colombia is land 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:51.320
 fertile that sustains the ideals more
