00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:09.019 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.629 

putting<00:00:10.019> layers<00:00:10.230> into<00:00:10.740> hair<00:00:10.920> extensions<00:00:11.460> is

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
putting layers into hair extensions is

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.089 
putting layers into hair extensions is
easy<00:00:12.000> if<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.690> follow<00:00:12.719> these<00:00:13.290> simple<00:00:13.679> rules

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
easy if you follow these simple rules

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.430 
easy if you follow these simple rules
the<00:00:15.000> first<00:00:15.240> rule<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.570> remember<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:16.080> that

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
the first rule to remember is that

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.800 
the first rule to remember is that
extensions<00:00:16.949> are<00:00:17.190> not<00:00:17.220> put<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.449> same<00:00:18.690> way

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
extensions are not put in the same way

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.990 
extensions are not put in the same way
that<00:00:18.960> natural<00:00:19.109> hair<00:00:19.560> grows<00:00:19.890> they're<00:00:20.699> going<00:00:20.910> to

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
that natural hair grows they're going to

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.420 
that natural hair grows they're going to
be<00:00:21.090> installed<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.689> rows<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.590> if<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.949> cut

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
be installed in rows so if you cut

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.310 
be installed in rows so if you cut
layers<00:00:23.730> as<00:00:24.090> rows<00:00:24.449> they're<00:00:24.779> going<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.050> really

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
layers as rows they're going to really

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.460 
layers as rows they're going to really
stand<00:00:25.680> out<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.550> what<00:00:26.699> we're<00:00:26.820> going<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.060> do<00:00:27.470> is

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
stand out so what we're going to do is

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.710 
stand out so what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:28.710> going<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.920> compensate<00:00:29.310> for<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.730> by

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
we're going to compensate for that by

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.930 
we're going to compensate for that by
finding<00:00:31.470> where<00:00:31.859> we<00:00:31.980> want<00:00:32.189> our<00:00:32.369> layers<00:00:32.640> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
finding where we want our layers to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.090 
finding where we want our layers to
start<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.570> where<00:00:33.870> we<00:00:33.989> want<00:00:34.170> them<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.440> end<00:00:34.620> now

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
start and where we want them to end now

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.650 
start and where we want them to end now
you<00:00:35.160> can<00:00:35.370> see<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.850> hair<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.239> all<00:00:36.450> one

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
you can see that this hair is all one

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.020 
you can see that this hair is all one
length<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.800> we<00:00:37.920> need<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.160> change<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.700> and

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
length so we need to change that and

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.880 
length so we need to change that and
since<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.690> know<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:40.079> need<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.260> fudge<00:00:40.590> in

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
since we know that we need to fudge in

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.619 
since we know that we need to fudge in
the<00:00:40.980> layers<00:00:41.219> we're<00:00:41.760> going<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.969> simply<00:00:42.270> start

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
the layers we're going to simply start

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.860 
the layers we're going to simply start
and<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.710> doesn't<00:00:43.950> matter<00:00:44.070> where<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.340> start

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
and it doesn't matter where you start

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.150 
and it doesn't matter where you start
we're<00:00:45.870> going<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.079> pull<00:00:46.289> up<00:00:46.320> some<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.890> hair

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
we're going to pull up some of that hair

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.850 
we're going to pull up some of that hair
and<00:00:47.510> then<00:00:48.510> we're<00:00:48.629> going<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.840> use<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.320> slide

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
and then we're going to use a slide

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.790 
and then we're going to use a slide
cutting<00:00:50.250> motion<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:51.780> take<00:00:51.989> out<00:00:52.199> some<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.680> that

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
cutting motion to take out some of that

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.420 
cutting motion to take out some of that
hair<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.309> create<00:00:53.730> some<00:00:54.000> false<00:00:54.270> layers<00:00:55.430> now

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
hair and create some false layers now

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.130 
hair and create some false layers now
you're<00:00:56.550> going<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.000> by<00:00:57.180> feel<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.960> can

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
you're going to do this by feel you can

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.260 
you're going to do this by feel you can
start<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.559> see<00:00:58.859> where<00:00:59.579> these<00:00:59.789> layers<00:01:00.030> are

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
start to see where these layers are

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:19.550 
start to see where these layers are
going<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.480> come<00:01:00.719> out

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.170 

layers<00:01:20.560> are<00:01:20.799> all<00:01:20.979> going<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.369> be<00:01:21.460> done<00:01:21.640> by<00:01:21.670> feel

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
layers are all going to be done by feel

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.380 
layers are all going to be done by feel
so<00:01:22.810> make<00:01:22.990> sure<00:01:23.170> that<00:01:23.320> you<00:01:23.439> stop<00:01:23.830> and<00:01:24.159> check<00:01:24.820> to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
so make sure that you stop and check to

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.719 
so make sure that you stop and check to
the<00:01:25.509> side<00:01:25.720> often<00:01:26.229> to<00:01:26.619> see<00:01:26.920> where<00:01:27.369> your<00:01:27.490> layers

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729

are coming in at continue working until

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:40.550 
are coming in at continue working until

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
you have all of your layers in place if

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.440 
you have all of your layers in place if
you've<00:01:41.560> done<00:01:41.830> your<00:01:42.009> layering<00:01:42.220> properly<00:01:43.000> no

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
you've done your layering properly no

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.060 
you've done your layering properly no

matter where you pick up your extensions

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.249

you'll<00:01:45.520> have<00:01:45.700> your<00:01:45.850> shorter<00:01:46.270> ends<00:01:46.630> tapering

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
you'll have your shorter ends tapering

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.410 
you'll have your shorter ends tapering
into<00:01:47.740> your<00:01:47.890> longer<00:01:48.340> ends<00:01:48.670> this<00:01:49.060> should<00:01:49.330> be

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
into your longer ends this should be

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.960 
into your longer ends this should be
consistent<00:01:50.229> all<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.619> way<00:01:50.950> across<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.789> head
