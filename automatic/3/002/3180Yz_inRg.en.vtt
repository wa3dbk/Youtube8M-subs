motor those are located right down in
here<00:00:18.400> there's<00:00:19.050> 401<00:00:20.050> here<00:00:20.380> I've<00:00:20.529> got<00:00:20.710> one<00:00:20.949> off

here there's 401 here I've got one off

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.259 
here there's 401 here I've got one off
another<00:00:21.609> one<00:00:21.730> over<00:00:21.999> here

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:22.269 
another one over here

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.989 
another one over here
I'm<00:00:22.990> working<00:00:23.349> on<00:00:23.409> this<00:00:23.650> one<00:00:23.829> but<00:00:24.159> the

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:24.999 
I'm working on this one but the

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.519 
I'm working on this one but the
underside<00:00:25.449> of<00:00:25.480> this<00:00:25.659> John<00:00:25.929> Deere<00:00:26.140> man<00:00:26.380> this

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
underside of this John Deere man this

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.829 
underside of this John Deere man this
thing's<00:00:26.739> pretty<00:00:27.009> roughed<00:00:27.339> it<00:00:27.519> if<00:00:28.359> you<00:00:28.539> look<00:00:28.720> at

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:28.839 
thing's pretty roughed it if you look at

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:30.499 
thing's pretty roughed it if you look at
this<00:00:28.989> you<00:00:29.499> could<00:00:29.650> just<00:00:29.800> see<00:00:29.949> how<00:00:30.099> the<00:00:30.159> paint

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
this you could just see how the paint

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.450 
this you could just see how the paint
it's<00:00:31.509> just<00:00:31.779> coming<00:00:32.050> off<00:00:32.290> of<00:00:32.349> it<00:00:32.650> in<00:00:32.829> all<00:00:33.310> the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
it's just coming off of it in all the

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.950 
it's just coming off of it in all the
areas<00:00:34.440> which<00:00:35.440> is<00:00:35.620> pretty<00:00:35.890> typical<00:00:36.960> although

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
areas which is pretty typical although

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.040 
areas which is pretty typical although
I've<00:00:38.080> never<00:00:38.110> seen<00:00:38.530> rough<00:00:38.800> this<00:00:39.070> bad<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
I've never seen rough this bad the

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.600 
I've never seen rough this bad the
reason<00:00:41.410> why<00:00:41.560> is<00:00:41.620> all<00:00:41.860> the<00:00:41.950> moisture<00:00:42.400> sits

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
reason why is all the moisture sits

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.430 
reason why is all the moisture sits
under<00:00:42.850> here<00:00:43.000> from<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.300> grass<00:00:43.540> but<00:00:44.260> I've<00:00:44.350> been

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
under here from the grass but I've been

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.400 
under here from the grass but I've been
finding<00:00:44.830> all<00:00:44.950> kinds<00:00:45.340> of<00:00:45.370> things<00:00:45.610> in<00:00:45.790> here

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
finding all kinds of things in here

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.720 
finding all kinds of things in here
around<00:00:47.410> the<00:00:47.590> belts<00:00:48.010> and<00:00:49.680> see<00:00:50.680> what<00:00:50.800> I<00:00:50.920> can<00:00:50.980> find

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
around the belts and see what I can find

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.280 
around the belts and see what I can find
this<00:00:52.480> all<00:00:52.690> needs<00:00:52.870> to<00:00:52.960> be<00:00:53.050> cleaned<00:00:53.410> out<00:00:55.290> nice

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
this all needs to be cleaned out nice

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.560 
this all needs to be cleaned out nice
pine<00:00:56.620> cone

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
so we'll keep pulling the motor okay

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.540 
so we'll keep pulling the motor okay
guys<00:01:02.970> so<00:01:03.240> I<00:01:03.270> got<00:01:03.330> the<00:01:03.660> motor<00:01:03.870> out<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.650> here's

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
guys so I got the motor out and here's

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.810 
guys so I got the motor out and here's
what<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.140> frame<00:01:07.140> looks<00:01:07.380> like<00:01:07.620> without<00:01:07.800> it<00:01:08.010> and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
what the frame looks like without it and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.500 
what the frame looks like without it and
there's<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.170> motor<00:01:10.730> one<00:01:11.730> thing<00:01:11.940> I<00:01:12.060> did<00:01:12.240> notice

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
there's the motor one thing I did notice

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.200 
there's the motor one thing I did notice
when<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.930> was<00:01:13.110> taking<00:01:13.440> this<00:01:13.530> baby<00:01:13.830> out<00:01:14.000> you<00:01:15.000> look

when I was taking this baby out you look
on<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.510> side<00:01:15.750> here<00:01:18.530> right<00:01:19.530> here<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.190> noticed

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
on the side here right here I noticed

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.070 
on the side here right here I noticed
there's<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.050> major<00:01:22.470> crack<00:01:23.270> or<00:01:24.270> something<00:01:24.630> hit

and<00:01:25.850> basically<00:01:26.850> oil<00:01:27.470> coming<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:28.560> all<00:01:28.830> over

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
and basically oil coming out all over

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.340 
and basically oil coming out all over
the<00:01:29.160> place<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.420> was<00:01:30.750> hidden<00:01:30.990> because

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
the place and that was hidden because

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.100 
the place and that was hidden because
the<00:01:31.440> carburetor<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:33.270> throttle<00:01:33.720> actually<00:01:34.080> a

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
the carburetor the throttle actually a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.740 
the carburetor the throttle actually a
throttle<00:01:34.500> assembly<00:01:34.670> is<00:01:35.670> right<00:01:35.940> here<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.660> we

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
throttle assembly is right here so we

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.650 
throttle assembly is right here so we
got<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> problem<00:01:37.410> there<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:39.119> bottom<00:01:39.330> line

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
got a problem there and the bottom line

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.210 
got a problem there and the bottom line
is<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:39.990> whole<00:01:40.200> engine<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.650> gonna<00:01:40.770> have<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.040> be

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
is this whole engine is gonna have to be

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.380 
is this whole engine is gonna have to be
opened<00:01:41.550> up<00:01:41.840> so<00:01:42.840> that's<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.710> next<00:01:43.890> step<00:01:44.390> we'll

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
opened up so that's the next step we'll

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.210 
opened up so that's the next step we'll
wind<00:01:45.600> up<00:01:45.720> doing<00:01:45.900> is<00:01:46.140> we'll<00:01:46.290> take<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.770> crank

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
wind up doing is we'll take the crank

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.670 
wind up doing is we'll take the crank
case<00:01:47.310> away<00:01:48.350> naturally<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.440> motor<00:01:49.680> sits<00:01:51.680> kind

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
case away naturally the motor sits kind

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.719 
case away naturally the motor sits kind
of<00:01:52.800> like<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.390> flat<00:01:54.830> like<00:01:55.830> it<00:01:55.860> was<00:01:56.190> it's<00:01:56.460> lower

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
of like that flat like it was it's lower

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.690 
of like that flat like it was it's lower
half<00:01:57.060> here<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:58.560> see<00:01:58.830> we'll<00:01:59.009> take<00:01:59.220> this<00:01:59.460> off

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
half here and see we'll take this off

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.749 
half here and see we'll take this off
this<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.720> crank<00:02:00.990> case<00:02:01.430> then<00:02:02.430> we<00:02:02.520> got<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
this is the crank case then we got the

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.780 
this is the crank case then we got the
upper<00:02:03.060> cylinder<00:02:03.800> right<00:02:04.800> here<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.490> upper

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
upper cylinder right here and the upper

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.060 
upper cylinder right here and the upper
cylinder<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.330> definitely<00:02:06.780> damaged<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.979> I'm
