00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
some machinery like this air compressor

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.140 
some machinery like this air compressor
that<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.119> bought<00:00:19.490> it's<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.609> three<00:00:20.850> horsepower

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
that I bought it's a three horsepower

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.800 
that I bought it's a three horsepower
Briggs<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.439> Stratton<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:23.539> I<00:00:24.539> put<00:00:24.779> some

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
Briggs and Stratton and I put some

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.890 
Briggs and Stratton and I put some
seafoam<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.980> gasoline<00:00:26.730> put<00:00:27.510> some<00:00:27.689> fresh

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
seafoam in the gasoline put some fresh

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.880 
seafoam in the gasoline put some fresh
gas<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.539> clean<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.689> carburetor<00:00:30.990> it

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
gas in it and clean the carburetor it

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.830 
gas in it and clean the carburetor it
doesn't<00:00:32.250> run<00:00:32.399> perfectly<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.570> runs

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
doesn't run perfectly but it runs

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.950 
doesn't run perfectly but it runs
errands<00:00:34.770> well<00:00:34.980> enough<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.430> compress<00:00:35.820> air<00:00:36.210> it

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
errands well enough to compress air it

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.780 
errands well enough to compress air it
probably<00:00:37.380> could<00:00:37.559> use<00:00:37.590> some<00:00:37.950> more<00:00:38.129> cleaning<00:00:38.399> to

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
probably could use some more cleaning to

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.780 
probably could use some more cleaning to
run<00:00:38.969> even<00:00:39.270> smooth<00:00:39.750> more<00:00:40.230> smoothly<00:00:40.649> but<00:00:41.640> it

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
run even smooth more smoothly but it

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.619 
run even smooth more smoothly but it
does<00:00:41.940> work<00:00:42.149> pretty<00:00:42.450> well<00:00:42.980> it's<00:00:43.980> got<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.600> Popoff

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
does work pretty well it's got a Popoff

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.080 
does work pretty well it's got a Popoff
air<00:00:45.960> valve<00:00:46.289> here<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.840> just<00:00:49.820> releases<00:00:50.820> air

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
air valve here that just releases air

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.610 
air valve here that just releases air
once<00:00:51.360> against<00:00:51.809> 100<00:00:52.230> psi<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.460> then<00:00:54.059> it'll

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
once against 100 psi and then it'll

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.470 
once against 100 psi and then it'll
release<00:00:55.620> air<00:00:55.860> down<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.219> 70<00:00:56.640> psi<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.360> then

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
release air down to 70 psi and then

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.189 
release air down to 70 psi and then
start<00:00:57.780> compressing<00:00:58.199> again<00:00:59.180> now<00:01:00.180> got<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.960> out

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
start compressing again now got this out

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.510 
start compressing again now got this out
here<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> field<00:01:01.859> here<00:01:02.219> because<00:01:02.370> I'm

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the engine about oh I guess it's been

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.190 
the engine about oh I guess it's been
about<00:01:12.659> four<00:01:13.200> years<00:01:13.439> ago<00:01:13.830> now<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.960> it's<00:01:15.960> just

field I'm airing up the tires with the
air<00:01:20.820> compressor<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.720> can<00:01:21.869> hitch<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.229> up<00:01:22.320> to

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
air compressor so it can hitch it up to

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.280 
air compressor so it can hitch it up to
the<00:01:22.770> Dodge<00:01:23.430> van<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.270> tow<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.810> out<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.140> this

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
field and get it back up to work and

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.280 
field and get it back up to work and
work<00:01:27.990> on<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.470> engine<00:01:29.630> it's<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.750> two<00:01:30.960> hundred

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
work on the engine it's a two hundred

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.980 
work on the engine it's a two hundred
and<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.530> cubic<00:01:32.040> inch<00:01:32.570> four-cylinder<00:01:33.570> engine

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
and one cubic inch four-cylinder engine

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.920 
and one cubic inch four-cylinder engine
I'll<00:01:34.860> put<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.220> air<00:01:35.490> cleaner<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.570> think

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
I'll put this air cleaner on it I think

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.910 
I'll put this air cleaner on it I think
it's<00:01:37.079> got<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> Zenith<00:01:37.799> carburetor<00:01:39.920> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
it's got a Zenith carburetor the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.499 
it's got a Zenith carburetor the
generators<00:01:41.460> disconnected<00:01:42.150> it's<00:01:42.299> got<00:01:42.479> a

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
generators disconnected it's got a

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.990 
generators disconnected it's got a
magneto<00:01:43.020> ignition<00:01:43.399> so<00:01:44.399> we<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:44.670> used<00:01:44.909> a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
magneto ignition so we just used a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.450 
magneto ignition so we just used a
12-volt<00:01:45.390> battery<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.560> start<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.009> up<00:01:47.189> and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
12-volt battery on it to start it up and

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.920 
12-volt battery on it to start it up and
then<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.729> doesn't<00:01:47.909> need<00:01:48.149> any<00:01:48.329> electrical

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
then it doesn't need any electrical

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.460 
then it doesn't need any electrical
power<00:01:49.140> from<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> battery<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.890> run<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
power from the battery to run and the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.469 
power from the battery to run and the
starter<00:01:52.920> has<00:01:53.040> been<00:01:53.280> rebuilt<00:01:54.590> need<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> new<00:01:55.890> fuel

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
starter has been rebuilt need a new fuel

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.480 
starter has been rebuilt need a new fuel
glass<00:01:57.479> there

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.540

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.330 
unfortunately that one of the rods
cracked<00:02:19.300> now<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.480> think<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.930> can<00:02:20.140> just<00:02:20.340> replace

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
cracked now I think I can just replace

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.520 
cracked now I think I can just replace
the<00:02:21.760> rod<00:02:23.010> because<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.760> think<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.140> bolts

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
the rod because I think that the bolts

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.170 
the rod because I think that the bolts
weren't<00:02:26.740> put<00:02:26.890> on<00:02:26.920> real<00:02:27.280> good<00:02:27.430> on<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.760> end<00:02:27.940> of

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
weren't put on real good on the end of

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.850 
weren't put on real good on the end of
the<00:02:28.360> bearing<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:28.900> they<00:02:29.050> came<00:02:29.320> off<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.830> the

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
the bearing and they came off and the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.980 
the bearing and they came off and the
rod<00:02:30.070> got<00:02:30.340> loose<00:02:31.350> so<00:02:32.350> I'm<00:02:32.410> gonna<00:02:32.530> try<00:02:32.890> that
