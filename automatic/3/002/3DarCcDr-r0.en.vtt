00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
all right here's a demo of my DM for I'm

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.530 
all right here's a demo of my DM for I'm
actually<00:00:04.170> selling<00:00:04.620> this<00:00:04.859> one<00:00:05.040> on<00:00:05.190> eBay<00:00:05.540> it's

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
actually selling this one on eBay it's

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.950 
actually selling this one on eBay it's
in<00:00:06.810> great<00:00:07.649> shape<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:08.460> usually<00:00:09.240> have<00:00:09.389> it<00:00:09.599> in<00:00:09.840> a

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
in great shape I usually have it in a

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.499 
in great shape I usually have it in a
pedal<00:00:10.320> board<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.860> haven't<00:00:11.670> used<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.969> unit<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.420> a

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
pedal board I haven't used a unit in a

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.270 
pedal board I haven't used a unit in a
couple<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.870> years<00:00:12.990> since<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.440> have<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:13.980> rack

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
couple of years since I have a rack

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.680 
couple of years since I have a rack
system<00:00:14.730> now<00:00:14.960> but<00:00:15.960> it's<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> great<00:00:16.710> unit

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
system now but it's a great unit

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.300 
system now but it's a great unit
so<00:00:18.930> I'll<00:00:19.050> go<00:00:19.170> ahead<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.470> demo<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.949> my<00:00:20.070> box

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
so I'll go ahead and demo it in my box

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.460 
so I'll go ahead and demo it in my box
which<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.359> just<00:00:21.390> using<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.020> brilliant

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
which is just using the brilliant

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.250 
which is just using the brilliant
channel<00:00:23.210> some<00:00:24.210> standard<00:00:24.660> settings<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.199> I

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
channel some standard settings that I

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.330 
channel some standard settings that I
use<00:00:28.130> I'll<00:00:29.130> play<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.880> through<00:00:30.090> my<00:00:30.210> Rickenbacker

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
use I'll play it through my Rickenbacker

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.850 
use I'll play it through my Rickenbacker
so<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.550> my<00:00:32.669> Rickenbacker<00:00:33.120> 360<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.620> is

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
so this is my Rickenbacker 360 this is

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.430 
so this is my Rickenbacker 360 this is
not<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.760> highest<00:00:35.940> gain<00:00:36.329> guitar<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:37.320> a

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
not the highest gain guitar I have a

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.139 
not the highest gain guitar I have a
less<00:00:37.680> foam<00:00:37.950> which<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.160> higher<00:00:38.430> gain<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:38.940> I

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
less foam which is higher gain but I

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.479 
less foam which is higher gain but I
like<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.750> way<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:39.989> one<00:00:40.200> sounds<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:41.340> way<00:00:41.460> I

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
like the way this one sounds the way I

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.330 
like the way this one sounds the way I
have<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.760> set<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.210> up<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.840> ts9<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
have it set it up is like the ts9 on the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.600 
have it set it up is like the ts9 on the
first<00:00:44.610> pedal<00:00:45.140> then<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> more<00:00:46.469> distorted<00:00:46.950> ts9<00:00:47.579> I

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
first pedal then a more distorted ts9 I

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.139 
first pedal then a more distorted ts9 I
think<00:00:48.059> then<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.600> screamer<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.879> I'm<00:00:50.879> sorry

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
think then the screamer and I'm sorry

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.150 
think then the screamer and I'm sorry
the<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> rat<00:00:52.199> pedal<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.829> think<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.129> a

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the like the rat pedal I think is a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.639 
the like the rat pedal I think is a
classic<00:00:53.670> distortion<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.870> then<00:00:55.260> something

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
classic distortion and then something

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.970 
classic distortion and then something
more<00:00:56.270> more<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.449> heavier<00:00:57.870> distortion<00:00:58.500> I'm

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
more more of a heavier distortion I'm

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.799 
more more of a heavier distortion I'm
not<00:00:59.190> really<00:00:59.370> into<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> too<00:01:00.059> heavy<00:01:00.420> metal

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
not really into the too heavy metal

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.219 
not really into the too heavy metal
sounds<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.430> it's<00:01:02.430> not<00:01:02.699> going<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.329> lot

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
sounds so it's not going to be a lot

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.600 
sounds so it's not going to be a lot
distorted<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:04.830> hopefully<00:01:05.159> it'll<00:01:05.309> give<00:01:05.489> you

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
distorted but hopefully it'll give you

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.300 
distorted but hopefully it'll give you
an<00:01:05.909> idea<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.420> range<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.960> effects<00:01:07.350> I'm<00:01:08.070> sure

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
an idea on the range of effects I'm sure

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.580 
an idea on the range of effects I'm sure
you<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.549> find<00:01:08.790> tons<00:01:09.000> more<00:01:09.240> demos<00:01:09.689> but<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.470> is
