00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.369 

okay<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.450> what<00:00:42.660> we're<00:00:42.750> gonna<00:00:42.840> do<00:00:43.050> now<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.230> a

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
okay so what we're gonna do now is a

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.560 
okay so what we're gonna do now is a
spinning<00:00:43.770> hook<00:00:43.890> kick<00:00:43.950> roundhouse<00:00:44.309> kick<00:00:44.820> when

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
spinning hook kick roundhouse kick when

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.700 
spinning hook kick roundhouse kick when
somebody's<00:00:45.870> kicking<00:00:46.230> at<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.410> especially

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.590 
somebody's kicking at you especially
with<00:00:46.949> I'd<00:00:47.519> say<00:00:47.730> County<00:00:48.059> kick<00:00:48.300> sort<00:00:48.540> of

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
with I'd say County kick sort of

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.540 
with I'd say County kick sort of
repeated<00:00:49.050> psychics<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:50.070> easiest<00:00:50.370> place<00:00:50.519> to

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
repeated psychics the easiest place to

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.640 
repeated psychics the easiest place to
score<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.180> into<00:00:51.720> the<00:00:51.809> front<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.170> body<00:00:52.350> and

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
score is into the front of the body and

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.100 
score is into the front of the body and
how<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.129> generally<00:00:53.580> do<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.090> if<00:00:54.600> gorillas

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
how we generally do that is if gorillas

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.820 
how we generally do that is if gorillas
kick<00:00:55.290> it<00:00:55.410> at<00:00:55.500> me

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
kick it at me

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.320 
kick it at me
we<00:00:56.160> spit<00:00:56.430> around<00:00:56.670> with<00:00:56.820> maybe<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.059> spinning

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
we spit around with maybe a spinning

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.270 
we spit around with maybe a spinning
hooking<00:00:57.600> into<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.900> center<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.260> body<00:00:58.440> if

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
hooking into the center of the body if

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.710 
hooking into the center of the body if
you<00:00:59.460> don't<00:00:59.640> fight<00:00:59.850> in<00:00:59.970> that<00:01:00.089> position<00:01:00.210> if<00:01:00.629> we

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
you don't fight in that position if we

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.180 
you don't fight in that position if we
fight<00:01:01.080> in<00:01:01.230> an<00:01:01.320> open<00:01:01.680> stance

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
fight in an open stance

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.969 
fight in an open stance
so<00:01:02.339> it's<00:01:03.090> chest<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.540> back<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:04.530> can't<00:01:04.770> do<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
so it's chest to back you can't do the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.560 
so it's chest to back you can't do the
same<00:01:05.100> technique<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:06.000> what<00:01:06.180> we're<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.420> do

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
same technique so what we're going to do

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.600 
same technique so what we're going to do
is<00:01:06.660> work<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> signal<00:01:07.110> attack<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.800> at<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.399> area

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
is work a signal attack in at this area

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.010 
is work a signal attack in at this area
we're<00:01:09.330> gonna<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> spinning<00:01:09.869> hook<00:01:09.960> kick

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
we're gonna do a spinning hook kick

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.020 
we're gonna do a spinning hook kick
first<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.680> spinning<00:01:11.430> hook<00:01:11.520> kick<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.789> a<00:01:11.820> very

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
first a spinning hook kick is a very

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:22.570 
first a spinning hook kick is a very
aggressive<00:01:12.539> very<00:01:12.570> strong<00:01:13.170> it

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.890 

pack<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.850> people<00:01:24.480> don't<00:01:24.630> like<00:01:24.720> getting<00:01:24.780> hit

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
pack and people don't like getting hit

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.690 
pack and people don't like getting hit
with<00:01:25.020> spinning<00:01:25.410> kicks<00:01:25.560> because<00:01:25.800> I<00:01:25.860> saw<00:01:26.100> so

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
with spinning kicks because I saw so

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.340 
with spinning kicks because I saw so
when<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.940> spin<00:01:27.210> around<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.720> person<00:01:28.050> kicking

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
when you spin around the person kicking

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.840 
when you spin around the person kicking
at<00:01:28.440> you<00:01:28.560> it's<00:01:28.920> more<00:01:29.100> than<00:01:29.220> likely<00:01:29.370> gonna<00:01:29.550> stop

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
at you it's more than likely gonna stop

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.940 
at you it's more than likely gonna stop
and<00:01:30.150> cover<00:01:30.360> up<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:31.290> gonna<00:01:31.440> allow<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.860> hit

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
and cover up it's gonna allow you to hit

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.340 
and cover up it's gonna allow you to hit
them<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.160> bit<00:01:32.280> easier<00:01:32.550> so<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:33.479> split<00:01:33.840> chambers

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
them a bit easier so I split chambers

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.469 
them a bit easier so I split chambers
