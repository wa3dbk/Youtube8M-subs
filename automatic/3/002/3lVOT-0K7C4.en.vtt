 She killed the bear when you killed one. 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.500

 thing that you can already talk about 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.679
 Very interesting face that this mold 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:50.020

 who's fighting they're fighting 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.229
 The truth is that if you had 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.940
 mode installed when you create a world 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.709

 forests go from the spal of some tents 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:11.050

 It has two actually and you will see how the 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.510
 Way he'll sell some 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.239
 interesting as hobby the bear clothes 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.860
 it is food tents and other things of the 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.160
 genre and is also having other than the 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.680
 art fox watching the fox is a look now 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.959

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.270
 Only it 's faster, it kills the galley. 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.700
 by the way, people did not kill and motor only 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.800
 It was not good for him, of course. 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.180
 Strangers Make a Scream It 's And With Them 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.920
 our coexistence can also make the 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.830
 mature but well on time but now 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.870

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.610

 This one needs to mount a tent, come here. 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.380

 it's just the right field I put alan 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.220
 to have passed the lighting is for me that 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.810
 It's better to have some neighborhood stalls. 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.520
 I can store soy items 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.650
 GM in the corner with emerging is 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.660

 You boot but it's the same source of oil. 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.030

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.990
 temporary house that can take to go 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.360

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.980
 those molds are for adventure and you 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.750
 You need to leave, you always walk around. 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.910

 circumstances shall compel the inventory and 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.519
 This is a thrill to realize if you have 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.140
 another military man even looks to be ours 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.190
 It's true and this place is here but you can 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.830
 put several various items to 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.100

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.140
 I put a friend I can see 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.740
 location placed without taking a map 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.570
 empty 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.760
 he opens it and then places himself in the corner and 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.220
 shows mick location and I am the point 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.900
 the red dot marks the blue dot 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.760
 had something else means that you 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.710

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.290
 craft for you can be cancer 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.060
 click on it do not subscribe to a 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.860
 time afterwards to conquer things 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.419
 You know when you walk, everything else is fine. 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.590
 nice too look at that time and 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.600
 flashlight it also works as 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.520
 Dynamic lights there you go walking like 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.449
 if I had a torch stuck in you 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.340
 where you go walking 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.620
 It became clear that I was not going to stay 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.430
 Me, let me show the guys to get it. 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.979
 a flashlight 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.839
 one antenna connected us tightens ce 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.029
 put it here 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:19.589
 The ball where I'm going, she's going. 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:21.839
 It is clearer that we put a 

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:23.879
 less light will give notice more 

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:25.860
 look at that I'll walk the same hilarious 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:27.360
 thing with very nice machine if I also 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.770
 I have a really cool script , it 's kind of 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.629
 a way for you to explore yourself 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.909
 Catch him he 's taking and now I'm going 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:34.559
 explore this map and weibo left right 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.809
 Even though you leave, go away, so let's go 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:39.689
 have some kits that are kit group that the 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:42.060
 turkey that contains some videos that 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:43.589
 hit the chile vineyard if you can see the time 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.389
 what time do these items also have 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:48.270
 Survival does not talk like that. 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.860
 Yes, and just cook everything. Cook everything. 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.389
 but it 's cool, too, the good ones 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.249
 interesting addition is that you try 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.529
 you can use to make it 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:57.509
 food in your own way a good attack of the day 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:00.180
 again but if you go see here you 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:02.370
 have two types of credit 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.229
 pile of bonfires a bonfire 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.089
 normal for you to be seven seconds 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:07.229
 so another campfire but you cook 

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:08.759
 when you right click on 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:10.889
 put coal there and put good 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:12.180
 uploaded a car and now you can 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:13.889
 cooking but it is here that 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.569
 Kitchen, there you can take care of everything. 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.969
 I will give an example here in relation to the 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:19.560
 mod that is the marcelo you take a slipper 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:22.199
 and just put it in the front 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.060
 of your business and soon after a while 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:26.159
 it will automatically be the poison 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.219
 alan of the hour it is interesting to remember the 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:30.990
 mike that this motto is going to be used 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:33.089
 In the light schumi today we will do 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.139
 a review of the light rain module but the 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:35.999
 people will use and with a purpose 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.069
 very interesting you will see today at 3 

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:40.319
 afternoon and also have midday escape 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:42.870
 I do not know, I do not know who I can 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:45.209
 design very crazy girl shows like 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.039
 quite sure this yes and this expense 

00:06:45.209 --> 00:06:48.539
 It's all she's all you can do 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:50.279
 some other type of food if you have 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:53.279
 also a pot that helps you to 

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:54.719
 killing both the fox and the 

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:57.360
 bear troop also a type of element 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:58.830
 different in this trap of the low 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.719
 Mexican or very large, right? 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.789
 also the animals in the characters that the 

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:05.039
 people can escape the animal 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:06.569
 us is that the animal and a few by 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:08.580
 be any kind of minecraft module 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:10.050
 get stuck here he'll get stuck in the 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.370
 thing that comes out as you have seen in the bear 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.800
 at the beginning of the episode here plus one 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.629
 very interesting thing is that that fire 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.129
 there from the camp he can change color 

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:20.050
 each color brings a benefit to the 

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:22.060
 know how to know if they are 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.520
 collaborated with the mouse or the blue team 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:27.879
 light blue he changes his color and he gives 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:31.030
 a type of deforestation and detects 

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:33.220
 insert the warby url then we can 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.930
 breathe underwater for 18 seconds 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.550
 but if I put the cacti green on it 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.750
 if we go because its the color 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.280
 I do not know if it will change here I think 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:43.419
 I'm going to create another one who fails. 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:45.159
 we will make a good room for the boys and this 

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:47.500
 Unfortunately, it will work for us. 

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:49.720
 has not picked up here after gl 

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.370
 although a bit to catch took caught 

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.810
 You can see that there is going to poison people. 

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.560
 you see that an example is a thing 

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.940
 good 

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.650
 obviously another bad thing because I 

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.569
 that they still have many things in 

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:00.219
 can operate all the colors of the mini 

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:02.560
 crash actually works is that it did not give 

00:08:00.219 --> 00:08:05.800
 nausea or not already caracas and that your 

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:07.270
 Ferroni tomorrow yet but at the end of 

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.490
 accounts this is a very simple but 

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.259
 he is aesthetically handsome too 

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.969
 Cool, you end up paying our friend. 

00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:15.550
 This is what fifty years wait for here. 

00:08:12.969 --> 00:08:18.180
 what sport show case ih and so far 

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.180
 such
