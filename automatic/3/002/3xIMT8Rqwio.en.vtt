00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.440

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.309
 finish but I have them wc also 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.070
 what I had not started 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.120
 a first half-time missed so without 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.109
 later we go right away 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.740
 so start with the bigger ones 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:27.180
 packaging so I have the playboy 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:32.009
 play it sexy which a game otherwise super 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.980
 in love with the smell so here is the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.809
 pack ats-united them like this with the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.719
 playboy's ears and behind it 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.960
 boyzone brand and we do not know if the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.280
 you will see finally the bottle 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.329
 red he loves the bottle very much we 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.270
 really worn a lot so 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.890
 this one for all seasons it goes very 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.420
 well because the smell I would not even 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.590
 not describe to you the smell and have 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.260
 so well they are very long so 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.390
 what have a pretty sweet smell a little 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.760
 sweet after that for them 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.760
 theses very well I love it here I am 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:19.140
 so here's for the light banks 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:21.060
 sexy even then a starter that I 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.270
 had my mother my birthday is 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.790
 the wolf to 2 2 diesel I love 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.759
 frankly so I tell you all of 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.630
 Following the lot towards 2 is more a perfume 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.060
 various as the nina ricci I wanted 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.590
 with finally that I actually hesitated between 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.750
 the world of living from what you do 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.640
 heathland is very very long and 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.950
 the mines at richie the nina ricci was 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.540
 really much more an odor of 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.729
 the summer so because in fact it's sweet 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.210
 I have much everything other 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.390
 sugar and my mother hates that but I get 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.390
 plug 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.650
 so in fact on the caps it marks 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.700
 diesel on the cheat stuff is also 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.800
 marked with diesel and they are so 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.540
 good it's also a pretty secret smell 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.210
 but it's a lot more for the winter 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:20.200
 that for the summer I wanted sure so 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.560
 wait so the cork is very hard to 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.540
 m 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.170
 we are afraid of cheetham expectations on the 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.800
 so it's a shape like you 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.440
 can see it from the heart and me it 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.600
 love this fragrance it is really 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.490
 extraordinary 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:43.810
 the outfitter the marks and the v12 of 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:45.640
 was saying here so do not do very 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.900
 watch out for my head I'm ugly I 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.700
 looks like nothing but really has that 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.500
 premises such as slab the wick in 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.820
 push the genres too long for 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.900
 I really ask our godmothers 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.080
 who cuts my hair because the 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.430
 TV is more possible 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.200
 and again that happily returns 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.200
 because my mother is too long rope 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:16.390
 so here is rue lenoir buzz so then 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.540
 a perfume so that I tell you direct 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.680
 fao which these exotic home agents 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.470
 so 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.010
 the smell is of course exotic so that 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.500
 it's a lot 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.880
 I consider this sometimes for the summer 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.800
 even though I put for spring for 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.550
 summer for autumn never put to 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.370
 the antenna in autumn and I really like 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.880
 the smell so that's what looks like 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.989
 packaging 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.680
 I love you not as it 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.450
 did but I find it very cute and 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.220
 they are so good it's a trick of 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.380
 sick 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.680
 so here I like the smell a lot and he 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.620
 is just zylab by the way I swatch it 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.000
 is just now on my home and 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.250
 I love the thin flag 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.710
 we who really marry a lot 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.970
 with the summer frankly he gets married very 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:07.400
 very much to the rule was like go 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:13.360
 wear and he's really very very 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:15.590
 nice then a richly fragrant 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.350
 before at the site called live there 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.500
 down he reacted a fragrance of any season 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.190
 I would also say they are very very good 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.680
 also 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.360
 No, I present the beast to you 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.810
 the packaging how was very pretty 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.169
 also and we go out we always find the 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.770
 form is lifted on the box and on the 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.200
 packaging 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.200
 so that's what makes all its charm 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.100
 so that's for rina banerjee 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.120
 so I finished for the big packaging 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.930
 now we will attack the most 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.700
 small so I have a very small perfume of 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.200
 at Yves vanilla rock so who 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.310
 only 20 milliliters 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.870
 but it does the trick so that says 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.660
 vanilla that says sugar and that it was there 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.570
 I really like their hymn that 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.850
 I did it hard that I said it's great 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.220
 they are very very good also 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.960
 I like a lot lover so I like 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.460
 many smells as I wanted said 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.410
 all that is fruity and sweet exotic 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.650
 that I love true I love it so it's 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:25.070
 really awesome like or shapes 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:28.810
 I love a shipping perfume 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:32.270
 called sweet violet 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.100
 so I'm not lying to you sure he's 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.960
 already demonstrated price because I the 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:42.020
 pay that this euro and it's a perfect 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.310
 for summer because last summer I wore 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.490
 that it really only has that in 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.840
 an aside as that 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.130
 I can not tell you that I love the smell 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.750
 is then the last perfume that 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.310
 sometimes also from home before 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.000
 Chapel 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:06:02.220
 rutile faboulous two planes matching 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.310
 so I started by pony 3 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.300
 way 3 so I like to see a player I love 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.789
 the packaging 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.470
 it's really too much shopping and 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:13.870
 the device 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.849
