fisted<00:01:32.110> this<00:01:32.260> would<00:01:32.410> be<00:01:32.530> much

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.969 

there's<00:01:42.710> no<00:01:42.890> more<00:01:43.070> supplements

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.139 

we<00:01:48.549> go<00:01:50.219> saw<00:01:51.219> what<00:01:51.430> was<00:01:51.520> happening<00:01:51.579> I<00:01:51.939> saw

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
we go saw what was happening I saw

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.240 
we go saw what was happening I saw
something<00:01:52.630> just<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:56.229> show<00:01:56.409> how<00:01:56.619> it<00:01:56.649> suggested

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
something just to show how it suggested

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.889 
something just to show how it suggested
I'll<00:01:58.090> take<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.630> edge<00:01:59.409> off<00:01:59.619> coupling<00:02:00.009> rod

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
I'll take the edge off coupling rod

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.279 
I'll take the edge off coupling rod
which<00:02:01.899> as<00:02:02.079> you<00:02:02.229> see<00:02:02.439> is<00:02:02.469> shorter<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.130> pin

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
which as you see is shorter the pin

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:10.580 
which as you see is shorter the pin
using<00:02:05.289> the<00:02:05.530> adjusting<00:02:05.920> screw<00:02:08.459> I'll<00:02:09.459> bring<00:02:09.759> up

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
using the adjusting screw I'll bring up

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.510 
using the adjusting screw I'll bring up
into<00:02:11.590> alignment

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.100

for adjusting the throw the cranks but
it's<00:03:11.870> already<00:03:12.110> set<00:03:12.440> so<00:03:12.800> it's<00:03:12.920> not<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.070> problem

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.289 

and<00:03:26.650> then<00:03:26.829> 14<00:03:27.219> will<00:03:27.400> appear

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.330 

we<00:03:31.299> recommend<00:03:31.569> finger<00:03:32.079> tight<00:03:32.290> that<00:03:32.590> certainly

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.539 

so<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.659> first<00:03:40.870> action<00:03:41.230> will<00:03:41.379> be<00:03:41.409> to<00:03:41.739> set<00:03:42.430> up

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
so the first action will be to set up

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.839 
so the first action will be to set up
the<00:03:42.640> bearings<00:03:42.970> of<00:03:43.470> see<00:03:44.470> there<00:03:44.799> will<00:03:45.280> fit<00:03:45.459> at

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
the bearings of see there will fit at

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.660 
the bearings of see there will fit at
the<00:03:46.000> end<00:03:46.769> this<00:03:47.769> is<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.010> outside<00:03:48.129> of<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.489> frame

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
the end this is the outside of the frame

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.979 
the end this is the outside of the frame
the<00:03:48.849> inside<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.390> frame

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
the inside of the frame

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.440 
the inside of the frame
solve<00:03:50.500> fit<00:03:50.889> with<00:03:51.099> fixed<00:03:51.430> bearing<00:03:51.819> from<00:03:52.239> the

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
solve fit with fixed bearing from the

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.929 
solve fit with fixed bearing from the
inside

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
inside

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:59.460 
inside
that's<00:03:54.939> what<00:03:55.150> entered<00:03:55.540> their<00:03:58.049> illicit<00:03:59.049> faces

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
that's what entered their illicit faces

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.039 
that's what entered their illicit faces
back<00:04:03.150> then<00:04:04.150> I<00:04:04.269> can't<00:04:04.450> watch<00:04:04.629> one<00:04:04.870> of<00:04:04.900> the

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
back then I can't watch one of the

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.649 
back then I can't watch one of the
bearings<00:04:06.780> don't<00:04:07.780> drop<00:04:07.989> it

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
bearings don't drop it

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.159 
bearings don't drop it
as<00:04:10.659> you<00:04:10.780> can<00:04:10.930> see<00:04:11.139> there<00:04:11.319> is<00:04:11.409> some<00:04:11.709> float<00:04:12.370> here

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
as you can see there is some float here

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:20.069 
as you can see there is some float here
so<00:04:14.169> I<00:04:14.230> can<00:04:14.530> use<00:04:16.079> this<00:04:17.079> fence<00:04:18.509> of<00:04:19.509> alignment

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
so I can use this fence of alignment

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:27.260 
so I can use this fence of alignment
knocks<00:04:20.289> at<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:20.859> edges

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.270 

to<00:04:27.840> set<00:04:28.050> it<00:04:28.169> up<00:04:28.259> to<00:04:28.470> ensure<00:04:28.590> that<00:04:28.949> it<00:04:29.129> is<00:04:29.160> in

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
to set it up to ensure that it is in

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.200 
to set it up to ensure that it is in
fact<00:04:30.830> level<00:04:31.830> if<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:32.639> want<00:04:32.789> to<00:04:32.879> use<00:04:33.030> other

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
fact level if you want to use other

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.960 
fact level if you want to use other
methods<00:04:33.479> of<00:04:36.409> measuring<00:04:37.409> feel<00:04:37.919> free<00:04:38.220> to<00:04:38.610> dig

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
methods of measuring feel free to dig

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:47.440 
methods of measuring feel free to dig
out<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.120> station<00:04:39.629> you<00:04:39.810> like
