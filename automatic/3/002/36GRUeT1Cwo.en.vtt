00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:01.440
 the beginning of 2016 the publishers of the series 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.050
 declined to comment on gossip 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.510
 but if she is true that fully 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.540
 The announcement is likely to take place on 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.290
 e3 what is the truth we already know completely 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.290
 soon 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.450
 perhaps if once on write history 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.770
 long-term construction of the last garden will take 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.650
 separate section 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.180
 the game began to develop back in 2007 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.120

 official announcement took place in 2009 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.220
 however, to this day, she did not come out only 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.550
 occasionally one or another sony employee 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.620
 mentions that the project is still alive 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.850
 the latest data to process the game under 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.220
 playstation 4 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.250
 but no specifics is clear no 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.650
 and then suddenly there was hope 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.360
 that dallas guardian did get to 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.890

 however information provided some 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.770

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.310
 rumors are true very little however nobody 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.690
