manufacturing consultant at address and

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.080 
manufacturing consultant at address and
today<00:00:07.250> I'm<00:00:07.309> going<00:00:07.429> to<00:00:07.519> be<00:00:07.580> taking<00:00:07.939> you<00:00:08.059> through

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
today I'm going to be taking you through

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.730 
today I'm going to be taking you through
a<00:00:08.360> little<00:00:08.510> tip<00:00:08.780> in<00:00:09.019> the<00:00:09.500> sheetmetal

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
a little tip in the sheetmetal

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.009 
a little tip in the sheetmetal
environment<00:00:10.550> with<00:00:10.849> the<00:00:11.030> unfold<00:00:11.540> refold

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
environment with the unfold refold

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.480 
environment with the unfold refold
feature<00:00:12.940> okay<00:00:13.940> so<00:00:13.999> this<00:00:14.240> is<00:00:14.419> the<00:00:14.570> example

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
feature okay so this is the example

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.120 
feature okay so this is the example
we're<00:00:16.490> going<00:00:16.670> to<00:00:16.820> complete<00:00:17.769> so<00:00:18.769> this<00:00:18.920> sort<00:00:19.099> of

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
we're going to complete so this sort of

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.470 
we're going to complete so this sort of
feature<00:00:19.369> that<00:00:19.640> you're<00:00:19.760> seeing<00:00:19.970> here<00:00:20.090> is<00:00:20.449> a

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
feature that you're seeing here is a

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.630 
feature that you're seeing here is a
perfect<00:00:21.019> example<00:00:21.260> of<00:00:21.769> how<00:00:21.830> you<00:00:22.039> could<00:00:22.310> use<00:00:22.340> the

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
perfect example of how you could use the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.329 
perfect example of how you could use the
unfold<00:00:23.029> refold<00:00:23.509> feature<00:00:23.720> if<00:00:24.650> you<00:00:24.800> were<00:00:24.949> not<00:00:25.189> to

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:25.339 
unfold refold feature if you were not to

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.400 
unfold refold feature if you were not to
be<00:00:25.400> using<00:00:25.789> the<00:00:26.119> unfold<00:00:26.509> refold<00:00:26.990> tool<00:00:27.230> you

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
be using the unfold refold tool you

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.570 
be using the unfold refold tool you
would<00:00:27.500> really<00:00:27.769> struggle<00:00:28.039> to<00:00:28.339> create

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
would really struggle to create

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.260 
would really struggle to create
something<00:00:28.820> like<00:00:28.910> this<00:00:30.039> so<00:00:31.039> what<00:00:31.939> you<00:00:31.970> might

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
something like this so what you might

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.440 
something like this so what you might
want<00:00:32.509> to<00:00:32.599> do<00:00:32.810> in<00:00:33.050> this<00:00:33.260> sort<00:00:33.500> of<00:00:33.530> scenario<00:00:33.710> is

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
want to do in this sort of scenario is

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.680 
want to do in this sort of scenario is
flatten<00:00:35.450> the<00:00:35.629> part<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:37.360> then<00:00:38.360> create<00:00:38.660> a

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
flatten the part and then create a

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.889 
flatten the part and then create a
sketch<00:00:39.070> but<00:00:40.070> as<00:00:40.160> you're<00:00:40.340> probably<00:00:40.460> aware<00:00:40.899> if

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
sketch but as you're probably aware if

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.299 
sketch but as you're probably aware if
you<00:00:41.989> try<00:00:42.199> and<00:00:42.260> create<00:00:42.500> a<00:00:42.590> sketch<00:00:42.860> on<00:00:43.250> a

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
you try and create a sketch on a

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.090 
you try and create a sketch on a
flattened<00:00:43.730> part<00:00:43.969> you<00:00:44.210> can<00:00:44.329> see<00:00:44.920> it<00:00:45.920> won't

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
flattened part you can see it won't

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.799 
flattened part you can see it won't
allow<00:00:46.399> you<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:46.610> it's<00:00:47.030> telling<00:00:47.300> you<00:00:47.480> it<00:00:47.629> won't

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
allow you to it's telling you it won't

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.500 
allow you to it's telling you it won't
be<00:00:47.960> reflected<00:00:48.649> in<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:48.859> folded<00:00:49.219> model<00:00:49.550> so<00:00:50.359> this

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
be reflected in the folded model so this

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.349 
be reflected in the folded model so this
is<00:00:50.660> why<00:00:50.809> you<00:00:50.870> want<00:00:51.289> to<00:00:51.379> use<00:00:51.590> the<00:00:51.980> unfold<00:00:52.699> refold

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
is why you want to use the unfold refold

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.090 
is why you want to use the unfold refold
tool<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.379> we're<00:00:54.500> going<00:00:54.590> to<00:00:54.649> go<00:00:54.769> for<00:00:54.949> a<00:00:54.980> quick

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
tool so we're going to go for a quick

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
tool so we're going to go for a quick
example<00:00:55.640> now<00:00:57.399> so<00:00:58.399> with<00:00:58.519> this<00:00:58.640> tool<00:00:58.879> it's

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
example now so with this tool it's

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.119 
example now so with this tool it's
really<00:00:59.359> straightforward<00:00:59.629> it<00:01:00.620> essentially

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
really straightforward it essentially

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.860 
really straightforward it essentially
acts<00:01:01.250> like<00:01:01.519> the<00:01:01.609> flat<00:01:01.820> pattern<00:01:02.059> tool<00:01:02.390> allowing

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
acts like the flat pattern tool allowing

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.340 
acts like the flat pattern tool allowing
you<00:01:03.050> to<00:01:03.580> special<00:01:04.580> specify<00:01:05.269> a<00:01:05.540> stationary

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
you to special specify a stationary

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.969 
you to special specify a stationary
reference<00:01:06.740> point<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:07.280> then<00:01:07.460> folds<00:01:08.180> or<00:01:08.630> bends

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
reference point and then folds or bends

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.510 
reference point and then folds or bends
you<00:01:09.979> wish<00:01:10.159> to<00:01:10.490> unfold<00:01:11.860> you<00:01:12.860> can<00:01:13.009> see<00:01:13.159> it<00:01:13.250> starts

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
you wish to unfold you can see it starts

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.870 
you wish to unfold you can see it starts
previewing<00:01:14.180> each<00:01:14.420> Bend<00:01:14.750> that<00:01:14.930> you<00:01:14.990> select<00:01:15.880> by

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
previewing each Bend that you select by

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.120 
previewing each Bend that you select by
unselect<00:01:17.420> Bend<00:01:17.750> it<00:01:18.049> refold<00:01:18.979> zit<00:01:20.890> soon<00:01:21.890> as<00:01:22.009> I

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
unselect Bend it refold zit soon as I

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.100 
unselect Bend it refold zit soon as I
that<00:01:22.759> that<00:01:23.119> will<00:01:23.329> become<00:01:23.450> a<00:01:23.630> feature<00:01:23.840> in<00:01:24.079> the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
that that will become a feature in the

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.210 
that that will become a feature in the
browser<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:26.200> when<00:01:27.200> you're<00:01:27.350> in<00:01:27.439> this<00:01:27.590> unfolded

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
browser so when you're in this unfolded

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.600 
browser so when you're in this unfolded
state<00:01:28.310> it<00:01:28.729> will<00:01:28.970> allow<00:01:29.210> you<00:01:29.270> to<00:01:29.479> sketch<00:01:29.900> and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
state it will allow you to sketch and

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.609 
state it will allow you to sketch and
create<00:01:31.610> features<00:01:32.180> which<00:01:32.840> are<00:01:33.200> affect

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
create features which are affect

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:44.130 
create features which are affect
reflected<00:01:34.520> in<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:35.479> folded<00:01:35.840> model

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.810 

so<00:01:44.740> we're<00:01:45.010> just<00:01:45.040> going<00:01:45.220> to<00:01:45.310> go<00:01:45.460> ahead<00:01:45.670> and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
so we're just going to go ahead and

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:59.050 
so we're just going to go ahead and
create<00:01:46.000> that<00:01:46.210> feature

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.359 

okay

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
okay

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.830 
okay
so<00:02:01.880> I<00:02:01.909> can<00:02:02.119> use<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.420> cut<00:02:02.630> tool<00:02:02.899> now<00:02:04.240> to<00:02:05.240> create

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
so I can use the cut tool now to create

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.040 
so I can use the cut tool now to create
the<00:02:05.929> cut<00:02:06.140> in<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.439> part

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.900 

and<00:02:11.620> at<00:02:11.710> this<00:02:11.830> point<00:02:12.070> I<00:02:12.310> actually<00:02:12.370> want<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.820> on

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
and at this point I actually want it on

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.900 
and at this point I actually want it on
each<00:02:13.090> corner<00:02:13.450> but<00:02:13.840> rather<00:02:14.140> than<00:02:14.460> modeling<00:02:15.460> or

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
each corner but rather than modeling or

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.120 
each corner but rather than modeling or
creating<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.630> sketch<00:02:16.870> for<00:02:17.020> each<00:02:17.170> face<00:02:17.470> and

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
creating a sketch for each face and

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.460 
creating a sketch for each face and
cutting<00:02:18.610> I'm<00:02:18.940> going<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.810> use<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.080> mirror<00:02:20.290> tool

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
cutting I'm going to use the mirror tool

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.760 
cutting I'm going to use the mirror tool
so<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:20.920> can<00:02:21.010> mirror<00:02:21.520> features<00:02:22.210> also<00:02:22.770> when

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
so you can mirror features also when

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:37.850 
so you can mirror features also when
you're<00:02:23.890> using<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.340> unfold

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.800 

so<00:02:38.400> there<00:02:38.580> we<00:02:38.670> have<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:38.880> s<00:02:39.150> all<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.420> features

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
so there we have it s all the features
