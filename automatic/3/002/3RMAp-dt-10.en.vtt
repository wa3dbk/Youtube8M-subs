00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello girls welcome in this video 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.460
 I'm going to share a beautiful 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.649
 decoration of one for the hands 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.860
 using the pattern here and stripes 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.660
 is over this video we start girls 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.849
 this is the first color I'm going to 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.369
 use for this decoration rosita 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:22.230
 strong as a first step let's paint 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.240
 all ours one big for the passage 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.939
 next I will use a ribbon 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.010
 decorative like this we go to the 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.960
 second nail where we are going to divide it from 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.670
 a diagonal way in this way to 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.780
 the next step I will use this 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.809
 white color we will paint the part 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.579
 left of the nail in this way to 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.399
 better results we have to apply 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.620
 two layers in this step is very useful 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.420
 decorative ribbon to divide the nail 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.879
 to paint only the area that we're going to 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.350
 paint for the next step I'm going to 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.350
 use this black color 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.280
 in this step we are going to use a brush 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.470
 thin and black paint and we'll do 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.970
 lines down throughout the area where 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.970
 we paint only white 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.990
 and after we finished painting 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.000
 remove the tape if you have left some 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.730
 residue as I only clean with a 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.310
 skewer and acetone and ready 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:30.270
 next step let's paint this area 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.890
 everything pink for the next step I'm going 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.890
 to use this thick and pearly 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.110
 we will paint with the whole in the nail of the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.160
 half we went to the fourth nail where the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.930
 let's paint everything in white 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.170
 we are left with the last nail we are going to 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.850
 paint all pink girls this were 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.800
 the colors that I was inspired for this 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.630
 decoration I hope you inspire with 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.100
 your favorite colors for the passage 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.250
 next I will use stones 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.320
 decorative first let's apply a 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.840
 protective gloss base and then the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.910
 pebbles in these sequences the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.790
 Decorative pebbles give a touch of 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.030
 elegance to our decoration and makes 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.040
 see our most attractive nails I'm 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.410
 using the pebbles of size one 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.780
 little medium not very large you choose the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.240
 size that you like 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.490
 finally we add the last stone and 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.190
 as a result we have it is no longer good 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.490
 finished for the next step I'm going to 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.680
 use this glitter of frost 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.170
 we will apply the glitter of frost on the 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.380
 nail of the middle to give that view 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.670
 desired that we want from our shore 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.740
 we went to the first one where we're going to 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.590
 put a pebble and also in the 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.530
 last line 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.120
 we are almost at the last steps of 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.400
 our decoration where we are going to do 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.860
 points this way in some plant 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.750
 in the corner part of the nail the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:02.959
 let's leave free because there we go 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.700
 make a bun how it happened 'last let's 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.349
 make a bun in the corner part 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.680
 using a thin brush and the 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:12.310
 Rosita culture we will give you the size 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.019
 desired either medium or large 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.010
 we retouched the figure around to 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:21.920
 get that desired figure from this 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.110
 way we have our world 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.209
 right away I will make points in that 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.209
 space that remained around the world 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.780
 now for our world to be left 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.270
 so I'm going to add some pebbles 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.550
 decorative 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:40.030
 in the middle I'm going to put a big one already 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.890
 sides two little girls who believe with 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.940
 these last details is like this 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.370
 we reached the end of our 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.720
 decoration at the end we will put a 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.520
 Protective gloss coat would be all 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.050
 these are the final results of 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.670
 our decoration I hope you have them
