00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
is in mine actually for the link that I

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.419 
is in mine actually for the link that I
want<00:01:34.700> mine<00:01:35.389> is<00:01:36.159> 38<00:01:37.389> long<00:01:38.710> 38<00:01:39.710> inches<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.310> it's

want mine is 38 long 38 inches and it's

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.819 
want mine is 38 long 38 inches and it's
folded<00:01:40.639> in<00:01:40.880> half<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:41.929> you<00:01:42.350> know<00:01:42.469> the<00:01:42.619> normal

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
folded in half so you know the normal

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.340 
folded in half so you know the normal
way<00:01:43.039> that<00:01:43.069> you're<00:01:43.460> suppose<00:01:43.789> it<00:01:43.939> in<00:01:44.030> half<00:01:44.350> right

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
way that you're suppose it in half right

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.129 
way that you're suppose it in half right
now<00:01:45.880> what<00:01:46.880> you<00:01:46.999> want<00:01:47.179> to<00:01:47.299> do<00:01:47.509> is<00:01:47.810> you<00:01:47.929> want<00:01:48.109> to

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.260 
fold it one more time this is like so
simple<00:01:53.899> to<00:01:54.109> make<00:01:54.289> you<00:01:54.700> fold<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:55.789> one<00:01:55.909> more<00:01:56.060> time

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
simple to make you fold it one more time

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.379 
simple to make you fold it one more time
or<00:01:56.959> like<00:01:57.350> that<00:01:57.590> now<00:01:58.100> this<00:01:58.340> corner<00:01:58.759> part<00:01:58.999> is<00:01:59.209> the
