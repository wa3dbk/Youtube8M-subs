so<00:00:03.629> cladistics<00:00:04.350> is<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.529> mechanism<00:00:05.339> or<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.700> method

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
so cladistics is a mechanism or a method

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.030 
so cladistics is a mechanism or a method
that<00:00:06.629> scientists<00:00:07.350> use<00:00:07.379> when<00:00:07.680> they're<00:00:07.799> trying

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
that scientists use when they're trying

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.860 
that scientists use when they're trying
to<00:00:08.069> figure<00:00:08.280> out<00:00:08.429> who<00:00:08.820> is<00:00:09.179> most<00:00:09.480> closely

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
to figure out who is most closely

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.320 
to figure out who is most closely
related<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.620> whom<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.190> it's<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.179> way<00:00:12.300> of

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
related to whom and it's a way of

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.810 
related to whom and it's a way of
grouping<00:00:12.750> organisms<00:00:13.530> based<00:00:13.769> on<00:00:14.130> looking<00:00:14.670> at

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
grouping organisms based on looking at

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.150 
grouping organisms based on looking at
what<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.450> call<00:00:15.630> derived<00:00:16.160> characteristics

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
what I call derived characteristics

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.400 
what I call derived characteristics
which<00:00:17.730> are<00:00:17.880> groups<00:00:18.330> or<00:00:18.900> types<00:00:19.230> of

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
which are groups or types of

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.810 
which are groups or types of
characteristics<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.130> are<00:00:20.310> unique<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.699> a

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
characteristics that are unique to a

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.689 
characteristics that are unique to a
particular<00:00:21.090> group<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.779> organisms<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:23.279> you'll

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
particular group of organisms so you'll

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.609 
particular group of organisms so you'll
wind<00:00:24.060> up<00:00:24.150> with<00:00:24.330> things<00:00:24.570> called<00:00:24.840> clades<00:00:25.289> a

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
wind up with things called clades a

wind up with things called clades a
clade<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.550> group<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.150> related<00:00:27.420> organisms

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
clade is a group of related organisms

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.919 
clade is a group of related organisms
that<00:00:28.560> all<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> shared<00:00:29.820> derived<00:00:30.300> trait<00:00:30.720> or

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
that all have a shared derived trait or

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.680 
that all have a shared derived trait or
shared<00:00:31.529> derived<00:00:31.890> traits<00:00:32.460> an<00:00:32.880> example<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.570> a

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
shared derived traits an example of a

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.720 
shared derived traits an example of a
clade<00:00:34.079> would<00:00:34.320> be<00:00:34.469> like<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:34.890> example<00:00:34.980> mammals

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
clade would be like for example mammals

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.330 
clade would be like for example mammals
all<00:00:35.940> mammals<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:36.809> hair<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.590> memory<00:00:38.040> glands

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
all mammals have hair and memory glands

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.639 
all mammals have hair and memory glands
so<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.360> as<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> mammal<00:00:40.379> have<00:00:40.710> hair

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
so I as a mammal have hair

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.750 
so I as a mammal have hair
non-functional<00:00:43.649> mammary<00:00:44.010> glands<00:00:44.309> but<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.610> do

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
non-functional mammary glands but I do

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.470 
non-functional mammary glands but I do
have<00:00:45.090> them<00:00:45.410> even<00:00:46.410> whales<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:47.340> hair<00:00:47.670> eight<00:00:48.210> of

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
have them even whales have hair eight of

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.150 
have them even whales have hair eight of
them<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.430> mammary<00:00:50.430> glands<00:00:50.780> now<00:00:51.829> you'll<00:00:52.829> see

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
them and mammary glands now you'll see

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160 
them and mammary glands now you'll see
the<00:00:53.340> term<00:00:53.699> drive<00:00:54.090> traits<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.840> mentioned

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
the term drive traits like I mentioned

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.650 
the term drive traits like I mentioned
before<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.710> these<00:00:55.860> are<00:00:56.070> unique<00:00:56.850> or<00:00:57.149> new

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
before and these are unique or new

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.920 
before and these are unique or new
traits<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.530> all<00:00:58.800> members<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.690> clade<00:01:00.690> all

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
traits that all members in a clade all

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.900 
traits that all members in a clade all
share<00:01:01.410> with<00:01:01.680> each<00:01:01.710> other<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.190> their

immediate<00:01:03.390> ancestor<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.619> you'll<00:01:04.949> often<00:01:05.159> see

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
immediate ancestor and you'll often see

these diagrams that are sometimes called

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.140 
these diagrams that are sometimes called
cladograms<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.100> here's<00:01:08.430> an<00:01:08.549> example<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:09.030> a
