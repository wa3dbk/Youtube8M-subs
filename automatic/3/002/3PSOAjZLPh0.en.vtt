00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.689
 hello good girls welcome to me 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:08.930
 channel today I bring you a tips 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.790
 good formation that is what kind or 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.969
 which is to use according to your tree type 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.660
 well there are many types of body is the 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.930
 h 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:22.720
 the a the b the 8 good much more because 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.720
 really around 7 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.570
 I started good the body h has very little 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.180
 taste the shoulders at the waist not over 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.690
 Waist and hips thermal porte 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.690
 that is to say that it is like the rectum and for 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:46.010
 I can remedy that in order to get more 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.890
 hip one is going to need to have a 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:54.850
 skirt like a skirt with a lot of flight 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.850
 to be able to give chain for example as 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:05.960
 the concept as much more volume to your 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.990
 hips and it does not seem anymore you 're no longer straight 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.420
 it 's you 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.310
 good the body to are with men 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.650
 small the big hips and the 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.740
 small waist 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.520
 well that means that the still 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.270
 the shoulders are small the waist 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.880
 little 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:33.430
 and hips hips and thighs 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.370
 very big is to say that a 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.090
 so for that we go to society 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:44.740
 a correct trapezoid skirt for 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:47.950
 this disguise the streets or is it for 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.060
 example this I have here then all the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.970
 fabric that is more straight but at the same time 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.690
 you look much more stylized much better 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:02.140
 and do not become attached both your body and 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.119
 it looks bad like that or it looks a lot 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.360
 better with a straight back or type 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.360
 trapeze 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.620
 good the body sees are by the shoulders 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.710
 with narrow hips but shoulders 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.340
 widths and narrow hips is to say a 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.680
 bird with then for it is always 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.630
 better because as men are more 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.260
 wide is much more to always use 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.410
 light colors on top is 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.870
 say pastel colors like celeste 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.440
 clear and he 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.819
 skin colors too light on the part 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.109
 from below dark colors 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:48.310
 then for that you need a skirt 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:52.090
 with a lot of fabric but for us to give 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.670
 light manna the wings to your hips for that 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.519
 you need a skirt that has a lot 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.769
 I roll of those so they were before type 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.799
 old looking for that would like 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:06.340
 meet and that with a lot of flight 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.889
 then that just gives you more volume in 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.499
 hips and I have to use that your 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:15.219
 body look too but good 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:17.079
 I have that skirt but they are those 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:20.620
 old ones that they used a long time ago 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:24.250
 back that are with a lot of flying here 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.370
 I mean a lot of fabric and you get 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.100
 a lot of volume to your tasks 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.760
 the 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.370
 body 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.640
 the body 8 is almost the perfect body 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.470
 is almost the woman or the body that 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.269
 we take what he wants to have because he has 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.329
 shoulders and hips the same 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:46.319
 Cut of the same cut and waist 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:49.370
 more chiquitita or is it an 8 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:53.730
 then for her they saw them too 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.709
 the faults that are cube type and are that 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.060
 they are at the middle of the knee always and 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:03.299
 when the person measures about a meter 65 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.549
 and if the person is under a 65 meter it 's 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:09.269
 much better that the person wear the skirt 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:11.849
 over the knee because that's how you're doing 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.609
 help you not look so low in 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.829
 I change the highest person doing here 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.950
 it's going to look much better and it's going to 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:24.490
 use 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.490
 good a shovel that for example is this 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.800
 the back had a back that gets attached 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.240
 to your body but at the same time you do not see 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.190
 disproportionate nor is it wrong 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.940
 but you look good since you have the 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:41.090
 body 8 and that body is the perfect 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.120
 well this has been all hopefully 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.120
 liked
