amount<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.369> Vaseline<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.200> gives<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
amount of Vaseline and so it gives the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.359 
amount of Vaseline and so it gives the
look<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.979> lip<00:01:17.250> gloss<00:01:17.930> but<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.080> also<00:01:19.290> stops<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
look of lip gloss but it also stops the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.859 
look of lip gloss but it also stops the
lips<00:01:20.880> from<00:01:21.090> drying<00:01:21.420> out<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:24.600> feeling
