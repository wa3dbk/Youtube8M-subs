00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
these sports is definitely growing I

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.440 
these sports is definitely growing I
think<00:00:32.369> that's<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.550> biggest<00:00:32.790> difference<00:00:33.030> in

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
think that's the biggest difference in

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.060 
think that's the biggest difference in
the<00:00:33.690> first<00:00:33.899> one<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.260> talk<00:00:34.440> about<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.890> that

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
the first one you can talk about is that

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.340 
the first one you can talk about is that
eSports<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.610> getting<00:00:35.879> bigger<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.930> used<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.199> be

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
eSports is getting bigger it used to be

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.689 
eSports is getting bigger it used to be
something<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.860> was<00:00:37.980> almost<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.309> subculture

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
something that was almost a subculture

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.270 
something that was almost a subculture
people<00:00:39.570> are<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:39.780> oh<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.620> get<00:00:40.739> money<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.160> do

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
people are like oh you get money to do

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.369 
people are like oh you get money to do
that<00:00:41.489> whereas<00:00:42.210> now<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.540> can<00:00:42.989> actually<00:00:43.230> go<00:00:43.320> to

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
that whereas now you can actually go to

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.750 
that whereas now you can actually go to
a<00:00:43.440> lot<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.739> places<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.220> people<00:00:44.309> are<00:00:44.489> like<00:00:44.550> okay

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
a lot of places and people are like okay

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.970 
a lot of places and people are like okay
I've<00:00:45.090> seen<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.510> TV<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.559> know<00:00:46.620> about

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
I've seen you on TV and I know about

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.920 
I've seen you on TV and I know about
that<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.519> my<00:00:47.640> friend<00:00:47.879> does<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.269> and<00:00:48.570> there's

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
that and my friend does this and there's

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.450 
that and my friend does this and there's
a<00:00:48.989> lot<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.170> people<00:00:49.320> interconnecting<00:00:50.129> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
a lot of people interconnecting and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.729 
a lot of people interconnecting and
related<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.199> think<00:00:52.230> that's<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.589> big

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
related to that and I think that's a big

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.140 
related to that and I think that's a big
difference<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.280> not<00:00:53.400> just<00:00:53.579> America<00:00:54.000> it's

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
difference it's not just America it's

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.240 
difference it's not just America it's
also<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.480> Asia<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.900> Europe<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.860> other<00:00:56.010> parts

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
also in Asia and Europe in other parts

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.439 
also in Asia and Europe in other parts
of<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:56.399> world<00:00:56.460> South<00:00:56.820> America<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.180> actually

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
of the world South America is actually

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.729 
of the world South America is actually
on<00:00:57.540> the<00:00:57.570> big<00:00:57.750> rise<00:00:57.960> with<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.260> as<00:00:58.350> well<00:00:58.379> I

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
on the big rise with that as well I

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.469 
on the big rise with that as well I
think<00:00:59.519> another<00:00:59.699> big<00:00:59.909> difference<00:01:00.239> with<00:01:00.360> these

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
think another big difference with these

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:02.930 
think another big difference with these
sports<00:01:00.720> is<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.019> money<00:01:01.350> again<00:01:02.309> with<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.789> being

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
sports is the money again with it being

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.450 
sports is the money again with it being
like<00:01:03.149> almost<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.570> subculture<00:01:03.930> thing<00:01:04.350> ten<00:01:05.220> years

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
like almost a subculture thing ten years

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.180 
like almost a subculture thing ten years
ago<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.910> is<00:01:05.940> now<00:01:06.180> becoming<00:01:06.570> more<00:01:07.190> wildly

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
ago it is now becoming more wildly

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.010 
ago it is now becoming more wildly
successful<00:01:08.399> and<00:01:09.030> something<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.479> people

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
successful and something that people

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.980 
successful and something that people
with<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.440> checkbooks<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:12.479> investments

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
with the checkbooks and the investments

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.169 
with the checkbooks and the investments
are<00:01:13.050> looking<00:01:13.350> at<00:01:13.500> as<00:01:13.649> a<00:01:13.920> logical<00:01:14.520> venue<00:01:14.910> to

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
are looking at as a logical venue to

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.570 
are looking at as a logical venue to
express<00:01:15.210> their<00:01:15.990> own<00:01:16.140> interests<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:17.460> get

their name out there and to be a part of
the<00:01:18.929> to<00:01:19.140> get<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.289> chunk<00:01:19.800> of<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> pot<00:01:20.160> so<00:01:20.700> there's

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
the to get a chunk of the pot so there's

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.010 
the to get a chunk of the pot so there's
a<00:01:20.910> lot<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.300> going<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.600> there's<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.840> money

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
a lot of that going on there's the money

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.560 
a lot of that going on there's the money
and<00:01:22.200> there's<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> end<00:01:22.649> there's<00:01:22.860> also<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.570> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
and there's the end there's also the the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.690 
and there's the end there's also the the
people<00:01:24.720> involved<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.649> think<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.429> third

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
people involved I think the third

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.450 
people involved I think the third
biggest<00:01:27.149> change<00:01:27.679> with<00:01:28.679> eSports<00:01:29.100> would<00:01:29.310> have

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
biggest change with eSports would have

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.969 
biggest change with eSports would have
to<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.090> don't<00:01:30.840> know<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.380> cutting<00:01:31.679> edge<00:01:31.800> of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
to be I don't know the cutting edge of

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.529 
to be I don't know the cutting edge of
it<00:01:32.130> right<00:01:32.369> now<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.759> there's<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.030> lot<00:01:33.179> of<00:01:33.210> games

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
it right now like there's a lot of games

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.210 
it right now like there's a lot of games
that<00:01:33.720> are<00:01:33.869> being<00:01:33.989> made<00:01:34.200> competitive<00:01:34.800> that<00:01:34.979> I

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
that are being made competitive that I

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.650 
that are being made competitive that I
don't<00:01:35.789> think<00:01:35.910> a<00:01:35.940> lot<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.090> people<00:01:36.149> considered

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660
