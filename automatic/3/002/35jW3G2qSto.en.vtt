00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
over the whole controversy of them not

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.180 
over the whole controversy of them not
being<00:00:45.450> mutant<00:00:45.870> turtles<00:00:46.200> but<00:00:46.350> alien<00:00:46.829> turtles

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
being mutant turtles but alien turtles

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.670 
being mutant turtles but alien turtles

know that this is kind of weird it's

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.430 
know that this is kind of weird it's
like<00:02:11.380> I<00:02:11.530> see<00:02:11.920> Donatello<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:12.880> Raphael<00:02:13.570> sliding

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
like I see Donatello and Raphael sliding

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.540 
like I see Donatello and Raphael sliding
down<00:02:14.710> like<00:02:15.250> this<00:02:15.430> snow<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.860> snow<00:02:17.860> hill<00:02:18.220> and

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
down like this snow the snow hill and

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.300 
down like this snow the snow hill and
then<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.630> then<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:19.990> guess<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.380> go<00:02:20.620> batters<00:02:21.070> up

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
then and then I guess I go batters up

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.190 
then and then I guess I go batters up
and<00:02:21.640> which<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.120> think<00:02:22.360> was<00:02:22.480> actually<00:02:22.810> kind<00:02:23.080> of

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
and which I think was actually kind of

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.040 
and which I think was actually kind of
neat<00:02:23.410> but<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.250> leads<00:02:24.490> up<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.760> Donatello<00:02:25.660> like

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
neat but it leads up to Donatello like

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.280 
neat but it leads up to Donatello like
kind<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:26.500> throwing<00:02:26.910> Raphael<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.900> he<00:02:29.080> hits

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290

their<00:03:31.300> limbs<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:32.050> head<00:03:32.350> kind<00:03:32.800> of<00:03:32.860> fitting

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
their limbs and head kind of fitting

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.850 
their limbs and head kind of fitting
inside<00:03:33.790> this<00:03:34.120> turtle<00:03:34.690> shell<00:03:34.959> hopefully<00:03:35.709> we

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
inside this turtle shell hopefully we

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.050 
inside this turtle shell hopefully we
see<00:03:35.890> that<00:03:36.190> in<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.340> movie<00:03:36.489> that'd<00:03:36.700> be<00:03:36.820> kind<00:03:37.030> of

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
see that in the movie that'd be kind of

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.430 
see that in the movie that'd be kind of
neat<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:38.620> guy<00:03:38.770> playing<00:03:39.100> master<00:03:39.850> shredder<00:03:40.440> the

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
neat the guy playing master shredder the

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.630 
neat the guy playing master shredder the
guy<00:03:41.590> from<00:03:41.739> The<00:03:41.890> Dark<00:03:42.070> Knight<00:03:42.160> I<00:03:42.340> forget<00:03:42.550> the

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
guy from The Dark Knight I forget the

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.010 
guy from The Dark Knight I forget the
actors<00:03:43.060> name<00:03:43.090> but<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:43.480> think<00:03:43.690> he's<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.810> good

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
actors name but I think he's a good

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.650 
actors name but I think he's a good
actor<00:03:44.140> I've<00:03:44.350> seen<00:03:44.560> him<00:03:44.650> in<00:03:44.739> many<00:03:44.920> movies<00:03:45.660> the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
actor I've seen him in many movies the

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.090 
actor I've seen him in many movies the
way<00:03:46.780> delivered<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.350> lines<00:03:47.590> he<00:03:47.769> basically

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
way delivered the lines he basically

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.640 
way delivered the lines he basically
narrates<00:03:48.700> through<00:03:49.209> this<00:03:49.330> trailer<00:03:49.870> I<00:03:50.080> thought

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
narrates through this trailer I thought

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.430 
narrates through this trailer I thought
he<00:03:50.860> did<00:03:51.130> a<00:03:51.160> good<00:03:51.370> job<00:03:51.430> not<00:03:52.360> really<00:03:52.750> happy<00:03:53.260> that

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
he did a good job not really happy that

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.630 
he did a good job not really happy that
it's<00:03:53.620> not<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:54.160> japanese<00:03:54.760> dude<00:03:55.150> but<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:56.560> know<00:03:56.739> so
