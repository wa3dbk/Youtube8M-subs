this Morris 1100 engine and I figured
either<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:06.899> get<00:00:07.020> stuck<00:00:07.379> into<00:00:07.589> it<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.330> spank<00:00:09.330> it

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420

I'm<00:00:29.010> going<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.310> do<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.580> just<00:00:29.609> give<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.300> good

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
I'm going to do is just give it a good

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.510 
I'm going to do is just give it a good
clean<00:00:30.720> up<00:00:30.929> I'm<00:00:31.500> just<00:00:31.679> changing<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.160> oil<00:00:32.219> at

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
clean up I'm just changing the oil at

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.560 
clean up I'm just changing the oil at
the<00:00:32.610> moment<00:00:32.910> we're<00:00:33.000> going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.180> flush<00:00:33.390> the

the moment we're going to flush the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.370 
the moment we're going to flush the
crankcase<00:00:33.899> out<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.800> just<00:00:35.070> filthy

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
crankcase out this is just filthy

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.740 
crankcase out this is just filthy
mechanically<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:37.530> not<00:00:37.680> bad<00:00:38.750> three

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
mechanically it's not bad three

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.450 
mechanically it's not bad three
cylinders<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.320> good<00:00:40.559> compression<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:41.250> them

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
cylinders have good compression on them

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.630 
cylinders have good compression on them
obviously<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.540> one<00:00:42.690> failed<00:00:43.460> they've<00:00:44.460> right

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
obviously that one failed they've right

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.000 
obviously that one failed they've right
up<00:00:44.760> with<00:00:44.910> leaky<00:00:45.149> head<00:00:45.480> gasket<00:00:46.020> water<00:00:46.620> leaking

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
up with leaky head gasket water leaking

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.930 
up with leaky head gasket water leaking
into<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> cylinder<00:00:47.730> for<00:00:47.850> quite<00:00:48.030> some<00:00:48.300> time

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
into the cylinder for quite some time

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.029 
into the cylinder for quite some time
giving<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.000> good<00:00:51.090> coat<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.360> paint<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:52.039> nice

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
giving a good coat of paint a nice

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.150 
giving a good coat of paint a nice
marine<00:00:53.629> type<00:00:54.629> green<00:00:55.020> color<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:55.890> makes<00:00:56.070> it

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
marine type green color so it makes it

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.500 
marine type green color so it makes it
look<00:00:56.280> like<00:00:56.340> an<00:00:56.520> old<00:00:56.610> marine<00:00:56.850> diesel<00:00:57.239> or

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
look like an old marine diesel or

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
look like an old marine diesel or
something<00:00:57.949> but<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.190> looks<00:00:59.340> good<00:01:00.289> I've<00:01:01.289> got<00:01:01.410> to

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
something but it looks good I've got to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.240 
something but it looks good I've got to
regrind<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.280> valve<00:01:02.579> seats<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.210> head

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
regrind the valve seats on the head

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.500 
regrind the valve seats on the head
regrind<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> bowels<00:01:05.760> I'll<00:01:05.939> find<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> couple<00:01:06.360> of

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
regrind the bowels I'll find a couple of

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.060 
regrind the bowels I'll find a couple of
replacement<00:01:07.080> valves<00:01:07.409> for<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> ones<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.950> are

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
replacement valves for the ones that are

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.820 
replacement valves for the ones that are
pitted<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:09.260> just<00:01:10.260> chuck<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.439> back<00:01:10.680> together

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
pitted and just chuck it back together

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.580 
pitted and just chuck it back together
and<00:01:11.130> hope<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.460> works<00:01:11.960> or<00:01:12.960> maybe<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.350> copy

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and hope it works or maybe a copy

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.580 
and hope it works or maybe a copy

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
a half still endures just because these

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.469 
a half still endures just because these

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
that's actually bought all of old bells

that's actually bought all of old bells

faith out and impress steel in 13
they're<00:01:40.650> pitted<00:01:41.509> that's<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.750> result<00:01:43.380> of

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
they're pitted that's just a result of

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.960 
they're pitted that's just a result of

running the cylinder with water in it

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.770 
running the cylinder with water in it
for<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.360> long<00:01:46.939> I'll<00:01:47.939> get<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.270> thing<00:01:48.479> cleaned

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
for so long I'll get this thing cleaned

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.520 
for so long I'll get this thing cleaned
up<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:50.189> worth<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.460> shot<00:01:51.200> might<00:01:52.200> get<00:01:52.350> some

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
up and it's worth a shot might get some

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.469 
up and it's worth a shot might get some
use<00:01:52.710> out<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.100> if<00:01:53.250> not<00:01:53.430> going<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.060> scrap<00:01:54.299> bin

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479

is<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> good<00:01:59.340> part<00:01:59.610> engine<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.600> can't

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
is a good part engine but I can't

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.600 
is a good part engine but I can't
justify<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.009> cost<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.520> rebuilding<00:02:02.700> it
