00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.660
 Weekly has been quite burdened with 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.849
 news so that some may 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.590
 be that it stays a little in the inkwell 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.270
 as they say but as always you 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.669
 I say if you want more news 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.050
 or want to see more content if not 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.279
 they say be a look at my channel that what 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.169
 you will have in the description if you are 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.520
 seeing this from optical esp and little else 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.660
 what to say we are going directly to comment 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.950
 what have been the news more 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.600
 important this past week 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.800
 let's start first talking about 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.930
 a brief news that has as 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.640
 protagonist to the pokemon and specifically 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.560
 of course to the nintendo company and 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.360
 is that they have recently announced that 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.900
 during the month of November this 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.350
 same year 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.370
 we will witness the reissue or 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.980
 remastering as you want to call it no 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.840
 I know very well how to define that 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.550
 concept of the original video games 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.740
 of the gameboy advance that came out in 2002 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.020
 known as pokemon ruby ​​and pokemon 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.420
 shapiro under the title of high pokemon 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.430
 sapphire and omega ruby pokemon I suppose 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.829
 will be something similar to what we saw in your 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.450
 day around red fire pokemon like that 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.729
 that as we said a kind of 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.140
 reissue so to speak of these 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.540
 titles the only thing we know at the moment 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.140
 sleep that we know and it's like I say that 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.270
 it will be exclusive 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.650
 and nintendo 3ds that will come out during the month 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.000
 November of this year and 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.380
 obviously the trailer you have in 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.150
 very short screen of which only 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.890
 we are shown the 2 pokémon 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.300
 legendary of these editions in order os 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.760
 I leave it in the description and as I say 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.290
 young confirmed we continue talking about 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.850
 another video game that also gave a lot 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.350
 to talk during last week 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.420
 this case known as the sunset 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.920
 overdrive multi ass of which we have not 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.050
 spoken too many times but 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.580
 many of you will remember that it was announced 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.430
 enough time and that is going to be a title 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.380
 exclusive of xbox band which you have 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.940
 right now on the screen the first job 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.170
 official of this title so far what 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.479
 same as we had seen in a kind 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.250
 of animation kinematics in which 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.840
 we could see we can see a little the 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.020
 thematic of the video game but finally 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.979
 we have something a little more detailed 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.420
 between lens you have on screen and that 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.340
 I will also leave you in the hard description 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.920
 approximately four minutes and on it 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.899
 they tell us practically all the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.369
 details of this video game with gameplay 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.289
 of course which is appreciated because 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.180
 finally we will know what the 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.760
 title tells us about weapons about 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.290
 the enemies the world skills 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.269
 complete and completely open 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.640
 in which we can move with 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.930
 our ability to parkour as 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.810
 who says in short 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.939
 very well, I'm really sorry it's a 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.530
 exclusive title of xbox one but good 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:29.510
 if you have the console, of course 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.189
 have a look because it has very very 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.900
 good looking at the moment has no date 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.540
 launch but is expected to come out 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.459
 the sale this same autumn of this year 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.109
 of 2014 let's now comment on a 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.280
 franchise that has many years and that 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.629
 many of you have also 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.879
 enjoyed when you are smaller 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.799
 you may remember some title of 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.469
 the delivery in the sayings of the 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.719
 franchise of a real winch then in this 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:52.370
 case the developers x games have 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.840
 assured that they are working in a 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.370
 new title of this franchise which 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.799
 it's funny because it's about 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.079
 one month they assured that it was not like that in a 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.000
 official statement so we do not know if 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.560
 they really just started like that 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.239
 start working on it but walk a 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.579
 little surprise sincerely in short 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.010
 what you have assured of this video game 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.930
 of which there are hardly any details yet 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.120
 we do not even know when he's going to leave or to 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.500
 that the forms absolutely nothing what 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.590
 The only thing they have said is that they will use 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.290
 obviously the new one real engine 4 and 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.790
 that at the moment the idea that they have for 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.709
 this video game is to be a complete 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.569
 free to play well we're not going to have to 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.530
 pay absolutely nothing any kind of 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.540
 microtransactions 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.370
 absolutely nothing everyone can 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.810
 enjoy this video game the rumors 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.670
 they suggest that he could leave for the 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.770
 could go out for platforms 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.330
 clicks or 4 xbox one and computer but still 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.560
 it's a little bit early to talk about everything 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.390
 that has as soon as there is more details 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.650
 like launch 2 I'll see you 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.720
 commenting by the way there is no 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.980
 absolutely no trailer of this 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.900
 video game so what he has superimposed 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.360
 on the screen I imagine it will be a demo 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.860
 technique of him a real in game 4 that 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.390
 supposed to be the graphical engine will use 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.650
 this video game and continuing a little 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.270
 with the aesthetics of videogames 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.100
 futurists which is something usual in 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.930
 the actual becomes mets continue speaking a 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.950
 little about the fate which a title 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.720
 there has not been spoken in infinity of 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.430
 Sometimes you know that to me 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.870
 personally, the call 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.550
 attention this title I do not know if you 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.260
 you think the same but good what there is 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.220
 what to comment on this occasion is a new 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.810
 trailer about three minutes 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.250
 approximately in which the 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.930
 developers apart from showing us 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.700
 new images that always appears 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.950
 of course they also do some that 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.750
 another reference to the subject of evolution 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.669
 and the emergence of our character as 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.560
 length of the video game as the theme of going 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.850
 raising the level of weapons that 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.420
 we can go finding ourselves from the 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.250
 video game armor objects 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.230
 dropping the enemies when the 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.120
 we defeated and it is that I remember that this 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.570
 title despite being a shooter will continue 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.580
 being an m type rpg or not at the moment 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.880
 you do not know all the details in 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.770
 around the nm facet today the facet 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.120
 multiplayer of this video game still 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.710
 is a bit to be determined and by 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.620
 discover all that but what yes 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.390
 we know it will be a more faithful rpg like 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.800
 who says to the genre that 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.510
 anything else we have a level 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.130
 defeating enemies we will get 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.780
 experience and we will raise that level what 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.880
 get out we will be doing much more 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.870
 We'll find better weapons and that 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.030
 it is a little bit what will have to be 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.340
 extend or description if you want 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.440
 take a look and finally remember that 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.940
 the release date this title is 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.710
 scheduled for September 9 and 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.150
 will leave for computer sorry to 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.920
 computer precisely is not going to come out 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.890
 it will only come out just for 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.930
 playstation 4 playstation3 xbox 360 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.400
 I wish I would leave for computer 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.080
 we continue now with another video game 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.730
 which has its launch date very 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.710
 close as he says in this case is 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.870
 watch dogs you know that in principle 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.330
 expected to go on sale on the 27th of 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.220
 this same month of May so inside 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.230
 we can not enjoy the streets 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.730
 of chicago from the point of view of 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.680
 watch game finally blocks which 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.480
 you have on screen is another new trailer 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.730
 pretty short also about two 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.410
 minutes in which the 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.840
 developers give a little more than 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.940
 information around the different 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.410
 friends and allies so to speak and 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.210
 enemies that we will find in the 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.340
 video game and in fact they do true 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.080
 emphasize the issue that we can not 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.420
 trust anybody and that in any 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.460
 moment any of these allies or 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.040
 alleged allies could betray us 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.540
 I do not know if it will be a kind of spoiler 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.640
 as who says but good keep in mind 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.190
 that we will discuss in a trailer 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.380
 I guess it will not be so in order Now 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.270
 promises an unexpected twist in the plot 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.400
 of the video game or at least of that 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.540
 think so we 'll see who our 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.580
 edition is not yet tradition in this 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.320
 We will see hopefully it will not be a 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.330
 spoiler anyway we have said 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.000
 remember to leave on the 27th of this month 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:28.180
 for playstation 3 playstation 4 xbox 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.380
 360 xbox computer and it will also exist 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.210
 a version for the platform 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.800
 nintendo wii I think it's supposed to 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.540
 will be released later this year so 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.490
 there will still be waiting for those 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.530
 that you are the owners of the console 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.060
 of nintendo and finally to finish 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.080
 precisely speaking of the issue of 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.759
 trailers and 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.680
 precisely also speaking of 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:46.689
 trailers set or related 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.129
 better said with the protagonists of the 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:49.990
 videogame we have to focus on 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:51.280
 this occasion in someone there is Felix in 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.689
 a title of which are treated infinity 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.580
 of occasions as you will remember 

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:56.469
 supposed to be a survival 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.849
 horror very true to the genre in which 

00:06:56.469 --> 00:07:00.250
 we will feel more afraid than ever and 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:02.139
 focused mainly on the importance of 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.099
 the first films of the yen hopefully 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:05.050
 that is the height of expectations 

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:06.639
 Well, as I said, there is a new 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.620
 trailer also quite short in which 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:12.189
 also the developers give their 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.719
 opinion give us their descriptions the 

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:14.710
 characteristics so to speak of 

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:16.030
 some protagonists that we 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.250
 we will find in this video game about 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.560
 all of the protagonist herself and also 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.990
 some of the allies of this same in 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.729
 end is not very important but always 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.810
 how I usually say thank you 

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:27.729

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.289
 what do they do in this trailer in 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:31.210

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:34.090
