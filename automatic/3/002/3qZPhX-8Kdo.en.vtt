 video show how to remove the hiss 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.240
 your microphone when you have already recorded 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.820
 video mount it for this to us 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:18.420
 need a program vegas pro 11 can 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.810
 and 12-13 just me a 32 bit system and 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.080
 I use the 11th century myself, let's say 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.470
 Our video is more accurately given to us 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.839
 need is my audio podcast here we look 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.450
 But if you have good headphones, then you 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:36.210
 will be over now hissing here let's 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.340
 I will even turn off my microphone 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.560
 I will have this video without processing 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.240
 immediately go to youtube as especially 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.740
 nothing will be mounted here 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.440
 let's turn off the microphone are n't we 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.480
 let's see the record in order to make sure 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.110
 the fact that there is a microphone behind small 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.360
 such 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.790
 no hiss but sounds can be said 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.079
 computer but the essence does not change let's 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.250
 check 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.600
 hello everyone with you phoenix and it's time 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.089
 resume started ie continue 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.479
 activity on yu tuba on this 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.479
 channel 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.460
 I think if you have good headphones you 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.990
 heard that there is a sound behind it 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.000
 if you have not heard him then he is 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.890
 then you could not hear him for that 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.740
 the reason that you are not very good 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.540
 headphones and 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.190
 or you are not set to full volume but 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.510
 the fact is there is a little 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.080
 hiss which is all the same 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.030
 nor hiss back background back noise which 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.110
 need to remove it is done everything is very 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:39.290
 I easily guessed it before we go 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.320
 here is the fix track and here we are raising it 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.330

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.630

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.800
 foreground background oh in the background noise water 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.660
 phoenix and it's time to renew 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.560
 started then continue 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:05.420
 on youtube on this particular channel because 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.660

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.200
 gordon 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:14.480
 abandoned so to speak as you can 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:20.600
 about me it was 24 whole 3 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:24.550
 10 decibels -24 10 scored and as you can see what 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.470
 it allows us it allows here noise 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.690
 deleted in those moments when you are nothing 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.560

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.570
 Yes, and you probably hear this noise 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.790
 that's when I keep silence completely 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.100
 turns off automatically it's all gone 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.100

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.390
 voice but at least you are present at the noise 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.630

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.700

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.290
