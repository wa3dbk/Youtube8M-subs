00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
short journey my biggest problem is in

short journey my biggest problem is in
the<00:01:16.799> height<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.640> there<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> panoramic<00:01:18.450> roof

the height but there is a panoramic roof
here<00:01:18.869> which<00:01:19.020> will<00:01:19.200> steal<00:01:19.409> some<00:01:19.619> Headroom<00:01:19.950> and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
here which will steal some Headroom and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.039 
here which will steal some Headroom and
actually<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.000> wouldn't<00:01:21.210> be<00:01:21.360> too<00:01:21.540> bad<00:01:21.570> over<00:01:22.020> a
