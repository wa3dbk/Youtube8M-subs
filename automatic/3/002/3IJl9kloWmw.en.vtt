00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
features as well we'll go into those

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.099 
features as well we'll go into those
first<00:00:25.920> off<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.029> long<00:00:27.510> oval<00:00:27.900> head<00:00:28.080> shape

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
fit also there's a bleeder valve so you

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.950 
fit also there's a bleeder valve so you
can<00:01:29.850> actually<00:01:30.090> let<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.360> air<00:01:30.540> out<00:01:30.570> much

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
can actually let that air out much

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.210 
can actually let that air out much
easier<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.350> pull<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.530> helmet<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.130> off

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
when that's deflated

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.060 
when that's deflated
since<00:01:34.290> we're<00:01:34.439> here<00:01:34.590> take<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> look<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
since we're here take a look the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.859 
since we're here take a look the
chinstrap<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> ratcheting<00:01:36.540> design

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
chinstrap this is a ratcheting design

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.960 
chinstrap this is a ratcheting design

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the outside the shield system is nice

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.780 
the outside the shield system is nice
and<00:01:46.439> easy<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.710> use<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.189> terms<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.549> everyday

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
and easy to use in terms of everyday

writing tab here on the left side up and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.770 
writing tab here on the left side up and
down<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.700> be<00:01:50.790> locked<00:01:51.030> into<00:01:51.240> place<00:01:51.420> using

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
down it can be locked into place using

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.960 
down it can be locked into place using
this<00:01:52.020> mechanism<00:01:52.380> click<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.280> into<00:01:53.520> place<00:01:53.729> and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
this mechanism click that into place and

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.160 
this mechanism click that into place and
now<00:01:54.149> it's<00:01:54.180> nice<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.659> secure

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
now it's nice and secure

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.830 
now it's nice and secure

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
also removing the shield it is possible

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.630 
also removing the shield it is possible
with<00:01:58.049> these<00:01:58.290> mechanisms<00:01:58.799> on<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.100> side<00:01:59.369> now

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
with these mechanisms on the side now

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.069 
with these mechanisms on the side now
you<00:02:00.149> need<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.420> have<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.780> shield<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
you need to have the shield in the

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.929 
you need to have the shield in the
upward<00:02:01.439> position<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.670> locked

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
upward position and this can be locked

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.630 
upward position and this can be locked
as<00:02:03.119> well<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.140> see<00:02:04.380> if<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.860> press<00:02:05.490> this

red tab to the back it's locked

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.440 
red tab to the back it's locked
once<00:02:08.069> we<00:02:08.220> unlock<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:08.849> can<00:02:09.000> turn<00:02:09.239> these

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
once we unlock it we can turn these

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.199 
once we unlock it we can turn these
forwards<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.500> they<00:02:10.979> will<00:02:11.129> pop<00:02:11.340> right<00:02:11.610> off<00:02:11.670> now

these<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.810> can<00:02:27.960> only<00:02:28.110> put<00:02:28.320> them<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.530> one<00:02:28.740> way

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
these you can only put them in one way

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.130 
these you can only put them in one way
they'll<00:02:29.310> fit<00:02:29.640> one<00:02:30.060> direction<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.810> flip<00:02:31.050> it

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
they'll fit one direction you flip it

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.470 
they'll fit one direction you flip it
180<00:02:31.560> degrees<00:02:31.650> they<00:02:32.160> won't<00:02:32.370> fit<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:33.000> little

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
180 degrees they won't fit so a little

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.000 
180 degrees they won't fit so a little
bit<00:02:33.660> hard<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.930> change<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.290> shield<00:02:34.560> but<00:02:34.740> once

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
bit hard to change the shield but once

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.050 
bit hard to change the shield but once
you<00:02:35.160> figure<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.550> out

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
you figure it out

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.880 
you figure it out
you'll<00:02:36.270> have<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.600> down<00:02:36.780> that's<00:02:37.020> no<00:02:37.230> problem<00:02:37.470> so

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
you'll have it down that's no problem so

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.130 
you'll have it down that's no problem so
that's<00:02:38.100> nice<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.550> see<00:02:38.760> okay<00:02:39.450> here's<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.930> last

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
that's nice to see okay here's the last

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.660 
that's nice to see okay here's the last
big<00:02:40.440> feature<00:02:40.710> we<00:02:40.890> need<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.070> talk<00:02:41.190> about<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.580> is

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
big feature we need to talk about it is

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.940 
big feature we need to talk about it is
the<00:02:41.700> drop-down<00:02:42.330> Sun<00:02:43.320> shield<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.710> this<00:02:43.860> is

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
the drop-down Sun shield so this is

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.380 
the drop-down Sun shield so this is
called<00:02:44.160> their<00:02:44.280> full<00:02:44.520> Eclipse<00:02:44.790> drop-down

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
called their full Eclipse drop-down

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.290 
called their full Eclipse drop-down
shield<00:02:45.980> very<00:02:46.980> easy<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.400> activate<00:02:47.670> on<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.090> left

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
shield very easy to activate on the left

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.300 
shield very easy to activate on the left
chin<00:02:48.540> bar<00:02:48.720> here<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:48.960> small<00:02:49.290> small<00:02:49.920> button<00:02:50.220> you

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
chin bar here a small small button you

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.310 
chin bar here a small small button you
can<00:02:50.460> see<00:02:50.610> it<00:02:50.700> with<00:02:50.790> red<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.300> open<00:02:51.630> black<00:02:52.110> to

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
can see it with red to open black to

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.200 
can see it with red to open black to
close<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.860> this<00:02:53.310> thing<00:02:53.520> comes<00:02:53.760> down<00:02:53.940> pretty

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
close and this thing comes down pretty

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.790 
close and this thing comes down pretty
far<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.540> like<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:54.990> it<00:02:55.080> goes<00:02:55.170> down<00:02:55.350> below<00:02:55.590> the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
far I like that it goes down below the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.440 
far I like that it goes down below the
nose<00:02:55.980> guard<00:02:56.280> should<00:02:56.670> keep<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:57.060> out<00:02:57.210> of<00:02:57.330> your

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
nose guard should keep that out of your
