00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
this live bait fishing takes a little

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.559 
this live bait fishing takes a little
bit<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.259> practice<00:01:10.500> but<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.340> do<00:01:11.729> like<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.270> bait

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:12.569 
bit of practice but I do like this bait

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:14.570 
bit of practice but I do like this bait
feeder<00:01:12.810> reel<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.350> pretty<00:01:13.619> neat<00:01:13.860> although

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
feeder reel it's pretty neat although

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.809 
feeder reel it's pretty neat although
last<00:01:14.819> night<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.119> had<00:01:15.659> one<00:01:16.280> pull<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.429> light<00:01:17.640> out

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:17.819 
last night I had one pull the light out

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:19.910 
last night I had one pull the light out
so<00:01:17.850> quick<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.509> got<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.690> big<00:01:18.929> bird's<00:01:19.350> nest<00:01:19.679> than

so quick I got a big bird's nest than
the<00:01:20.009> reel<00:01:20.190> so<00:01:20.550> I'm<00:01:21.479> starting<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.470> tighten<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
the reel so I'm starting to tighten the

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.740 
the reel so I'm starting to tighten the
rear<00:01:23.340> drag<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> little<00:01:24.030> bit<00:01:24.270> tighter<00:01:24.600> to

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
rear drag a little bit tighter to

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.590 
rear drag a little bit tighter to
hopefully<00:01:25.560> prevent<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:30.000> when<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.390> caught

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600

experimenting<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:47.939> different<00:01:48.450> lengths<00:01:48.840> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
experimenting with different lengths and
