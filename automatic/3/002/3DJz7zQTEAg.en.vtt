something I don't know how she figured
out<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.509> she<00:01:30.929> had<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.670> find<00:01:32.670> some<00:01:32.969> way<00:01:32.999> like<00:01:33.119> go

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
out but she had to find some way like go

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.209 
out but she had to find some way like go
to<00:01:33.899> the<00:01:34.049> store<00:01:34.319> or<00:01:34.350> whatever<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.920> don't<00:01:34.979> know

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
to the store or whatever I don't know

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:36.800

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.270 
she had to talk to someone about it so I
feel<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.170> it's<00:01:37.319> so<00:01:37.469> much<00:01:37.619> more<00:01:37.770> convenient

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
pretty sure they don't have a store

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.190
