of days that you're playing on tactical

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.069 
of days that you're playing on tactical
because<00:02:05.939> if<00:02:06.060> you're<00:02:06.210> used<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.570> going<00:02:06.689> up<00:02:06.930> and

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
because if you're used to going up and

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.169 
because if you're used to going up and
panic<00:02:07.350> knifing<00:02:07.680> people<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.879> know<00:02:09.000> if

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
panic knifing people and you know if

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.570 
panic knifing people and you know if
you're<00:02:09.330> going<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.920> crouch<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.190> corner<00:02:11.550> and

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
you're going to crouch in a corner and

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.330 
you're going to crouch in a corner and
you're<00:02:11.849> used<00:02:12.150> to

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
you're used to

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.850 
you're used to
hitting<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:13.599> know<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.989> circle<00:02:14.440> button<00:02:14.560> it

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
hitting you know the circle button it

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.860 
hitting you know the circle button it
will<00:02:15.010> get<00:02:15.190> difficult<00:02:15.430> because<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.750> know

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
will get difficult because you know

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.440 
will get difficult because you know
Arthur<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.709> new<00:02:17.879> prime<00:02:18.879> button<00:02:19.239> so<00:02:19.420> you

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
Arthur is the new prime button so you

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.910
