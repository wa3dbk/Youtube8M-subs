hi<00:00:00.810> good<00:00:01.350> morning<00:00:01.410> and<00:00:01.829> welcome<00:00:02.190> back<00:00:02.399> today

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
hi good morning and welcome back today

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.420 
hi good morning and welcome back today
let's<00:00:03.449> learn<00:00:03.689> about<00:00:03.929> how<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.770> catalytic

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
let's learn about how the catalytic

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.340 
let's learn about how the catalytic
converters<00:00:06.180> work<00:00:06.420> how<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.839> chemical

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
converters work how the chemical

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.110 
converters work how the chemical
reaction<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:07.919> like<00:00:08.040> catalytic<00:00:08.639> converter<00:00:08.970> is

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
reaction is like catalytic converter is

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.879 
reaction is like catalytic converter is
happening<00:00:09.599> so<00:00:10.050> if<00:00:10.139> you<00:00:10.230> don't<00:00:10.530> know<00:00:10.590> watch<00:00:10.740> the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
happening so if you don't know watch the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.830 
happening so if you don't know watch the
canvas<00:00:11.280> you<00:00:11.400> can<00:00:11.429> order<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.000> brief<00:00:12.360> about<00:00:12.719> it

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
canvas you can order and brief about it

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.110 
canvas you can order and brief about it
the<00:00:13.469> function<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.250> chemistry<00:00:14.670> converter

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
the function of the chemistry converter

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.290 
the function of the chemistry converter
is<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:16.049> reduce<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.980> amount<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.609> half-full

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
is to reduce the amount of the half-full

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.900 
is to reduce the amount of the half-full
pollutants<00:00:18.840> going<00:00:19.260> outside<00:00:19.500> an<00:00:20.039> automobile

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
pollutants going outside an automobile

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.759 
pollutants going outside an automobile
so<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.420> an<00:00:21.539> automobile<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.470> have<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
so this is an automobile we have the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.609 
so this is an automobile we have the
engine<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> XO<00:00:24.869> stripped<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
engine and this is the XO stripped the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.470 
engine and this is the XO stripped the
excess<00:00:25.920> gas<00:00:26.130> has<00:00:26.369> been<00:00:26.519> pushed<00:00:26.789> off<00:00:26.970> there

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
excess gas has been pushed off there

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.109 
excess gas has been pushed off there
will<00:00:27.689> be<00:00:27.720> hydrocarbons<00:00:28.650> carbon<00:00:29.279> monoxide<00:00:30.090> and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
will be hydrocarbons carbon monoxide and

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.450 
will be hydrocarbons carbon monoxide and
nitrous<00:00:30.660> oxides<00:00:31.109> coming<00:00:31.560> out<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.070> exhaust

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
nitrous oxides coming out of the exhaust

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.150 
nitrous oxides coming out of the exhaust
so<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> characteristic<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.010> water

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
so we have a characteristic and water

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.150 
so we have a characteristic and water
located<00:00:35.700> over<00:00:35.820> here<00:00:36.020> okay<00:00:37.050> which<00:00:37.290> reduces<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
located over here okay which reduces the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.280 
located over here okay which reduces the
harmful<00:00:38.610> components<00:00:38.910> that's<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.690> common<00:00:40.140> ox

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
harmful components that's a common ox

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.590 
harmful components that's a common ox
and<00:00:40.500> hydrocarbons<00:00:41.219> include<00:00:41.489> less<00:00:42.000> half<00:00:42.360> full

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
and hydrocarbons include less half full

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.529 
and hydrocarbons include less half full
pollutants<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.770> that's<00:00:44.250> what<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.910> catalytic

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
pollutants so that's what a catalytic

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.930 
pollutants so that's what a catalytic
converter<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.230> doing<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.770> reduce<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.640> effect

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
converter is doing to reduce the effect

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.850 
converter is doing to reduce the effect
of<00:00:48.090> global<00:00:48.329> warming<00:00:48.629> due<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.590> harmful

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
of global warming due to the harmful

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.830 
of global warming due to the harmful
pollutants<00:00:50.520> being<00:00:50.879> pushed<00:00:51.149> out<00:00:51.300> by<00:00:51.719> an

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
pollutants being pushed out by an

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.959 
pollutants being pushed out by an
automobile<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.770> now<00:00:52.949> let's<00:00:53.190> see<00:00:53.370> how<00:00:53.579> they

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
automobile so now let's see how they

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.689 
automobile so now let's see how they
exact<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.949> catalytic

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
exact you up so this is the catalytic

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.819 
exact you up so this is the catalytic
converter<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.840> catalytic<00:00:58.289> converter

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
converter and this catalytic converter

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.920 
converter and this catalytic converter
is<00:00:59.840> composed<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.109> metals<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:03.210> platinum

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
is composed of metals like the platinum

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.359 
is composed of metals like the platinum
the<00:01:04.890> rhodium<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.960> also<00:01:06.960> palladium<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.010> these

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
the rhodium and also palladium so these

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.730 
the rhodium and also palladium so these
are<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> three<00:01:09.060> metals<00:01:09.479> commonly<00:01:10.229> used<00:01:10.500> in

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
are the three metals commonly used in

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.190 
are the three metals commonly used in
catalytic<00:01:11.220> reactions<00:01:12.030> there<00:01:12.659> are<00:01:12.780> three

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
catalytic reactions there are three

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.890 
catalytic reactions there are three
stages<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.159> reaction<00:01:14.790> or<00:01:15.000> chemical<00:01:15.450> reaction

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
stages of reaction or chemical reaction

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.560 
stages of reaction or chemical reaction
happening<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:17.040> catalytic<00:01:17.549> converter<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
happening in a catalytic converter the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.510 
happening in a catalytic converter the
stage<00:01:18.869> 1<00:01:19.320> stage<00:01:20.100> 1<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.780> reduction<00:01:22.520> catalytic

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
stage 1 stage 1 is a reduction catalytic

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.179 
stage 1 stage 1 is a reduction catalytic
reaction<00:01:24.509> which<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.689> happening<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.560> here

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
reaction which is happening so here

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.120 
reaction which is happening so here
platinum<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.240> rhodium<00:01:27.720> uh<00:01:28.049> play<00:01:28.470> their<00:01:28.799> part

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
platinum and rhodium uh play their part

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.969 
platinum and rhodium uh play their part
what<00:01:29.640> they<00:01:29.850> do<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.450> reduce<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.409> amount<00:01:31.829> of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
what they do is the reduce the amount of

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.060 
what they do is the reduce the amount of
NOx<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.880> amount<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.329> nitrous<00:01:33.869> oxide<00:01:34.070> being

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
NOx the amount of nitrous oxide being

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.039 
NOx the amount of nitrous oxide being
coming<00:01:35.700> out<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.210> next<00:01:36.479> source<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.869> been

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
coming out of a next source is been

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.770 
coming out of a next source is been
reduced<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.890> have<00:01:38.100> nitrogen<00:01:38.790> oxide<00:01:39.570> and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
reduced so we have nitrogen oxide and

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.929 
reduced so we have nitrogen oxide and
nitrogen<00:01:40.320> dioxide<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.310> they<00:01:41.460> are<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.700> NOx

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
nitrogen dioxide so they are the NOx

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.740 
nitrogen dioxide so they are the NOx
okay<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.140> North<00:01:43.380> summit<00:01:43.649> reduce<00:01:44.180> o2n<00:01:45.180> Nome<00:01:45.509> is

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
okay the North summit reduce o2n Nome is

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.039 
okay the North summit reduce o2n Nome is
reduced<00:01:46.229> into<00:01:46.619> n2<00:01:47.430> nitrogen<00:01:47.820> oxide<00:01:48.659> plus

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
reduced into n2 nitrogen oxide plus

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.789 
reduced into n2 nitrogen oxide plus
oxygen<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:50.189> no.2<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:51.000> reduced<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.799> nitrogen

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
oxygen to no.2 is reduced to nitrogen

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.090 
oxygen to no.2 is reduced to nitrogen
oxide<00:01:53.399> plus<00:01:53.700> 2<00:01:54.210> O<00:01:54.240> 2<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.590> see<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
combined with n plus n 2 cube n 2 so

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.900 
combined with n plus n 2 cube n 2 so
here<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.090> can<00:02:42.239> see<00:02:42.450> that's<00:02:43.260> how<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:44.400> n<00:02:44.550> 2<00:02:44.790> is

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
here you can see that's how the n 2 is

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.670 
here you can see that's how the n 2 is

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
becoming more and accident is being

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.190 
becoming more and accident is being
released<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.220> that's<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.790> stage<00:02:48.000> 1<00:02:48.360> let's<00:02:49.050> go

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
released so that's the stage 1 let's go

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.760 
released so that's the stage 1 let's go
to<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.560> stage<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:50.070> stage<00:02:50.670> 2<00:02:51.360> we<00:02:52.050> have<00:02:52.320> two

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
to the stage to stage 2 we have two

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.110 
to the stage to stage 2 we have two
metals<00:02:53.130> playing<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.580> roles<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:53.970> it's

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
metals playing the roles and it's

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.760 
metals playing the roles and it's
platinum<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.900> palladium<00:02:55.380> there<00:02:56.420> creates<00:02:57.420> an

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
platinum and palladium there creates an

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.350 
platinum and palladium there creates an
oxidation<00:02:58.770> reaction<00:02:58.800> that<00:02:59.550> catalyzes<00:03:00.060> an

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
oxidation reaction that catalyzes an

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.960 
oxidation reaction that catalyzes an
oxidation<00:03:01.140> reaction<00:03:01.220> what<00:03:02.220> they<00:03:02.370> do<00:03:02.580> is<00:03:02.790> they

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
oxidation reaction what they do is they

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.300 
oxidation reaction what they do is they
oxidizes<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.720> hydrocarbons<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:04.860> harmful

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
oxidizes the hydrocarbons the harmful

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.000 
oxidizes the hydrocarbons the harmful
hydrocarbon<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.660> harmful<00:03:07.049> carbon

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
hydrocarbon and the harmful carbon

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.729 
hydrocarbon and the harmful carbon
monoxide<00:03:08.820> here<00:03:09.330> you<00:03:09.420> can<00:03:09.600> see<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.320> carbon

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
monoxide here you can see the carbon

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.920 
monoxide here you can see the carbon
bond<00:03:10.920> upset<00:03:11.310> over<00:03:11.549> here<00:03:11.820> plus<00:03:12.480> oxygen

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
bond upset over here plus oxygen

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.259 
bond upset over here plus oxygen
oxidation<00:03:13.890> reaction<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.340> happening<00:03:14.549> and<00:03:14.940> they

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
oxidation reaction is happening and they

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.449 
oxidation reaction is happening and they
are<00:03:15.299> going<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.840> do<00:03:15.959> less<00:03:16.530> harmful<00:03:16.980> carbon

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
are going to do less harmful carbon

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.890 
are going to do less harmful carbon
dioxide<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:19.260> harmful<00:03:19.799> carbon<00:03:20.040> monoxide

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
dioxide so the harmful carbon monoxide

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.449 
dioxide so the harmful carbon monoxide
oxidizes<00:03:21.900> with<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.200> oxygen<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.920> give<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.220> less

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
oxidizes with the oxygen to give a less

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.180 
oxidizes with the oxygen to give a less
harmful<00:03:23.760> carbon<00:03:24.150> dioxide<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.769> same<00:03:25.980> is

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
harmful carbon dioxide so the same is

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.610 
harmful carbon dioxide so the same is
hydrocarbons<00:03:26.970> are<00:03:27.120> also<00:03:27.420> converted<00:03:27.989> into<00:03:28.080> h2o

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
hydrocarbons are also converted into h2o

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.610 
hydrocarbons are also converted into h2o
that's<00:03:29.400> what<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.670> river<00:03:29.940> by<00:03:30.600> an<00:03:30.780> oxidation

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
that's what a river by an oxidation

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.819 
that's what a river by an oxidation
reaction<00:03:31.650> that's<00:03:32.519> stage<00:03:33.000> two<00:03:33.440> so<00:03:34.440> here<00:03:34.650> we

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
reaction that's stage two so here we

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:35.270 
reaction that's stage two so here we
have

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
have

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.900 
have
NOx<00:03:35.790> have<00:03:36.060> been<00:03:36.239> reduced<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.750> nitrogen<00:03:37.230> oxygen

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
NOx have been reduced to nitrogen oxygen

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.100 
NOx have been reduced to nitrogen oxygen
hydrocarbons<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.060> carbon<00:03:39.180> monoxide<00:03:39.360> reduce

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide reduce

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.170 
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide reduce
to<00:03:40.260> whatever<00:03:40.980> way<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.310> promote<00:03:41.519> carbon

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
to whatever way and promote carbon

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.000 
to whatever way and promote carbon
dioxide<00:03:42.720> so<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:42.930> harmful<00:03:43.380> components<00:03:43.680> are

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
dioxide so the harmful components are

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.740 
dioxide so the harmful components are
going<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.370> be<00:03:44.489> ready<00:03:44.760> used<00:03:45.000> in<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.269> two<00:03:45.480> stages

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
going to be ready used in the two stages

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.289 
going to be ready used in the two stages
and<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.560> third<00:03:46.890> stage<00:03:47.220> we<00:03:47.519> have<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:47.730> control

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
and the third stage we have a control

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.780

controls the injection system and also
this<00:04:48.150> oxygen<00:04:48.870> if<00:04:49.080> we<00:04:49.289> have<00:04:49.470> enough<00:04:49.710> oxygen

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
this oxygen if we have enough oxygen

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.120 
this oxygen if we have enough oxygen
it<00:04:50.610> creates<00:04:51.120> an<00:04:51.270> oxidation<00:04:52.050> reaction<00:04:52.130> to

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
it creates an oxidation reaction to

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.790 
it creates an oxidation reaction to
convert<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.669> hydrocarbons<00:04:54.510> and<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:55.410> carbon

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
convert the hydrocarbons and the carbon

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.500 
convert the hydrocarbons and the carbon
monoxide<00:04:55.919> into<00:04:56.520> less<00:04:56.760> harmful<00:04:56.789> components

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
monoxide into less harmful components

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.870 
monoxide into less harmful components
like<00:04:57.870> carbon<00:04:58.229> dioxide<00:04:58.260> and<00:04:58.830> water<00:04:58.950> vapor<00:04:59.099> so

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
like carbon dioxide and water vapor so

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.790 
like carbon dioxide and water vapor so
that's<00:05:00.180> how<00:05:00.720> the<00:05:00.780> chemical<00:05:01.260> reaction<00:05:01.680> is

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
that's how the chemical reaction is

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.710 
that's how the chemical reaction is
happening<00:05:01.950> in<00:05:02.250> a<00:05:02.310> catalytic<00:05:02.700> converter<00:05:02.880> if
