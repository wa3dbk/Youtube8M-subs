00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.910
 you know that a game of open looks 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:12.280
 that the children of 16 hours 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:14.320
 and 24 years later he will see live again 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.990
 and full color a cup final 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.720
 world between germany and argentina in the 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.270
 last lived edgardo codesal headed 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.359
 the match from the field in the world 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.720
 from italy 90 many memories obviously 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.340
 of 24 years ago and especially that 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.250
 it is repeated in quite circumstances 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.550
 similar a German team that like 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.920
 always comes very strong solid very 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.960
 compacted all its lines with large 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.059
 figures and a great work world author 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.210
 and an Argentine who has not been seen 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.370
 still that there is not and is not over 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.800
 to set as a team and as 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.199
 Messi individualities always 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.100
 leading everyone but on the one hand 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:59.379
 Higuain sometimes bari at a time and 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.930
 trying to do something but you can not see 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.119
 that team joint a bit the same 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.010
 in circumstances of 24 years a Germany 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.960
 very strong a very diminished argentina 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.420
 but good when they reach the final all 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.729
 is equated and the two have the same 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.909
 possibilities he won the pulse to be 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.310
 designated the referee of that final the 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.070
 of that day would be the last game of his 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.439
 career as a professional referee a 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.240
 world that you will never forget in that 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.400
 we were doing all the functions so much 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.979
 of arbitrators as of assistants then 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.280
 I was quite involved I had three 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.040
 flag aces 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.380
 and he had two referees and he already had five 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.270
 participation in very beautiful matches 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.300
 for example of assistant he touched me and the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.900
 soft earth touched me 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.610
 also holland against egypt a match 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.120
 very controversial because there was a criminal 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.380
 that was serious outside in 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.540
 fortunately it was not from my sector that 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.100
 could have seen me involved as 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.650
 assistant in that position situation 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.140
 in the end things were happening and my 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.910
 work I did the best I could and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.940
 accumulated qualifications for 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.830
 to be able to reach any in 24 years changed 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.350
 many things in football 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.360
 the only thing that has not been 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.670
 modified is the decision that I take 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.040
 code and that changed the course to that 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.280
 match that gave the world cup to 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.100
 the Germans declared of course of 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.610
 the end of that dialing match 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.950
 of the penal being missing either yesterday we are 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.870
 reliving some of the images and 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.880
 Obviously there are things that are not 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.000
 they practiced at the time that people 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.160
 did not see much are fixed down on the leg 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.410
 that if the leg tries to go to the ball 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.840
 that does not come of course but with the 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.629
 forearm supports from behind 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.030
 the German player and makes him fall 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.160
 definitely for me there was never 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.870
 no doubt but chicha generated so much 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.459
 controversy over Argentine passion more than 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.530
 nothing not because he will always be the 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.680
 amateur and the Argentine people is very 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.640
 passionate about football just like here 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.680
 in Brazil but definitely when 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.599
 you have that passion there are things that you do not 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.190
 comes to see what he gets to see is that 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.680
 they lost the end of the world with 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.470
 maradona on the court that was his 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.390
 second to cup he could have won and 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.700
 they lost it missing either not after 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.190
 of having fought in two teams so 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.049
 uneven but they had fought 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.549
 strongly for trying to get through so 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.799
 less to overtime and 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.319
 probably to the penalties as it came 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.810
 going to argentina and over there getting 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.180
 again the cup but it got frustrated and I 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.739
 I think the anger is greater when I was 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.260
 so close to the edge a little what 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.860
 happened to mexico not to say the feeling of 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.440
 be so close 23 minutes and stay 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.950
 out I think that that still gives more 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.170
 and I kept the ball but it was still 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.630
 a concern not had told 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.430
 my assistants that where I finished the 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.830
 party the first thing that the one that was 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.420
 the closer you run for the ball and so what 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.850
 He said putting together Colombian holes 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.220
 was with me the ball was very 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.960
 he's ran and I take it and he gave it to me 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.760
 practically when you get to the dressing room 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.710
 because the term was also very 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.100
 difficult all Argentine banking comes 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:18.489
 on my own tap many insults 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.370
 that was reported and never sanctioned 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.980
 but if the arbitration cell was reported 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.810
 then, arming, he always stayed with the 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.310
 ball and the locker handed it to me and I 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.550
 I still have it in power but in 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.890
 that era we were I think a 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.480
 great trophy was almost almost like having the 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.170
 world cup the hands was for 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.170
 we the ball 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.130
 but if you do not go 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.370
 that has gone wrong
