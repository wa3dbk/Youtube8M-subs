lot of differences but they did make
some<00:00:21.750> subtle<00:00:22.020> differences<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.939> they<00:00:23.939> look

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
some subtle differences that they look

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.929 
some subtle differences that they look
subtle<00:00:24.510> but<00:00:24.660> they<00:00:24.779> end<00:00:24.930> up<00:00:25.050> being<00:00:25.320> pretty

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
subtle but they end up being pretty

most places the 3 plus is 399 so a

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.130 
most places the 3 plus is 399 so a
little<00:00:37.739> bit<00:00:37.890> more<00:00:38.570> but<00:00:39.570> I'll<00:00:39.629> go<00:00:39.750> through<00:00:39.989> some

little bit more but I'll go through some
of<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.290> changes<00:00:40.469> they<00:00:40.829> made<00:00:41.040> which<00:00:41.370> kind<00:00:41.610> of

of the changes they made which kind of
makes<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.000> worth<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:43.129> first<00:00:44.129> off<00:00:44.539> if<00:00:45.539> you'll

notice the you actually probably won't
be<00:00:48.329> able<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.510> notice<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.050> yo<00:00:49.170> Pro<00:00:49.440> and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
be able to notice this but yo Pro and

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.920 
be able to notice this but yo Pro and
totally<00:00:50.340> rebuilt<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.879> lens<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.420> hero<00:00:51.690> 3

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.939 
totally rebuilt the lens on the hero 3
plus<00:00:53.270> it's<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.449> major<00:00:54.930> improvement<00:00:55.320> improve

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
sharpness on the color balancing

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.099 
sharpness on the color balancing
according<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> website<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.719> can

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
according to the website so you can

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.080 
according to the website so you can
actually<00:01:01.500> tell<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.739> big<00:01:01.980> difference<00:01:02.090> some

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
actually tell a big difference some

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.929 
actually tell a big difference some

comparison shots from the 3 + 3 +
secondly<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.900> weight<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> camera<00:01:07.740> it's

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
secondly the weight of the camera it's

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.210 
secondly the weight of the camera it's
about<00:01:08.040> twenty<00:01:08.340> percent<00:01:09.380> wider<00:01:10.380> than<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.040> hero

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
about twenty percent wider than the hero

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.320 
about twenty percent wider than the hero
3<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:14.040> its<00:01:14.490> twenty<00:01:14.850> percent<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
3 and the its twenty percent of the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.320 
3 and the its twenty percent of the
camera<00:01:15.659> itself<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:16.110> actually<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.439> same<00:01:16.619> size

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
camera itself is actually the same size

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.719 
camera itself is actually the same size
but<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.390> casings<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.740> actual<00:01:20.040> casing<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.549> it

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
but the casings the actual casing on it

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.870 
but the casings the actual casing on it
is<00:01:20.880> twenty<00:01:21.810> percent<00:01:22.080> smaller<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.460> little

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
is twenty percent smaller so a little

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.370 
is twenty percent smaller so a little
bit<00:01:24.000> more<00:01:24.180> compact<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:24.990> see<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
bit more compact you can see the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.480 
bit more compact you can see the
differences<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.850> casings<00:01:27.299> themselves

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
differences in the casings themselves

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.399 
differences in the casings themselves
I'm<00:01:29.490> gonna<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.479> shadows<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:31.229> a

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
I'm gonna the shadows here a

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.300 
I'm gonna the shadows here a
little<00:01:32.130> bit<00:01:32.280> redesigned<00:01:33.560> on<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.829> top<00:01:35.040> there

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
little bit redesigned on the top there

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.870 
little bit redesigned on the top there
that<00:01:35.490> was<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> great<00:01:35.790> plus<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.930> compared<00:01:37.320> to

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
that was a great plus it's compared to

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.460 
that was a great plus it's compared to
the<00:01:38.880> old<00:01:39.000> here<00:01:39.150> with<00:01:39.299> three<00:01:39.600> there<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.320> much

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the old here with three there so much

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.210 
the old here with three there so much
smaller<00:01:40.829> casing<00:01:41.369> as<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.700> see<00:01:41.850> there<00:01:43.220> next

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
smaller casing as you can see there next

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.429 
smaller casing as you can see there next
and<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> really<00:01:45.149> big<00:01:45.329> addition<00:01:46.170> with

on the battery life on the three plus
one<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:12.880> biggest<00:02:13.060> changes<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.630> you'll

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
one of the biggest changes that you'll

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.020 
one of the biggest changes that you'll
read<00:02:13.900> about<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.709> super<00:02:15.130> view<00:02:15.340> mode<00:02:15.520> on<00:02:15.819> the

read about is the super view mode on the
hero<00:02:16.239> 3<00:02:16.569> plus<00:02:17.190> that's<00:02:18.190> why<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.370> most

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
hero 3 plus that's why the most

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.280 
hero 3 plus that's why the most
talked-about<00:02:18.910> enhancement<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:19.870> basically

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
talked-about enhancement and basically

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.100 
talked-about enhancement and basically
long<00:02:20.709> story<00:02:20.739> short<00:02:21.370> what<00:02:21.520> that<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:21.880> it<00:02:22.120> gives

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
long story short what that is it gives

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.800 
long story short what that is it gives
you<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.290> ability<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.709> capture<00:02:24.010> more<00:02:24.810> without

you the ability to capture more without

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.630 
you the ability to capture more without
the<00:02:26.170> warping<00:02:26.620> load<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.130> some<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.430> older

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
the warping load and some of the older

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.240 
the warping load and some of the older
models<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.150> tin<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.660> three<00:02:29.250> so

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
models the tin you and the three so

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.640 
models the tin you and the three so
that's<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.520> big<00:02:30.670> addition<00:02:31.530> when<00:02:32.530> you're

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
that's a big addition when you're

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.850 
that's a big addition when you're
filming<00:02:33.300> also<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.540> auto<00:02:34.750> low<00:02:35.110> light<00:02:35.350> mode<00:02:35.380> was

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
filming also the auto low light mode was

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.380 
filming also the auto low light mode was
another<00:02:36.069> big<00:02:36.280> advancement<00:02:36.850> they<00:02:37.030> did<00:02:37.209> with<00:02:37.360> a

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
another big advancement they did with a

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.380 
another big advancement they did with a
three<00:02:37.630> plus<00:02:38.160> it's<00:02:39.160> basically<00:02:39.640> an<00:02:39.849> automatic

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
three plus it's basically an automatic

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.420 
three plus it's basically an automatic
adjustment<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:42.130> your<00:02:42.160> frame<00:02:42.550> rate<00:02:43.110> when<00:02:44.430> white

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
adjustment to your frame rate when white

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.729 
adjustment to your frame rate when white
starts<00:02:45.850> to<00:02:46.030> become<00:02:46.239> dimmer<00:02:46.989> band<00:02:47.350> starts<00:02:47.650> to

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
starts to become dimmer band starts to

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.280 
starts to become dimmer band starts to
get<00:02:47.830> dark<00:02:48.090> long<00:02:49.090> story<00:02:49.360> short<00:02:49.510> on<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:49.989> one<00:02:50.170> is

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
get dark long story short on that one is

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.800 
get dark long story short on that one is
basically<00:02:50.769> what<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:50.950> does<00:02:51.690> instead<00:02:52.690> of

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
basically what it does instead of

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.750 
basically what it does instead of
automatically<00:02:53.290> filming<00:02:53.769> in<00:02:53.860> 60<00:02:54.340> frames<00:02:54.610> per

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
automatically filming in 60 frames per

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.570 
automatically filming in 60 frames per
second<00:02:55.299> like<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.750> would<00:02:55.930> on<00:02:56.019> a<00:02:56.049> three<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.739> want<00:02:57.549> a

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
second like it would on a three I want a

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.550 
second like it would on a three I want a
three<00:02:57.819> plus<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.480> has<00:02:58.600> a<00:02:58.630> sensor<00:02:58.959> that<00:02:59.140> actually

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
three plus it has a sensor that actually

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.610 
three plus it has a sensor that actually
reads<00:02:59.860> when<00:03:00.100> there's<00:03:00.310> lower<00:03:00.819> light<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.720> it'll

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
reads when there's lower light and it'll

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.250 
reads when there's lower light and it'll
automatically<00:03:04.080> simultaneously<00:03:05.080> while

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
automatically simultaneously while

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.050 
automatically simultaneously while
you're<00:03:05.440> filming<00:03:05.709> can<00:03:06.489> go<00:03:06.610> all<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.790> way<00:03:06.850> down

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
you're filming can go all the way down

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.180 
you're filming can go all the way down
to<00:03:07.090> 24<00:03:07.540> frames<00:03:07.930> per<00:03:08.019> second<00:03:08.500> because<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.799> idea

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
to 24 frames per second because the idea

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.030 
to 24 frames per second because the idea
there<00:03:09.400> is<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.810> lower<00:03:10.989> frames<00:03:11.380> per<00:03:11.620> second

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
there is the the lower frames per second

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.460 
there is the the lower frames per second
the<00:03:12.850> slower<00:03:13.120> frames<00:03:13.540> per<00:03:13.750> second<00:03:14.079> basically

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
the slower frames per second basically

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.220 
the slower frames per second basically
the<00:03:14.859> more<00:03:15.040> like<00:03:15.250> you<00:03:15.400> can<00:03:15.549> let<00:03:15.730> in<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.150> so<00:03:16.870> it's

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
the more like you can let in and so it's

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.250 
the more like you can let in and so it's
a<00:03:17.320> it's<00:03:17.590> available<00:03:17.890> to<00:03:18.220> let<00:03:18.400> more<00:03:18.850> light<00:03:18.880> in

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
a it's available to let more light in

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.410 
a it's available to let more light in
when<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.380> needs<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.769> without<00:03:21.609> doing<00:03:22.239> anything

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
when it needs it without doing anything

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.319 
when it needs it without doing anything
to<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.870> actual<00:03:23.079> quality<00:03:23.380> of<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.650> video<00:03:24.329> then

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
to the actual quality of the video then

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.870 
to the actual quality of the video then
lastly<00:03:25.660> they<00:03:25.810> improve<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:26.230> sound<00:03:26.880> resign

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
lastly they improve it sound resign

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.979 
lastly they improve it sound resign
microphones<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:30.329> that<00:03:31.329> really<00:03:31.510> helped<00:03:31.870> out

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
microphones and that really helped out

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.170 
microphones and that really helped out
with<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:33.070> sound<00:03:33.310> quality<00:03:33.459> less<00:03:33.910> wind

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
with the the sound quality less wind

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.750 
with the the sound quality less wind
noise<00:03:34.390> things<00:03:34.720> like<00:03:34.900> that<00:03:35.140> with<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.370> with<00:03:36.730> the

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
noise things like that with the with the

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.740 
noise things like that with the with the
tighter<00:03:37.060> casing<00:03:37.540> as<00:03:37.660> well<00:03:37.840> so<00:03:38.170> a<00:03:38.380> couple<00:03:38.980> of

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
tighter casing as well so a couple of

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.360 
tighter casing as well so a couple of
you<00:03:40.750> know<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.470> only<00:03:41.680> outside<00:03:42.100> they<00:03:42.190> don't

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
you know the only outside they don't

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.340 
you know the only outside they don't
seem<00:03:42.609> major<00:03:42.910> improvements<00:03:43.600> but<00:03:44.109> it<00:03:44.200> really

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
seem major improvements but it really

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.890 
seem major improvements but it really
makes<00:03:44.560> a<00:03:44.650> difference<00:03:44.680> when<00:03:45.100> you're<00:03:45.220> filming

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
makes a difference when you're filming

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.710 
makes a difference when you're filming
between<00:03:46.900> 23<00:03:47.200> in<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.320> three<00:03:47.500> plus<00:03:47.769> so<00:03:48.720> hope

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
between 23 in the three plus so hope

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.910 
between 23 in the three plus so hope
