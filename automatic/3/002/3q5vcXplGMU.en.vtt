was like yeah we shouldn't use that as a
competition<00:04:56.110> but<00:04:56.440> then<00:04:56.560> I<00:04:56.650> looked<00:04:56.830> around<00:04:57.160> all

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
competition but then I looked around all

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.370 
competition but then I looked around all
the<00:04:57.729> nonsense<00:04:58.120> and<00:04:58.510> realized<00:04:58.900> like<00:04:59.080> it's<00:04:59.229> not

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
the nonsense and realized like it's not

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.070 
the nonsense and realized like it's not
just<00:04:59.919> a<00:05:00.039> competition<00:05:00.520> it<00:05:01.300> is<00:05:01.449> like<00:05:01.750> my<00:05:01.900> boy

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
just a competition it is like my boy

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.260 
just a competition it is like my boy
people<00:05:02.710> do<00:05:02.949> practice<00:05:03.400> takes<00:05:03.760> time<00:05:03.970> there's

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
people do practice takes time there's

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.700 
people do practice takes time there's
technique<00:05:04.690> it's<00:05:04.960> not<00:05:05.080> just<00:05:05.320> throwing<00:05:05.500> your

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
technique it's not just throwing your

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.670 
technique it's not just throwing your
hands<00:05:05.919> into<00:05:06.220> a<00:05:06.610> figure<00:05:07.180> eight<00:05:07.360> motion<00:05:07.680> it's

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
hands into a figure eight motion it's

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.440 
hands into a figure eight motion it's
not<00:05:08.800> like<00:05:08.950> that<00:05:09.130> you<00:05:09.880> can<00:05:10.000> express<00:05:10.270> yourself

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
not like that you can express yourself

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.510 
not like that you can express yourself
do<00:05:10.750> lines<00:05:10.960> and<00:05:11.169> it's<00:05:11.289> kind<00:05:11.470> of<00:05:11.500> exciting<00:05:12.280> to

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
do lines and it's kind of exciting to

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.990 
do lines and it's kind of exciting to
see<00:05:12.610> everybody<00:05:12.970> story<00:05:13.240> I<00:05:14.610> never<00:05:15.610> thought<00:05:15.820> it

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
see everybody story I never thought it

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.850 
see everybody story I never thought it
would<00:05:16.120> be<00:05:16.360> this<00:05:16.539> far<00:05:16.750> when<00:05:17.169> I<00:05:17.260> first<00:05:17.560> started

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
would be this far when I first started

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.610 
would be this far when I first started
and<00:05:18.460> to<00:05:18.580> see<00:05:18.789> it<00:05:18.880> grow<00:05:19.120> so<00:05:19.510> much<00:05:19.720> -<00:05:19.960> whereas<00:05:20.289> now

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
and to see it grow so much - whereas now

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.230 
and to see it grow so much - whereas now
from<00:05:21.490> when<00:05:21.700> I<00:05:21.820> started<00:05:21.880> is<00:05:22.539> just<00:05:23.099> insane<00:05:24.099> so<00:05:24.849> to

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
from when I started is just insane so to

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:48.350 
from when I started is just insane so to
think<00:05:25.389> that

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.419
