Before we start, I recommend you have your hair a little bit wet.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.060
Hello! We're gonna do the crown braid.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.420
It's super, super easy. We'll divide the hair by half,
and make sure that it's well combed

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.200
because it's a lot easier that way.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.200
What we're gonna do is divide the hair
into three equal parts, like any other braid,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:32.000
and we're gonna roll each part
so that there's no hair sticking out or anything.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.500
This way, the braid is easier to make.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.700
Once we have the rolls done, we're gonna make a simple braid

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.500
but we're gonna raise the hair
so that it's above the ear, not below.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.000
And we're gonna do the same thing on the other side.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:37.500
Once we have the simple braids, we're gonna raise
one of them up to the middle of the head

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.200
and we can fix the hair there with bobby pins.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:53.800
We can also take off the hair tie.
In that one I forgot to take it off.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.840
And we do the same thing with the other braid too.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.600
We can hide the bobby pins that we used to fix
the other braid with this one.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.300
In this case I did take off the hair tie.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.800
We're gonna fix it with bobby pins.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.200

I'll put another link over there, on the screen,
about other hairstyles for short hair, if you're interested.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.000
See you next time. Bye-bye.
