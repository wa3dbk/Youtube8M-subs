the<00:03:25.560> camera<00:03:25.859> turned<00:03:26.040> on<00:03:26.510> another<00:03:27.510> thing<00:03:27.690> that

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
the camera turned on another thing that

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.360 
the camera turned on another thing that
I<00:03:27.930> really<00:03:27.959> liked<00:03:28.349> about<00:03:28.530> her<00:03:28.769> that<00:03:28.889> my<00:03:29.010> dad<00:03:29.190> was

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
I really liked about her that my dad was

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.500 
I really liked about her that my dad was
telling<00:03:29.519> me<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:29.879> that<00:03:30.030> she's<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.269> very

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
telling me is that she's a very

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.080 
telling me is that she's a very
independent<00:03:30.840> cat<00:03:31.430> she<00:03:32.430> would<00:03:32.549> stay<00:03:32.760> inside

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
independent cat she would stay inside

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.280 
independent cat she would stay inside
while<00:03:33.299> a<00:03:33.359> lot<00:03:33.629> of<00:03:33.659> the<00:03:33.750> other<00:03:33.870> ones<00:03:34.049> were

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
while a lot of the other ones were

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.899 
while a lot of the other ones were
outside<00:03:34.680> so<00:03:34.979> I<00:03:35.010> thought<00:03:35.310> she<00:03:35.489> would<00:03:35.609> do<00:03:35.729> pretty

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
outside so I thought she would do pretty

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:36.890 
outside so I thought she would do pretty
well<00:03:36.150> by<00:03:36.329> herself

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
well by herself

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.879 
well by herself
and<00:03:37.099> I<00:03:38.099> hope<00:03:38.489> she<00:03:38.699> can<00:03:38.940> if<00:03:39.359> not<00:03:39.560> my<00:03:40.560> parents

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
and I hope she can if not my parents

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.259 
and I hope she can if not my parents
always<00:03:41.069> have<00:03:41.220> more<00:03:41.370> kittens<00:03:41.729> out<00:03:41.879> there<00:03:42.150> and

well if you guys are wondering this

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.140 
well if you guys are wondering this
litter<00:04:09.750> box<00:04:10.019> is<00:04:10.409> actually<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.919> like<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.430> bacon

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
litter box is actually a like a bacon

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.869 
litter box is actually a like a bacon
pan<00:04:12.389> which<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:12.989> got<00:04:13.139> for<00:04:13.290> like<00:04:13.439> four<00:04:13.680> bucks<00:04:13.919> so<00:04:14.849> I

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
pan which I got for like four bucks so I

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.339 
pan which I got for like four bucks so I
figured<00:04:15.359> that'd<00:04:15.479> make<00:04:15.599> a<00:04:15.659> nice<00:04:15.900> temporary

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
figured that'd make a nice temporary

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.440 
figured that'd make a nice temporary
litter<00:04:16.560> box<00:04:16.769> for<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.430> it's<00:04:18.120> a<00:04:18.150> lot<00:04:18.269> cheaper

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
litter box for and it's a lot cheaper

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.699 
litter box for and it's a lot cheaper
than<00:04:18.570> what<00:04:18.719> you'd<00:04:18.810> find<00:04:19.019> at<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.260> store<00:04:19.469> and

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
than what you'd find at the store and

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:20.690 
than what you'd find at the store and
then<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.400> just

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
then I just

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.550 
then I just
some<00:04:21.330> pretty<00:04:21.540> inexpensive<00:04:22.080> litter<00:04:22.230> and<00:04:22.410> put

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
some pretty inexpensive litter and put

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.900 
some pretty inexpensive litter and put
in<00:04:22.680> there<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:22.860> don't<00:04:22.980> know<00:04:23.160> if<00:04:23.220> all<00:04:23.340> come<00:04:23.820> to

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
in there I don't know if all come to

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.730 
in there I don't know if all come to
regret<00:04:24.120> that<00:04:24.330> but<00:04:24.540> that'll<00:04:24.780> work<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.650> I'll

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
regret that but that'll work and I'll

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.200 
regret that but that'll work and I'll
have<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.980> teacher<00:04:26.370> how<00:04:26.640> to<00:04:26.700> go<00:04:26.880> in<00:04:27.030> there

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
have the teacher how to go in there

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.400 
have the teacher how to go in there
which<00:04:27.480> I'm<00:04:27.630> sure<00:04:27.750> she's<00:04:27.930> gonna<00:04:28.020> want<00:04:28.260> to

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
which I'm sure she's gonna want to

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.920 
which I'm sure she's gonna want to
because<00:04:28.650> cats<00:04:29.430> are<00:04:29.580> naturally<00:04:30.120> inclined<00:04:30.360> to

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
because cats are naturally inclined to

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.180 
because cats are naturally inclined to
go<00:04:31.260> in<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:31.440> litter<00:04:31.590> box<00:04:33.830> so<00:04:34.830> I'll<00:04:34.920> just<00:04:35.040> let
