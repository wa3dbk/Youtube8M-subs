00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.959
 he always 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.849
 - 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.630
 50 here 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.390
 back off 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.890
 with 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.430
 after we installed don like me 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.100
 remind to install workshop 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.660
 we go push the keel and here u 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.150
 us in the weapons tab has a new 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.550
 subsection drink asimov click on it 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.740
 and here we have such 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.010
 texture as I personally know the question move 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.570
 the incentive seems to be 70 bucks and 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.190
 from such a texture you can buy yourself 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.369
 somewhere fifth and let's say go sometime 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.350
 novelty 2014 and pretty and 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.330
 expensive texture if you don't have 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.040
 opportunities to buy it in with can 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.920
 shoot of course in the very 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.720
 you are going to fashion the sight is made very beautifully 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.830
 I personally did not shoot ct bp I do not know which one 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.660
 aim it into a real let's say to with as 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.550
 we see enemies flying off at a very large 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.649
 distance if you shoot them 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.930
 let's even 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.930
 so here I am to the san because the sight 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.570
 fine , let 's try without 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.909
 sight but it's personal 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.319
 here but fear 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.569
 lucky recharge and now he will die at 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:14.489
 how now fly off this far 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.640
 let's try not to tear down 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.080
 try now at the bottom of the code 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.840
 fly off altogether just by the big 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.459
 distance here we still have one 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:29.209
 the guy who's in return now 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.860
 here of course there is this ce 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.540
 but are you worth it to install 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.299
 him and 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.489
 let's indulge in shooting like this 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:42.120
 she looks shoots pretty 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.860
 effectively and kills from the first strike if 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.940
 you get a hammer in general flies off to 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.849
 30 meters so kill the last and we 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.819
 there is another uh how water flew away 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:57.930
 beautiful then so here we still have 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.700
 vrazhina not on the top floor I 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.560
 spawn specifically to shoot with 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:07.069
 this pukalki need to focus and if 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.959
 we will get there of course 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.030
 divinely cool about how I flew off 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.819
 personally saw maybe you didn't see 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.590
 there are two patrons left and just these 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:25.079
 the cartridges will be on these enemies 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:27.690
 1 and of course now 2 we built the whole 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.459
 clip store more bullets and now we 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.590
 check avi pedro head on 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.810
 in order to sprinkle these weapons we 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.109
 click ok and here we have a new one 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.810
 subsection hallow cs go u japanese and here 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.620
 we have a in b dragon lor as i personally 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.340
 I know and vp 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.669
 it is also very expensive as gdp azimov but 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.489
 here and such sight as at azimov but 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:53.069
 we can kill all the enemies now and 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:57.480
 we can zoom in on this scope 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:00.109
 better than gdv land like this he shoots 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.950
 the sound is the same as usual 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:06.230
 the original will tell about the PC with whom and a p 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.120
 n very 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.370
 good i certainly donâ€™t try but here 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.600
 a large such skill is not required 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:19.230
 to kill let's say enemies so everything 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.690
 the enemies are dead now kill it no 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:26.030
 it didn't work out to kill some kind of tenacious 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.030
 so everything is now for sure 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:36.060
 pretty cool so everyone here 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.409
 up here up above nobody's there but i 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:46.009
 I know we have enemies here and now 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:48.740
 lucky him a number and you get it 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.809
 no he's alive because i asked here 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.849
 now he just flew off and you know that he 

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:55.159
 exactly there could fall because from 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:58.669
 such good luck he will be on duty 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:05:00.849
 flew off like that this addon we 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.839
 killed all enemies 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:05.270
 I think for such a house you can put 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:07.729
 Of course, like a don is called a wi-fi 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.710
 Asimov and a in dragon lor 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.990
 these are two different addons just in one 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.189
 series I decided to do so let's say 2 don 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:18.020
 at the same time, thank you all for 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:20.569
 view subscribe put big
