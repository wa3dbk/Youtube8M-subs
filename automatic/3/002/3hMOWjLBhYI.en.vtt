 these matches fights everything is 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.489
 OK 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:10.020
 and maybe putting figures on everything 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.330
 like lagrimita or yuri for a charge of 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.380
 those that are so important and so 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.560
 relevant to mexico because that's 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.310
 laugh that's a joke but it also serves 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.640
 of media distractor also serves 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.880
 to get certain ratings for them 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.640
 in their programs and also as well 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.539
 mere distractions of public opinion 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.810
 in the middle of what the matches uncover 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.330
 for throwing at each other those 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.119
 hypocrites that when it comes to 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.880
 receive the big slices of the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.729
 then you can combine impacts 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.459
 for mexico as they did but that 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.110

 manure everywhere then then 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.890
 do not be surprised that this is part of the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.379
 political marketing 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.940
 that seeks to never understand the 

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:12.510
 they want 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.260
 what is the charge, and much less if it is worth 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.020
 sorry or not for what they want to occupy and 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.350
 that will represent citizens 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.350
 Mexicans
