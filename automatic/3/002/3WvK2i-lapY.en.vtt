we<00:00:18.410> really<00:00:18.680> want<00:00:18.920> to<00:00:18.980> make<00:00:19.040> sure<00:00:19.100> that<00:00:19.460> there's

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610 
we really want to make sure that there's

we really want to make sure that there's
that<00:00:19.670> contrast<00:00:20.300> between<00:00:20.480> the<00:00:21.050> negative<00:00:21.500> space

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
that contrast between the negative space

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.630 
that contrast between the negative space
and<00:00:22.660> then<00:00:23.660> the<00:00:23.900> high-tension<00:00:24.410> Speights<00:00:24.890> you

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
and then the high-tension Speights you

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.580 
and then the high-tension Speights you
need<00:00:25.940> the<00:00:26.210> exploration<00:00:26.930> you<00:00:27.170> need<00:00:27.380> the

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
need the exploration you need the

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.280 
need the exploration you need the
scavenging<00:00:28.190> you<00:00:28.370> need<00:00:28.610> something<00:00:29.180> to<00:00:29.210> to<00:00:30.080> say

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.290 
scavenging you need something to to say

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.770

like okay I'm setting a certain tone and
a<00:00:33.200> patina<00:00:33.530> here<00:00:34.250> so<00:00:34.670> that<00:00:34.850> then<00:00:35.059> we<00:00:35.210> can

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
a patina here so that then we can

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.299 
a patina here so that then we can
contrast<00:00:35.900> that<00:00:36.140> with<00:00:36.200> some<00:00:36.440> stark<00:00:36.770> like

side of that door or you could craft a

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.830 
side of that door or you could craft a
melee<00:02:29.680> upgrade<00:02:30.070> so<00:02:30.340> you<00:02:30.430> might<00:02:30.790> have<00:02:31.060> some

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
scissors or something you're going to be

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.780 
scissors or something you're going to be
able<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:34.840> use<00:02:35.500> advantages<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.520> use<00:02:36.610> these

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
able to use advantages and use these

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.840 
able to use advantages and use these
things<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:37.030> attach<00:02:37.390> them<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.850> two-by-four

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
things to attach them to the two-by-four

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.850

able to run and take down below

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.130 
able to run and take down below
alternatively<00:02:45.940> but<00:02:46.330> you<00:02:46.390> can<00:02:46.540> use<00:02:46.690> those<00:02:46.900> same

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
alternatively but you can use those same

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.520 
alternatively but you can use those same
types<00:02:47.440> of<00:02:47.620> nails<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:48.430> make<00:02:49.090> a<00:02:49.540> bomb<00:02:49.960> is

types of nails to make a bomb is

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.390 
types of nails to make a bomb is
something<00:02:50.830> you<00:02:50.890> can<00:02:51.040> place<00:02:51.220> in<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.460> world

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
something you can place in the world

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.209 
something you can place in the world
and<00:02:52.549> they<00:02:52.970> could<00:02:53.090> go<00:02:53.180> to<00:02:53.239> trigger

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:57.219 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:59.800 

since<00:02:58.219> resources<00:02:58.670> are<00:02:58.790> limited<00:02:58.939> you<00:02:59.599> still

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
since resources are limited you still

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.630 
since resources are limited you still
pass<00:02:59.989> an<00:03:00.200> encounter<00:03:00.439> you're<00:03:01.219> not<00:03:01.340> getting<00:03:01.549> the

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
pass an encounter you're not getting the

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.770 
pass an encounter you're not getting the
stuff<00:03:01.790> that<00:03:01.939> was<00:03:02.000> encountered<00:03:02.359> not<00:03:02.450> just<00:03:02.719> the

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
stuff that was encountered not just the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.089 
stuff that was encountered not just the
stuff<00:03:02.930> off<00:03:03.109> the<00:03:03.140> guys<00:03:03.439> that<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:03.859> would<00:03:03.890> have

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
stuff off the guys that you would have

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.729 
stuff off the guys that you would have
taken<00:03:04.340> down<00:03:04.609> but<00:03:05.269> also<00:03:05.480> in<00:03:06.019> terms<00:03:06.379> of<00:03:06.560> what's

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
taken down but also in terms of what's

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:07.959 
taken down but also in terms of what's
in<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:06.920> environment<00:03:07.129> for<00:03:07.430> you<00:03:07.519> to<00:03:07.549> scavenge

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:07.969 
in the environment for you to scavenge

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.330 
in the environment for you to scavenge
so<00:03:08.480> it's<00:03:08.689> a<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:09.500> have<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:09.739> balance<00:03:09.890> out<00:03:10.129> risk

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
so it's a you have to balance out risk

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.339 
so it's a you have to balance out risk
versus<00:03:10.640> reward<00:03:10.730> but<00:03:11.030> it's<00:03:11.180> definitely<00:03:11.390> all<00:03:12.290> a

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
versus reward but it's definitely all a

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.319 
versus reward but it's definitely all a
part<00:03:12.769> of<00:03:12.829> the<00:03:12.950> choice<00:03:13.129> and<00:03:13.489> sometimes<00:03:14.150> the

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
part of the choice and sometimes the

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.339 
part of the choice and sometimes the
world<00:03:14.480> doesn't<00:03:14.719> give<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:15.079> a<00:03:15.109> choice

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
world doesn't give you a choice

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.589 
world doesn't give you a choice
sometimes<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.430> battle<00:03:16.969> breaks<00:03:17.209> out<00:03:17.420> in<00:03:17.540> the

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
sometimes the battle breaks out in the

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.809 
sometimes the battle breaks out in the
way<00:03:17.719> you<00:03:17.780> didn't<00:03:18.230> expect<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:18.889> you<00:03:18.920> have<00:03:19.730> to

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
way you didn't expect and you have to

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.059 
way you didn't expect and you have to
make<00:03:19.969> decisions<00:03:20.090> like<00:03:20.719> in<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.230> moment<00:03:21.650> so

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
make decisions like in the moment so

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.860 
make decisions like in the moment so
that's<00:03:22.430> another<00:03:22.700> reason<00:03:22.939> why<00:03:23.180> we<00:03:23.540> did<00:03:23.750> the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
that's another reason why we did the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.349 
that's another reason why we did the
whole<00:03:23.900> crafting<00:03:24.620> system<00:03:24.829> live<00:03:25.340> we<00:03:26.060> didn't

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
whole crafting system live we didn't

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.929 
whole crafting system live we didn't
want<00:03:26.389> the<00:03:26.719> player<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:26.989> have<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.939> scroll

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939 
want the player to have to scroll

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.449 
want the player to have to scroll
through<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.389> long<00:03:29.810> list<00:03:30.169> of<00:03:30.470> different<00:03:30.919> items

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
through a long list of different items

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.149 
through a long list of different items
we<00:03:32.060> wanted<00:03:32.450> it<00:03:32.629> to<00:03:32.959> be<00:03:33.109> the<00:03:33.290> absolute<00:03:33.470> minimum

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 
we wanted it to be the absolute minimum

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:38.559 
we wanted it to be the absolute minimum
amount<00:03:34.879> of<00:03:35.000> button<00:03:35.329> presses<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:38.299> thing<00:03:38.480> that

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
amount of button presses the thing that

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.199 
amount of button presses the thing that
i<00:03:38.629> hate<00:03:38.810> about<00:03:39.019> any<00:03:39.439> games<00:03:39.739> you<00:03:39.919> I<00:03:39.950> is<00:03:40.120> when<00:03:41.120> it

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
i hate about any games you I is when it

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.759 
i hate about any games you I is when it
pulls<00:03:41.480> you<00:03:41.569> out<00:03:41.599> of<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:41.959> game<00:03:42.139> for<00:03:42.349> too<00:03:42.560> long

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
pulls you out of the game for too long

pulls you out of the game for too long
so<00:03:43.549> that<00:03:43.939> was<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.120> challenge<00:03:44.209> to<00:03:44.810> reduce<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:45.469> all

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
so that was a challenge to reduce it all

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.309 
so that was a challenge to reduce it all
