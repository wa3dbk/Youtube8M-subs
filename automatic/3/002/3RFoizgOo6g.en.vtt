00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
alteration is really simple you read

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000 
alteration is really simple you read
need<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.779> realize<00:00:07.049> that<00:00:07.200> any<00:00:07.379> court<00:00:07.680> can<00:00:07.859> be

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
need to realize that any court can be

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.430 
need to realize that any court can be
altered<00:00:08.519> by<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.300> half<00:00:09.570> step<00:00:09.599> through<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.290> use

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
altered by a half step through the use

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.070 
altered by a half step through the use
of<00:00:10.469> pluses<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.130> minuses<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:12.030> minus<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.900> course

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
of pluses and minuses a minus of course

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.749 
of pluses and minuses a minus of course
would<00:00:13.320> mean<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.650> lower<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.190> particularly

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
would mean to lower that particularly

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.790 
would mean to lower that particularly
note<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> half<00:00:15.240> step<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:16.199> plus<00:00:16.440> would<00:00:16.650> mean

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
note a half step and a plus would mean

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.859 
note a half step and a plus would mean
to<00:00:16.980> raise<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.490> note<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.670> half<00:00:17.910> step<00:00:18.210> for

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
to raise the note a half step for

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.689 
to raise the note a half step for
example<00:00:19.260> if<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.470> said<00:00:19.680> if<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.160> sit<00:00:20.400> chord

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
example if it said if the sit chord

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.019 
example if it said if the sit chord
symbol<00:00:21.000> said<00:00:21.210> c<00:00:22.039> minus<00:00:23.039> five<00:00:23.519> what<00:00:23.820> would<00:00:23.910> you

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
symbol said c minus five what would you

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.470 
symbol said c minus five what would you
do<00:00:25.220> you<00:00:26.220> lower<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.730> fifth<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.090> half<00:00:27.240> step

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
do you lower the fifth a half step

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.390 
do you lower the fifth a half step
because<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:27.960> minus<00:00:28.619> five<00:00:28.890> that's<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> fifth

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
because it's minus five that's the fifth

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.510 
because it's minus five that's the fifth
note<00:00:29.640> C<00:00:29.970> scale<00:00:32.360> if<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.930> have<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> c7<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.219> it

said plus by what would you meet what

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.240 
said plus by what would you meet what
would<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.530> do<00:00:37.649> then<00:00:38.780> it<00:00:39.780> raised<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.290> field<00:00:40.590> if

would you do then it raised the field if

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.959 
would you do then it raised the field if
you<00:00:41.460> had<00:00:41.610> see<00:00:41.879> seventh-<00:00:42.540> lime<00:00:43.050> over<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.469> me

you had see seventh- lime over to me

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.040 
you had see seventh- lime over to me
lower<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.210> step<00:00:45.930> okay<00:00:46.940> usually<00:00:48.050> alteration

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
lower the step okay usually alteration

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.279 
lower the step okay usually alteration
chords<00:00:49.410> happen<00:00:49.860> two<00:00:49.950> fifths<00:00:50.480> nights<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.870> 11s

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
chords happen two fifths nights and 11s

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.500 
chords happen two fifths nights and 11s
not<00:00:53.100> too<00:00:53.309> much<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.640> anything<00:00:53.850> else<00:00:54.180> although

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
not too much to anything else although

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.470 
not too much to anything else although
it's<00:00:54.660> possible<00:00:54.870> okay<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.190> if<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.940> have<00:00:57.120> a/c

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
it's possible okay so if I have a/c

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.040 
it's possible okay so if I have a/c
ninth<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.559> example<00:00:59.090> and<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.270> says<00:01:00.449> C<00:01:00.750> minor

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
ninth for example and it says C minor

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.039 
ninth for example and it says C minor
nine<00:01:01.440> what<00:01:02.070> would<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.340> mean<00:01:02.550> you'd<00:01:02.930> find<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
nine what would that mean you'd find the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.280 
nine what would that mean you'd find the
ninth<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.559> lower<00:01:04.739> half<00:01:05.159> step<00:01:05.489> so

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
ninth and lower half step so

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.500 
ninth and lower half step so
here<00:01:08.040> than<00:01:08.310> la

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.749 

you<00:01:14.510> for<00:01:14.720> that<00:01:14.869> kind<00:01:15.110> of<00:01:15.140> thing<00:01:18.220> if<00:01:19.220> you<00:01:19.610> were

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
you for that kind of thing if you were

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.450 
you for that kind of thing if you were
it<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:20.450> had<00:01:20.659> c<00:01:21.049> plus<00:01:21.560> 11<00:01:22.100> what<00:01:22.250> would<00:01:22.340> that

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
it you had c plus 11 what would that

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.899 
it you had c plus 11 what would that
mean<00:01:23.440> it<00:01:24.440> would<00:01:24.530> mean<00:01:24.710> raise<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.280> 11th<00:01:25.640> okay

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
mean it would mean raise the 11th okay

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.760 
mean it would mean raise the 11th okay
let's<00:01:26.330> say<00:01:26.509> here's<00:01:26.780> up<00:01:26.960> c11<00:01:29.049> plus<00:01:30.049> 11<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:30.560> meet

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
let's say here's up c11 plus 11 to meet

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.450 
let's say here's up c11 plus 11 to meet
lat<00:01:33.190> so<00:01:34.190> minus<00:01:34.880> simply<00:01:35.360> means<00:01:35.570> lower<00:01:35.869> a<00:01:36.460> given

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
lat so minus simply means lower a given

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.450 
lat so minus simply means lower a given
node<00:01:37.640> a<00:01:37.700> half<00:01:37.909> step<00:01:38.229> plus<00:01:39.229> means<00:01:39.560> raise<00:01:39.890> a<00:01:40.220> node

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
node a half step plus means raise a node

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.370 
node a half step plus means raise a node
a<00:01:40.490> half<00:01:40.729> step<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.240> you<00:01:41.630> see<00:01:41.810> that<00:01:41.960> in<00:01:42.140> court

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
a half step and you see that in court

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.190 
a half step and you see that in court
symbols<00:01:42.770> such<00:01:42.979> as<00:01:43.009> f<00:01:43.970> let's<00:01:44.840> take<00:01:44.990> one<00:01:45.140> more

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
symbols such as f let's take one more

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.380 
symbols such as f let's take one more
let's<00:01:46.100> take<00:01:46.280> F<00:01:47.200> 7-5<00:01:48.200> what<00:01:48.619> would<00:01:48.710> that<00:01:48.830> be<00:01:49.390> we

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
let's take F 7-5 what would that be we

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.160 
let's take F 7-5 what would that be we
have<00:01:50.539> seven<00:01:51.429> lower<00:01:52.429> the<00:01:52.640> fifth<00:01:52.880> have<00:01:53.810> Sabbath

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
have seven lower the fifth have Sabbath

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.460 
have seven lower the fifth have Sabbath
plus<00:01:54.500> 5<00:01:54.770> raise<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.880> fifth<00:01:56.119> you're<00:01:57.050> gonna<00:01:57.319> run

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
plus 5 raise the fifth you're gonna run

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.260 
plus 5 raise the fifth you're gonna run
into<00:01:57.530> this<00:01:57.800> a<00:01:57.860> whole<00:01:58.130> lot<00:01:58.159> but<00:01:58.550> I<00:01:58.610> want<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.179> to
