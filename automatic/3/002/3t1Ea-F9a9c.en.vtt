going to scan her to make sure she
hasn't<00:01:46.220> been<00:01:46.459> previously<00:01:46.849> microchipped<00:01:47.420> and

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
hasn't been previously microchipped and

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.979 
hasn't been previously microchipped and
this<00:01:48.979> will<00:01:49.129> read<00:01:49.280> anybody's<00:01:49.640> microchip<00:01:50.209> any

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:50.989 
this will read anybody's microchip any

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:53.109 
this will read anybody's microchip any
company<00:01:51.379> so<00:01:52.099> that's<00:01:52.340> why<00:01:52.459> we<00:01:52.489> do<00:01:52.729> these<00:01:52.849> this
