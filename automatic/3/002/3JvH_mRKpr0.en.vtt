is like I would like to call the big
brother<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:20.039> machete<00:00:20.480> it's<00:00:21.480> gonna<00:00:21.600> be<00:00:21.840> a

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
brother of the machete it's gonna be a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.599 
brother of the machete it's gonna be a
little<00:00:22.050> bit<00:00:22.230> stiffer<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.859> it's<00:00:23.220> gonna<00:00:23.340> have<00:00:23.580> a

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
little bit stiffer and it's gonna have a

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.970 
little bit stiffer and it's gonna have a
little<00:00:23.789> bit<00:00:23.970> more<00:00:24.470> hard-charging<00:00:25.470> response

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
little bit more hard-charging response

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.500 
little bit more hard-charging response
for<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.310> all-mountain<00:00:26.580> freestyle<00:00:27.300> guy

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
for that all-mountain freestyle guy

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.599 
for that all-mountain freestyle guy
who's<00:00:28.349> looking<00:00:28.470> for<00:00:28.619> something<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.099> little<00:00:29.490> bit

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
who's looking for something a little bit

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.700 
who's looking for something a little bit
more<00:00:29.910> rugged<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:31.140> gonna<00:00:31.230> hold<00:00:31.410> up<00:00:31.590> on

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
more rugged and it's gonna hold up on

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.979 
more rugged and it's gonna hold up on
some<00:00:31.859> bigger<00:00:32.040> landings<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:33.420> reason<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.750> say

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
some bigger landings the reason I say

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.319 
some bigger landings the reason I say
that<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:35.309> comes<00:00:35.520> with<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.000> hybrid

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
that is it comes with the hybrid

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.619 
that is it comes with the hybrid
low-rise<00:00:37.290> rocker<00:00:37.590> shape<00:00:38.120> so<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.540> to

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
low-rise rocker shape so it's going to

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.290 
low-rise rocker shape so it's going to
have<00:00:39.840> rocker<00:00:40.379> tip<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.129> tail<00:00:41.309> with<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> micro

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
have rocker tip and tail with a micro

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.260 
have rocker tip and tail with a micro
camber<00:00:42.920> from<00:00:43.920> about<00:00:44.160> right<00:00:44.190> here<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:45.030> past

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
camber from about right here just past

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.290 
camber from about right here just past
the<00:00:45.390> inserts<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.620> here<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.700> micro<00:00:47.969> camber

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
the inserts to here so that micro camber

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.580 
the inserts to here so that micro camber
is<00:00:48.360> gonna<00:00:48.570> give<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.809> lot<00:00:48.989> more<00:00:49.170> response

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
is gonna give you a lot more response

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.590 
is gonna give you a lot more response
and<00:00:49.950> be<00:00:50.309> better<00:00:50.489> at<00:00:50.640> high<00:00:50.760> speeds<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.300> also

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
and be better at high speeds and also

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.020 
and be better at high speeds and also
you<00:00:52.590> know<00:00:52.710> locking<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> lot<00:00:53.309> more<00:00:53.489> landings<00:00:53.879> for

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
you know locking a lot more landings for

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.660 
you know locking a lot more landings for
you<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:55.170> comes<00:00:55.379> with<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.860> hyper<00:00:56.129> glass<00:00:56.399> top

performance<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.689> core<00:01:10.189> it<00:01:11.189> also<00:01:12.060> has

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
performance to in core it also has

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.420 
performance to in core it also has
really<00:01:12.510> cool<00:01:13.049> feature<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.619> pop<00:01:14.159> walls

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
really cool feature is the pop walls

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.789 
really cool feature is the pop walls
which<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.330> rides<00:01:15.720> classic<00:01:16.259> urethane

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
which is rides classic urethane

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.460 
which is rides classic urethane
sidewalls<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.150> also<00:01:18.299> has<00:01:18.630> layers<00:01:19.259> of

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
sidewalls but it also has layers of

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.670 
sidewalls but it also has layers of
carbon<00:01:20.000> inside<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.299> which<00:01:22.110> gives<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.650> a

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
carbon inside of it which gives it a

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.590 
carbon inside of it which gives it a
little<00:01:22.830> bit<00:01:22.979> extra<00:01:23.189> rigidity<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.909> then<00:01:24.360> also

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
little bit extra rigidity and then also

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.039 
little bit extra rigidity and then also
adds<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.140> pop<00:01:25.409> ence<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.250> name<00:01:26.400> pop<00:01:26.670> walls

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
adds to the pop ence the name pop walls

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.840 
adds to the pop ence the name pop walls
you've<00:01:28.049> got<00:01:28.259> your<00:01:28.439> cleavage<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.189> here<00:01:29.460> which

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
you've got your cleavage on here which

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.880 
you've got your cleavage on here which
gives<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.299> 50<00:01:30.689> percent<00:01:30.810> more<00:01:31.200> steel<00:01:31.590> than<00:01:31.619> on

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
gives you 50 percent more steel than on

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.679 
gives you 50 percent more steel than on
a<00:01:31.920> traditional<00:01:32.490> board<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.030> if<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.299> hit<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.479> rail

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
a traditional board so if you hit a rail

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.660 
a traditional board so if you hit a rail
or<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.590> want<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.799> take<00:01:34.979> down<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.369> edge<00:01:35.490> of

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
really fast and work on all terrain and

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.139 
really fast and work on all terrain and
it<00:01:54.420> also<00:01:54.659> has<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.409> carbon<00:01:55.979> array<00:01:56.100> 5<00:01:56.670> which<00:01:57.030> is

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
it also has the carbon array 5 which is

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.240 
it also has the carbon array 5 which is
the<00:01:57.240> carbon<00:01:57.479> stringers<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.320> run<00:01:58.649> from<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
the carbon stringers that run from the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
the carbon stringers that run from the
inserts<00:02:00.119> right<00:02:00.240> here<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.750> out<00:02:01.939> to<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.060> tip

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
inserts right here and out to the tip

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.929 
inserts right here and out to the tip
and<00:02:03.390> tail<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.799> also<00:02:05.189> helps<00:02:05.790> with<00:02:05.880> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
and tail so that also helps with the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.570 
and tail so that also helps with the
rigidity<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.659> also<00:02:07.320> gives<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> really

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
rigidity and also gives you a really

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.830 
rigidity and also gives you a really
good<00:02:08.700> transfer<00:02:09.270> edge<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.720> edge<00:02:09.840> and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
good transfer edge to edge and

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.830 
good transfer edge to edge and
yeah<00:02:11.650> torsionally<00:02:12.280> its<00:02:12.459> adds<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.630> little<00:02:13.750> bit

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
yeah torsionally its adds a little bit

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.339 
yeah torsionally its adds a little bit
more<00:02:13.959> stiffness<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.739> quicker<00:02:15.190> response<00:02:16.349> yeah

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
more stiffness and quicker response yeah

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.729 
more stiffness and quicker response yeah
this<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:18.010> ride<00:02:18.510> 2014<00:02:19.510> machete<00:02:19.959> GT<00:02:20.080> it's

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
this is the ride 2014 machete GT it's

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.080 
this is the ride 2014 machete GT it's
going<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:20.980> be<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.160> big<00:02:21.340> brother<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.910> the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
going to be the big brother to the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.550 
going to be the big brother to the
machete<00:02:22.390> so<00:02:22.900> it's<00:02:22.989> going<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.140> be<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.260> little<00:02:23.410> bit

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
machete so it's going to be a little bit

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.559 
machete so it's going to be a little bit
more<00:02:23.709> of<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.890> hard-charging<00:02:24.569> all-mountain
