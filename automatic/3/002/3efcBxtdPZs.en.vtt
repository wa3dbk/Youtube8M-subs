00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
that choking a choking generally occurs

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.970 
that choking a choking generally occurs
when<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> reed<00:00:39.570> sits<00:00:39.960> too<00:00:40.170> close<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> slot

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
when a reed sits too close to the slot

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.610 
when a reed sits too close to the slot
so<00:00:41.329> what<00:00:42.329> I'm<00:00:42.450> gonna<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.050> I'm<00:00:43.200> gonna<00:00:43.320> remove

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna remove

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.619 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna remove
the<00:00:43.800> covers<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.399> then<00:00:45.059> I'm<00:00:45.149> going<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.510> adjust

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
the covers and then I'm going to adjust

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.690 
the covers and then I'm going to adjust
the<00:00:45.899> camera<00:00:46.320> angle<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.800> show<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.160> how<00:00:47.340> we<00:00:47.399> can

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the camera angle and show you how we can

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.250 
the camera angle and show you how we can
fix<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:50.210> now<00:00:51.210> what<00:00:51.449> I've<00:00:51.570> done<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:52.079> I've

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
fix that now what I've done is I've

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.229 
fix that now what I've done is I've
removed<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> covers<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.520> I've<00:00:54.059> identified

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
removed the covers and I've identified

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.569 
removed the covers and I've identified
the<00:00:55.079> notes<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.770> weren't<00:00:56.010> playing<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the notes that weren't playing as the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.069 
the notes that weren't playing as the
four<00:00:57.180> blow<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.379> five<00:00:58.649> blow<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> doubt

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
four blow and the five blow so I doubt

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.260 
four blow and the five blow so I doubt
that<00:01:01.289> we'll<00:01:01.440> be<00:01:01.559> able<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.949> see<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:03.030> from

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
that we'll be able to see it here from

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.340 
that we'll be able to see it here from
the<00:01:03.359> camera<00:01:03.780> angles<00:01:04.729> difficulty<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.510> you'll

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the camera angles difficulty but you'll

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.670 
the camera angles difficulty but you'll
notice<00:01:07.670> if<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.729> can<00:01:09.000> see<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.659> reed<00:01:09.900> and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
notice if you can see that the reed and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.530 
notice if you can see that the reed and
whole<00:01:11.070> number<00:01:11.430> four<00:01:11.670> will<00:01:11.820> count<00:01:12.060> over<00:01:12.299> from

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
whole number four will count over from

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.840 
push that breed a little further than
what<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:18.690> might<00:02:18.900> believe<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.440> be<00:02:19.560> optimal<00:02:20.190> the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
what we might believe to be optimal the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.340 
what we might believe to be optimal the
reason<00:02:21.210> is<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.630> breed<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:21.930> going<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.170> have<00:02:22.320> a

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
reason is the breed is going to have a

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.110 
reason is the breed is going to have a
tendency<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:23.570> settle<00:02:24.570> back<00:02:24.750> into<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.200> slot

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.140 

I've<00:02:30.120> checked<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.630> gap<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:32.190> gap<00:02:32.220> seems<00:02:32.820> to

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
I've checked the gap the gap seems to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.760 
I've checked the gap the gap seems to
match<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.640> gap<00:02:35.850> on<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.180> left<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.740> the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
match the the gap on the left and to the

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.600 
match the the gap on the left and to the
right<00:02:38.810> this<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.260> be<00:02:40.380> sort<00:02:40.710> of<00:02:40.770> gradual<00:02:41.340> so

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
right this is to be sort of gradual so

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.250 
right this is to be sort of gradual so
the<00:02:41.730> largest<00:02:42.120> gap<00:02:42.300> will<00:02:42.510> be<00:02:42.660> on<00:02:42.750> number<00:02:42.930> one

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
the largest gap will be on number one

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.230 
the largest gap will be on number one
breed<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.040> then<00:02:44.190> it'll<00:02:44.340> go<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.880> smallest

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
breed and then it'll go to the smallest

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.860 
breed and then it'll go to the smallest
gap<00:02:45.540> which<00:02:45.780> will<00:02:45.930> be<00:02:46.020> on<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.140> ten<00:02:46.500> Reed<00:02:50.870> now

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
gap which will be on the ten Reed now

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.580 
gap which will be on the ten Reed now
one<00:02:52.110> thing<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.440> can<00:02:52.620> do<00:02:53.960> to<00:02:54.960> ensure<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.290> you

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
one thing you can do to ensure that you

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.200 
one thing you can do to ensure that you
have<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.920> gap<00:02:56.100> set<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:56.730> then<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:56.880> stays<00:02:57.150> there

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
have the gap set and then it stays there

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.290 
have the gap set and then it stays there
is<00:02:57.630> you<00:02:57.810> can<00:02:58.020> push<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.710> Reed<00:02:58.980> up<00:02:59.280> through<00:03:00.180> the

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
is you can push that Reed up through the

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.770 
is you can push that Reed up through the
slot<00:03:00.630> like<00:03:00.900> this<00:03:01.940> grab<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.090> with<00:03:03.240> your<00:03:03.270> finger

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
slot like this grab it with your finger

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.930 
slot like this grab it with your finger
and<00:03:04.020> just<00:03:04.560> plink<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.010> down<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.490> see<00:03:05.640> where<00:03:05.820> it

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
and just plink it down and see where it

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.890 
and just plink it down and see where it
lands<00:03:06.180> then<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.260> can<00:03:07.410> adjust<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.920> again<00:03:08.900> most

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
lands then you can adjust it again most

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.630 
lands then you can adjust it again most
often<00:03:10.350> when<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.560> hear<00:03:10.860> from<00:03:11.040> people<00:03:11.250> who<00:03:11.430> have

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
often when I hear from people who have

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.880 
often when I hear from people who have
adjusted<00:03:12.450> their<00:03:13.020> reeds<00:03:13.820> they<00:03:14.820> complain<00:03:15.300> that

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
adjusted their reeds they complain that

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.800 
adjusted their reeds they complain that
it<00:03:16.890> lasts<00:03:17.310> but<00:03:17.610> just<00:03:17.820> a<00:03:17.940> couple<00:03:18.120> minutes<00:03:18.630> and

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
it lasts but just a couple minutes and

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.200 
it lasts but just a couple minutes and
then<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:19.220> playing<00:03:20.220> time<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.790> then<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.000> goes

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
then a playing time and then it goes

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.880 
then a playing time and then it goes
back<00:03:21.240> to<00:03:21.660> what<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.930> did<00:03:22.080> before<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.620> then<00:03:22.710> they

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
back to what it did before and then they

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.700 
back to what it did before and then they
end<00:03:23.040> up<00:03:23.130> sending<00:03:23.520> it<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.880> me

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
end up sending it to me

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.870 
end up sending it to me
that's<00:03:25.710> because<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.250> Reed<00:03:26.430> will<00:03:26.670> have<00:03:26.850> a

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
that's because the Reed will have a

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.700 
that's because the Reed will have a
tendency<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.480> settle<00:03:27.780> back<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.350> its<00:03:28.470> previous

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
tendency to settle back to its previous

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.730 
tendency to settle back to its previous
stage<00:03:29.160> so<00:03:29.460> it's<00:03:29.580> best<00:03:29.820> if<00:03:30.000> we<00:03:30.030> can<00:03:30.500> link<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.650> a

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
stage so it's best if we can link it a

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.100 
stage so it's best if we can link it a
little<00:03:31.920> bit<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.460> then<00:03:32.580> readjust<00:03:32.910> it<00:03:36.080> okay

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
little bit and then readjust it okay

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.740 
little bit and then readjust it okay
let's<00:03:37.920> adjust<00:03:38.190> our<00:03:38.370> camera<00:03:38.820> back<00:03:39.030> again<00:03:39.450> and

let's adjust our camera back again and
