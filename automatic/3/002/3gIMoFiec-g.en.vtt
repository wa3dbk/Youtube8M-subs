00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.470
 renewable energies 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.910
 the renewable energy food community 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.510
 was born in 2009 as it evolved into 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.000
 during these five years it is done 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.120
 let's say a long journey since 2009 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.110
 we started as five companies with 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.000
 this project born from cosmit and slow 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.640
 Tuscan food and slow foundation 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.170
 food for biodiversity and from there we say 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.840
 today we have arrived that we are already 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.430
 fourteen companies where among them 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.070
 fourteen companies there is also a 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.500
 pomarancina sheep consortium and a 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.380
 another group of companies that are lands 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.380
 hot and from Tuscany an association of 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.940
 pomarance pd we see that in these years 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.700
 let's say more companies have believed in 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.890
 this project and the project is having 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.920
 his results are participating in 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.979
 important events one of the 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.640
 goals of the food community and 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.400
 to show 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.990
 the idea of the project per se goodness 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.270
 of the project and that this project is 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.220
 can also replicate in other territories 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.220
 as ours 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.580
 we want to explain what is the idea of 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.099
 food community 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.230
 yes the idea is so because it is born for 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.230
 promote the companies they use 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.780
 renewable energy and it would be simple 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.970
 a buy on the net produced energy 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.459
 read this clean energy already 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.500
 let's say it's a good result though 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.720
 what companies produce it 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.000
 directly they too is one thing 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.220
 different you have to believe in this thing 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.470
 here from an environmental point of view 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.590
 because the minimum 50 percent 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.269
 of the energy and various uses a 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.269
 use cars produced on the farm 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.209
 what does it mean to be part of 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.620
 food community renewable energy 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.040
 it means precisely this fact here 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.280
 believe in the first place as a community 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.950
 Food also participates in with 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.500
 University of food and wine pollenzo

 become different schools to visit us 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.470
 in various companies and then explain 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:18.560
 also what you are doing in order to 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.260
 make them understand all the goodness there is 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.900
 behind the philosophy that linked to 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.159
 slow food of the right clean good e 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.159
 also renewable 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.950
 be a member of the food community yes 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.780
 intends this to bring everyone together 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.110
 these values ​​and all these values 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.180
 being able to pass them on to transmit them to 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.920
 all those companies or schools that 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.090
 come to visit the companies here it is 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.190
 this we say the focal point of the 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.850
 food community and that in this way 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.340

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.090
 even a tasting we do not see 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.250

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:52.390
 malt beer guys name would be 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.540
 taking advantage of geothermal energy we did not give 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:57.840
 the guys also names the beers and that's one 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.840
