00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
bigger the pyramid the MA beacons you

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.640 
bigger the pyramid the MA beacons you
have<00:05:14.310> the<00:05:14.550> biggest<00:05:14.970> radius<00:05:15.389> it<00:05:15.600> will<00:05:15.930> be<00:05:16.320> so

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
have the biggest radius it will be so

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.200 
have the biggest radius it will be so
you<00:05:16.889> do<00:05:17.250> notice<00:05:17.610> that<00:05:17.729> you<00:05:17.820> do<00:05:17.970> have<00:05:18.000> to

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
you do notice that you do have to

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.820 
you do notice that you do have to
right-click<00:05:18.419> on<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:18.960> beacon<00:05:19.380> it's<00:05:19.590> gonna<00:05:19.680> be

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
right-click on the beacon it's gonna be

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.890 
right-click on the beacon it's gonna be
different<00:05:20.070> on<00:05:20.340> minecraft<00:05:20.820> console<00:05:21.360> than<00:05:21.780> it

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
different on minecraft console than it

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.750 
different on minecraft console than it
is<00:05:22.050> to<00:05:22.289> PC<00:05:22.710> but<00:05:22.889> you<00:05:22.979> probably<00:05:23.160> have<00:05:23.430> seen<00:05:23.639> it

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
is to PC but you probably have seen it

throughout<00:05:24.000> this<00:05:24.150> video<00:05:24.300> so<00:05:24.840> I'm<00:05:24.960> guessing

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
throughout this video so I'm guessing

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.290 
throughout this video so I'm guessing
you<00:05:25.470> have<00:05:25.620> a<00:05:25.650> rough<00:05:25.919> idea<00:05:26.400> on<00:05:26.490> how<00:05:26.820> they<00:05:27.030> work

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
you have a rough idea on how they work

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.879 
you have a rough idea on how they work
anyway<00:05:28.050> so<00:05:28.110> you<00:05:28.380> shouldn't<00:05:28.620> have<00:05:28.740> any

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
anyway so you shouldn't have any

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.129 
anyway so you shouldn't have any
problems<00:05:29.490> on<00:05:29.729> understanding<00:05:30.479> what<00:05:30.750> certain

much as anything is in this world the

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.830 
much as anything is in this world the
bigger<00:06:12.240> the<00:06:12.419> better

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:50.980

resistance increased armor rating jump
boost<00:06:51.190> increased<00:06:51.730> jumping<00:06:52.150> distance<00:06:52.600> and

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750 
boost increased jumping distance and

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.750 
boost increased jumping distance and
height<00:06:53.080> and<00:06:53.350> strength<00:06:53.889> gives<00:06:54.280> you<00:06:54.400> increased

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
melee damage similar to the potion of

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.770 
melee damage similar to the potion of
strength<00:06:57.490> so<00:06:57.850> I<00:06:57.910> think<00:06:58.000> that<00:06:58.300> is<00:06:58.419> all<00:06:58.540> you<00:06:58.630> need

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:58.780 
strength so I think that is all you need

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.690 
strength so I think that is all you need
to<00:06:58.870> know<00:06:59.050> about<00:06:59.290> the<00:06:59.560> pyramid<00:06:59.950> options<00:07:00.370> and

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:00.700 
to know about the pyramid options and

the power options that you get from

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.830 
the power options that you get from
beacons<00:07:03.070> and<00:07:03.340> you<00:07:03.700> can<00:07:03.940> kind<00:07:04.180> of<00:07:04.300> save<00:07:04.540> your
