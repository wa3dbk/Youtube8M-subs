bread<00:04:26.729> potatoes<00:04:27.210> growing<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:28.199> so<00:04:28.530> as<00:04:29.400> they

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
bread potatoes growing and so as they

bread potatoes growing and so as they
grow<00:04:29.639> up<00:04:30.030> I'm<00:04:30.210> going<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.919> scoop<00:04:31.919> that<00:04:32.070> soil

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
grow up I'm going to scoop that soil

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.830 
grow up I'm going to scoop that soil
down<00:04:32.610> on<00:04:32.760> top<00:04:32.910> of<00:04:32.970> them<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.330> eventually<00:04:33.510> just

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
down on top of them and eventually just

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.930 
down on top of them and eventually just
mount<00:04:34.080> it<00:04:34.199> up<00:04:34.320> pretty<00:04:34.530> high<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:35.520> so<00:04:35.820> this

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
mount it up pretty high and so this

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.170 
mount it up pretty high and so this
soaker<00:04:36.330> hose<00:04:36.540> this<00:04:37.199> is<00:04:37.380> a<00:04:37.410> 50-footer<00:04:38.180> that

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
soaker hose this is a 50-footer that

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.050 
soaker hose this is a 50-footer that
goes<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.229> there<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:40.680> then<00:04:40.770> there's<00:04:41.310> a<00:04:41.370> 15-foot

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
goes to there and then there's a 15-foot

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.560 
goes to there and then there's a 15-foot
sectional<00:04:42.510> leader<00:04:42.750> hose<00:04:43.020> and<00:04:43.590> then

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
sectional leader hose and then

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.630 
sectional leader hose and then
got<00:04:46.570> another<00:04:46.750> 50<00:04:46.960> foot<00:04:47.370> section<00:04:48.370> growing<00:04:48.550> up

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
got another 50 foot section growing up

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.460 
got another 50 foot section growing up
here<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:49.440> our<00:04:50.440> lot<00:04:50.710> has<00:04:52.050> secondary<00:04:53.050> water<00:04:53.290> on

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
here and our lot has secondary water on

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.460 
here and our lot has secondary water on
it<00:04:53.620> so<00:04:53.740> that's<00:04:53.890> what<00:04:54.040> this<00:04:54.130> hook<00:04:54.400> to<00:04:54.690> it<00:04:55.690> is

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
it so that's what this hook to it is

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.100 
it so that's what this hook to it is
higher<00:04:56.710> pressure<00:04:57.150> and<00:04:58.150> so<00:04:58.540> the<00:04:58.660> soaker<00:04:58.870> hose

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
higher pressure and so the soaker hose

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.060 
higher pressure and so the soaker hose
is<00:04:59.260> really<00:04:59.530> spray<00:05:01.440> and<00:05:02.440> that<00:05:02.770> is<00:05:02.950> the

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
is really spray and that is the

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.230 
is really spray and that is the
clubhouse<00:05:03.430> we've<00:05:03.640> built<00:05:03.790> for<00:05:03.940> our<00:05:04.030> kids

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
clubhouse we've built for our kids

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.100 
clubhouse we've built for our kids

back half the front have two watermelons
and<00:06:09.770> I<00:06:10.770> think<00:06:10.979> up<00:06:11.100> there<00:06:11.310> as<00:06:11.460> well<00:06:11.639> I've<00:06:11.850> got<00:06:11.880> a

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
and I think up there as well I've got a

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.499 
and I think up there as well I've got a
couple<00:06:12.270> of<00:06:12.449> watermelons<00:06:12.960> and<00:06:13.050> so<00:06:13.400> anyway

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:14.509 
couple of watermelons and so anyway

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:17.390 
couple of watermelons and so anyway
that's<00:06:15.509> the<00:06:15.690> garden<00:06:16.110> and<00:06:16.289> taking<00:06:17.280> a<00:06:17.310> little

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
that's the garden and taking a little

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.330 
that's the garden and taking a little
bit<00:06:17.520> of<00:06:17.580> work<00:06:17.789> but<00:06:19.099> hopefully<00:06:20.099> it'll<00:06:20.220> be<00:06:20.250> worth

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
bit of work but hopefully it'll be worth

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.230 
bit of work but hopefully it'll be worth
it<00:06:20.639> so<00:06:20.849> anyway<00:06:22.310> hope<00:06:23.310> this<00:06:23.430> has<00:06:23.550> been<00:06:23.639> a<00:06:23.699> help<00:06:23.970> I

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
it so anyway hope this has been a help I

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.939 
it so anyway hope this has been a help I
think<00:06:24.750> just<00:06:25.080> the<00:06:25.139> biggest<00:06:25.440> thing<00:06:25.620> going<00:06:25.889> on

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:25.949 
think just the biggest thing going on

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:31.129 
think just the biggest thing going on
here<00:06:26.009> is<00:06:26.780> use<00:06:27.780> the<00:06:27.810> soaker<00:06:28.259> hoses<00:06:28.440> and<00:06:30.139> make

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 
here is use the soaker hoses and make

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:34.219 
here is use the soaker hoses and make
the<00:06:31.259> best<00:06:31.410> use<00:06:31.560> of<00:06:32.570> the<00:06:33.570> area<00:06:33.810> that<00:06:33.900> you<00:06:33.990> have

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
the best use of the area that you have

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:35.659 
the best use of the area that you have
because<00:06:34.560> I<00:06:34.650> mean<00:06:34.800> when<00:06:34.949> you<00:06:35.009> think<00:06:35.039> about<00:06:35.250> it<00:06:35.520> I

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:35.669 
because I mean when you think about it I

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.680 
because I mean when you think about it I
don't<00:06:35.820> really<00:06:35.940> have<00:06:36.210> much<00:06:36.449> garden<00:06:36.810> space<00:06:37.080> but

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
don't really have much garden space but

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.230 
don't really have much garden space but
but<00:06:39.690> I've<00:06:39.780> managed<00:06:40.139> to<00:06:40.880> squeeze<00:06:41.880> a<00:06:41.910> lot<00:06:42.120> of

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
but I've managed to squeeze a lot of

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.170 
but I've managed to squeeze a lot of
gardening<00:06:42.570> and<00:06:43.080> so<00:06:43.789> hopefully<00:06:44.789> I<00:06:44.820> have<00:06:45.000> more

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180
