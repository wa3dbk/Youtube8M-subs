00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.480
 good afternoon we started the wheel of 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.870
 press remember we ask a question 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.549
 by intervention with your name and in the 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.939
 so it is in English except with their 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.939
 fire investments on quality issues 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.939
 James 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.010
 later view jaime rodríguez del 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.740
 world wanted to count as a Christian and 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.660
 benzema that has happened to them and if it's in danger 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.750
 the final that what worries everything 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.370
 Christian is not like before the game 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.040
 after a good workout that has 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.280
 said yesterday that he had confidence in the 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.000
 Warming was not comfortable 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.420
 then see you now you are guided in 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.230
 Spain is a test all the tip that 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.300
 it is a small contracture then 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.430
 we are calm because I think it has 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.940
 the time to recover this to play 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.629
 the final 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.080
 also from hand when the 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:08.430
 candle lamp has been taken to the j 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.820
 height of the abductor a small thing 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.530
 also for him 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.650
 I think he has no problem playing the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.650
 final 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.670
 well you know today I entered the liza and 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.250
 they returned to play enough men that 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.990
 they were touched decades in the end like 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.720
 you have seen all of them 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.090
 I do not think I think everything is fine because I said 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.460
 has played without problems carvajal also 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.509
 at 45 minutes he has done very well 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.509
 I also tell you 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.950
 I needed to play for half an hour 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.260
 the conditions for the others played 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.260
 very good daily I thought 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:58.170
 nothing else now we start thinking is going to 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.170
 play the next game 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.170
 Pepe thinks he will arrive is very 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.170
 just like how this app 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.450
 half a half time 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.709
 I think tomorrow I start working in the 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.220
 field so far and its treatment has 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.769
 I started running in the gym hope 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.530
 that tomorrow begins to run also for 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.170
 see I think we have the confidence that 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.560
 He can play 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.209
 to be here where three weeks ago already 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.010
 you said that the usual substitute for 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.390
 xabi alonso national from ground to grass 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.459
 or list to say it was still your 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.930
 first option after the game of 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.910
 today that may have been the best 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.770
 of security is lately can you 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.370
 ensure that he's going to play Saturday 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:51.550
 that comes book so does not have has 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.720
 option not to get into the lineup 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.720
 I have a week of time 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:02.010
 I have to decide the best alignment 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.560
 possible is happy because there are now 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.070
 less after some games of low 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:12.630
 today he has played with rhythms with intensity 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:15.830
 with good position in the field until 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.830
 happy of the party that has said 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.080
 later the turret mystery of the 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.730
 be generally concerned about 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.650
 these annoyances of Christian benzema 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.090
 the physical state for the end of your 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.310
 players it is not clear that I would like 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.940
 that the whole team can train 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.480
 it can usually be that by some 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:40.360
 we need more individual work 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.400
 the important is that 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.650
 and all the equipment 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.299
 is ready for an afternoon players 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.730
 are ready to play I think 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:53.480
 only to place names also 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:58.940
 it's called we think they're going to be 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.800
 seen to play the final 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.570
 hello mister loves the rose daily 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.130
 taking into account that today they were not playing 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.020
 nothing and that next week is the 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.430
 final did not seem too much risk 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.320
 risk Christian who had to stop 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.990
 in the heating benzema 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.460
 Christian has practically played the 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.430
 last matches the game has said 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.489
 against the valence that has been had not 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.290
 were there a risk because I already know 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.420
 train normally I had a lot 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.420
 trust when not 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:33.580
 when you have nothing in the medical test 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.200
 we need the shelter of the radars is 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.600
 very very important then the 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.890
 player was very very comfortable happy 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:44.080
 I wanted to play to give him a minute later 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.690
 valencia it was important that he played 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:51.610
 later in the treatment I was not 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:55.979
 comfortable we have decided 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.979
 remove it from the game to avoid risk 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:04.540
 but diego towers of the country has said that 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.120
 you already have options to be a holder so 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.160
 that has been seen today would say the same of 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.860
 who will say that he has options to be 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.830
 owner friend we have to think that that 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.720
 give up there 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.020
 is going back to a very lesson 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.290
 important was a period where I have not 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.290
 I have 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:29.010
 Play has done very well 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.919
 it's fine it 's clear that we have to 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:35.150
 consider that a player who after 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.150
 long time 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.280
 the sense that at this moment 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.280
 Daily has more options 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.889
 now mister javier iglesias jr bernabéu 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.210
 puntocom I wanted to ask him about the 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.830
 left side we have already seen 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.460
 marcelo you know and who will play 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.249
 in lisbon 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.409
 marcelo encounter 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:04.109
 I do not know, I'm going to watch programming 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:08.330
 done very well today's game showed 

00:06:04.109 --> 00:06:10.800
 a very good physical condition then 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.320
 how like 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.910
 there is a lot of competition 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:20.380
 in this position I will not decide 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.970
 I have not decided yet 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.740
 we ask the last two questions 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.690
 what a good afternoon holy meana 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.670
 'radio brand' without dramatizing things 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.010
 but it can be said that the Christian does not 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.860
 He tells you the truth because you see him 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.270
 well in the previous and then player or not 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.400
 can play even ten minutes in 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.050
 valladolid or can not start the 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.670
 party something has to happen so that 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.130
 you say it's perfect on Friday 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.380
 and that Saturday does not play Christian no 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.740
 there's a problem is that when you have a 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.360
 end will not be skiing if 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.930
 was the last game the final 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:56.230
 clearly christian played this match 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:07:00.270
 having such an important end to 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.270
 I think it's all 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.990
 we do not need to take and also not 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:09.180
 he needs to take and study he was 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.729
 all right 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:14.870
 I've seen it well in the game those of the 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:14.870
 alignment after 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:23.940
 I was not comfortable like I said without 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.940
 risk let's think to the end 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.530
 Christian is very sincere 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.660
 last question is to practice it Alejandra 

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:34.660
 lopez for bernabe digital you wanted a 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.960
 match with so little intensity before 

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.960
 the final 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.139
 I thought it was a match like this with 

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:46.830
 little intensity because the team 

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:49.290
 otherwise I did not feel like doing 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:51.389
 needed points the game was a 

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:55.650
 normal match of the end of season 

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:59.690
 to avoid problems then everything 

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.690
 everything normal thank you very much
