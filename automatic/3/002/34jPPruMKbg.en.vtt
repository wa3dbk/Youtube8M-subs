00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.190 

okay<00:00:11.670> let's<00:00:11.910> talk<00:00:12.120> now<00:00:12.330> about<00:00:12.360> marking

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
okay let's talk now about marking

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.620 
okay let's talk now about marking
stencil<00:00:13.650> designs<00:00:13.980> right<00:00:14.310> on<00:00:14.460> your<00:00:14.610> fabric<00:00:15.150> and

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
stencil designs right on your fabric and

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.030 
stencil designs right on your fabric and
of<00:00:15.750> course<00:00:15.930> this<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.200> time<00:00:16.530> when<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:16.830> would

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040 
of course this is a time when I would

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.929 
of course this is a time when I would
use<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.430> washout<00:00:17.790> marker<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:19.490> this<00:00:20.490> design

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
use the washout marker and this design

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.519 
use the washout marker and this design
especially<00:00:21.150> when<00:00:21.600> you're<00:00:21.720> using<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.170> large

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
especially when you're using a large

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.980 
especially when you're using a large
background<00:00:22.980> design<00:00:23.610> like<00:00:23.849> this<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.240> usually<00:00:24.570> do

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
background design like this I usually do

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.839 
background design like this I usually do
mark<00:00:25.320> these<00:00:25.500> right<00:00:25.770> on<00:00:25.920> my<00:00:26.070> fabric<00:00:26.310> because

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
mark these right on my fabric because

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.510 
mark these right on my fabric because
the<00:00:26.970> pelting<00:00:27.540> paper<00:00:27.779> will<00:00:28.110> shift<00:00:28.860> just<00:00:29.160> enough

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
the pelting paper will shift just enough

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.519 
the pelting paper will shift just enough
that<00:00:29.700> the<00:00:29.790> lines<00:00:30.000> won't<00:00:30.239> stay<00:00:30.480> straight<00:00:30.869> so

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
that the lines won't stay straight so

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.250 
that the lines won't stay straight so
this<00:00:31.770> is<00:00:31.950> a<00:00:31.980> time<00:00:32.310> when<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.060> use<00:00:33.600> these<00:00:33.930> large

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
this is a time when I use these large

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.710 
this is a time when I use these large
stencils<00:00:34.680> which<00:00:35.010> are<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.579> nice<00:00:35.880> because<00:00:36.420> there

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
stencils which are so nice because there

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.750 
stencils which are so nice because there
you<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.260> line<00:00:37.680> them<00:00:37.860> up<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.190> perfectly<00:00:38.670> in

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
you can line them up just perfectly in

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.430 
you can line them up just perfectly in
your<00:00:38.940> quilt<00:00:39.149> block<00:00:39.390> or<00:00:39.660> if<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.020> larger

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
your quilt block or if you have a larger

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.810 
your quilt block or if you have a larger
quilt<00:00:40.680> they're<00:00:40.890> easy<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.220> line<00:00:41.460> up<00:00:41.640> with

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
quilt they're easy to line up with

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.479 
quilt they're easy to line up with
themselves<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.630> so<00:00:43.379> you'd<00:00:43.980> lay<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.399> right

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
themselves and so you'd lay this right

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.400 
themselves and so you'd lay this right
on<00:00:44.969> your<00:00:45.000> quilt<00:00:45.390> now<00:00:45.660> notice<00:00:45.989> I've<00:00:46.199> already

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
on your quilt now notice I've already

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.200 
on your quilt now notice I've already
basted<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.699> typically<00:00:48.710> when<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.090> mark<00:00:51.090> a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
basted this and typically when I mark a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.779 
basted this and typically when I mark a
quilt<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.929> always<00:00:52.350> after<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:53.010> basted<00:00:53.609> it

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
quilt it is always after it's basted it

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.720 
quilt it is always after it's basted it
is<00:00:54.359> very<00:00:55.079> easy<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.679> mark<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.100> quote<00:00:56.280> before<00:00:56.609> it's

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
is very easy to mark a quote before it's

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.220 
is very easy to mark a quote before it's
based<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.210> if<00:00:57.269> you<00:00:57.390> already<00:00:57.570> know<00:00:57.839> how<00:00:58.019> you're

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
based and if you already know how you're

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.509 
based and if you already know how you're
going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.379> quilt<00:00:58.620> your<00:00:58.829> quilt<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.339> want

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
going to quilt your quilt and you want

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.069 
going to quilt your quilt and you want
to<00:00:59.579> mark<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.820> prior<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.089> basting<00:01:00.629> that's

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
to mark it prior to basting that's

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.619 
to mark it prior to basting that's
perfectly<00:01:01.649> fine<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.339> reason<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.210> have

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
perfectly fine the reason that I have

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.320 
perfectly fine the reason that I have
always<00:01:03.870> based<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.949> mine<00:01:05.129> first<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.850> that

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
always based in mine first is that

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.640 
always based in mine first is that
typically<00:01:06.870> I'm<00:01:07.050> getting<00:01:07.290> quilts<00:01:07.590> from

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
typically I'm getting quilts from

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.230 
typically I'm getting quilts from
customers<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.250> I've<00:01:08.490> never<00:01:08.790> seen<00:01:09.090> before

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
customers that I've never seen before

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.330 
customers that I've never seen before
and<00:01:09.480> I<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:09.960> no<00:01:09.990> idea<00:01:10.800> how<00:01:11.010> I'm<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.280> to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
and I have no idea how I'm going to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.370 
and I have no idea how I'm going to
quilt<00:01:11.580> them<00:01:11.760> when<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.909> see<00:01:12.210> them<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.050> when<00:01:13.260> I'm

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
quilt them when I see them so when I'm

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.770 
quilt them when I see them so when I'm
going<00:01:13.860> through<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.130> basting<00:01:14.610> process<00:01:15.180> my

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
going through the basting process my

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.170 
going through the basting process my
ideas<00:01:16.290> flow<00:01:16.710> then<00:01:17.040> when<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.280> see<00:01:17.550> it<00:01:17.640> laid<00:01:17.910> out

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
ideas flow then when I see it laid out

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.050 
ideas flow then when I see it laid out
on<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> table<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.230> can<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.650> exactly<00:01:20.220> how<00:01:21.030> I

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
on the table and I can see exactly how I

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.880 
on the table and I can see exactly how I
want<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> quilt<00:01:21.690> it<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.990> then<00:01:22.140> my<00:01:22.320> ideas<00:01:22.710> are

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
want to quilt it and then my ideas are

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.680 
want to quilt it and then my ideas are
much<00:01:23.190> better<00:01:23.460> then<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.240> more<00:01:24.390> time<00:01:24.570> to

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
much better then I have more time to

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.320 
much better then I have more time to
think<00:01:24.720> about<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.800> most<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> time<00:01:26.940> my

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
think about it so most of the time my

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.090 
think about it so most of the time my
quilts<00:01:27.750> are<00:01:27.870> already<00:01:28.260> basted<00:01:28.680> by<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:28.860> time

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
quilts are already basted by the time

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.520 
quilts are already basted by the time
I'm<00:01:29.310> marking<00:01:29.730> them<00:01:29.910> now<00:01:30.510> when<00:01:30.690> you<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:31.050> pins

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
I'm marking them now when you have pins

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.950 
I'm marking them now when you have pins
already<00:01:32.160> in<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.670> quilt<00:01:32.970> top<00:01:33.300> and<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.750> lay<00:01:33.930> a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
already in the quilt top and you lay a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.570 
already in the quilt top and you lay a
stencil<00:01:34.350> over<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> top<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.130> don't<00:01:35.280> want<00:01:35.490> to

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
stencil over the top you don't want to

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.370 
stencil over the top you don't want to
take<00:01:35.730> the<00:01:35.880> pins<00:01:36.120> out<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.690> want<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.020> leave<00:01:37.170> them

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
take the pins out you want to leave them

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.330 
take the pins out you want to leave them
there<00:01:37.410> and<00:01:38.160> you<00:01:38.370> simply<00:01:39.120> lay<00:01:40.080> this<00:01:40.470> over<00:01:41.160> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
there and you simply lay this over the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.530 
there and you simply lay this over the
top<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:42.030> your<00:01:42.360> design<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.760> mark<00:01:44.760> in<00:01:45.060> those

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
top of your design and mark in those

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.950 
top of your design and mark in those
channels<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:46.980> stencil<00:01:47.660> wherever<00:01:48.660> you

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
channels of the stencil wherever you

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.870 
channels of the stencil wherever you
need<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.620> if<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.890> run<00:01:50.100> into<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> pin<00:01:50.850> you

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
need to and if you run into a pin you

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.990

mark<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.510> either<00:01:51.720> side<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.820> then<00:01:53.820> you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
mark on either side of it and then you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.570 
mark on either side of it and then you
slip<00:01:54.300> your<00:01:54.510> hand<00:01:54.750> underneath<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.620> flip<00:01:55.650> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
pin over and Mark in that spot where it

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.310 
pin over and Mark in that spot where it
blocked<00:01:59.040> prior<00:01:59.550> to<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.140> keep

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
blocked prior to that and you just keep

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.610 
blocked prior to that and you just keep
going<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.980> and<00:02:02.280> Mark<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:04.050> exactly<00:02:04.440> like

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
that and keep on going and then check to

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.589 
that and keep on going and then check to
make<00:02:07.200> sure<00:02:07.260> you've<00:02:07.620> got<00:02:07.800> all<00:02:07.830> your<00:02:08.340> lines

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
make sure you've got all your lines

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.210 
make sure you've got all your lines
drawn<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.379> can<00:02:10.560> see<00:02:10.830> everything

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
drawn and that you can see everything

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.360 
drawn and that you can see everything
and<00:02:11.819> then<00:02:12.599> if<00:02:12.900> I'm<00:02:13.230> using<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.800> stencil<00:02:14.099> that

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
and then if I'm using a stencil that

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.190 
and then if I'm using a stencil that
I've<00:02:14.640> not<00:02:14.879> used<00:02:15.060> before<00:02:15.540> or<00:02:15.750> something<00:02:15.900> that's

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
I've not used before or something that's

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.410 
I've not used before or something that's
an<00:02:16.470> intricate<00:02:16.920> pattern<00:02:17.129> I<00:02:17.610> will<00:02:18.060> take<00:02:18.269> the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
an intricate pattern I will take the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.440 
an intricate pattern I will take the
stencil<00:02:18.629> away<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.890> will<00:02:19.950> fill<00:02:20.430> in<00:02:20.730> on<00:02:21.120> my

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
stencil away and I will fill in on my

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.280 
stencil away and I will fill in on my
quilt<00:02:21.870> those<00:02:22.440> places

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
quilt those places

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.910 
quilt those places
where<00:02:23.409> the<00:02:24.010> stencil<00:02:24.579> has<00:02:25.000> has<00:02:25.930> brakes<00:02:26.349> and<00:02:26.769> the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
where the stencil has has brakes and the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.319 
where the stencil has has brakes and the
reason<00:02:27.159> they<00:02:27.250> have<00:02:27.400> brakes<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.849> to<00:02:28.000> hold<00:02:28.150> them

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
reason they have brakes is to hold them

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.589 
reason they have brakes is to hold them
together<00:02:28.450> so<00:02:29.409> you<00:02:29.829> need<00:02:30.159> to<00:02:30.310> fill<00:02:30.609> those<00:02:30.819> in<00:02:30.879> to

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
together so you need to fill those in to

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.000 
together so you need to fill those in to
make<00:02:31.810> sure<00:02:32.019> that<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:32.379> know<00:02:32.560> where<00:02:32.829> you're

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
make sure that you know where you're

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.149 
make sure that you know where you're
going<00:02:33.129> to<00:02:33.189> stitch<00:02:33.459> next<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:34.719> I<00:02:35.109> have<00:02:35.500> one<00:02:35.769> here

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
going to stitch next so I have one here

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.920 
going to stitch next so I have one here
that<00:02:36.340> I've<00:02:36.459> already<00:02:36.879> marked<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.659> I've

that I've already marked and I've
already<00:02:38.230> started<00:02:38.469> stitching<00:02:39.040> on<00:02:39.159> I<00:02:39.189> just<00:02:39.579> want

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
already started stitching on I just want

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.539 
already started stitching on I just want
to<00:02:39.879> show<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.180> what<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:41.439> simple<00:02:42.099> way<00:02:42.310> of

to show you what the simple way of
quilting<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.120> cross-hatching<00:02:43.689> design<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.650> the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
quilting a cross-hatching design and the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.520 
quilting a cross-hatching design and the
nice<00:02:45.640> thing<00:02:45.939> about<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.390> is<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.720> can<00:02:46.930> just<00:02:47.200> keep

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
nice thing about it is you can just keep

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.339 
nice thing about it is you can just keep
on<00:02:47.920> going<00:02:47.980> if<00:02:48.819> you<00:02:48.970> can<00:02:49.150> see<00:02:49.450> where<00:02:50.079> I've

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
on going if you can see where I've

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.490 
on going if you can see where I've
stitched<00:02:50.829> and<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.700> can<00:02:51.879> just<00:02:52.120> keep<00:02:52.900> going<00:02:52.959> and

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
I went across here outside the quilt and

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.559 
I went across here outside the quilt and
then<00:02:55.959> I<00:02:55.989> kept<00:02:56.409> on<00:02:56.590> going<00:02:56.859> over<00:02:57.430> here<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:57.909> you

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
can actually stitch this entire thing

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.509 
can actually stitch this entire thing
between<00:03:01.689> running<00:03:02.409> over<00:03:02.919> the<00:03:03.069> edge<00:03:03.220> of<00:03:03.459> the

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
between running over the edge of the

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.599 
between running over the edge of the
quilt<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:03.970> then<00:03:04.359> jumping<00:03:05.200> over<00:03:05.980> here<00:03:06.310> where

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
quilt and then jumping over here where

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.960 
quilt and then jumping over here where
you're<00:03:07.120> near<00:03:07.389> the<00:03:07.569> star<00:03:07.840> Center<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.760> nice

you're near the star Center so the nice

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.149 
you're near the star Center so the nice
thing<00:03:10.000> about<00:03:10.389> these<00:03:10.840> type<00:03:11.260> of<00:03:11.290> designs<00:03:11.799> is<00:03:12.099> you

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
thing about these type of designs is you

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.220 
thing about these type of designs is you
never<00:03:12.790> have<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.180> stop<00:03:13.359> you<00:03:13.599> can<00:03:13.720> just<00:03:13.870> keep<00:03:14.049> on

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
never have to stop you can just keep on

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.580 
never have to stop you can just keep on
quilt<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.709> it's<00:03:14.799> all<00:03:15.040> continuous<00:03:16.590> here's

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
quilt and it's all continuous here's

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.379 
quilt and it's all continuous here's
another<00:03:17.950> example<00:03:18.189> of<00:03:18.669> when<00:03:18.879> I've<00:03:19.030> used<00:03:19.269> a

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
another example of when I've used a

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.179 
another example of when I've used a
background<00:03:19.870> design<00:03:20.319> this<00:03:20.590> is<00:03:20.739> a<00:03:20.769> finished

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:21.189 
background design this is a finished

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:23.339 
background design this is a finished
quilt<00:03:21.489> that<00:03:21.730> I<00:03:21.790> have<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.510> this<00:03:23.019> is<00:03:23.169> the

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
quilt that I have and this is the

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.379 
quilt that I have and this is the
stencil<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.859> I<00:03:23.980> used<00:03:24.310> in<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:24.639> background<00:03:25.209> of

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
stencil that I used in the background of

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.629 
stencil that I used in the background of
it<00:03:25.540> when<00:03:26.049> you<00:03:26.169> use<00:03:26.409> designs<00:03:26.919> like<00:03:27.189> this<00:03:27.370> in<00:03:27.549> the

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
it when you use designs like this in the

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.520 
it when you use designs like this in the
background<00:03:27.909> especially<00:03:28.659> but<00:03:29.079> behind

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
background especially but behind

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.490 
background especially but behind
applique<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.699> makes<00:03:31.120> your<00:03:31.329> background<00:03:31.959> recede

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
applique it makes your background recede

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.490 
applique it makes your background recede
and<00:03:32.739> your<00:03:33.220> applique<00:03:33.790> pop<00:03:34.090> forward<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:34.959> so

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
and your applique pop forward and so

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.890 
and your applique pop forward and so
this<00:03:35.739> is<00:03:35.889> another<00:03:36.220> place<00:03:36.940> where<00:03:37.239> I<00:03:37.269> had<00:03:37.599> to<00:03:37.720> use

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
this is another place where I had to use

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.259 
this is another place where I had to use
this<00:03:38.109> stencil<00:03:38.440> but<00:03:39.190> I<00:03:39.220> would<00:03:39.519> have<00:03:39.639> had<00:03:39.879> to

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
this stencil but I would have had to

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.860 
this stencil but I would have had to
line<00:03:40.629> it<00:03:40.659> up<00:03:41.220> across<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.729> top<00:03:43.000> of<00:03:43.030> this<00:03:43.479> quilt

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
line it up across the top of this quilt

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.949 
line it up across the top of this quilt
and<00:03:44.319> these<00:03:45.190> larger<00:03:45.729> size<00:03:45.970> stencils<00:03:46.569> make<00:03:46.750> that

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
and these larger size stencils make that

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.860 
and these larger size stencils make that
very<00:03:47.349> simple<00:03:47.979> because<00:03:48.159> I<00:03:48.340> can<00:03:48.609> overlap<00:03:49.150> parts

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
very simple because I can overlap parts

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.990 
very simple because I can overlap parts
that<00:03:50.049> I've<00:03:50.169> already<00:03:50.530> marked<00:03:50.949> and<00:03:51.129> then<00:03:51.669> line

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
that I've already marked and then line

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.509 
that I've already marked and then line
that<00:03:52.209> up<00:03:52.239> with<00:03:52.569> the<00:03:52.750> areas<00:03:53.530> of<00:03:53.769> this<00:03:53.949> of<00:03:54.159> this

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
that up with the areas of this of this

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.599 
that up with the areas of this of this
inner<00:03:54.790> border<00:03:55.299> and<00:03:55.510> it<00:03:55.989> just<00:03:56.409> makes<00:03:56.859> life<00:03:57.190> so

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
inner border and it just makes life so

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.909 
inner border and it just makes life so
much<00:03:57.639> simpler<00:03:58.269> to<00:03:58.750> get<00:03:58.959> that<00:03:59.169> background<00:03:59.620> line

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
much simpler to get that background line

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:03.990 
much simpler to get that background line
straight<00:04:00.609> I<00:04:02.069> just<00:04:03.069> want<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.340> show<00:04:03.519> you<00:04:03.579> a

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
straight I just want to show you a

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.839 
straight I just want to show you a
continuous<00:04:04.870> line<00:04:05.079> design<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.829> sometimes<00:04:06.669> you

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
continuous line design and sometimes you

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.339 
continuous line design and sometimes you
have<00:04:06.879> to<00:04:07.150> think<00:04:07.299> about<00:04:07.510> things<00:04:07.810> a<00:04:07.989> little<00:04:08.109> bit

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
have to think about things a little bit

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.140 
have to think about things a little bit
different<00:04:08.829> to<00:04:09.189> understand<00:04:09.790> how<00:04:10.090> the

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
different to understand how the

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.390 
different to understand how the
continuous<00:04:10.810> line<00:04:11.049> works<00:04:11.439> every<00:04:11.949> stencil<00:04:12.370> of

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
continuous line works every stencil of

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.099 
continuous line works every stencil of
course<00:04:12.639> is<00:04:12.760> going<00:04:12.879> to<00:04:12.939> be<00:04:13.090> different<00:04:13.329> but<00:04:13.870> this

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
course is going to be different but this

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.589 
course is going to be different but this
one<00:04:14.290> is<00:04:14.409> a<00:04:14.439> really<00:04:14.739> good<00:04:15.069> example<00:04:15.189> of<00:04:15.879> how<00:04:16.269> you

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:16.599 
one is a really good example of how you

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:18.539 
one is a really good example of how you
have<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:17.169> think<00:04:17.470> about<00:04:17.739> keeping<00:04:18.400> this

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
have to think about keeping this

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.640 
have to think about keeping this
continuous<00:04:19.269> what<00:04:19.750> you<00:04:19.900> see<00:04:20.139> here<00:04:20.440> are<00:04:20.620> a

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
continuous what you see here are a

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.350 
continuous what you see here are a
series<00:04:20.829> of<00:04:21.009> hearts<00:04:21.549> and<00:04:21.759> so<00:04:21.880> you<00:04:21.940> think<00:04:22.270> you're

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
series of hearts and so you think you're

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.730 
series of hearts and so you think you're
going<00:04:22.479> to<00:04:22.539> quilt<00:04:22.780> a<00:04:22.900> heart<00:04:23.139> and<00:04:23.380> then<00:04:23.500> quote

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
going to quilt a heart and then quote

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.140 
going to quilt a heart and then quote
the<00:04:23.889> next<00:04:24.130> heart<00:04:24.340> and<00:04:24.550> then<00:04:24.639> quote<00:04:24.820> the<00:04:24.940> next

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
the next heart and then quote the next

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.060 
the next heart and then quote the next
heart<00:04:25.300> but<00:04:25.419> that's<00:04:25.599> not<00:04:25.780> how<00:04:25.930> this<00:04:26.080> works<00:04:26.139> this

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
heart but that's not how this works this

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.680 
heart but that's not how this works this
is<00:04:27.250> a<00:04:27.280> border<00:04:27.669> design<00:04:27.970> and<00:04:28.180> so<00:04:28.270> this<00:04:28.419> is<00:04:28.570> the

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
is a border design and so this is the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.749 
is a border design and so this is the
corner<00:04:29.110> so<00:04:29.289> think<00:04:29.500> about<00:04:29.710> this<00:04:29.889> going<00:04:30.099> all<00:04:30.400> the

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
corner so think about this going all the

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.860 
corner so think about this going all the
way<00:04:30.789> around<00:04:31.270> your<00:04:31.450> quilt<00:04:31.750> and

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
way around your quilt and

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.690 
way around your quilt and
the<00:04:33.260> way<00:04:33.410> you<00:04:33.470> would<00:04:33.740> quilt<00:04:34.070> this<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:34.460> keep

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
the way you would quilt this to keep

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.230 
the way you would quilt this to keep
going<00:04:35.000> is<00:04:35.360> you<00:04:35.930> would<00:04:36.110> start<00:04:36.470> here<00:04:37.460> or<00:04:37.669> this<00:04:38.060> is

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
going is you would start here or this is

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.480 
going is you would start here or this is
one<00:04:38.450> place<00:04:38.660> you<00:04:38.690> could<00:04:39.020> start<00:04:39.410> and<00:04:39.800> come<00:04:40.310> up

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
one place you could start and come up

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.850 
one place you could start and come up
here<00:04:40.910> and<00:04:41.090> go<00:04:41.270> across<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.780> top<00:04:42.020> of<00:04:42.260> this<00:04:42.440> heart

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
here and go across the top of this heart

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.240 
here and go across the top of this heart
do<00:04:43.730> the<00:04:43.760> loop<00:04:44.180> here<00:04:44.900> do<00:04:45.350> the<00:04:45.500> bottom<00:04:45.889> of<00:04:46.040> this

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
do the loop here do the bottom of this

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.060 
do the loop here do the bottom of this
heart<00:04:46.610> do<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.270> loop<00:04:47.630> here<00:04:48.139> and<00:04:48.290> then<00:04:48.740> do<00:04:48.919> the

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
heart do the loop here and then do the

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.970 
heart do the loop here and then do the
top<00:04:49.310> of<00:04:49.550> this<00:04:49.700> heart<00:04:50.090> and<00:04:50.330> continue<00:04:51.020> on<00:04:51.260> just

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
top of this heart and continue on just

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.140 
top of this heart and continue on just
like<00:04:52.250> that<00:04:52.280> all<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:53.540> way<00:04:53.720> around<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.560> quilt

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
like that all the way around the quilt

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.270 
like that all the way around the quilt
until<00:04:56.150> you<00:04:56.300> come<00:04:56.510> all<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:56.810> way<00:04:56.840> back<00:04:56.960> and<00:04:57.830> then

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
until you come all the way back and then

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.510 
until you come all the way back and then
you<00:04:58.430> would<00:04:58.580> end<00:04:58.820> up<00:04:59.030> down<00:05:00.020> here<00:05:00.310> you<00:05:01.310> should<00:05:01.490> be

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
you would end up down here you should be

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.550 
you would end up down here you should be
coming<00:05:01.820> from<00:05:01.910> the<00:05:02.210> top<00:05:02.419> of<00:05:02.690> this<00:05:02.870> heart<00:05:03.230> down

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
coming from the top of this heart down

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.800 
coming from the top of this heart down
to<00:05:03.800> here<00:05:04.130> which<00:05:04.310> is<00:05:04.340> where<00:05:04.639> we<00:05:04.760> started<00:05:05.240> then

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
to here which is where we started then

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.200 
to here which is where we started then
you<00:05:05.840> would<00:05:06.110> have<00:05:06.290> to<00:05:06.530> fill<00:05:06.889> in<00:05:07.160> the<00:05:07.639> bottom<00:05:08.060> of

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
you would have to fill in the bottom of

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.020 
you would have to fill in the bottom of
this<00:05:08.360> heart<00:05:08.750> the<00:05:09.380> top<00:05:09.680> of<00:05:09.919> this<00:05:10.100> heart<00:05:10.460> the

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
this heart the top of this heart the

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.210 
this heart the top of this heart the
bottom<00:05:11.419> of<00:05:11.570> this<00:05:11.750> heart<00:05:12.080> in<00:05:12.290> the<00:05:12.680> top<00:05:12.889> of<00:05:13.100> this

bottom of this heart in the top of this

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.010 
bottom of this heart in the top of this
one<00:05:13.400> and<00:05:13.669> so<00:05:13.910> on<00:05:13.940> around<00:05:14.450> so<00:05:14.690> you're<00:05:14.840> actually

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
one and so on around so you're actually

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.460 
one and so on around so you're actually
making<00:05:15.410> two<00:05:15.560> trips<00:05:16.100> around<00:05:16.430> your<00:05:16.700> quilt<00:05:17.470> but

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
making two trips around your quilt but

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.190 
making two trips around your quilt but
you're<00:05:18.710> never<00:05:19.610> having<00:05:19.910> to<00:05:20.210> stop<00:05:20.540> and<00:05:20.780> cut<00:05:21.080> your

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
you're never having to stop and cut your

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.530 
you're never having to stop and cut your
threads
