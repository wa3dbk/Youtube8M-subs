00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
repeat what we did before right section

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.859 
repeat what we did before right section
under<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> middle<00:01:07.670> left<00:01:08.670> section<00:01:09.030> under<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
under the middle left section under the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.760 
under the middle left section under the
middle<00:01:11.090> this<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.270> basically<00:01:12.750> like<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.320> French

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
middle this is basically like a French

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.070 
middle this is basically like a French
braid<00:01:14.070> but<00:01:14.520> instead<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.060> leaving<00:01:15.330> your<00:01:15.720> hair

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
braid but instead of leaving your hair

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.740 
braid but instead of leaving your hair
over<00:01:16.590> one<00:01:17.250> another<00:01:17.729> you're<00:01:18.090> gonna<00:01:18.180> weave<00:01:18.509> it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
over one another you're gonna weave it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.010 
over one another you're gonna weave it
under<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.920> Dutch<00:01:20.159> braid<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
under so it's a Dutch braid and it's a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.109 
under so it's a Dutch braid and it's a
diagonal<00:01:22.710> Dutch<00:01:22.920> braid<00:01:23.220> because<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.640> started

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
diagonal Dutch braid because you started

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.990 
diagonal Dutch braid because you started
on<00:01:24.299> one<00:01:24.720> side<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.170> your<00:01:25.320> head<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.000> diagonally

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
on one side of your head and diagonally

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.990 
on one side of your head and diagonally
weave<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.049> down<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.979> other<00:01:29.100> side<00:01:29.400> so

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
weave it down to the other side so

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.020 
weave it down to the other side so
that's<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.540> only<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:31.229> trick<00:01:31.619> here

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
that's like the only little trick here

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.789 
that's like the only little trick here
otherwise<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.390> really<00:01:33.810> really<00:01:34.020> simple<00:01:34.049> I

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
otherwise it's really really simple I

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.740 
otherwise it's really really simple I
kind<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.189> had<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.640> practice<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.360> couple

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
kind of had to practice this a couple

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.109 
kind of had to practice this a couple
times<00:01:36.979> for<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> braid<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.430> come<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.790> nice<00:01:39.060> and

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
times for the braid to come out nice and

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.830 
times for the braid to come out nice and
and<00:01:40.009> whatever<00:01:41.009> but<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.820> think<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:42.360> practice

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
and whatever but I think just practice

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.929 
and whatever but I think just practice
makes<00:01:43.049> perfect<00:01:44.659> also<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.860> demo<00:01:47.159> actually

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
makes perfect also in this demo actually

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.789 
makes perfect also in this demo actually
have<00:01:48.210> nothing<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.869> my<00:01:48.960> hair<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.560> washed

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
have nothing in my hair I just washed

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.550 
have nothing in my hair I just washed
and<00:01:50.130> air<00:01:50.399> dried<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.570> found<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.409> that

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
and air dried it so I found that that

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.950 
and air dried it so I found that that
was<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.799> little<00:01:53.070> bit<00:01:53.280> easier<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:54.149> Dutch<00:01:54.570> braid

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
was a little bit easier to Dutch braid

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.920 
was a little bit easier to Dutch braid
compared<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.890> having

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
compared to having

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.300 
compared to having
products<00:01:57.740> or<00:01:58.010> like<00:01:58.190> anything<00:01:58.610> in<00:01:58.700> your<00:01:58.790> hair

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.440 

all<00:02:04.310> right<00:02:04.430> so<00:02:04.610> a<00:02:04.640> little<00:02:04.850> side<00:02:05.060> note<00:02:05.090> my

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
all right so a little side note my

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.600
