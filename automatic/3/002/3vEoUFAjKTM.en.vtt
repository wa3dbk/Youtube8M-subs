this<00:00:21.810> will<00:00:21.990> be<00:00:22.080> our<00:00:22.230> only<00:00:22.260> source<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.949> light<00:00:23.090> so

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
this will be our only source of light so

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.169 
this will be our only source of light so
let's<00:00:24.300> get<00:00:24.480> over<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.170> set<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.910> begin<00:00:27.080> as<00:00:29.179> a

do<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.469> we're<00:00:49.620> literally<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.309> like

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
do is we're literally going to like

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.729 
do is we're literally going to like
paint<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.149> lighting<00:00:51.600> onto<00:00:52.230> our<00:00:52.350> still<00:00:52.710> life

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
paint the lighting onto our still life

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.750 
paint the lighting onto our still life
and<00:00:53.420> use<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.629> couple<00:00:54.660> different<00:00:55.199> techniques

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
and use it a couple different techniques

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.099 
and use it a couple different techniques
show<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.820> how<00:00:57.239> creative<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.809> can<00:00:57.930> actually

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
show you how creative you can actually

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.779 
show you how creative you can actually
be<00:00:58.440> using<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.120> flashlight<00:01:00.120> technique<00:01:01.789> also

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
be using this flashlight technique also

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.090 
be using this flashlight technique also
I'm<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.539> shooting<00:01:03.750> at<00:01:03.989> 15<00:01:04.470> seconds

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
I'm going to be shooting at 15 seconds

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.429 
I'm going to be shooting at 15 seconds
so<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:06.119> allows<00:01:06.330> me<00:01:06.479> enough<00:01:06.659> time<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.930> do

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
so it allows me enough time to do

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.190 
so it allows me enough time to do
different<00:01:07.799> things<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.310> at<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> rather<00:01:09.540> deep

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
different things and at a rather deep

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.120 
different things and at a rather deep
f-stop<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.770> f-22<00:01:11.729> 225<00:01:12.689> click<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.799> see<00:01:13.830> plenty

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
f-stop of f-22 225 click you see plenty

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.520 
f-stop of f-22 225 click you see plenty
of<00:01:14.280> time<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.820> play<00:01:15.060> around<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.720> do<00:01:16.200> different

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
of time to play around and do different

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.770 
of time to play around and do different
effects<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.610> let's<00:01:17.790> get<00:01:17.909> started<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:21.509> shutter

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
effects so let's get started the shutter

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.260 
effects so let's get started the shutter
and<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.229> 15<00:01:22.619> seconds<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.189> work<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:24.090> this

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
and you have 15 seconds to work in this

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.270 
and you have 15 seconds to work in this
particular<00:01:24.840> case<00:01:25.049> I'm<00:01:25.290> going<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.590> light<00:01:25.740> three

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
particular case I'm going to light three

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.539 
particular case I'm going to light three
sides<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> object<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.020> tips<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.310> two

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
sides of the object the tips and the two

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.580 
sides of the object the tips and the two
outside<00:01:30.000> edges

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.520 

let's<00:01:34.490> take<00:01:34.729> a<00:01:34.759> look<00:01:34.970> at<00:01:35.119> that

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.920 

see<00:01:38.100> how<00:01:38.250> great<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.700> looks<00:01:38.880> already<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.840> you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
see how great that looks already and you

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.240 
see how great that looks already and you
just<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.260> to<00:01:40.350> play<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:40.920> amount<00:01:41.160> of

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
just have to play with the amount of

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.740 
just have to play with the amount of
light<00:01:41.550> you<00:01:41.580> put<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.360> object<00:01:44.540> all<00:01:45.540> right

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
light you put on the object all right

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.210 
light you put on the object all right
let's<00:01:46.020> try<00:01:46.200> something<00:01:46.470> else<00:01:46.680> I'm<00:01:47.010> going<00:01:47.160> to

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220

I'm just going to backlight it just to
see<00:01:52.229> what<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.410> effect<00:01:52.920> looks<00:01:53.160> like<00:01:55.400> but

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.120 
very creative way to shoot now let's add
two<00:02:03.540> angles<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.020> light<00:02:04.080> I'm<00:02:04.470> going<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.860> do<00:02:04.979> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
two angles of light I'm going to do the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.900 
two angles of light I'm going to do the
backlighting

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
backlighting

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.440

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.030 
I'm going to go over and just highlight
the<00:02:12.150> type<00:02:12.450> on<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.959> front<00:02:13.290> wrench<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.800> little

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
the type on that front wrench a little

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.990 
the type on that front wrench a little
bit<00:02:15.920> now<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:16.950> can<00:02:17.220> see<00:02:17.430> we<00:02:17.580> have<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.850> nice

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
bit now you can see we have the nice

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.030 
bit now you can see we have the nice
backlight<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.930> little<00:02:19.200> highlight<00:02:19.590> on<00:02:19.800> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
backlight and a little highlight on the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.260 
backlight and a little highlight on the
writing<00:02:20.430> on<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.640> front<00:02:21.090> wrench<00:02:23.030> let's<00:02:24.030> add<00:02:24.239> a

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
writing on that front wrench let's add a

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.210 
writing on that front wrench let's add a
third<00:02:24.420> light<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.290> speak<00:02:25.650> we'll<00:02:25.980> do<00:02:26.100> the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
third light so to speak we'll do the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.460 
third light so to speak we'll do the
back<00:02:26.430> lighting<00:02:26.790> like<00:02:26.970> this<00:02:27.239> just<00:02:28.050> like<00:02:28.200> we<00:02:28.320> did

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
back lighting like this just like we did

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.430 
back lighting like this just like we did
in<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.680> first<00:02:28.860> one<00:02:29.690> then<00:02:30.690> let's<00:02:30.930> add<00:02:31.200> the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
in the first one then let's add the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.979 
in the first one then let's add the
light<00:02:31.650> on<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.100> writing<00:02:32.550> as<00:02:32.730> we<00:02:33.660> did<00:02:33.810> in<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
light on the writing as we did in the

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.860 
light on the writing as we did in the
second<00:02:34.350> one<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:35.000> now<00:02:36.000> let's<00:02:36.239> add<00:02:36.420> some<00:02:36.450> light

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
second one and now let's add some light

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.729 
second one and now let's add some light
in<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.080> front<00:02:38.930> let's<00:02:39.930> take<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.200> look<00:02:40.410> at<00:02:40.530> that

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.470 

so<00:02:43.739> you<00:02:43.860> can<00:02:44.040> see<00:02:44.070> by<00:02:44.459> moving<00:02:44.730> around<00:02:45.209> with<00:02:45.450> the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
so you can see by moving around with the

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.300 
so you can see by moving around with the
flashlight<00:02:46.049> you<00:02:46.200> can<00:02:46.350> create<00:02:46.620> just<00:02:46.890> about<00:02:47.070> any

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
flashlight you can create just about any

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.990 
flashlight you can create just about any
kind<00:02:47.519> of<00:02:47.700> look<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:47.910> want<00:02:49.580> now<00:02:50.580> let's<00:02:50.760> try<00:02:50.970> a

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
kind of look you want now let's try a

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.490 
kind of look you want now let's try a
totally<00:02:51.420> different<00:02:51.780> style<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.290> lighting

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
totally different style of lighting

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.990 
totally different style of lighting
we're<00:02:52.890> going<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.160> light<00:02:53.310> from<00:02:53.489> directly

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
we're going to light from directly

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.420 
we're going to light from directly
overhead<00:02:54.299> so<00:02:55.019> we<00:02:55.140> open<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.560> lens<00:02:55.739> we<00:02:56.160> have<00:02:56.280> our

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
overhead so we open the lens we have our

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.300 
overhead so we open the lens we have our
15<00:02:56.820> seconds<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:57.660> I'm<00:02:58.290> just<00:02:58.530> sort<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.739> painting

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
15 seconds and I'm just sort of painting

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.140 
15 seconds and I'm just sort of painting
the<00:02:59.430> light<00:02:59.640> on<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.510> objects<00:03:01.850> it's<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.880> very

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
the light on the objects it's a very

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.940 
the light on the objects it's a very
creative<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.959> effective<00:03:04.230> way<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.650> light

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
creative and effective way to light

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.199 
creative and effective way to light
something<00:03:05.220> let's<00:03:05.970> take<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.239> look<00:03:06.480> at<00:03:06.600> that<00:03:08.209> well

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
something let's take a look at that well

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.910 
something let's take a look at that well
that<00:03:09.390> really<00:03:09.630> looks<00:03:09.840> nice<00:03:09.989> too<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.890> can

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
that really looks nice too so you can

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.680 
that really looks nice too so you can
see<00:03:11.070> how<00:03:11.370> adaptable<00:03:11.970> this<00:03:12.120> type<00:03:12.329> of<00:03:12.450> lighting

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
see how adaptable this type of lighting

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.390 
see how adaptable this type of lighting
is<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.260> if<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.500> use<00:03:13.620> different<00:03:13.950> kinds<00:03:14.310> of

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
is and if you use different kinds of

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.740 
is and if you use different kinds of
flashlights<00:03:14.970> imagine<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.510> different

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
flashlights imagine the different

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.550 
flashlights imagine the different
possibilities<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.680> are<00:03:16.709> available<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.850> you

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
possibilities that are available to you

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.560 
possibilities that are available to you
so<00:03:19.560> give<00:03:19.799> it<00:03:19.829> a<00:03:19.980> try<00:03:20.010> it's<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:20.790> great<00:03:21.180> fun

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
so give it a try it's a great fun

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.979 
so give it a try it's a great fun
technique<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:24.209> let's<00:03:24.390> have<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.570> look<00:03:24.750> at<00:03:24.870> our

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
technique so let's have a look at our

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.680 
technique so let's have a look at our
three<00:03:25.380> final<00:03:25.829> photos<00:03:26.280> each<00:03:26.579> one<00:03:27.120> done<00:03:27.450> with<00:03:27.600> a

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
three final photos each one done with a

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.660 
three final photos each one done with a
different<00:03:28.049> technique<00:03:28.440> having<00:03:29.400> its<00:03:29.549> own

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
different technique having its own

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.780 
different technique having its own
unique<00:03:30.739> characteristics

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.150 

and<00:03:34.840> this<00:03:35.840> type<00:03:36.110> of<00:03:36.140> lighting<00:03:36.530> allows<00:03:36.860> you<00:03:37.040> to

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
and this type of lighting allows you to

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.699 
and this type of lighting allows you to
try<00:03:37.340> many<00:03:37.400> many<00:03:37.730> different<00:03:38.239> things<00:03:38.709> with
