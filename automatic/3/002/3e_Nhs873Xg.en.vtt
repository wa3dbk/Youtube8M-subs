00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:07.530
 learn to reuse with us hello to 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.749
 now all you learn to reuse 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.169
 let's teach to give it a second life 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:15.240
 to a ball punctured or simply old 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:17.939
 in our case as you can see in the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.490
 image we have used a ball of 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.949
 basketball and we have transformed it into 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.730
 a flowerpot for plants 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.470
 let's see how to do it first of all 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.710
 we'll start with the material that we're going to 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.710
 use 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:37.550
 to start we need a ball to 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.580
 this video we advise to use a ball 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.470
 spherical for example football or 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.410
 basketball 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:48.810
 next we need a couple of 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.850
 strong ropes or cables 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:57.199
 we are also going to need some scissors 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.930
 land for crops and finally the 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:05.540
 plant or seeds that we want to plant 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:09.229
 let's start we cut the ball to one 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.710
 greater than another because it is because if 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.710
 Two parts are the same size once 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.950
 then put the land not 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.799
 we can catch the ball with the ropes 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.130
 for this reason for the moment we are going 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:29.539
 cutting in half and once we have 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:34.550
 cut one of the two parties we tried 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:38.810
 go up a little bit in order to cut the other 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:42.830
 and that it is bigger you see now we turn and 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:46.280
 we cut through here so we assure that a 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:51.580
 of the two parts will be larger than the 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:54.300
 another let's finish cutting this 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.300
 and a little more 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.180
 slope is worth little 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.140
 see here 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:15.190
 what damage to the test spheres 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.610
 to see if you can not as it happens to me 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:25.200
 so try to throw them little by little to go 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.200
 cutting in this case so it is already 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:37.750
 and oh and it 's worth 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:40.360
 and now 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.010
 once we have it cut as 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:48.340
 you can see here in this case as it has 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.850
 these that come out to put air let's go 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:56.140
 to see if we can remove it by power 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:59.140
 I can not see, I'm going to take them and what 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.100
 I could leave but I do not like it, we're going to 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.410
 remove bar is already good step by step 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.470
 we have this hole and now 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.400
 let's make the hole so be careful 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.200
 click with the scissors and now we are going to 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.760
 make the other hole in the other part 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.840
 to be able to pass the door to see 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.120
 carefully and you're already trying to do 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:29.220
 a little bit bigger because it's small you see 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:32.489
 tiny one with care you are looking for it and 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.390
 so the hole goes bigger 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.390
 a little more 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.520
 I will open like this 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.770
 we are more 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.760
 a little more as I think you're already seeing 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.610
 plus 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.599
 the little one has yet to pass the 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.150
 cable or the door now it seems that if 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:04:00.989
 once we have this we take the cable in 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:04.200
 our case rope and carefully what 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.560
 we are going through it is like this until 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.080
 we have passed 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.420
 we try to be focused for that 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.050
 we pull the two ends until 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.680
 have the same length 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.709
 and we are going to make a knot and the strongest thing 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.709
 possible 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:28.260
 We make another knot to secure it 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:31.740
 strong as you are seeing I suppose 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:36.700
 we tighten we look that it is very strong 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:39.150
 so it's worth to see look gives us to do 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.150
 another let's make another knot more 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.150
 perfect 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:51.240
 Now it's okay, this is already 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:54.789
 it has been good has not been stable 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.229
 more now let's do the same with the 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.889
 another band 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:04.050
 we take the door again 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:05.340
 we had a look if it was easier and 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.830
 the same 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.879
 we take the two extremes we look that 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.879
 have the same length 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.630
 we tied it first once there was another 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:24.330
 we press it to be very strong 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:26.970
 is stronger and we make another squeeze with 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.880
 this I think we're already looking at 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:33.570
 more or less equal it seems that yes 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.940
 perfect once we are already filling 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.030
 the pot as you see we have already filled 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.790
 a little to save time and 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:45.510
 we just throw the last earth that 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:48.540
 we have the moss spread throughout 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.300
 and across the entire ball like that with 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:54.620
 careful and let's take the plants 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.620
 after looking good 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.749
 we take the plants in our case 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.599
 we have taken these because they grow 

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:05.330
 pretty fast and carefully we're going 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:08.419
 planting these are easy to plant 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:11.360
 you just have to nail in the 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:16.310
 land and you're done 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:19.820
 and good if you have seeds the plants 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:22.880
 following those that put the recipe 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:25.720
 because there are some that are different if 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.420
 they are plants you make a hole and the vais 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.310
 planting 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.490
 I even think this is the last one to see 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:36.430
 If it's worth now we take water to water a 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.530
 little careful with the water echad 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.410
 little because remember that it is a 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:44.440
 closed container and everything you throw 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:47.050
 will stay there you throw too much you can 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.140
 choke the plants and finish 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:53.020
 leaving we throw a little bit so that 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:55.930
 moisten the earth and nail the 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.510
 plants so they do not come out and ccoo bread 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:01.530
 root more easily we put them that 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:05.410
 we look that everything is fine it seems that yes 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.639
 ok to see this and we throw a little bit of 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.819
 more rice 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:12.789
 and with this we will have finished everything 

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:15.219
 once we have finished we are going to 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:17.680
 hang it then you will see 

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:19.419
 images of how we have been left because 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.580
 we are going to put the whole procedure 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:24.520
 to hang it is cold depends on each 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:28.659
 person although we recommend hanging it 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:32.229
 in walls or trees as our case and 

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:34.960
