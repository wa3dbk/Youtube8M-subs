00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.089
 from the name one could think of delle 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.519
 bikes for newbies yes cv 500 here there lindt 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.150
 easy online easy docile only for 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.480
 newbies 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.100
 all lies yes because we got on 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.380
 saddle to the new food 500 rcb 500 f yes 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.810
 discovers a fantastic bike not only for 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.880
 ours but for everyone yes because how 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.949
 we got to try it also in 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.750
 performance track is true 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.619
 engine has no extreme cavalry 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.820
 we are talking about 35 kilowatts then 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.559
 also fall into powers for 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.719
 new licenses to last however 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.390
 very smooth very smooth dispensing 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.210
 and also lengthens well up to the 8,500 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.460
 laps available the rest then is 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.950
 typically easy cycling wave that 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.539
 helps but never fails 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.539
 especially when driving fast 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.190
 once in the street with the mini cd r 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.140
 immediately ends 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.300
 saddle low torso semi and right weight 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.009
 anorexic all with a great feeling 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.930
 control 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.509
 the new twin-cylinder engine is not sweet 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.369
 tears and does not stress but pushes well 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.920
 without hesitation even if the best 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.479
 it comes out at high speed doing it 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.970
 stand in the upper part of the tachometer 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.440
 so there is a brilliant answer that 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.330
 he doesn't regret that much 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.090
 cavalry and higher also in 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.979
 consideration of stand-by consumption 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.110
 cycling seems to be able to accommodate every 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.119
 type of guide from that pass to 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.080
 the sportier one without showing 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.090
 too the hip even when you overdo it 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.740
 [Music] 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.250
 it seems strange to wear the track suit 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.200
 on the cdr 500r but after all this will be 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.200
 the motorcycle of the bureau pil in junior cup 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.880
 so all in the normal course in the ring 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.950
 and the lack of real power is done 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.659
 feel but being an engine with that 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.390
 the high one still feels pleasure in 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.009
 take it up to the red zone 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.619
 good braking despite the single 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.880
 front disc and also the chassis 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.090
 despite the rather simple scheme 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.739
 always nepal and balanced only the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.539
 world when you overdo it with cash 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:07.729
 shows he does not like the treatment 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.090
 enter fork always sends a big one 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.090
 ends 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.140
 very large and in performance e 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.300
 in the use therefore the cbr 500r but not 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.510
 in the price that remains a motorcycle for 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.739
 small because they console 6,200 euros there 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:29.430
 you can take it home after driving 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.260
 r we got on the saddle of the effe 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.540
 I really liked it 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.660
 especially in the street like and more than 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.760
 sister r yes because the high handlebars le 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.090
 allows you to be more agile even in the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.650
 fast direction changes and it's true loses 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.959
 a bit of stability maybe at the highest 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.150
 speed but everything is compensated by one 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.090
 more comfortable driving even easier 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.610
 of the already very easy in general more 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.069
 just more agile and agile among the 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.280
 wheels above all and it also costs a lot 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.640
 little less if we are on the 5,500 euros with abs 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.640
 standard
