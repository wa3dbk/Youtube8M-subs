 the galeras I heard here I 'm here to teach 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.240
 to you a new conflict 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.299
 the position of the feet is more or less so 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.640
 the pack brings you back a bit behind 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.880
 screws with tip 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:27.330
 so and the back foot and boot also suit me 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:30.420
 to the point of clashing the distance and race the foot of 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.590
 behind the diagonal to here for him to be able 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.030
 to spin 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.520

 with 11 and operates a little further back 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.260
 to be able to get easier the flip 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.399
 Nor can I buy nor is 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.230
 down attaches to the front and then goes 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.020
 perfecting the shepherd 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.750
 how much more do you hit hard and a cut 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.870
 getting right down here but instead of 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.870
 You can not leave, you can not shave. 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:09.659
 easy and paste you have to do already in 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:13.640
 low and do not change to accept in the bases 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.640
