you can see we've got two sets of points
in<00:01:05.309> here<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> older<00:01:07.350> model<00:01:08.390> the

this the gaskets on these I made out of

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.980 
this the gaskets on these I made out of
lead<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:26.090> they<00:01:27.090> get<00:01:27.240> out<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.509> shape<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.930> just

lead so they get out of shape you just

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.560 
lead so they get out of shape you just
bend<00:01:28.409> them<00:01:28.560> back<00:01:28.590> into<00:01:28.979> shape<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.549> you're<00:01:30.390> off

covers<00:03:00.370> here<00:03:00.670> so<00:03:00.880> you<00:03:01.000> can<00:03:01.209> get<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.420> better<00:03:01.630> look

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
covers here so you can get a better look

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.050 
covers here so you can get a better look
at<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:03.000> pull<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.180> off<00:03:05.550> see<00:03:06.550> we're<00:03:06.700> missing<00:03:07.030> a

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
at it pull that off see we're missing a

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.210 
at it pull that off see we're missing a
couple<00:03:07.180> of<00:03:07.540> rocker<00:03:07.750> I'm<00:03:08.080> just<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.560> parts<00:03:08.920> motor

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
couple of rocker I'm just a parts motor

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.130 
couple of rocker I'm just a parts motor
here<00:03:09.580> that's<00:03:09.970> our<00:03:10.180> running<00:03:10.540> engine<00:03:10.870> over

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
here that's our running engine over

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.810 
here that's our running engine over
there<00:03:11.640> as<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.730> can<00:03:12.880> see<00:03:13.120> even<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:14.820> retainers

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
there as you can see even the retainers

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.190 
there as you can see even the retainers
have<00:03:16.330> been<00:03:16.630> drilled<00:03:18.150> for<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.180> lighted<00:03:19.630> for

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
have been drilled for a lighted for

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.110 
have been drilled for a lighted for
light<00:03:22.200> reduction<00:03:23.200> of<00:03:23.350> weight

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.290 

and<00:03:27.300> some<00:03:28.050> of<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.230> other<00:03:28.410> features<00:03:29.280> which<00:03:29.970> you

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
and some of the other features which you

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.650 
and some of the other features which you
will<00:03:30.420> find<00:03:30.690> that<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.930> military<00:03:31.170> engine<00:03:31.739> is<00:03:32.660> the

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
will find that a military engine is the

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.260 
will find that a military engine is the
hot<00:03:33.840> lash<00:03:34.670> specifications<00:03:35.670> for<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:35.970> intake

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
hot lash specifications for the intake

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.120 
hot lash specifications for the intake
and<00:03:36.330> exhaust<00:03:36.540> stamped<00:03:37.470> into<00:03:37.650> each<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:37.980> every

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
and exhaust stamped into each and every

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.910 
and exhaust stamped into each and every
valve<00:03:38.520> cover

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.860 

also<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:44.790> could<00:03:45.000> see<00:03:45.210> it<00:03:45.300> here<00:03:45.480> this<00:03:45.630> one's

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
also you could see it here this one's

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.809 
also you could see it here this one's
been<00:03:46.080> rebuilt<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:46.770> it's<00:03:46.920> painted<00:03:47.310> over<00:03:47.580> it's<00:03:47.730> a

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
been rebuilt so it's painted over it's a

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.730 
been rebuilt so it's painted over it's a
little<00:03:48.060> bit<00:03:48.150> harder<00:03:48.450> to<00:03:48.569> read<00:03:48.810> but<00:03:49.110> I<00:03:49.319> assure

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
little bit harder to read but I assure

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
little bit harder to read but I assure
you<00:03:49.770> it's<00:03:50.130> there<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:52.250> other<00:03:53.250> notable

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
you it's there and other notable

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.630 
you it's there and other notable
features<00:03:54.290> we<00:03:55.290> have<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:57.860> throttle<00:03:58.860> selector

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
features we have a throttle selector

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.110 
features we have a throttle selector
which<00:04:00.620> allows<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:01.830> to<00:04:01.860> pull<00:04:02.550> the<00:04:02.670> engine<00:04:02.940> down

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
which allows you to pull the engine down

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.140 
which allows you to pull the engine down
into<00:04:03.510> an<00:04:03.660> idle<00:04:04.050> you<00:04:04.320> can<00:04:04.500> see<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.770> stamped<00:04:05.490> may

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
into an idle you can see it stamped may

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.500 
into an idle you can see it stamped may
not<00:04:06.390> be<00:04:06.540> able<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.810> make<00:04:07.050> it<00:04:07.200> out<00:04:07.820> but<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:09.090> idle

so if you get a chance pick one up

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.050 
so if you get a chance pick one up
you'll<00:05:04.680> figure<00:05:05.010> out<00:05:05.160> something<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.760> do<00:05:05.910> with

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
you'll figure out something to do with
