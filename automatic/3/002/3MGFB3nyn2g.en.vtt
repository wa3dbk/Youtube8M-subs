that's vitamin A vitamin D vitamin E and
even<00:02:36.000> with<00:02:36.269> some<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.720> B<00:02:36.930> vitamins<00:02:36.959> like

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
even with some of the B vitamins like

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.369 
even with some of the B vitamins like
for<00:02:38.430> example<00:02:38.519> folic<00:02:39.299> acid<00:02:39.930> has<00:02:40.140> been

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
for example folic acid has been

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.680 
for example folic acid has been
correlated<00:02:40.799> with<00:02:41.280> increased<00:02:41.519> risk<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.390> some

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
correlated with increased risk of some

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.390 
correlated with increased risk of some
forms<00:02:43.109> of<00:02:43.230> cancer<00:02:43.650> such<00:02:43.829> as<00:02:43.890> breast<00:02:44.250> cancer

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
forms of cancer such as breast cancer

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.390 
forms of cancer such as breast cancer
and<00:02:45.060> colon<00:02:45.569> cancer<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.470> wouldn't<00:02:47.010> recommend

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
and colon cancer so I wouldn't recommend

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.539 
and colon cancer so I wouldn't recommend
using<00:02:48.319> multivitamins<00:02:49.319> because<00:02:49.799> they<00:02:50.040> can<00:02:50.310> be

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
using multivitamins because they can be

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.839 
using multivitamins because they can be
toxic<00:02:50.879> I<00:02:51.269> know<00:02:51.359> there<00:02:51.599> are<00:02:51.750> some<00:02:52.079> better

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849

just a quick point I advocate the use of
vitamin<00:04:12.180> b12<00:04:12.479> as<00:04:12.989> you<00:04:13.650> know<00:04:13.769> an<00:04:13.889> exception<00:04:14.579> to

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
the program because I don't want to tell

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.229 
the program because I don't want to tell

people to go eat foods off the ground or

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.180

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
like that because

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.270 
like that because
not<00:04:27.600> everybody<00:04:28.050> is<00:04:28.200> going<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.530> do<00:04:28.770> that<00:04:28.920> and<00:04:29.190> if

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
not everybody is going to do that and if

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.400 
not everybody is going to do that and if
people<00:04:29.550> do<00:04:29.850> do<00:04:30.030> that<00:04:30.210> they<00:04:30.510> risk<00:04:30.750> consuming

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
people do do that they risk consuming

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.680 
people do do that they risk consuming
things<00:04:31.680> from<00:04:32.010> contaminated<00:04:32.820> sources<00:04:33.390> and

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
things from contaminated sources and

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.810 
things from contaminated sources and
then<00:04:33.900> there's<00:04:34.080> also<00:04:34.260> the<00:04:34.500> reliability<00:04:35.400> is<00:04:35.430> it

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
then there's also the reliability is it

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.640 
then there's also the reliability is it
a<00:04:35.850> reliable<00:04:36.480> source<00:04:36.750> and<00:04:37.080> all<00:04:37.170> that<00:04:37.350> so<00:04:37.560> I<00:04:37.590> just

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
a reliable source and all that so I just

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.340 
a reliable source and all that so I just
say<00:04:37.950> you<00:04:38.370> know<00:04:38.490> for<00:04:38.670> the<00:04:38.760> population<00:04:39.600> they're

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
say you know for the population they're

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.980 
say you know for the population they're
much<00:04:40.620> better<00:04:40.860> off<00:04:41.160> just<00:04:41.460> consuming<00:04:42.300> the

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
much better off just consuming the

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.650 
much better off just consuming the
traces<00:04:43.680> of<00:04:43.890> the<00:04:44.280> vitamin<00:04:44.700> b-12<00:04:45.300> that<00:04:45.510> they

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
traces of the vitamin b-12 that they

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.080 
traces of the vitamin b-12 that they
need<00:04:45.840> from<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.170> supplement<00:04:46.770> Americans<00:04:47.610> consume

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
need from a supplement Americans consume

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.650 
need from a supplement Americans consume
1<00:04:48.510> million<00:04:49.170> times<00:04:49.620> more<00:04:50.130> of<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.730> vitamin<00:04:51.180> b12

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
1 million times more of the vitamin b12

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.650 
1 million times more of the vitamin b12
requirement<00:04:52.350> in<00:04:52.530> sodium<00:04:53.370> all<00:04:54.090> right<00:04:54.270> so<00:04:54.570> you

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
requirement in sodium all right so you

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.260 
requirement in sodium all right so you
barely<00:04:55.440> need<00:04:55.770> any<00:04:55.980> vitamin<00:04:56.430> b12<00:04:56.850> that's<00:04:57.120> why<00:04:57.240> I

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
barely need any vitamin b12 that's why I

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.270 
barely need any vitamin b12 that's why I
say<00:04:57.450> just<00:04:57.690> go<00:04:57.870> with<00:04:58.020> a<00:04:58.050> supplement<00:04:58.590> you<00:04:58.830> know

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
say just go with a supplement you know

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.210 
say just go with a supplement you know
save<00:04:59.730> save<00:05:00.210> yourself<00:05:00.630> from<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:01.470> having<00:05:02.070> the
