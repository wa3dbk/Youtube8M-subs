00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.060 
lot of notes on my fishing to see these
trends<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.790> when<00:01:39.450> fish<00:01:39.810> bite<00:01:40.140> what<00:01:40.950> I've

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
trends in when fish bite what I've

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.370 
trends in when fish bite what I've
learned<00:01:41.369> from<00:01:41.490> my<00:01:41.640> own<00:01:41.810> experience<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.049> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
learned from my own experience is that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.480 
learned from my own experience is that
the<00:01:43.680> big<00:01:43.979> fish<00:01:44.399> tend<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.570> feed<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.490> three-day

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the big fish tend to feed on a three-day

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.170 
the big fish tend to feed on a three-day
cycle<00:01:48.180> if<00:01:48.390> nothing<00:01:48.960> interferes<00:01:49.649> with<00:01:49.920> them<00:01:50.180> so

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
cycle if nothing interferes with them so

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.789 
cycle if nothing interferes with them so
if<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.360> want<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.630> get<00:01:51.780> serious<00:01:52.049> if<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.470> really

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
if you want to get serious if you really

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.440 
if you want to get serious if you really
want<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.040> go<00:01:53.100> out<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.310> find<00:01:53.460> big<00:01:53.700> fish<00:01:53.970> you

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
want to go out and find big fish you

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.330 
want to go out and find big fish you
should<00:01:54.659> typically<00:01:55.049> take<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> three-day<00:01:55.950> window

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
should typically take a three-day window

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.950 
should typically take a three-day window
be<00:01:56.520> prepared<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.969> fish<00:01:57.149> three<00:01:57.450> nights<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.869> a

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
be prepared to fish three nights in a

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.600 
be prepared to fish three nights in a
row<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.380> you're<00:01:58.799> going<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.040> encounter<00:01:59.340> those

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
row and you're going to encounter those

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.209 
row and you're going to encounter those
bigger<00:01:59.880> bites<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:01.079> if<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.590> guys<00:02:01.770> want<00:02:02.040> to

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
bigger bites but if you guys want to

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.060 
bigger bites but if you guys want to
target<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.880> biggest<00:02:03.420> fish<00:02:03.750> again<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.770> don't

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
target the biggest fish again I don't

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.980 
target the biggest fish again I don't
know<00:02:05.159> why<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:06.180> you're<00:02:06.299> going<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.540> fish<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
know why but you're going to fish the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.410 
know why but you're going to fish the
three<00:02:07.350> days<00:02:07.560> before<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.700> after<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.209> new<00:02:09.390> moon

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
three days before and after the new moon

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.500 
three days before and after the new moon
and<00:02:09.840> before<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.830> after<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
and before and after the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.479 
and before and after the
moon<00:02:11.750> so<00:02:12.349> the<00:02:12.500> new<00:02:12.620> moons<00:02:12.920> coming<00:02:13.189> up<00:02:13.280> July

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
moon so the new moons coming up July

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.179 
moon so the new moons coming up July
first<00:02:14.060> they're<00:02:14.930> gonna<00:02:14.989> fish<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.530> last<00:02:15.769> three

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:16.189 
first they're gonna fish the last three

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.550 
first they're gonna fish the last three
days<00:02:16.340> of<00:02:16.400> June<00:02:16.819> through<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.659> first<00:02:18.019> three

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
days of June through the first three

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.869 
days of June through the first three
days<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:19.280> July<00:02:19.819> that<00:02:20.540> six<00:02:21.110> day<00:02:21.470> window<00:02:22.069> around

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
days of July that six day window around

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.119 
days of July that six day window around
that<00:02:23.239> new<00:02:23.480> moon<00:02:23.780> is<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.409> phenomenal

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
that new moon is a phenomenal

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.000 
that new moon is a phenomenal
opportunity<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.970> get<00:02:26.180> those<00:02:26.420> big<00:02:26.750> bites<00:02:27.079> same

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
opportunity to get those big bites same

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.039 
opportunity to get those big bites same
thing<00:02:28.280> with<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.579> full<00:02:28.879> moon<00:02:29.090> full<00:02:29.659> moons<00:02:29.900> on

thing with the full moon full moons on

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.740 
thing with the full moon full moons on
the<00:02:30.200> 15th<00:02:30.739> so<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:31.670> could<00:02:31.970> fish<00:02:32.150> anywhere<00:02:32.599> from

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
the 15th so you could fish anywhere from

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.550 
the 15th so you could fish anywhere from
the<00:02:32.930> 12th<00:02:33.500> to<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.280> 18th<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:35.390> have<00:02:35.959> a<00:02:36.019> shot<00:02:36.379> if

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
the 12th to the 18th and have a shot if

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.860 
the 12th to the 18th and have a shot if
you<00:02:36.590> fish<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:36.950> three<00:02:37.310> day<00:02:37.489> window<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:38.090> getting

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
you fish a three day window of getting

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.509 
you fish a three day window of getting
involved<00:02:39.140> with<00:02:39.440> some<00:02:39.620> really<00:02:40.040> really<00:02:40.190> big

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
involved with some really really big

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.240 
involved with some really really big
fish<00:02:40.849> now<00:02:41.840> again<00:02:42.170> that's<00:02:42.500> not<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.950> guarantee

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
fish now again that's not a guarantee

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.119 
fish now again that's not a guarantee
but<00:02:44.209> those<00:02:44.359> are<00:02:44.540> your<00:02:44.720> best<00:02:45.049> days<00:02:45.470> out<00:02:45.829> of<00:02:46.069> the

entire month to fish those twelve days

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.750 
entire month to fish those twelve days
will<00:02:49.879> be<00:02:50.030> better<00:02:50.180> than<00:02:50.450> all<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.139> other<00:02:51.319> days

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
will be better than all the other days

that much more they know that so they

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.360 
that much more they know that so they
