00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570 

hey<00:00:00.719> guys<00:00:00.960> how's<00:00:01.230> it<00:00:01.260> going<00:00:01.530> today<00:00:02.159> I<00:00:02.310> thought

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hey guys how's it going today I thought

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.340 
hey guys how's it going today I thought
I<00:00:02.639> would<00:00:02.760> do<00:00:03.000> a<00:00:03.030> quick<00:00:03.300> little<00:00:03.600> test<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:04.140> the

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
I would do a quick little test of the

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.499 
I would do a quick little test of the
devotion<00:00:04.980> threshold<00:00:05.490> ability<00:00:05.819> that<00:00:06.180> you<00:00:06.240> get

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
devotion threshold ability that you get

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.680 
devotion threshold ability that you get
from<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.960> world<00:00:07.410> event<00:00:08.090> it's<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.269> second

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
from the world event it's the second

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.740 
from the world event it's the second
ability<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.139> can<00:00:10.349> buy<00:00:10.530> so<00:00:10.860> far<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.750> what

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
ability that you can buy so far and what

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.279 
ability that you can buy so far and what
it<00:00:12.900> does<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.710> makes<00:00:14.839> your<00:00:15.839> protection

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
it does is it makes your protection

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.109 
it does is it makes your protection
priors<00:00:16.710> one<00:00:16.890> hundred<00:00:17.130> percent<00:00:17.160> effective<00:00:17.609> for

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
priors one hundred percent effective for

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.840 
priors one hundred percent effective for
20<00:00:18.720> seconds<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:20.189> basically<00:00:20.310> makes<00:00:20.670> your

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
20 seconds so it basically makes your

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.070 
20 seconds so it basically makes your
priors<00:00:21.060> like<00:00:21.359> what<00:00:21.510> they<00:00:21.630> used<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.810> be<00:00:21.869> before

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
priors like what they used to be before

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.580 
priors like what they used to be before
the<00:00:22.320> EOC<00:00:22.619> was<00:00:22.769> released<00:00:23.039> because<00:00:24.590> obviously

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the EOC was released because obviously

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.160 
the EOC was released because obviously
it<00:00:26.099> doesn't<00:00:26.390> really<00:00:27.390> protect<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.900> from

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
it doesn't really protect you from

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.349 
it doesn't really protect you from
whenever<00:00:28.830> you're<00:00:28.920> getting<00:00:29.160> hit<00:00:29.279> by<00:00:29.310> now<00:00:29.550> so

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
whenever you're getting hit by now so

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.450 
whenever you're getting hit by now so
I'm<00:00:30.779> just<00:00:31.260> going<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.470> kill<00:00:31.769> some<00:00:31.920> glass<00:00:32.130> orders

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
I'm just going to kill some glass orders

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.340 
I'm just going to kill some glass orders
because<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.630> only<00:00:33.719> place<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.200> could

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
because it's the only place that I could

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.170 
because it's the only place that I could
really<00:00:34.530> think<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.010> could<00:00:35.219> test<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
really think of that I could test the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.910 
really think of that I could test the
might<00:00:36.329> by<00:00:36.450> myself<00:00:36.750> I'm<00:00:37.050> actually<00:00:37.290> used<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.770> yet

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
might by myself I'm actually used it yet

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.549 
might by myself I'm actually used it yet
because<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.719> haven't<00:00:39.989> been<00:00:40.110> doing<00:00:40.440> much

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
because I just haven't been doing much

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.229 
because I just haven't been doing much
pvm<00:00:41.010> recently<00:00:42.050> but<00:00:43.050> I'm<00:00:43.230> hoping<00:00:43.530> one<00:00:43.739> my<00:00:43.860> did

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
pvm recently but I'm hoping one my did

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.529 
pvm recently but I'm hoping one my did
hoping<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.390> should<00:00:45.960> work<00:00:45.989> out<00:00:46.379> all<00:00:46.590> right<00:00:46.620> I

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
hoping this should work out all right I

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.790 
hoping this should work out all right I
just<00:00:48.539> need<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.750> build<00:00:49.020> up<00:00:49.110> my<00:00:49.200> adrenaline<00:00:49.530> okay

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
just need to build up my adrenaline okay

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.459 
just need to build up my adrenaline okay
and<00:00:50.449> yeah<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.480> think<00:00:51.660> up<00:00:51.809> attack<00:00:52.020> from<00:00:52.110> LA

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
and yeah I think up attack from LA

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.139 
and yeah I think up attack from LA
because<00:00:53.660> it<00:00:54.660> kind<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.899> owned<00:00:55.370> but<00:00:56.370> um<00:00:56.550> yeah

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
because it kind of owned but um yeah

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.910 
because it kind of owned but um yeah
this<00:00:57.629> could<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:57.930> fairly<00:00:58.230> useful<00:00:58.469> for<00:00:58.829> like

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
this could be fairly useful for like

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.910 
this could be fairly useful for like
necks<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.460> stuff<00:00:59.670> out<00:00:59.850> imagine<00:01:00.210> because<00:01:00.920> next

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
necks and stuff out imagine because next

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.170 
necks and stuff out imagine because next
does<00:01:02.160> have<00:01:02.340> pretty<00:01:02.430> hard<00:01:02.670> with<00:01:02.760> our<00:01:02.879> magic

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
does have pretty hard with our magic

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.200 
does have pretty hard with our magic
attacks<00:01:03.449> sometimes<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.909> probably<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> new

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
attacks sometimes and probably the new

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.810 
attacks sometimes and probably the new
borrows<00:01:07.010> thing<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.250> released<00:01:08.430> awhile

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
borrows thing that was released awhile

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.450 
borrows thing that was released awhile
ago<00:01:09.060> haven't<00:01:09.479> actually<00:01:09.600> done<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.990> before<00:01:10.290> but

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
ago haven't actually done it before but

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.200 
ago haven't actually done it before but
imagine<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.580> would<00:01:11.670> be<00:01:11.729> fairly<00:01:12.000> useful

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
imagine it would be fairly useful

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.300 
imagine it would be fairly useful
because<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:13.110> get<00:01:13.229> hit<00:01:13.439> pretty<00:01:13.470> hard<00:01:13.920> doing

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
because you get hit pretty hard doing

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.160 
because you get hit pretty hard doing
that<00:01:15.439> but<00:01:16.439> yeah<00:01:17.659> these<00:01:18.659> are<00:01:18.720> actually<00:01:19.049> pretty

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
that but yeah these are actually pretty

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.510 
that but yeah these are actually pretty
easy<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.530> kill<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.799> didn't<00:01:19.950> realize<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.280> would

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
easy to kill I didn't realize this would

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.960 
easy to kill I didn't realize this would
be<00:01:20.670> quite<00:01:20.970> as<00:01:21.090> easy<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:21.360> their<00:01:21.509> um<00:01:22.759> yeah<00:01:23.759> that

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
be quite as easy as their um yeah that

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.410 
be quite as easy as their um yeah that
seemed<00:01:24.180> decent<00:01:24.420> enough<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:26.360> can't<00:01:27.360> really

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
seemed decent enough but I can't really

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.850 
seemed decent enough but I can't really
tell<00:01:27.630> because<00:01:27.840> these<00:01:28.320> don't<00:01:28.619> really

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
tell because these don't really

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.399 
tell because these don't really
particularly<00:01:29.610> hit<00:01:29.790> very<00:01:29.939> hard<00:01:30.170> but<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.320> get

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
particularly hit very hard but you get

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.649 
particularly hit very hard but you get
the<00:01:31.470> idea<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.130> um<00:01:32.369> I'm<00:01:32.970> sorry<00:01:33.030> for<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.420> lack<00:01:33.630> of

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
the idea so um I'm sorry for the lack of

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.670 
the idea so um I'm sorry for the lack of
videos<00:01:33.900> recently<00:01:34.820> pretty<00:01:35.820> much<00:01:35.970> been<00:01:36.680> like
