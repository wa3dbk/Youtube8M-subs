00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
do you see how I'm almost accentuating

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.340 
do you see how I'm almost accentuating
that<00:03:21.820> line<00:03:22.150> it's<00:03:22.390> almost<00:03:22.540> like<00:03:22.750> drawing<00:03:23.050> a

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
that line it's almost like drawing a

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.800 
that line it's almost like drawing a
line<00:03:23.650> with<00:03:23.890> a<00:03:23.920> pencil<00:03:24.280> I<00:03:24.790> was<00:03:25.450> going<00:03:25.600> to<00:03:25.660> tell

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
line with a pencil I was going to tell

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.150 
line with a pencil I was going to tell
you<00:03:25.870> guys<00:03:25.960> you<00:03:26.080> could<00:03:26.200> use<00:03:26.350> an<00:03:26.470> eyeliner<00:03:26.920> if

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
you guys you could use an eyeliner if

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.740 
you guys you could use an eyeliner if
you<00:03:27.190> want<00:03:27.520> to<00:03:27.640> try<00:03:27.820> that<00:03:27.970> earlier<00:03:28.390> but<00:03:28.570> it<00:03:28.660> was

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
you want to try that earlier but it was

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.210 
you want to try that earlier but it was
really<00:03:28.900> hard<00:03:29.140> to<00:03:29.290> blend<00:03:29.530> it<00:03:29.710> kind<00:03:29.890> of<00:03:29.950> sticks

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
really hard to blend it kind of sticks

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.040 
really hard to blend it kind of sticks
with<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.550> powder<00:03:30.790> so<00:03:31.540> it's<00:03:31.630> better<00:03:31.780> just<00:03:31.840> to

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
with that powder so it's better just to

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.110 
with that powder so it's better just to
