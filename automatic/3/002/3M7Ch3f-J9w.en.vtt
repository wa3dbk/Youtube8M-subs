and also your beaten egg all right so

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.550 
and also your beaten egg all right so
again<00:04:13.600> just<00:04:14.110> mix<00:04:14.890> that<00:04:15.010> together<00:04:16.320> okay<00:04:17.320> so<00:04:17.380> the

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
again just mix that together okay so the

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.630 
again just mix that together okay so the
majority<00:04:17.769> of<00:04:17.919> that<00:04:18.010> mixed<00:04:18.280> together<00:04:18.340> the

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
majority of that mixed together the

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.009 
majority of that mixed together the
butter<00:04:18.790> is<00:04:18.910> still<00:04:19.120> thick<00:04:19.419> but<00:04:19.690> what<00:04:19.780> you<00:04:19.870> do

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
butter is still thick but what you do

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.980 
butter is still thick but what you do
now<00:04:20.200> is<00:04:20.470> grab<00:04:20.799> your<00:04:21.190> other<00:04:21.669> powering<00:04:22.539> mixture

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
now is grab your other powering mixture

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.430 
now is grab your other powering mixture
and<00:04:23.650> just<00:04:23.800> pour<00:04:24.070> that<00:04:24.220> all<00:04:24.400> in<00:04:25.200> all<00:04:26.200> that<00:04:26.350> I'm

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
and just pour that all in all that I'm

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.810 
and just pour that all in all that I'm
stir<00:04:26.680> it<00:04:26.800> all<00:04:26.919> in<00:04:26.950> until<00:04:27.340> it<00:04:27.400> makes<00:04:27.550> a<00:04:27.669> nice

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
stir it all in until it makes a nice

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.640 
stir it all in until it makes a nice
thick<00:04:28.090> batter<00:04:28.330> so<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:28.900> butter<00:04:29.110> should<00:04:29.380> blend

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
thick batter so the butter should blend

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.770 
thick batter so the butter should blend
in<00:04:29.830> with<00:04:29.919> us<00:04:30.039> anyway<00:04:30.370> so<00:04:30.580> I'm<00:04:31.150> gonna<00:04:31.300> start<00:04:31.600> do

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780

that now so keep doing that until you
get<00:04:36.160> a<00:04:36.190> nice<00:04:36.310> batter<00:04:36.610> anyway<00:04:36.940> cool<00:04:37.539> okie<00:04:38.530> doke

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
get a nice batter anyway cool okie doke

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.750 
get a nice batter anyway cool okie doke
you<00:04:38.740> think<00:04:38.890> guys<00:04:39.010> this<00:04:39.220> is<00:04:39.340> where<00:04:39.490> we're<00:04:39.610> at

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
you think guys this is where we're at

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.400 
you think guys this is where we're at
I'm<00:04:40.360> just<00:04:40.510> got<00:04:40.600> the<00:04:40.690> apples<00:04:41.020> and<00:04:41.110> put<00:04:41.289> them

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
I'm just got the apples and put them

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.990 
I'm just got the apples and put them
into<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.650> lovely<00:04:42.010> formation<00:04:42.520> then<00:04:42.700> they<00:04:42.910> have

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
into a lovely formation then they have

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.100 
into a lovely formation then they have
some<00:04:43.150> proof<00:04:43.360> dish<00:04:43.570> I<00:04:43.690> hope<00:04:43.840> you'll<00:04:44.020> agree

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
some proof dish I hope you'll agree

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.690 
some proof dish I hope you'll agree
there<00:04:45.039> is<00:04:45.190> the<00:04:45.310> batter

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
there is the batter

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.040 
there is the batter
looking<00:04:46.030> all<00:04:46.120> funky<00:04:46.510> which<00:04:46.720> we're<00:04:46.870> going<00:04:46.990> to

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
looking all funky which we're going to

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.050 
looking all funky which we're going to
pour<00:04:47.260> over<00:04:47.289> there<00:04:47.590> in<00:04:47.770> a<00:04:47.830> minute<00:04:48.220> what<00:04:49.000> you

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
pour over there in a minute what you

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.600 
pour over there in a minute what you
need<00:04:49.180> is<00:04:49.210> to<00:04:49.419> get<00:04:49.690> 250<00:04:50.440> mils<00:04:50.650> of<00:04:50.860> water<00:04:51.100> on<00:04:51.430> to

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
need is to get 250 mils of water on to

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.460 
need is to get 250 mils of water on to
boil<00:04:51.820> we're<00:04:52.690> going<00:04:52.720> to<00:04:52.840> mix<00:04:53.020> that<00:04:53.140> in<00:04:53.229> with<00:04:53.320> a

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
boil we're going to mix that in with a

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.960 
boil we're going to mix that in with a
Xuan<00:04:53.770> I<00:04:53.860> mean<00:04:53.979> it<00:04:54.039> to<00:04:54.160> make<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.400> topping<00:04:54.610> it

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
Xuan I mean it to make the topping it

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.670 
Xuan I mean it to make the topping it
sounds<00:04:55.510> a<00:04:55.570> bit<00:04:55.660> odd<00:04:55.720> what<00:04:56.110> we're<00:04:56.200> gonna<00:04:56.289> do<00:04:56.470> but

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
sounds a bit odd what we're gonna do but

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.500 
sounds a bit odd what we're gonna do but

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
put your batter mix on top of the apples

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.400 
put your batter mix on top of the apples
all<00:05:00.250> right<00:05:00.630> okay<00:05:01.630> guys<00:05:01.750> workout<00:05:02.110> was<00:05:02.200> just

about to boil um but I've just put the
batter<00:05:05.410> mix<00:05:05.470> on<00:05:05.800> there<00:05:05.950> as<00:05:06.039> you<00:05:06.130> can<00:05:06.160> see

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
batter mix on there as you can see

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.680 
batter mix on there as you can see
there's<00:05:06.460> a<00:05:06.490> few<00:05:06.669> cheeky<00:05:07.030> apples<00:05:07.330> poppin<00:05:07.600> out

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
anyway so what you're gonna do now is

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.480 
anyway so what you're gonna do now is
get<00:05:11.050> your<00:05:11.169> brown<00:05:11.380> sugar

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
get your brown sugar

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.999 
get your brown sugar
in<00:05:12.789> a<00:05:12.910> jug<00:05:13.210> stir<00:05:13.720> it<00:05:13.840> together<00:05:13.990> with<00:05:14.889> the

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
in a jug stir it together with the

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.830 
in a jug stir it together with the
boiling<00:05:15.340> water<00:05:15.550> okay<00:05:16.030> so<00:05:16.060> we<00:05:16.419> got<00:05:16.600> to<00:05:16.690> do<00:05:16.750> this

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
boiling water okay so we got to do this

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.270 
boiling water okay so we got to do this
mix<00:05:17.110> that<00:05:17.259> in<00:05:17.440> and<00:05:17.560> then<00:05:17.710> we're<00:05:17.830> gonna<00:05:17.919> pour<00:05:18.190> it

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
mix that in and then we're gonna pour it

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.309 
mix that in and then we're gonna pour it
over<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.940> batter<00:05:19.360> mix<00:05:19.449> I<00:05:19.780> know<00:05:19.900> that<00:05:19.990> sounds

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 
over the batter mix I know that sounds

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:21.870 
over the batter mix I know that sounds
odd<00:05:20.410> but<00:05:20.470> that's<00:05:20.979> partly<00:05:21.310> that's<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.639> way<00:05:21.759> it

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
odd but that's partly that's the way it

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.089 
odd but that's partly that's the way it
goes<00:05:21.910> um<00:05:22.360> I<00:05:22.720> don't<00:05:22.930> really<00:05:23.110> know<00:05:23.229> but<00:05:23.590> there<00:05:24.039> we

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
goes um I don't really know but there we

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:25.529 
goes um I don't really know but there we
go<00:05:24.250> ah
