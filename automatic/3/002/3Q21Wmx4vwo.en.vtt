00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
I looked up this video and it was by a

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.470 
I looked up this video and it was by a
company<00:00:13.259> called<00:00:13.349> lace<00:00:14.160> anchors<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.910> don't<00:00:15.420> know

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
company called lace anchors I don't know

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.519 
company called lace anchors I don't know
if<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.599> heard<00:00:15.750> these<00:00:15.900> things<00:00:15.960> or<00:00:16.230> not<00:00:16.260> but

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
if you heard these things or not but

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.540 
if you heard these things or not but
they're<00:00:16.619> basically<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.039> little<00:00:17.220> pieces<00:00:17.369> of

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
they're basically the little pieces of

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.609 
they're basically the little pieces of
plastic<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:18.119> put<00:00:18.300> on<00:00:18.390> your<00:00:18.480> shoelaces<00:00:18.900> then

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
plastic you put on your shoelaces then

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.340 
plastic you put on your shoelaces then
make<00:00:19.770> them<00:00:19.890> easier<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.250> lace<00:00:20.990> probably<00:00:21.990> like

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
make them easier to lace probably like

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.189 
make them easier to lace probably like
just<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.740> they<00:00:22.859> stay<00:00:23.039> in<00:00:23.160> place<00:00:23.189> um

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
just so they stay in place um

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.410 
just so they stay in place um
problem<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.640> they're<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.939> dumbest<00:00:27.240> things

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
problem is they're the dumbest things

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.939 
problem is they're the dumbest things
ever<00:00:27.570> um<00:00:29.150> they're<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.330> not<00:00:30.449> worth<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.949> so

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
ever um they're just not worth it so

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.250 
ever um they're just not worth it so
basically<00:00:32.489> what<00:00:33.300> they're<00:00:33.510> gonna<00:00:33.750> tell<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.140> to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
basically what they're gonna tell you to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.920 
basically what they're gonna tell you to
do<00:00:34.430> when<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.550> lace<00:00:35.700> your<00:00:35.820> shoe<00:00:36.030> when<00:00:36.780> that

here now I'm not fully done with this

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.449 
here now I'm not fully done with this
yet<00:02:06.690> I<00:02:06.869> tried<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.710> just<00:02:07.860> do<00:02:07.950> what<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.130> did<00:02:08.190> before

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
yet I tried to just do what I did before

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.479 
yet I tried to just do what I did before
and<00:02:08.610> tie<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.850> knot<00:02:09.259> beat<00:02:10.259> but<00:02:10.619> uh<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.459> can

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
and tie a knot beat but uh as you can

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.059 
and tie a knot beat but uh as you can
see<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.760> didn't<00:02:11.940> really<00:02:12.030> work<00:02:12.380> so<00:02:13.380> I<00:02:13.830> just

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
see that didn't really work so I just

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.830 
see that didn't really work so I just
took<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.220> little<00:02:14.400> ahead<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:15.000> these<00:02:15.090> small

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
took a little ahead of these small

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.410 
took a little ahead of these small
little<00:02:16.170> rubber<00:02:16.350> bands<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.120> just<00:02:18.300> had

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
little rubber bands that I just had

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.270 
little rubber bands that I just had
laying<00:02:18.569> around<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:19.739> just<00:02:19.800> put<00:02:20.010> one<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.190> those

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
laying around so I just put one of those

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.880 
laying around so I just put one of those
on<00:02:20.489> there<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:21.720> can<00:02:21.840> see<00:02:21.959> doesn't<00:02:22.680> come

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
on there and you can see doesn't come

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.140 
on there and you can see doesn't come
through<00:02:23.100> but<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.400> kind<00:02:23.549> of<00:02:23.580> loosens<00:02:23.760> up<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
through but it kind of loosens up the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.699 
through but it kind of loosens up the
design<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.450> little<00:02:24.600> bit<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.530> I'm<00:02:25.590> probably

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
design a little bit so I'm probably

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.470 
design a little bit so I'm probably
gonna<00:02:25.920> end<00:02:26.040> up<00:02:26.190> either<00:02:26.459> trying<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.060> tie<00:02:27.209> I

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
gonna end up either trying to tie I

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.020 
gonna end up either trying to tie I
would<00:02:27.860> recommend<00:02:28.860> just<00:02:29.010> tying<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.280> knot<00:02:29.459> but<00:02:29.910> if

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
would recommend just tying a knot but if

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.130 
would recommend just tying a knot but if
that<00:02:30.150> doesn't<00:02:30.390> work<00:02:30.450> like<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.720> said<00:02:30.900> go<00:02:31.019> with

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
that doesn't work like I said go with

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.890 
that doesn't work like I said go with
the<00:02:31.230> rubber<00:02:31.380> band<00:02:31.620> but<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:33.150> know<00:02:33.269> probably

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
the rubber band but you know probably

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.050 
the rubber band but you know probably
for<00:02:34.170> another<00:02:34.350> rubber<00:02:34.560> band<00:02:34.680> even<00:02:35.579> even<00:02:35.880> just<00:02:36.000> a

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
for another rubber band even even just a

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.900 
for another rubber band even even just a
dab<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.540> glue<00:02:36.660> just<00:02:37.049> take<00:02:37.560> hot<00:02:37.769> glue<00:02:38.010> gun<00:02:38.190> and

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
dab of glue just take hot glue gun and

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.340 
dab of glue just take hot glue gun and
just<00:02:39.090> pull<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.570> your<00:02:39.600> desired<00:02:39.930> tightness

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
just pull it to your desired tightness

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.870 
just pull it to your desired tightness
and<00:02:40.470> just<00:02:40.650> put<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> dab<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.370> hot<00:02:41.459> glue<00:02:41.519> right

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
and just put a dab of hot glue right

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.210 
and just put a dab of hot glue right
there<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.690> don't<00:02:42.900> need<00:02:43.140> these<00:02:43.470> stupid<00:02:44.070> little
