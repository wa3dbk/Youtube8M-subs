this tutorial I'm going to demonstrate

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.039 
this tutorial I'm going to demonstrate
the<00:00:05.730> basic<00:00:06.060> concepts<00:00:06.450> are<00:00:06.569> playing<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.839> demo

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
the basic concepts are playing a demo

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.990 
the basic concepts are playing a demo
man<00:00:07.230> then<00:00:07.950> my<00:00:08.069> man<00:00:08.220> can<00:00:08.519> be<00:00:08.639> used<00:00:08.760> as<00:00:08.910> an

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
man then my man can be used as an

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.910 
man then my man can be used as an
offensive<00:00:09.269> glass<00:00:09.599> but<00:00:09.929> most<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.440> time<00:00:10.650> it

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
offensive glass but most of the time it

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.310 
offensive glass but most of the time it
is<00:00:11.280> an<00:00:11.580> extremely<00:00:12.030> effective<00:00:12.540> defense<00:00:12.990> class

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
is an extremely effective defense class

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
quite a lot the time the enemy will try

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.940 
quite a lot the time the enemy will try
to<00:00:45.270> trick<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.899> make<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.170> detonate<00:00:46.770> your

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
to trick you to make you detonate your

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.240 
to trick you to make you detonate your
pipes<00:00:47.899> so<00:00:48.899> they<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.260> then<00:00:49.379> get<00:00:49.559> onto<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.950> move

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
pipes so they can then get onto the move

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.180 
pipes so they can then get onto the move
on<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> flag<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.559> you<00:00:52.559> really<00:00:52.739> need<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.100> be

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
on to the flag and you really need to be

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.020 
on to the flag and you really need to be
patient<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.520> wait<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.910> opportune

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
patient and wait for the opportune

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.930 
patient and wait for the opportune
moment<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.809> detonate<00:00:55.500> your<00:00:56.129> pipes<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
moment to detonate your pipes and the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.450 
moment to detonate your pipes and the
third<00:00:57.360> thing<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.320> really<00:00:58.680> need<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.070> you

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
third thing that you really need is you

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.520 
third thing that you really need is you
need<00:00:59.489> to<00:01:00.090> pay<00:01:00.239> attention<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.780> sound<00:01:01.050> sounds

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
need to pay attention to sound sounds

need to pay attention to sound sounds
planning<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.070> massive<00:01:02.489> role<00:01:02.879> when<00:01:03.059> you're

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
planning a massive role when you're

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.119 
planning a massive role when you're
playing<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.510> demo<00:01:03.719> man<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.799> hear<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
playing a demo man if you can hear the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.250 
playing a demo man if you can hear the
click<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.580> grenade<00:01:05.909> makes<00:01:06.240> especially<00:01:07.170> if

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
click that grenade makes especially if

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.870 
click that grenade makes especially if
it's<00:01:07.380> coming<00:01:07.500> from<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.799> scout<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.670> coming

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
it's coming from a scout if it's coming

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.399 
it's coming from a scout if it's coming
from<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.090> scout<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.540> know<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.020> Scout<00:01:10.260> is

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
from a scout you know that that Scout is

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.750 
from a scout you know that that Scout is
going<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.619> perform<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.979> concussion<00:01:11.430> jump<00:01:11.640> he's

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
going to perform a concussion jump he's

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.789 
going to perform a concussion jump he's
not<00:01:11.909> going<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.060> throw<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.390> at<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.630> well<00:01:13.350> it's

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
not going to throw it at you well it's

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.810 
not going to throw it at you well it's
very<00:01:14.070> unlikely<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.610> he<00:01:14.850> will<00:01:14.970> throw<00:01:15.270> at<00:01:15.450> you

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
very unlikely that he will throw at you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.520 
very unlikely that he will throw at you
it's<00:01:17.820> more<00:01:18.000> than<00:01:18.060> likely<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.750> he's<00:01:19.320> going<00:01:19.470> to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
it's more than likely that he's going to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.990 
it's more than likely that he's going to
try<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.799> con<00:01:20.070> con<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> flag<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.850> cong

try and con con to the flag and cong
straight<00:01:21.330> past<00:01:21.570> your<00:01:21.750> pipes<00:01:21.990> if<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.740> know<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
straight past your pipes if you know the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.740 
straight past your pipes if you know the
timing<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.610> grenade<00:01:23.880> obviously<00:01:24.390> screen

timing of a grenade obviously screen
beeps<00:01:24.990> if<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.409> hear<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.009> grenade<00:01:26.220> click

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
beeps if you hear that grenade click

count in your head those three beeps and

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.130 
count in your head those three beeps and
then<00:01:29.250> you'll<00:01:30.090> know<00:01:30.270> when<00:01:30.780> they're<00:01:30.960> going<00:01:31.049> to

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
then you'll know when they're going to

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.300 
then you'll know when they're going to
make<00:01:31.290> their<00:01:31.500> move<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.070> anticipate

make their move and you can anticipate

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.380 
make their move and you can anticipate
it<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.759> advance<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.329> detonated<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.079> i<00:01:35.390> gave

it in advance and detonated then i gave

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.539 
it in advance and detonated then i gave
the<00:01:36.570> blue<00:01:36.750> pipes<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.500> Demoman<00:01:37.890> they're

the blue pipes of the Demoman they're
really<00:01:38.880> useful<00:01:39.210> for<00:01:39.390> covering<00:01:39.689> spam<00:01:39.930> like

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
really useful for covering spam like

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.819 
really useful for covering spam like
covering<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.619> position<00:01:41.009> such<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:42.829> they

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
covering a position such as that they

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.969 
covering a position such as that they
are<00:01:43.890> also<00:01:44.040> used<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.610> make<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.939> enemy<00:01:45.060> rush<00:01:45.509> if

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
are also used to make the enemy rush if

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.109 
are also used to make the enemy rush if
you've<00:01:46.979> got<00:01:47.220> blue<00:01:47.430> pipes<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:47.850> you're<00:01:47.970> playing

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
you've got blue pipes if you're playing

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.520 
you've got blue pipes if you're playing
scout<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.659> have<00:01:48.810> blue<00:01:48.990> pipes<00:01:49.259> being

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
scout and you have blue pipes being

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.840 
scout and you have blue pipes being
fired<00:01:49.740> at<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:49.979> don't<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.490> much<00:01:50.640> time

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
fired at you don't have much time

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.370 
fired at you don't have much time
eventually<00:01:51.210> one<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.689> them<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:51.990> going<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.200> hit

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
eventually one of them is going to hit

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.830 
eventually one of them is going to hit
you<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.549> you're<00:01:53.850> rushing<00:01:54.210> your<00:01:54.360> opponent<00:01:54.750> into

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
making that move on to your pipe trap um

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.789 
making that move on to your pipe trap um
you<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.909> at<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.540> moment<00:02:00.899> I'm<00:02:01.469> just

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
you can in at the moment I'm just

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.670 
you can in at the moment I'm just
playing<00:02:01.979> against<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> Scout<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:03.869> medic<00:02:04.469> would

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
playing against the Scout a medic would

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.170 
playing against the Scout a medic would
be<00:02:04.829> death<00:02:05.040> matching<00:02:05.399> me<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> lot<00:02:05.729> more<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.090> then

where<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.890> just<00:02:11.129> about<00:02:11.700> see<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.120> flag

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
where you can just about see the flag

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.980 
where you can just about see the flag
and<00:02:12.540> hope<00:02:12.660> the

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
and hope the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
can see his move okay but yeah there's a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.570 
can see his move okay but yeah there's a
few<00:02:18.150> examples<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.750> see<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:18.930> dismissed<00:02:19.470> um<00:02:19.740> my

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
few examples you see I dismissed um my

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.250 
few examples you see I dismissed um my
detonate<00:02:21.000> there<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.360> instantly<00:02:21.810> placed<00:02:22.110> a

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
detonate there and instantly placed a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.370 
detonate there and instantly placed a
new<00:02:22.380> pipe<00:02:22.620> trap<00:02:22.800> on<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.010> flag<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:24.270> only<00:02:25.140> needed

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
new pipe trap on the flag I only needed

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.840 
new pipe trap on the flag I only needed
a<00:02:25.590> couple<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.950> pipes<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.310> kill<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.490> scout<00:02:26.820> the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
a couple of pipes to kill a scout the

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.170 
a couple of pipes to kill a scout the
rest<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.390> pipes<00:02:27.630> are<00:02:27.930> there<00:02:28.380> just<00:02:28.590> um<00:02:29.280> they

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
rest of the pipes are there just um they

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.540 
rest of the pipes are there just um they
provide<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> bigger<00:02:31.020> blast<00:02:31.560> area<00:02:32.010> see<00:02:32.430> the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
provide a bigger blast area see the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.940 
provide a bigger blast area see the
pipes<00:02:32.760> will<00:02:33.030> spread<00:02:33.300> out<00:02:33.480> nicely<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:34.740> means

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
pipes will spread out nicely that means

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.410 
pipes will spread out nicely that means
that<00:02:35.220> he<00:02:35.340> doesn't<00:02:35.520> have<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.850> actually<00:02:36.150> be

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
that he doesn't have to actually be

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.480 
that he doesn't have to actually be
anywhere<00:02:36.750> near<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.990> flag<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.650> gives<00:02:37.800> me<00:02:37.980> it

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
anywhere near the flag it gives me it

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.280 
anywhere near the flag it gives me it
means<00:02:38.760> i<00:02:38.940> have<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.150> use<00:02:39.360> less<00:02:39.600> reaction<00:02:40.110> time

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
means i have to use less reaction time

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.960 
means i have to use less reaction time
to<00:02:40.470> let<00:02:40.650> me<00:02:40.860> in<00:02:42.050> um<00:02:43.050> okay<00:02:44.010> just<00:02:44.430> run<00:02:44.580> our<00:02:44.700> pipes

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
to let me in um okay just run our pipes

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.060 
to let me in um okay just run our pipes
there<00:02:46.190> yeah<00:02:47.190> but<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.700> demo<00:02:48.660> man<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.110> pretty<00:02:49.920> much

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
there yeah but a demo man is pretty much

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.430 
there yeah but a demo man is pretty much
the<00:02:50.130> last<00:02:50.370> class<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.240> last<00:02:51.330> line<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:51.870> defense

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
the last class the last line of defense

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.730 
the last class the last line of defense
that<00:02:52.590> they<00:02:52.800> will<00:02:52.920> have<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.070> go<00:02:53.280> through<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:54.740> yes

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
that they will have to go through so yes

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.920 
that they will have to go through so yes
it<00:02:56.160> is<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.550> is<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.760> very<00:02:57.120> very<00:02:57.390> very<00:02:57.540> good

it is it is a very very very good

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.570 
it is it is a very very very good
defensive<00:02:58.410> class<00:02:58.620> I'm<00:02:59.130> just<00:02:59.340> there<00:02:59.550> for

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
defensive class I'm just there for

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.900 
defensive class I'm just there for
example<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.240> didn't<00:03:00.510> see<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:00.750> scalp<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:02.400> just

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
example I didn't see that scalp I just

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.750 
example I didn't see that scalp I just
heard<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.330> concussion<00:03:03.870> grenade<00:03:04.080> went<00:03:04.230> boom

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
hear that it was close to me so I could

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.150 
hear that it was close to me so I could
