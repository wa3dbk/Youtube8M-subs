00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.479 
I've talked about or Damona doctrine how
you<00:00:51.660> know<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.050> breaks<00:00:52.230> cliches<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.309> this

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.900 
you know it breaks cliches but this
episode<00:00:53.969> was<00:00:54.210> just<00:00:54.710> very<00:00:55.710> different<00:00:56.370> compared

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
episode was just very different compared

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.349 
episode was just very different compared
to<00:00:57.090> normal<00:00:57.449> episodes<00:00:58.199> like<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.590> was<00:00:59.090> way<00:01:00.090> out

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
to normal episodes like this was way out

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.000 
to normal episodes like this was way out
there<00:01:00.390> compared<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.140> what<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.440> normally<00:01:01.620> get

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
there compared to what we normally get

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.640 
there compared to what we normally get
because<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:03.059> was<00:01:03.300> like<00:01:03.449> fresh<00:01:03.960> air<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.409> was<00:01:04.619> a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
because this was like fresh air it was a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.679

episode I don't normally see because

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.590 
episode I don't normally see because
this<00:01:31.680> was<00:01:31.920> definitely<00:01:32.400> out<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:33.060> all<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
this was definitely out of all the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.480 
this was definitely out of all the
episodes<00:01:33.720> I've<00:01:34.200> seen<00:01:34.439> with<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.070> cliches<00:01:35.460> like

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
episodes I've seen with the cliches like

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.399 
episodes I've seen with the cliches like
the<00:01:35.820> uncleshe<00:01:36.210> stuff<00:01:36.659> about<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.020> how<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> gets

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
the uncleshe stuff about it how it gets

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.780 
the uncleshe stuff about it how it gets
broken<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.860> think<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.430> one<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> most

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
broken I think this is one of the most

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.460 
broken I think this is one of the most
shocking<00:01:38.880> episodes<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.140> way<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.380> was

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
shocking episodes just the way it was

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.590 
shocking episodes just the way it was
handled<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.490> can't<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.970> only<00:01:42.000> one<00:01:42.570> that

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
handled and I can't be the only one that

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.270 
handled and I can't be the only one that
fought<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.470> mother<00:01:43.710> was<00:01:43.920> gonna<00:01:44.040> have<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
fought that the mother was gonna have a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.160 
fought that the mother was gonna have a
miscarriage<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:45.060> really<00:01:45.659> thought<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.869> was

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
miscarriage I really thought that was

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.020 
miscarriage I really thought that was
gonna<00:01:46.259> happen<00:01:46.500> when<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.369> was<00:01:47.579> watching<00:01:47.939> this
