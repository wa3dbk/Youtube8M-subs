take<00:00:36.660> your<00:00:36.780> hat<00:00:37.320> Obama<00:00:37.590> she<00:00:37.739> was<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.890> supporter

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
take your hat Obama she was a supporter

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.000 
take your hat Obama she was a supporter
she<00:00:38.579> had<00:00:39.090> Obama<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:39.809> before<00:00:40.379> he<00:00:40.530> was<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
she had Obama on before he was in the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.950 
she had Obama on before he was in the
election<00:00:41.430> yeah<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.850> one<00:00:42.059> around<00:00:42.300> his<00:00:42.629> book

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
election yeah the one around his book

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.990 
election yeah the one around his book
two<00:00:43.559> different<00:00:44.010> books<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.460> she<00:00:44.730> does<00:00:44.969> that

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
two different books and she does that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.299 
two different books and she does that
and<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.899> think<00:00:46.230> from<00:00:46.440> what<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.860> read<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and I think from what I read in the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.040 
and I think from what I read in the
statement<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.059> again<00:00:48.149> I'm<00:00:48.450> not<00:00:48.480> speaking<00:00:48.870> for

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
statement and again I'm not speaking for

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.900 
statement and again I'm not speaking for
him<00:00:49.170> only<00:00:49.350> going<00:00:49.559> by<00:00:49.680> what<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.860> read<00:00:50.129> did<00:00:50.730> she

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
him only going by what I read did she

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.850 
him only going by what I read did she
thinks<00:00:51.270> Palin<00:00:51.629> would<00:00:51.750> be<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> fantastic<00:00:52.199> guess

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
thinks Palin would be a fantastic guess

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.860 
thinks Palin would be a fantastic guess
I<00:00:53.039> don't<00:00:53.219> know<00:00:53.370> was<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.059> issue<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:54.750> she's

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
I don't know was it the issue if she's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.910 
I don't know was it the issue if she's
not<00:00:54.989> supporting<00:00:55.350> her<00:00:55.410> politically<00:00:55.770> that's

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
not supporting her politically that's

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.959 
not supporting her politically that's
what<00:00:56.070> has<00:00:56.190> them<00:00:56.340> upset<00:00:56.579> because<00:00:56.699> she's<00:00:56.850> been

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
what has them upset because she's been

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.670 
what has them upset because she's been
out<00:00:57.090> there<00:00:57.210> supporting<00:00:57.390> Barack<00:00:57.780> Obama<00:00:58.230> what's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
out there supporting Barack Obama what's

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.220 
out there supporting Barack Obama what's
your<00:00:58.829> take<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.250> the<00:01:00.149> choice<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.809> Palin

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
your take on the choice of Palin

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.840 
your take on the choice of Palin
certainly<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.039> politically<00:01:02.730> it's

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
certainly in it politically it's

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.149 
certainly in it politically it's
probably<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.149> very<00:01:03.180> good<00:01:03.390> move<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:03.979> how<00:01:04.979> do<00:01:05.040> you

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
probably a very good move but how do you

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.359 
probably a very good move but how do you
see<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.760> glass<00:01:06.030> ceiling<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:07.340> was<00:01:08.340> a

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
see it is it a glass ceiling it was a

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.810 
see it is it a glass ceiling it was a
good<00:01:08.670> move<00:01:09.560> where<00:01:10.560> there<00:01:10.740> was<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> cynical<00:01:11.580> good

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
good move where there was a cynical good

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.520 
good move where there was a cynical good
move<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.210> not<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.600> voters<00:01:12.840> will<00:01:13.170> determine

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
move and not the voters will determine

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.630 
move and not the voters will determine
but<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.920> was<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> good<00:01:14.310> move

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
but it was a good move

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.999 
but it was a good move
I<00:01:14.670> think<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.360> rolled<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.869> out<00:01:16.020> very<00:01:16.380> smartly

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
I think they rolled it out very smartly

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.850 
I think they rolled it out very smartly
by<00:01:17.640> lowering<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> bar<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.930> then<00:01:19.320> having<00:01:19.530> her

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
by lowering the bar and then having her

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.490 
by lowering the bar and then having her
come<00:01:20.100> on<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:21.210> all<00:01:21.360> guns<00:01:21.659> blasting<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.439> it

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
come on and with all guns blasting so it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.380 
come on and with all guns blasting so it
looked<00:01:22.770> as<00:01:22.950> though<00:01:22.979> she<00:01:23.369> was<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:23.970> much<00:01:24.150> better

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
looked as though she was so much better

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.630 
looked as though she was so much better
than<00:01:24.689> what<00:01:24.930> they<00:01:25.470> had<00:01:25.650> projected<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
than what they had projected the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.429 
than what they had projected the
question<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.299> when<00:01:27.570> now<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.960> gets<00:01:28.170> down<00:01:28.409> to

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
question is when now it gets down to

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.300 
question is when now it gets down to
issues<00:01:29.220> can<00:01:30.119> they<00:01:30.450> weather<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.590> storm<00:01:31.619> when

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
issues can they weather that storm when

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.310 
issues can they weather that storm when
we<00:01:32.460> start<00:01:32.759> talking<00:01:32.939> about<00:01:33.060> health<00:01:33.689> care<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
we start talking about health care and

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.929 
we start talking about health care and

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
George W Bush the lowest unemployment

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.440 
George W Bush the lowest unemployment
compared<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.239> last<00:03:19.450> four<00:03:19.720> decades<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:20.560> it

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
compared to the last four decades and it

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.509 
compared to the last four decades and it
seems<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.780> other<00:03:23.019> parameters<00:03:23.739> increases<00:03:24.250> but

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
seems the other parameters increases but

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.070 
seems the other parameters increases but
he's<00:03:24.880> been<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.239> president<00:03:25.780> for<00:03:25.900> eight<00:03:26.050> years
