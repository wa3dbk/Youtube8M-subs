00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.399 

was<00:01:25.090> that<00:01:25.240> a

oh<00:02:48.630> that's<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.590> Phrygian<00:02:49.980> mode

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.520 

that's<00:02:54.450> how<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.599> Phrygian<00:02:54.959> mode<00:02:54.989> sounds<00:02:55.439> up

that's how the Phrygian mode sounds up

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:22.570 
that's how the Phrygian mode sounds up
over<00:02:55.890> that

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:32.590 

you<00:03:22.780> see<00:03:23.780> sharp

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
invokes a very dark sound so a power

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.660

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
know the chords because the chord

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.390 
know the chords because the chord
progression<00:03:43.140> can<00:03:43.320> outline<00:03:43.740> the<00:03:43.950> scale<00:03:44.250> that
