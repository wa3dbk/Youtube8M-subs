your own home and download it with a
push<00:04:36.379> of<00:04:36.409> a<00:04:36.680> button<00:04:36.710> that's<00:04:37.669> basically<00:04:38.150> what

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
push of a button that's basically what

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.830 
push of a button that's basically what
how<00:04:39.949> I<00:04:40.190> see<00:04:40.460> it<00:04:40.490> like<00:04:40.819> I<00:04:41.000> rather<00:04:41.210> sit<00:04:41.599> home<00:04:41.780> and

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
how I see it like I rather sit home and

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.740 
how I see it like I rather sit home and
just<00:04:42.199> like<00:04:42.470> relax<00:04:42.909> and<00:04:43.909> be<00:04:44.240> able<00:04:44.330> to<00:04:44.509> just

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
just like relax and be able to just

just like relax and be able to just
download<00:04:44.960> it<00:04:45.229> easier<00:04:45.710> I<00:04:45.740> think<00:04:45.860> it's<00:04:46.159> more

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
download it easier I think it's more

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.189 
download it easier I think it's more
efficient<00:04:46.729> that<00:04:46.849> way<00:04:46.909> also<00:04:47.569> the<00:04:47.750> disc<00:04:47.990> can

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
efficient that way also the disc can

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.589 
efficient that way also the disc can
really<00:04:48.530> get<00:04:48.650> scratched<00:04:49.009> although<00:04:49.819> blu-ray

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
really get scratched although blu-ray

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:53.559 
really get scratched although blu-ray
discs<00:04:50.990> us<00:04:51.199> especially<00:04:51.560> for<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:53.120> PlayStation

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:53.569

3 that's hard to like ruin the disc for

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.300 
3 that's hard to like ruin the disc for
it<00:04:56.360> to<00:04:56.659> be<00:04:56.750> unreadable<00:04:57.080> but<00:04:57.560> yeah<00:04:57.949> at<00:04:58.039> the<00:04:58.129> same

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
it to be unreadable but yeah at the same

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.490 
it to be unreadable but yeah at the same
time<00:04:58.520> when<00:04:58.789> you<00:04:58.879> download<00:04:59.330> it<00:04:59.360> there's<00:05:00.080> no<00:05:00.289> way

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
time when you download it there's no way

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.110 
time when you download it there's no way
that<00:05:01.039> it<00:05:01.250> can<00:05:01.370> get<00:05:01.550> scratched<00:05:01.879> or<00:05:02.090> anything

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
that it can get scratched or anything

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.089 
that it can get scratched or anything
and<00:05:02.539> it's<00:05:02.659> therefore<00:05:02.900> saying<00:05:03.409> it's<00:05:03.680> there<00:05:03.919> to

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:04.099

and it's therefore saying it's there to
stay<00:05:04.129> and<00:05:04.580> there's<00:05:04.729> nothing<00:05:04.879> that<00:05:05.060> can<00:05:05.180> ever

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
stay and there's nothing that can ever

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.240 
stay and there's nothing that can ever
happen<00:05:05.509> to<00:05:05.810> it<00:05:05.960> because<00:05:06.469> even<00:05:06.740> if<00:05:06.830> you<00:05:06.949> delete
