00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.530 
to always realize that you have to learn
from<00:01:42.590> failure<00:01:42.650> I<00:01:43.250> mean<00:01:43.700> that's<00:01:43.970> that's<00:01:44.270> what

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
from failure I mean that's that's what

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.359 
from failure I mean that's that's what
it<00:01:44.630> is<00:01:44.660> you're<00:01:45.110> never<00:01:45.410> gonna<00:01:45.650> do<00:01:45.950> everything

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
it is you're never gonna do everything

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.109 
it is you're never gonna do everything
perfectly<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.150> if<00:01:47.540> you<00:01:47.690> do<00:01:47.900> fail<00:01:48.340> you<00:01:49.340> you

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
perfectly and if you do fail you you

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.090 
perfectly and if you do fail you you
take<00:01:50.360> a<00:01:50.390> step<00:01:50.660> back<00:01:50.900> and<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:51.260> realize<00:01:51.560> okay<00:01:52.070> I

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
take a step back and you realize okay I

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.609 
take a step back and you realize okay I
failed<00:01:52.490> but<00:01:53.090> what<00:01:53.630> have<00:01:53.810> I<00:01:53.840> learned<00:01:54.110> from<00:01:54.259> it

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
failed but what have I learned from it

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.650 
failed but what have I learned from it
and<00:01:54.770> how<00:01:55.280> can<00:01:55.520> I<00:01:55.580> not<00:01:56.000> make<00:01:56.300> this<00:01:56.420> mistake

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
and how can I not make this mistake

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.840 
and how can I not make this mistake
again<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.320> you<00:01:58.220> know<00:01:58.310> I<00:01:58.369> read<00:01:58.580> an<00:01:58.700> article

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
again and you know I read an article

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.960 
again and you know I read an article
recently<00:01:59.510> about<00:01:59.950> millionaires<00:02:00.950> or<00:02:01.340> top<00:02:01.550> CEOs

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
recently about millionaires or top CEOs

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.090 
recently about millionaires or top CEOs
or<00:02:02.240> something<00:02:02.540> like<00:02:02.690> that<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:03.140> one<00:02:03.830> of<00:02:03.950> the

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
or something like that and one of the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.710 
or something like that and one of the
first<00:02:04.280> points<00:02:04.730> like<00:02:04.880> how<00:02:05.090> do<00:02:05.150> you<00:02:05.360> become

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
first points like how do you become

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.960 
first points like how do you become
truly<00:02:06.200> successful<00:02:06.830> as<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.160> learn<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.760> fail

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
truly successful as you learn to fail

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.960 
truly successful as you learn to fail
because<00:02:08.480> most<00:02:08.980> billionaires<00:02:09.980> have<00:02:10.670> at<00:02:10.790> one

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
because most billionaires have at one

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.120 
because most billionaires have at one
point<00:02:11.000> failed<00:02:11.660> in<00:02:12.110> their<00:02:12.440> life<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.100> think

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
point failed in their life and I think

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.710 
point failed in their life and I think
it's<00:02:13.459> really<00:02:13.610> important<00:02:14.180> to<00:02:14.330> learn<00:02:14.480> how<00:02:14.690> to

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
it's really important to learn how to

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.380 
it's really important to learn how to
fail<00:02:14.989> because<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.380> have<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.800> be<00:02:15.920> able<00:02:16.070> to

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
fail because you have to be able to

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.150 
fail because you have to be able to
handle<00:02:17.390> that<00:02:17.540> cuz<00:02:18.170> life<00:02:18.380> is<00:02:18.620> not<00:02:18.830> gonna<00:02:19.010> be

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
handle that cuz life is not gonna be

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.190 
handle that cuz life is not gonna be
easy<00:02:19.280> working<00:02:19.880> it's<00:02:20.120> not<00:02:20.150> easy<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.840> you<00:02:21.019> have

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
easy working it's not easy and you have

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.840
