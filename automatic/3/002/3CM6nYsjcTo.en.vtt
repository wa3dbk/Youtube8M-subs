00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.530
 we look then my name is french and 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.900
 today i'm going to answer a question from 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.020
 Mitchell and who asks on what days 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.430
 which muscle groups can best train 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.369
 And so we have a combination of 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.900
 be the best and so on 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.910
 well at least we go first 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.410
 already say there are so many 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.939
 options are because there are so many 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.490
 variations of course with a lot 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.170
 different variables that play a role 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.820
 for example how often you train where you 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.579
 especially want to emphasize whether you 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.469
 have injuries and so on 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.719
 I train it myself more often a week because 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.390
 I already like it and I have the me there 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.670
 make time for that so I have less 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.469
 need for really combine I can often 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.960
 just a single muscle group per 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.760
 workout partner and give the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.969
 me for a moment that says nothing 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.670
 but the just i often train 35 to 45 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.640
 minutes and then I'm done with my 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.800
 training in you have had muscle group 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.309
 only if you can train fewer days 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.720
 then of course you have to combine such 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.049
 for three times a week is a good one 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.240
 combination for that wants on day one breast 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.790
 biceps on day 2 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.310
 your shoulders and your back and assignment 3 you 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.869
 legs and your triceps 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.580
 four days a week you can think of 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:26.340
 chest biceps back and shoulders triceps 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.509
 your legs dissolve days and five times 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.220
 in the week and yours just a day 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.329
 brush you can do a day of air you can 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.220
 a day shoulders you can do a day 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.520
 legs do you can do that poor and so 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.600
 thus how many times train more often 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.280
 You have the option of a certain 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.979
 train muscle groups and for example 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.590
 Imagine you already have very good arms 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.680
 then you can on the 5 day schedule 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.649
 for example, choose to still have one 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.030
 do chest biceps triceps nights or one 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.700
 chest triceps 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.200
 air biceps and then another day 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.020
 from chest and to stick from esther 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.490
 just youth rest or shoulders 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.280
 just add something extra 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.119
 make your weaknesses a bit more 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.340
 to get upstairs 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.950
 well in your schedule with you there think 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.340
 that you 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.410
 a I myself prefer a 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.150
 large muscle group with and smaller 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.739
 muscle group combine 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.560
 Well of course it can with time or 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:24.250
 any other training videos or pi 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.080
 just because it is coming out now is possible 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.120
 for example you are two big ones 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.620
 muscle group, for example, combines something 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.750
 You often see is a combination between 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.950
 chest and back that you air their breasts 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.930
 behind one 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.819
 I once have a breast myself 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.860
 quiet in my schedule 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.930
 in which it is always super set where it is 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.430
 once a chest exercise in one 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.410
 from the back and always putting it super 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.120
 with each other so that you for example a 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.299
 super the super set with 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.040
 bench press and barbell are everywhere then 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.049
 actually performs two in the same way 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.940
 and you don't really need much rest there 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.319
 between because you are 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.630
 stood in front 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.790
 opposite muscle groups we 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.530
 have little influence on each other 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.120
 well when you exactly those days 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.579
 must do that really makes a whole thunder 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.079
 from which often sees that the chest and 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.910
 triceps men who are all whole 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.739
 very busy on Monday and then on 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.049
 Wednesdays and Fridays do other things 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.000
 or also breast and biceps of course 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.889
 when you get it you exactly get their chest 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.230
 diary or lawyers and not one 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.670
 nut skin and clean when you come out 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.959
 train all your legs on Monday 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.700
 do you just nice your legs Monday 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.109
 but that it actually speaks for itself 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.700
 but some people are so into that 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.260
 fixed model fixed because I have to Monday 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.480
 train my chest 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.090
 yes that can sometimes be a bit tricky the de 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.769
 flexibility two schedule so you have to 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.970
 just train when you can when 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.500
 comes out 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.670
 and if you have a three-day schedule there 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.100
 I would make sure that you 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.630
 tries to rest a delsey every time 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.709
 between them so that you don't 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.310
 for example, three consecutive days 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.049
 trains and then not for 3 days for 4 days 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.100
 if it is true that you can only do so 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.099
 of course you have to 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.049
 just do it but sometimes try quietly 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.549
 spawn season 4 days it rains 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.400
 just train for two days then one day 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.549
 rest two days of training and 2 days 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.599
 and so on 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.400
 and you can play a little more 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.200
 Of course well I hope you have something 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.100
 to this video and that you aim 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.900
 know well on which days and how 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.030
 can put together your training schedule 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.830
 this was my opinion give this video a 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.120
 thumbs up if you liked it and leave it 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.980
 a response 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.360
 you can also post your questions it is also possible 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.950
 my twitter so that one of 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.720
 below zero description and I'll see the 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.900
 next time with a new video 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.900
