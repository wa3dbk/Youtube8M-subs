of a gas tank and what I found is that
people<00:01:02.309> don't<00:01:02.579> realize<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.420> they<00:01:03.989> tend

people don't realize that and they tend

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.740 
people don't realize that and they tend
to<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.769> throw<00:01:05.640> things<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.119> their<00:01:06.240> trunk<00:01:06.540> and

top of their gas tanks which is not a
good<00:01:13.110> thing<00:01:13.290> because<00:01:13.500> obviously<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.250> get

come across it's going to be a cure-all
for<00:02:03.810> anything<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.830> is<00:02:04.979> something<00:02:05.280> that's

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
for anything but it is something that's

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.359 
for anything but it is something that's
one<00:02:05.880> step<00:02:06.270> above<00:02:07.020> what<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.799> originally<00:02:07.920> was

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
one step above what it originally was

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.850 
one step above what it originally was
and<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.479> doesn't<00:02:09.840> take<00:02:09.990> away<00:02:10.020> from<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.709> look

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
and it doesn't take away from the look

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.559 
and it doesn't take away from the look
of<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.130> car<00:02:11.310> that's<00:02:11.640> where<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.000> was<00:02:12.239> trying<00:02:12.480> to

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
of the car that's where I was trying to

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.390 
of the car that's where I was trying to

come from there's other guys out there
that<00:02:14.700> have<00:02:14.850> developed<00:02:15.480> these<00:02:15.600> things<00:02:15.989> these

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
that have developed these things these

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.380 
that have developed these things these
big<00:02:16.530> steel<00:02:16.860> plates<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.459> can<00:02:17.700> cover<00:02:17.940> your<00:02:18.209> gas

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
big steel plates that can cover your gas

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.420 
big steel plates that can cover your gas
tank<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:18.959> they're<00:02:19.440> fine<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:19.770> dandy<00:02:20.100> it's

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
tank and they're fine and dandy it's

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.040 
tank and they're fine and dandy it's
just<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.819> they<00:02:20.940> don't<00:02:21.060> look<00:02:21.420> real<00:02:21.750> right

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
just that they don't look real right

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.449 
just that they don't look real right
they<00:02:22.290> look<00:02:22.470> like<00:02:22.620> something<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.160> somebody

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
they look like something that somebody

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.190 
they look like something that somebody
just<00:02:23.489> made<00:02:23.819> up<00:02:24.060> at<00:02:24.209> their<00:02:24.360> home<00:02:24.540> I've

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
just made up at their home I've

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.660 
just made up at their home I've
developed<00:02:25.590> something<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.250> really<00:02:26.489> looks

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
developed something that really looks

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.090 
developed something that really looks
slick<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.900> does<00:02:28.110> help<00:02:28.380> protect<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.920> top

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
slick and it does help protect the top

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.340 
slick and it does help protect the top
of<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.340> gas<00:02:29.520> tank<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.390> call<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.840> tank<00:02:31.080> top

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
of the gas tank and I call it a tank top

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.870 
of the gas tank and I call it a tank top

thing here is a drop in style gas tank

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.199 
thing here is a drop in style gas tank
if<00:02:52.739> you<00:02:52.769> take<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.340> out<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.640> there<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:54.060> can

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
to be aware that this is a gas tank this

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.080 
to be aware that this is a gas tank this
is<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.920> top<00:02:59.130> of<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.370> gas<00:02:59.549> tank<00:02:59.580> right<00:02:59.940> here

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
is the top of the gas tank right here

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.830 
is the top of the gas tank right here
and<00:03:00.540> it's<00:03:00.959> easy<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.290> damage<00:03:02.239> it's<00:03:03.239> not<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.510> very

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
and it's easy to damage it's not a very

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.530 
and it's easy to damage it's not a very
big<00:03:04.080> or<00:03:04.319> thick<00:03:04.590> piece<00:03:04.799> of<00:03:04.980> steel<00:03:05.360> and<00:03:06.360> you

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
big or thick piece of steel and you

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.840 
big or thick piece of steel and you
can't<00:03:06.810> drill<00:03:07.230> into<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:07.920> can't<00:03:08.190> damage<00:03:08.579> it

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
can't drill into it it can't damage it

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.870 
can't drill into it it can't damage it
whatsoever<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.860> somewhat<00:03:11.250> vulnerable

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
whatsoever and it is somewhat vulnerable

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.670 
whatsoever and it is somewhat vulnerable
so<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.690> first<00:03:12.959> thing<00:03:13.170> you're<00:03:13.320> going<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.470> want

so the first thing you're going to want
to<00:03:13.739> do<00:03:13.920> is<00:03:14.190> actually<00:03:14.940> take<00:03:15.420> out<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:16.260> roughly

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
to do is actually take out the roughly

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.680 
to do is actually take out the roughly
11<00:03:17.160> or<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.310> dozen<00:03:17.730> screws<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.269> hold<00:03:18.510> this

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
11 or a dozen screws that hold this

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.289 
11 or a dozen screws that hold this
thing<00:03:18.959> in<00:03:19.220> basically<00:03:20.220> with<00:03:20.459> just<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.850> 3/8

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
thing in basically with just a 3/8

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
this is what it's all about

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.940 
this is what it's all about
it's<00:03:47.400> basically<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:48.380> preformed<00:03:49.380> piece<00:03:49.769> of

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
it's basically a preformed piece of

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.640 
it's basically a preformed piece of
steel<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.579> has<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.239> exact<00:03:51.630> same<00:03:51.750> ribbons<00:03:52.470> in

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
steel that has the exact same ribbons in

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.069 
steel that has the exact same ribbons in
it<00:03:52.799> as<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.310> original<00:03:53.730> gas<00:03:53.940> tank<00:03:54.269> so<00:03:54.480> when<00:03:54.959> it's

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
it as the original gas tank so when it's

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.680 
it as the original gas tank so when it's
put<00:03:55.290> into<00:03:55.440> place<00:03:55.799> it<00:03:56.160> looks<00:03:56.880> like<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:57.359> is<00:03:57.510> the

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
put into place it looks like it is the

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.599 
put into place it looks like it is the
top<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:58.079> your<00:03:58.200> gas<00:03:58.410> tank<00:03:58.590> so<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.160> doesn't<00:03:59.489> take

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
top of your gas tank so it doesn't take

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.550 
top of your gas tank so it doesn't take
away<00:03:59.850> from<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.120> originality<00:04:00.569> for<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:01.350> guys

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560

out there I'd like to show your cars
this<00:04:04.019> is<00:04:04.079> what<00:04:04.410> it's<00:04:04.590> all<00:04:04.739> about<00:04:04.769> here

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
this is what it's all about here

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.210 
this is what it's all about here
to<00:04:06.300> keep<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.630> original<00:04:06.840> looking<00:04:07.500> it<00:04:07.980> goes

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
to keep it original looking it goes

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.430 
to keep it original looking it goes
around<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:09.030> opening<00:04:09.570> of<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.960> gate<00:04:10.140> fuel

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
around the opening of the gate fuel

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.840 
around the opening of the gate fuel
filler<00:04:10.710> so<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.070> don't<00:04:11.250> have<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.520> take<00:04:11.670> your

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
filler so you don't have to take your

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.550 
filler so you don't have to take your
fuel<00:04:12.090> filler<00:04:12.330> off<00:04:12.570> of<00:04:12.750> there<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.080> it

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
fuel filler off of there and it

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.010 
fuel filler off of there and it
literally<00:04:13.890> bolts<00:04:14.490> over<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.180> existing<00:04:15.750> tank

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
literally bolts over the existing tank

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:18.820 
literally bolts over the existing tank
kind<00:04:16.770> of<00:04:16.890> gives<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.489> little<00:04:17.670> bit<00:04:18.060> of<00:04:18.300> a<00:04:18.390> cover

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
kind of gives it a little bit of a cover

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.680 
kind of gives it a little bit of a cover
to<00:04:19.830> help<00:04:20.010> protect<00:04:20.190> it<00:04:20.550> so<00:04:21.060> you'll<00:04:21.239> take<00:04:21.450> this

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
to help protect it so you'll take this

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.050 
to help protect it so you'll take this
thing<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.260> you'll<00:04:22.770> just<00:04:23.010> put<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:23.460> inside<00:04:23.820> the

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
thing and you'll just put it inside the

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.920 
thing and you'll just put it inside the
trunk<00:04:24.570> here<00:04:25.130> the<00:04:26.300> top<00:04:27.300> of<00:04:27.510> your<00:04:27.690> original<00:04:28.110> tank

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
trunk here the top of your original tank

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.960 
trunk here the top of your original tank
Nestle<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.080> into<00:04:31.290> place<00:04:31.560> it's<00:04:32.310> probably<00:04:32.760> not<00:04:32.910> a

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
Nestle it into place it's probably not a

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
Nestle it into place it's probably not a
bad<00:04:33.180> idea<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:33.720> vacuum<00:04:34.170> it<00:04:34.290> out<00:04:34.440> clean<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:35.370> out

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
bad idea to vacuum it out clean it out

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.940 
bad idea to vacuum it out clean it out
because<00:04:36.990> you<00:04:37.200> don't<00:04:37.350> really<00:04:37.560> want<00:04:37.830> to

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
because you don't really want to

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.820 
because you don't really want to
sandwich<00:04:38.520> anything<00:04:39.060> between<00:04:39.240> this<00:04:39.870> lid<00:04:40.290> with

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
sandwich anything between this lid with

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.390 
sandwich anything between this lid with
this<00:04:40.950> tank<00:04:41.280> top<00:04:41.580> and<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.050> original<00:04:43.050> tank<00:04:43.400> but

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
this tank top and the original tank but

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.100 
this tank top and the original tank but
you<00:04:44.520> can<00:04:44.670> see<00:04:44.880> how<00:04:45.270> what<00:04:45.420> it<00:04:45.540> does<00:04:45.720> it<00:04:45.900> kind<00:04:45.990> of

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
you can see how what it does it kind of

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.780 
you can see how what it does it kind of
brightens<00:04:46.290> it<00:04:46.590> up<00:04:46.710> if<00:04:46.890> you<00:04:46.980> have<00:04:47.130> an<00:04:47.280> old<00:04:47.490> tank

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
brightens it up if you have an old tank

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.520 
brightens it up if you have an old tank
that's<00:04:48.090> still<00:04:48.360> functional<00:04:48.930> but<00:04:49.110> just<00:04:49.350> looks

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
that's still functional but just looks

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.290 
that's still functional but just looks
old<00:04:49.770> well<00:04:50.340> now<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:50.550> have<00:04:50.670> something<00:04:51.150> there

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
old well now you have something there

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.910 
old well now you have something there
that<00:04:51.330> actually<00:04:51.570> looks<00:04:51.990> brand-new<00:04:52.530> in<00:04:52.710> there

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
that actually looks brand-new in there

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.580 
that actually looks brand-new in there
so<00:04:53.400> it<00:04:53.520> does<00:04:53.700> serve<00:04:53.940> a<00:04:53.970> couple<00:04:54.360> functions<00:04:54.600> I<00:04:55.050> do

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
so it does serve a couple functions I do

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.680 
so it does serve a couple functions I do
supply<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:56.250> screws<00:04:56.820> that<00:04:57.030> are<00:04:57.150> just<00:04:57.330> a<00:04:57.450> tad

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
supply the screws that are just a tad

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.780 
supply the screws that are just a tad
longer<00:04:58.230> that<00:04:58.800> will<00:04:58.920> go<00:04:59.100> in<00:04:59.280> here<00:04:59.640> and

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
longer that will go in here and

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.790 
longer that will go in here and
basically<00:05:00.450> you'll<00:05:00.690> just<00:05:00.900> find<00:05:01.200> the<00:05:01.380> hole<00:05:01.560> that

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
basically you'll just find the hole that

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.320
