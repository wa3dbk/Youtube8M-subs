pull on this and wiggle and we should be

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.580 
pull on this and wiggle and we should be
able<00:02:00.409> to<00:02:00.530> get<00:02:00.679> this<00:02:00.830> loose<00:02:02.050> now<00:02:03.050> you<00:02:03.110> can<00:02:03.440> just

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
able to get this loose now you can just

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.639 
able to get this loose now you can just
hit<00:02:03.800> it<00:02:03.920> with<00:02:04.039> a<00:02:04.069> rubber<00:02:04.280> mallet<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:04.940> get<00:02:05.179> your

hit it with a rubber mallet and get your

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.469 
hit it with a rubber mallet and get your
bottom<00:02:06.649> of<00:02:06.739> a<00:02:06.830> pry<00:02:07.039> bar<00:02:07.069> or<00:02:07.280> something<00:02:07.759> and

bottom of a pry bar or something and

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.059 
bottom of a pry bar or something and
it'll<00:02:08.629> lock<00:02:08.840> loose<00:02:09.140> make<00:02:09.530> sure<00:02:09.709> you<00:02:09.830> still

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
it'll lock loose make sure you still

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.070 
it'll lock loose make sure you still
have<00:02:10.099> a<00:02:10.280> catch<00:02:11.150> underneath<00:02:11.540> here<00:02:11.840> because

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
have a catch underneath here because

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.280 
have a catch underneath here because
cooling<00:02:12.709> might<00:02:12.890> still<00:02:13.300> leak<00:02:14.300> out<00:02:14.510> like<00:02:14.959> it<00:02:15.140> is

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
cooling might still leak out like it is

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.240 
cooling might still leak out like it is
in<00:02:15.920> our<00:02:16.129> case<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:21.290> then<00:02:21.470> should<00:02:21.890> be<00:02:21.980> able<00:02:22.069> to
