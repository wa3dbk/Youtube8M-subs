00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240 
two are pretty similar the PI TiVo X and
the<00:01:30.360> Mac<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.750> TiVo<00:01:31.170> let's<00:01:31.830> kind<00:01:32.010> of<00:01:32.040> check

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
the Mac to TiVo let's kind of check

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.400 
the Mac to TiVo let's kind of check
these<00:01:32.370> out<00:01:32.550> real<00:01:32.850> quick<00:01:33.350> essentially<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
these out real quick essentially the

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.410 
these out real quick essentially the
idea<00:01:34.500> here<00:01:34.830> is<00:01:34.980> you<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.490> folder<00:01:36.120> and<00:01:36.300> you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
idea here is you have a folder and you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.710 
idea here is you have a folder and you
just<00:01:36.630> drag<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.200> drop<00:01:37.470> your<00:01:38.220> your<00:01:38.700> your<00:01:39.570> media

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
just drag and drop your your your media

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.900 
just drag and drop your your your media
on<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.410> folder<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.890> same<00:01:41.460> thing<00:01:41.640> here

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
on to the folder and same thing here

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.870 
on to the folder and same thing here
inside<00:01:42.330> of<00:01:42.510> the<00:01:42.600> PI<00:01:42.810> TiVo<00:01:43.620> so<00:01:44.340> here<00:01:44.550> these<00:01:44.670> two

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
inside of the PI TiVo so here these two

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.580 
inside of the PI TiVo so here these two
act<00:01:45.150> pretty<00:01:45.510> similarly<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.230> I<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.410> a<00:01:46.440> little

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
act pretty similarly and I have a little

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.680 
act pretty similarly and I have a little
folder<00:01:47.010> here<00:01:47.190> that<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.370> made<00:01:47.610> we'll<00:01:48.450> just<00:01:48.570> call

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
folder here that I made we'll just call

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.120 
folder here that I made we'll just call
it<00:01:48.720> TiVo<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:51.320> put<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> couple<00:01:52.620> videos<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:53.040> here

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
it TiVo and put a couple videos in here

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.190 
it TiVo and put a couple videos in here
and<00:01:53.250> use<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.400> couple<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.730> my<00:01:53.820> videos<00:01:54.020> I'll<00:01:55.020> just

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
and use a couple of my videos I'll just

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.370 
and use a couple of my videos I'll just
put<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.470> for<00:01:55.710> my<00:01:55.920> for<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.730> demo<00:01:56.940> here<00:01:57.380> these

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
put in for my for the demo here these

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.900 
put in for my for the demo here these
work<00:01:58.620> pretty<00:01:58.800> similarly<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.640> know<00:01:59.730> these

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
work pretty similarly you know these

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.910 
work pretty similarly you know these
they<00:02:00.450> support<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.840> number<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.170> video<00:02:01.590> formats

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
they support a number of video formats

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.690 
they support a number of video formats
the<00:02:02.400> h.264<00:02:03.180> DivX<00:02:04.050> you<00:02:05.040> know<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.160> few<00:02:05.370> others<00:02:05.550> I'm

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
the h.264 DivX you know a few others I'm

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.580 
the h.264 DivX you know a few others I'm
not<00:02:05.730> too<00:02:05.970> sure<00:02:06.150> all<00:02:06.330> of<00:02:06.360> them<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:07.320> some<00:02:07.440> of<00:02:07.470> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
not too sure all of them but some of the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.990 
not too sure all of them but some of the
main<00:02:07.710> common<00:02:08.129> ones<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.550> pretty<00:02:08.759> cool

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
main common ones this is pretty cool

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.059 
main common ones this is pretty cool
because<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> transcoder<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:10.920> just

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
because it is a transcoder so you just

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.860 
because it is a transcoder so you just
drop<00:02:11.280> your<00:02:11.310> media<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.909> here<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.269> it<00:02:12.780> will

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
drop your media in here and it will

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.649 
drop your media in here and it will
transcode<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.470> into<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.010> TiVo<00:02:14.670> format<00:02:15.420> on<00:02:15.629> the

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
transcode it into the TiVo format on the

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.479 
transcode it into the TiVo format on the
fly<00:02:15.840> as<00:02:16.290> it's<00:02:16.530> transmitted<00:02:16.950> that's<00:02:17.220> really

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
fly as it's transmitted that's really

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.020 
fly as it's transmitted that's really
cool

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
cool

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.600 
cool
back<00:02:18.569> in<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.810> day<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.020> know<00:02:19.319> you<00:02:19.410> had<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.680> take

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
back in the day you know you had to take

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.800 
back in the day you know you had to take
your<00:02:20.760> media<00:02:21.120> and

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
your media and

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.690 
your media and
verdict<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.349> TiVo<00:02:22.620> format<00:02:23.099> so<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.580> would

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
verdict to the TiVo format so it would

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.210 
verdict to the TiVo format so it would
work<00:02:23.880> stream<00:02:24.180> lisore<00:02:24.750> seamlessly<00:02:25.260> but<00:02:26.099> this

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
work stream lisore seamlessly but this

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.740 
work stream lisore seamlessly but this
year<00:02:26.370> it's<00:02:26.489> pretty<00:02:26.580> cool<00:02:26.819> you<00:02:27.420> just<00:02:27.630> basically

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
year it's pretty cool you just basically

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.180 
year it's pretty cool you just basically
drop<00:02:28.020> your<00:02:28.260> media<00:02:28.500> as<00:02:28.620> long<00:02:28.739> as<00:02:28.920> one<00:02:29.069> of<00:02:29.099> the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
drop your media as long as one of the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.860 
drop your media as long as one of the
supported<00:02:29.640> media's<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.330> know<00:02:30.450> you're<00:02:30.630> fine

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
supported media's you know you're fine

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.110 
supported media's you know you're fine
media<00:02:31.290> you're<00:02:31.650> fine<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.280> if<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.730> need<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.970> you

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
media you're fine and if you need to you

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.720 
media you're fine and if you need to you
can<00:02:33.270> convert<00:02:33.569> it<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.870> know<00:02:33.930> use<00:02:34.080> handbrake

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
can convert it you know use handbrake

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.130 
can convert it you know use handbrake

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
so let's make it just a couple here just

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.120 
so let's make it just a couple here just
to<00:03:18.630> give<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:18.810> an<00:03:18.900> idea<00:03:19.019> when<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:19.680> show<00:03:19.890> it<00:03:19.980> on

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.910 
to give you an idea when I show it on
the<00:03:20.250> TiVo<00:03:21.080> now<00:03:22.080> that<00:03:22.230> one<00:03:22.349> does<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.470> drag<00:03:22.890> and

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
the TiVo now that one does a drag and

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.330 
the TiVo now that one does a drag and
drop<00:03:23.360> so<00:03:24.360> there<00:03:24.510> we<00:03:24.630> go<00:03:24.829> so<00:03:25.829> here<00:03:25.859> we<00:03:26.040> got<00:03:26.160> two

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
drop so there we go so here we got two

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.759 
drop so there we go so here we got two
was<00:03:26.700> called<00:03:26.880> my<00:03:27.030> share<00:03:27.329> and<00:03:27.359> test<00:03:27.870> okay<00:03:28.200> now

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
was called my share and test okay now

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:29.840 
was called my share and test okay now
let's<00:03:29.040> look<00:03:29.100> inside<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.430> prep<00:03:29.670> for

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
let's look inside the prep for

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.580 
let's look inside the prep for
preferences<00:03:30.359> here<00:03:30.600> general<00:03:31.170> preferences

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
preferences here general preferences

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.099 
preferences here general preferences
launched<00:03:31.859> at<00:03:32.070> login<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:33.510> this<00:03:33.660> turns<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.019> on

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
launched at login and this turns it on

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.569 
launched at login and this turns it on
this<00:03:34.350> enables<00:03:34.769> it<00:03:34.950> so<00:03:35.100> essentially<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.489> can

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
this enables it so essentially you can

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.120 
this enables it so essentially you can
keep<00:03:35.760> your<00:03:35.910> computer<00:03:36.180> running<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:37.560> if<00:03:37.799> it<00:03:37.980> is

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
keep your computer running and if it is

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.770 
keep your computer running and if it is
running<00:03:38.430> you<00:03:38.609> can<00:03:38.790> grab<00:03:39.030> this<00:03:39.180> content<00:03:39.630> off

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
running you can grab this content off

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.479 
running you can grab this content off
the<00:03:39.900> TiVo<00:03:40.200> something<00:03:40.890> else<00:03:41.010> kind<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.280> cool<00:03:41.400> is

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
the TiVo something else kind of cool is

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.199 
the TiVo something else kind of cool is
a<00:03:41.579> stream<00:03:41.850> baby

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
a stream baby

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.930 
a stream baby
and<00:03:42.900> this<00:03:43.200> actually<00:03:43.470> streams<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.400> content

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
and this actually streams the content

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.300 
and this actually streams the content
live<00:03:45.239> so<00:03:45.690> this<00:03:46.140> one<00:03:46.350> here<00:03:46.560> you<00:03:46.650> download<00:03:47.130> it<00:03:47.220> to

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
live so this one here you download it to

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.190 
live so this one here you download it to
TiVo<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:48.150> is<00:03:48.359> stored<00:03:48.600> on<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.870> TiVo<00:03:49.170> and

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
TiVo and it is stored on the TiVo and

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.050 
TiVo and it is stored on the TiVo and
this<00:03:49.470> one<00:03:49.620> here<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:49.920> stream<00:03:50.160> it<00:03:50.190> live<00:03:50.489> over

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
this one here you stream it live over
