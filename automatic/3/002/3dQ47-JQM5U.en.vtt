00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:26.920
 there are three sheets of tissue paper to cut 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:32.830
 He has some leaves that I have 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:38.830
 I already cut it and another color just for 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:41.620
 you see after cutting in the middle you go 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:50.770

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:59.610
 so we'll double it will double 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:59.610
 line started it out 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.530

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.650
 rounded back sides 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.300
 the hatch muzzle 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.350

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.460
 We're going to fold in the middle. 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:56.050
 Let's get it. I like to tie it with the 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:56.050
 nylon wire in the middle 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.069
 now, open it so carefully 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:37.440
 You have to be very careful because that 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.440
 KakÃ¡, the tissue paper is very thin. 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:49.530
 now carefully 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:49.530
 Let's get up too high to launch 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:03:14.230
 the left rock and now the right side 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:17.130
 I always felt weak falling elephant 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.130

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.820

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.360
 medium 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:50.470
 The less leaf you use less 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:54.700
 it will get full the more leaf more 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:04:03.459
 full of what they will hold to give 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:11.890
 finish or pull straight to 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:15.520
 cute and she gets close in the middle 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:19.840
 now let's do this part we go 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:23.020

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:29.440

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:31.630

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.330

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.839

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:55.080
 toothpick for me to put here 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:58.000
 In the middle I'm going to pass a double 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.940
