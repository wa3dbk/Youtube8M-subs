you might notice David's footage not

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.110 
you might notice David's footage not
looking<00:00:03.310> quite<00:00:03.400> as<00:00:03.610> good<00:00:03.700> as<00:00:03.820> it<00:00:03.940> did<00:00:04.000> before

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:04.120 
looking quite as good as it did before

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.510 
looking quite as good as it did before
that's<00:00:04.960> because<00:00:05.320> he<00:00:05.500> thought<00:00:05.680> I'll<00:00:05.920> use<00:00:05.980> this

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:06.520 
that's because he thought I'll use this

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.579 
that's because he thought I'll use this
mod<00:00:06.790> that<00:00:07.089> is<00:00:07.240> highly<00:00:07.420> unstable<00:00:07.810> and<00:00:08.289> that

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:08.589 
mod that is highly unstable and that

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:11.159 
mod that is highly unstable and that
would<00:00:08.679> be<00:00:08.709> perfectly<00:00:09.190> fine<00:00:09.539> but<00:00:10.539> no<00:00:10.690> it<00:00:10.839> wasn't

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:11.169 
would be perfectly fine but no it wasn't

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:12.839 
would be perfectly fine but no it wasn't
because<00:00:11.349> then<00:00:11.650> the<00:00:11.860> game<00:00:12.009> updated<00:00:12.519> and<00:00:12.699> now

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:12.849 
because then the game updated and now

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.119 
because then the game updated and now
it's<00:00:13.030> broken<00:00:13.239> and<00:00:13.650> now<00:00:14.650> we<00:00:14.709> have<00:00:14.889> to<00:00:15.009> go<00:00:15.099> back

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129 
it's broken and now we have to go back

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:16.680 
it's broken and now we have to go back
to<00:00:15.369> normal<00:00:15.669> and<00:00:15.789> the<00:00:15.909> rest<00:00:16.210> the<00:00:16.330> footage<00:00:16.600> is

to normal and the rest the footage is

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.810 
to normal and the rest the footage is
going<00:00:16.810> to<00:00:16.870> be<00:00:16.960> highly<00:00:17.170> in<00:00:17.380> congruous<00:00:17.890> if<00:00:18.160> I

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820
