bobby pin just bobby pins at this big in
another<00:01:52.049> spoon<00:01:53.049> add<00:01:53.560> on<00:01:53.829> something<00:01:54.189> at<00:01:54.460> the

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
another spoon add on something at the

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.170 
another spoon add on something at the
play-doh<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:56.200> see<00:01:56.439> the<00:01:56.670> smallness<00:01:57.670> of<00:01:58.000> this

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
play-doh you see the smallness of this

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.450 
play-doh you see the smallness of this
play-doh<00:01:58.390> this<00:01:58.750> is<00:02:00.450> 2/3<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.719> this<00:02:02.590> is<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.799> 2<00:02:03.070> 3<00:02:03.310> M

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
play-doh this is 2/3 and this is a 2 3 M

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.520 
play-doh this is 2/3 and this is a 2 3 M
scan<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:05.140> I<00:02:06.450> compare<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.659> the<00:02:07.780> other<00:02:07.930> one<00:02:08.049> this

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
scan and I compare to the other one this

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.010 
scan and I compare to the other one this
is<00:02:08.799> a<00:02:08.829> whore<00:02:09.220> 1/4<00:02:09.970> a<00:02:10.239> Guram

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
is a whore 1/4 a Guram

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.780 
is a whore 1/4 a Guram
and<00:02:11.500> so<00:02:11.830> look<00:02:12.040> at<00:02:12.129> the<00:02:12.220> difference<00:02:12.580> between

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
and so look at the difference between

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.630 
and so look at the difference between
the

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.570 
the
sizes<00:02:14.180> this<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.440> regular<00:02:15.950> size<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.400> this

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
sizes this is the regular size and this

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.120 
sizes this is the regular size and this
is<00:02:16.790> like<00:02:16.970> this<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.900> fun<00:02:18.080> factor<00:02:18.440> inside<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:18.920> I

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
is like this the fun factor inside so I

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.000 
is like this the fun factor inside so I
think<00:02:19.430> that's<00:02:19.580> kind<00:02:20.060> of<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.319> ripoff<00:02:21.319> better

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
think that's kind of a ripoff better

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.430 
think that's kind of a ripoff better
size
