00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
month and there is two dollars fifty

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.330 
month and there is two dollars fifty
processing<00:01:00.359> fee<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.260> plus<00:01:01.590> postage<00:01:02.010> and

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
because I think it works out a lot

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.550 
because I think it works out a lot
cheaper<00:01:08.299> especially<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:09.750> me<00:01:10.020> because<00:01:10.229> I

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
cheaper especially for me because I

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.609

is<00:03:31.389> what<00:03:31.720> I<00:03:31.750> did<00:03:32.019> with<00:03:32.169> one<00:03:32.440> of<00:03:32.590> my<00:03:32.769> orders

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
is what I did with one of my orders

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.640 
is what I did with one of my orders
because<00:03:33.849> I<00:03:33.879> had<00:03:34.239> like<00:03:34.419> one<00:03:35.139> order<00:03:35.440> from

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
because I had like one order from

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.670 
because I had like one order from
Nordstrom<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:36.370> one<00:03:36.760> order<00:03:37.030> from<00:03:37.209> Sephora<00:03:37.810> but

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
Nordstrom and one order from Sephora but

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.039 
Nordstrom and one order from Sephora but
I<00:03:39.069> wouldn't<00:03:39.549> recommend<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.299> because<00:03:40.690> when<00:03:41.019> I

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
I wouldn't recommend it because when I

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.110 
I wouldn't recommend it because when I
worked<00:03:41.349> it<00:03:41.530> out<00:03:41.650> it<00:03:41.829> actually<00:03:42.220> cost<00:03:42.549> more

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
worked it out it actually cost more

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.110 
worked it out it actually cost more
basically<00:03:43.989> there's<00:03:44.199> a<00:03:44.319> lot<00:03:44.560> of<00:03:44.919> fees

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
basically there's a lot of fees

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.229 
basically there's a lot of fees
so<00:03:46.660> that's<00:03:46.900> processing<00:03:47.799> fee<00:03:48.220> of<00:03:48.489> five<00:03:48.910> dollars

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
so that's processing fee of five dollars

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.589 
so that's processing fee of five dollars
for<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.840> two<00:03:50.049> boxes<00:03:50.620> and<00:03:50.980> then<00:03:51.519> repacking<00:03:52.239> fee

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
and other $4 and then to take a photo

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.740 
and other $4 and then to take a photo
they<00:03:56.620> basically<00:03:56.949> give<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:57.310> three<00:03:57.730> photos<00:03:58.359> and

they basically give you three photos and

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.439 
they basically give you three photos and
that's<00:03:59.049> a<00:03:59.199> dollar<00:03:59.470> and<00:03:59.889> then<00:04:00.489> postage<00:04:01.120> was

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:01.449 
that's a dollar and then postage was

fourteen dollars and ten cents and

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.449 
fourteen dollars and ten cents and
that's<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.299> meal<00:04:04.480> priority<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:05.290> always<00:04:05.799> choose<00:04:06.159> a

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
that's a meal priority I always choose a

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.330 
that's a meal priority I always choose a
meal<00:04:06.849> priority<00:04:07.569> and<00:04:07.840> then<00:04:08.620> there's<00:04:08.889> also<00:04:09.129> a

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
meal priority and then there's also a

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.189 
meal priority and then there's also a
bank<00:04:09.760> fee<00:04:10.180> of<00:04:10.540> 4.3%<00:04:11.229> which<00:04:12.220> was<00:04:12.569> 58<00:04:13.569> cents<00:04:14.109> so

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:14.199 
bank fee of 4.3% which was 58 cents so

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.020 
bank fee of 4.3% which was 58 cents so
in<00:04:14.349> total<00:04:14.530> I<00:04:14.829> paid<00:04:15.069> twenty<00:04:15.400> four<00:04:15.549> dollars<00:04:15.819> and

in total I paid twenty four dollars and

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.569 
in total I paid twenty four dollars and
ten<00:04:16.269> cents<00:04:16.690> to<00:04:16.930> consolidate<00:04:17.680> those<00:04:17.919> two<00:04:18.310> boxes

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
ten cents to consolidate those two boxes

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.909 
ten cents to consolidate those two boxes
and<00:04:18.940> I<00:04:19.120> won't<00:04:19.359> recommend<00:04:19.720> this<00:04:20.049> because<00:04:20.349> it's

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
and I won't recommend this because it's

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.370 
and I won't recommend this because it's
a<00:04:21.219> lot<00:04:21.669> more<00:04:21.880> expensive<00:04:22.270> if<00:04:22.719> I<00:04:22.810> worked<00:04:23.080> it<00:04:23.260> out

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
a lot more expensive if I worked it out

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.340 
a lot more expensive if I worked it out
and<00:04:23.740> it's<00:04:24.070> a<00:04:24.370> lot<00:04:24.669> cheaper<00:04:24.700> if<00:04:25.210> you<00:04:25.240> just<00:04:25.570> go

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
and it's a lot cheaper if you just go

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.430 
and it's a lot cheaper if you just go
with<00:04:26.790> individual<00:04:27.790> packages<00:04:28.450> okay<00:04:29.020> so<00:04:29.080> once

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
with individual packages okay so once
