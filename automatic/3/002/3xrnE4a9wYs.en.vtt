I<00:02:11.950> believe<00:02:12.430> it's<00:02:12.730> because<00:02:12.880> black<00:02:13.450> folks<00:02:13.720> have

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
I believe it's because black folks have

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.979 
I believe it's because black folks have
have<00:02:14.440> invested<00:02:15.099> psychologically<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.270> much<00:02:16.720> in

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
have invested psychologically so much in

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.559 
have invested psychologically so much in
this<00:02:17.200> president<00:02:17.819> that<00:02:18.819> like<00:02:19.030> people<00:02:19.180> do<00:02:19.450> not

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
want him to fail and and therefore

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.309 
want him to fail and and therefore
choose<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:24.040> see<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:24.880> reality<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:26.200> is

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
choose to see a reality that is

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.190
