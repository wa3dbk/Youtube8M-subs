00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.950
 now they are Carlos this third part of 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.780
 video tutorial so that the vigués picture 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.369
 I will explain 

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:10.719
 p three things 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.559
 the first is how to match 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.720
 the arms of the cross with the central ones of the lateral streets for example 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.829
 here is the red indicated that the well-known and well 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.829
 here is the orange and the valley green level 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:26.460
 here is the orange 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.099
 to live natural blue 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.220
 and here is the iberia 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.120
 here you owe gratitude you're worth it 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.609
 place the corners 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:37.220
 instead 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.210
 and he feels it turn the corners so that you of the cube in fact total 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.170
 for it 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.770
 to match the arms of the cross 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.530
 p we take as superior 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.470
 the face we are doing is yellow the opposite of the one that is already 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.250
 he learns 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.410
 and as a frontal 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.890
 one side 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.700
 p 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.020
 side 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.750
 that will lead us the contractor twizy of the red for example 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.990
 if we take this one 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.200
 they have acted 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.480
 min 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.410
 marc gasol can match 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.850
 a 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.040
 clarke 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.430
 they are the ones that can affect 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.010
 a tab if I'm not asking the 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.580
 does not work then 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.580
 if it is not with whom we all skip this step 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.670
 yes in the concerts 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.450
 we have to move for people with AIDS unapro example will not only work 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.410
 if it contains us if they tell us donovan 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.320
 so 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.270
 don bosco frontán lake 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.800
 bananas with 503 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.280
 we do and a hundred for the no is not easy 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.100
 we go up the right 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.100
 the top left and lower right 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.080
 the drift after that land 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.170
 we go up the right 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.410
 the drift 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.820
 we turn twice 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.240
 we go down the right 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.830
 it is no longer coincident 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.830
 they suffer again 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:13.939
 you have to do it so that the volga 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.049
 prato volva isea 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.019
 to have him see it 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.889
 we go up the right 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.379
 the drift to the left and lower the right 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.839
 the left derivation again 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:30.909
 we go up the right 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.409
 we rotate the one above 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:33.879
 twice 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.549
 if we go down the right 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.549
 because yesterday the first second or because it would not happen to second 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:40.989
 another thing 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.890
 the law the right up 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.519
 the network the above also attended by the right 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.229
 the drift to the left we raise the right 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.359
 those above believe we admitted having twice 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.359
 i went down the right vargas prince 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:58.419
 now we have to do 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:02:59.639
 that the corners 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.599
 final coli the colors 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.859
 for example here active 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.349
 the yellow and red corner 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:07.479
 green no 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:10.739
 but here is yellow blue orange take out we are not worth 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:12.330
 yellow 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.379
 green orange yellow red-green neither mom but neither is it worth 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.569
 yellow orange blue yellow green orange is not worth but for example this one 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.379
 yes we would be worth 3 yellow blue red and here is the yellow blue and red 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.129
 so it's worth to have the hundred percent in 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.779
 is to put the corners in place 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:36.379
 is to take as superior what we are doing the base 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:37.210
 salazar 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.999
 the yellow 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:41.499
 and as a frontal a channel the ctera 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:43.119
 so that he does not write 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:44.349
 the corner 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.349
 that will lead us up to the right 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:53.239
 we make recent algorithm the rival area to the left and we climb the 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.399
 right 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:56.809
 the drift that the right 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:59.229
 we climb the left 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.219
 from above to the left 

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:03.079
 we go down 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.379
 the right 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.379
 the one on top that the right one we go down the left 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.709
 we see that it does not contain us a few years with night axis festivals amount from 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.569
 the beginning but they are and are with whom 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.509
 ok then we go back to 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.759
 to repeat the algorithm 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.550
 the drift to the left 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.319
 we go up the right 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:28.059
 the one on the top to the right 

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:31.539
 we climb the left 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.330
 the one on the top left 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.249
 we go down the right 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:38.449
 the one on the top to the right and we go down the left 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.130
 maletilla confer us for example you look so directly impacts this 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:45.169
 red and green yellow 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.190
 and yellow nadja attitude 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.909
 majesty two corners 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.250
 we are left without being placed in Basque well 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.520
 but you turn like that 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.460
 for 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.110
 to place the following 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.279
 to place the yan corners 

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:02.339
 to rotate what we have to do is 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:04.469
 we turn 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:07.469
 edesa we take as fruit some side face 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.309
 so that the corner of we want to place is up on the right 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:14.159
 after arriving, then 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:15.559
 we make 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:19.739
 the algorithm the chente algorithm are four movements but you have to 

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:21.839
 repeat it until it comes out 

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:23.529
 then 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:24.509
 we go down 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.889
 the right 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.059
 the drift towards the area under the cistierna sorry 

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:32.139
 we go up the right 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.289
 and the one on the bottom to the right 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.580
 is worth these four movements 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.800
 is repeated 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.189
 we go down 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:40.469
 let's keep going 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:43.909
 we go up we turn in reverse 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:46.009
 we go down 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:47.979
 let's keep going 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.979
 we climb 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.300
 why sometimes the other time patients country 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:00.919
 buenos aires but he paid but this does not happen because that the pp happened to him what 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.569
 same until this festival 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:05.119
 we go down 

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:06.639
 let's keep going 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.930
 we went around 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.979
 we go down the right we continue attending to his right hand 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.529
 we start does the right 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:20.139
 again we go down 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.589
 we turn up and turn 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:23.599
 the cube 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:27.029
 the problem is destroyed 

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:29.509
 already considers soccer the orange 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:32.360
 Well, red red and yellow 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.360
 because in my opinion this corner and now we go to the next one that is here 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:39.569
 but there is a problem that instead of turning the cube 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:42.389
 and catch it for now we'll see the green 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:45.810
 we continue with the same one that we have taken for example we have taken the blue 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.219
 we follow with lasso as the president the problem is that we take and 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:53.159
 let's follow the drift 

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:55.499
 I belong entity the corner 

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:57.550
 up to the right 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.699
 we repeat the 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:00.870
 the algorithm 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.129
 m until that is allowed 

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:06.460
 from that point we are finishing we occupied 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.360
 let's keep going 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.559
 we climb 

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:12.939
 I love the right that they make us left their right hand 

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:15.259
 I think the right side goes down 

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:17.360
 let's see 1 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.199
 and there is the last one the last repetition we go down the right 

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:22.839
 if you are not left 

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:24.990
 we go up the right 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.240
 i turn actress and right 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.689
 reality 

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:30.050
 everyone 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.409
 we have the cube completely done 

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:35.849
 in another tutorial I will explain 

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:37.580
 how does the cube of 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.699
 four times four to play 

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:42.259
 they wore the following 

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:45.129
 gone in the back 

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:47.569
 thank you very much for your attention 

00:07:47.569 --> 00:07:50.069
 that silver carlos martín the day from madrid
