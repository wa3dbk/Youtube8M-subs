00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.770 
appearance I'm just kind of allowing the
carrots<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:02.890> onions<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.430> sweat<00:02:03.760> onto<00:02:04.450> the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
carrots and onions to sweat onto the

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.919 
carrots and onions to sweat onto the
rice<00:02:05.100> okay<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:07.649> for<00:02:08.649> our<00:02:08.679> liquid<00:02:09.569> part<00:02:10.569> of<00:02:10.750> the

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
rice okay so for our liquid part of the

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.420 
rice okay so for our liquid part of the
recipe<00:02:11.880> which<00:02:12.880> again<00:02:13.209> is<00:02:13.270> one<00:02:13.750> full<00:02:14.110> cup<00:02:14.430> of

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
recipe which again is one full cup of

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.699 
recipe which again is one full cup of
chicken<00:02:16.060> stock<00:02:17.100> we<00:02:18.100> showed<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.670> how<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:18.910> make

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
chicken stock we showed you how to make

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.790 
chicken stock we showed you how to make
so<00:02:20.709> I've<00:02:21.280> got<00:02:21.489> my<00:02:21.520> liquid<00:02:22.140> element<00:02:23.140> into<00:02:23.650> the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
so I've got my liquid element into the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.559 
so I've got my liquid element into the
equation<00:02:24.310> there<00:02:24.520> so<00:02:25.060> I'm<00:02:25.150> going<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.330> go<00:02:25.480> ahead

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
equation there so I'm going to go ahead

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.770 
equation there so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:25.720> crank<00:02:25.989> this<00:02:26.200> fire<00:02:26.530> up<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.970> will

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
and crank this fire up so that will

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.310 
and crank this fire up so that will
bring<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.080> out<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.380> boil<00:02:30.750> once<00:02:31.750> we<00:02:31.930> reach<00:02:32.140> a

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
bring it out to a boil once we reach a

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.930 
bring it out to a boil once we reach a
boil<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:32.800> want<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.130> crank<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.459> right<00:02:33.670> back<00:02:33.880> down

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
boil I want to crank it right back down

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.150 
boil I want to crank it right back down
so<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:34.450> we<00:02:34.630> achieved<00:02:34.959> just<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.320> simmer<00:02:35.590> at

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
so that we achieved just a simmer at

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.740 
so that we achieved just a simmer at
that<00:02:36.430> point<00:02:36.730> I'm<00:02:37.180> going<00:02:37.300> to<00:02:37.390> go<00:02:37.510> ahead<00:02:37.630> and

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
that point I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.190 
that point I'm going to go ahead and
cover<00:02:38.050> it<00:02:38.230> with<00:02:38.320> my<00:02:38.620> lid<00:02:38.890> here<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:40.019> we'll<00:02:41.019> let

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
cover it with my lid here and we'll let

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.380 
cover it with my lid here and we'll let
that<00:02:41.230> simmer<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:41.980> what<00:02:42.519> we're<00:02:42.700> allowing<00:02:43.150> the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
that simmer and what we're allowing the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.750 
that simmer and what we're allowing the
rise<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.870> do<00:02:44.050> is<00:02:44.350> to<00:02:44.530> soak<00:02:44.830> in<00:02:45.070> all<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.459> good

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
rise to do is to soak in all that good

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.430 
rise to do is to soak in all that good
rich<00:02:46.000> chicken<00:02:46.510> stock<00:02:46.750> that<00:02:46.959> we<00:02:47.050> made<00:02:47.260> from

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
rich chicken stock that we made from

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.620 
rich chicken stock that we made from
scratch<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:48.190> that's<00:02:48.880> what<00:02:49.060> makes<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.450> rice

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
scratch and that's what makes the rice

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.300 
scratch and that's what makes the rice
come<00:02:49.870> out<00:02:49.959> nice<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.200> tender<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:50.769> fluffy<00:02:51.280> but

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
come out nice and tender and fluffy but

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.009 
come out nice and tender and fluffy but
it's<00:02:51.550> all<00:02:51.700> in<00:02:51.850> just<00:02:52.030> using<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.450> right<00:02:52.630> amount

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
it's all in just using the right amount

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.509 
it's all in just using the right amount
of<00:02:53.080> ratio<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:53.739> that<00:02:53.769> you<00:02:53.980> don't<00:02:54.130> use<00:02:54.280> too<00:02:54.489> much

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
of ratio so that you don't use too much

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.300 
of ratio so that you don't use too much
liquid<00:02:54.910> or<00:02:55.150> too<00:02:55.300> little<00:02:55.510> so<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.950> need<00:02:57.100> to<00:02:57.190> pay

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
liquid or too little so you need to pay

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.309 
liquid or too little so you need to pay
attention<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.850> that<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.630> we'll<00:02:58.959> come<00:02:59.140> back

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
attention to that so we'll come back

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:01.710 
attention to that so we'll come back
here<00:02:59.560> in<00:02:59.650> just<00:02:59.800> a<00:02:59.950> bit<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.459> show<00:03:01.450> you<00:03:01.510> the

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
here in just a bit and show you the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.210 
here in just a bit and show you the
simmering<00:03:02.049> and<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.320> boiling<00:03:02.530> technique<00:03:03.070> that

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
simmering and the boiling technique that

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.790 
simmering and the boiling technique that
I<00:03:03.280> just<00:03:03.459> talked<00:03:03.700> about
