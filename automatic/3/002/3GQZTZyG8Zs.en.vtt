a<00:01:42.630> little<00:01:42.869> bit<00:01:42.960> thicker<00:01:43.259> then<00:01:43.979> when<00:01:44.490> you

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
a little bit thicker then when you

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.280 
a little bit thicker then when you
strain<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> little<00:01:45.600> bit<00:01:45.689> creamier<00:01:46.049> so

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290
