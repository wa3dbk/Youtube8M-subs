00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
then go back on the other side where you

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.319 
then go back on the other side where you
can't<00:00:40.980> see<00:00:41.250> them<00:00:41.490> and<00:00:41.730> you're<00:00:41.850> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.210> be

can't see them and you're going to be
drilling<00:00:42.690> for<00:00:43.560> your<00:00:43.740> concrete<00:00:44.400> rebar<00:00:44.880> epoxies

and<00:00:46.280> mark<00:00:47.280> them<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:47.880> as<00:00:48.120> simple<00:00:48.300> as<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.630> and

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
and mark them it's as simple as that and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.490 
and mark them it's as simple as that and
you<00:00:50.220> can<00:00:50.370> save<00:00:50.610> yourself<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:51.120> lot<00:00:51.150> of

frustration now you do not need to mark

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.810 
frustration now you do not need to mark
the<00:00:56.100> foundation<00:00:56.880> bolts<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.450> you<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:58.170> see

the foundation bolts that you can see

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.580 
the foundation bolts that you can see
however<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.210> wouldn't<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> bad<00:01:01.079> idea<00:01:01.110> to

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
however it wouldn't be a bad idea to

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.950 
however it wouldn't be a bad idea to
mark<00:01:02.070> them<00:01:02.309> anyway<00:01:03.210> or<00:01:04.079> to<00:01:04.679> lay<00:01:05.189> out<00:01:05.549> your

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960

times you will lay out and this has

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.010 
times you will lay out and this has
happened<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.799> me<00:01:22.889> I'll<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.579> layout<00:01:24.299> I'll

happened to me I'll just a layout I'll
mark<00:01:25.649> the<00:01:26.389> foundation<00:01:27.389> for<00:01:27.979> any<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.729> bolts

just go back three or four inches and
then<00:02:17.190> you're<00:02:17.730> going<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:17.910> make<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.480> Bay<00:02:18.900> a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
then you're going to make that Bay a

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.800 
then you're going to make that Bay a
little<00:02:20.040> smaller<00:02:20.430> but<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:21.090> next<00:02:21.420> one<00:02:21.600> you'll

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
little smaller but the next one you'll

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.320 
little smaller but the next one you'll
start<00:02:22.110> from<00:02:22.410> from<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.340> one<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:23.670> just<00:02:23.700> marked

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
start from from the one you just marked

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.870 
start from from the one you just marked
and<00:02:24.540> start<00:02:24.960> to<00:02:25.200> 24<00:02:25.830> inches<00:02:25.860> on<00:02:26.280> center<00:02:26.310> again

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
and start to 24 inches on center again

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.120 
and start to 24 inches on center again
but<00:02:27.090> make<00:02:27.420> sure<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.410> make<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.860> layout

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
but make sure that you make this layout

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.940 
but make sure that you make this layout
work<00:02:29.520> on<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.850> other<00:02:29.880> side<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.710> matches

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
work on the other side that it matches

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.820 
work on the other side that it matches
otherwise<00:02:32.580> you're<00:02:32.820> going<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.000> have<00:02:33.150> some

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
otherwise you're going to have some

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.800 
otherwise you're going to have some
unparallel<00:02:34.830> rebars<00:02:35.580> there<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.240> hope<00:02:36.390> this<00:02:36.630> tip

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
unparallel rebars there so hope this tip

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.180 
unparallel rebars there so hope this tip
helps<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.620> keep<00:02:38.340> watching<00:02:38.700> our<00:02:38.790> videos
