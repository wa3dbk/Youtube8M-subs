00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:58.780 

here<00:00:36.500> comes<00:00:36.740> I<00:00:37.070> think<00:00:37.100> it<00:00:37.280> hit<00:00:37.430> a<00:00:37.460> gap

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.000 

so<00:00:59.300> since<00:00:59.540> we<00:00:59.660> don't<00:00:59.690> have<00:00:59.870> a<00:00:59.989> choice<00:01:00.260> here<00:01:00.590> but

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
so since we don't have a choice here but

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.430 
so since we don't have a choice here but
to<00:01:01.399> drill<00:01:01.760> our<00:01:01.940> hole<00:01:02.149> in<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.690> middle<00:01:03.020> that's

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
to drill our hole in the middle that's

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.860 
to drill our hole in the middle that's
where<00:01:03.559> we're<00:01:03.800> starting<00:01:04.070> with<00:01:04.430> drill<00:01:04.690> fill<00:01:05.690> all

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
where we're starting with drill fill all

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.350 
where we're starting with drill fill all
the<00:01:05.990> way<00:01:06.110> down<00:01:06.350> up<00:01:06.740> to<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.040> middle<00:01:07.360> then

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
the way down up to the middle then

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.930 
the way down up to the middle then
reinsert<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:08.990> holes<00:01:09.200> up<00:01:09.440> and<00:01:09.890> fill<00:01:10.640> from<00:01:10.820> the

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
reinsert the holes up and fill from the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.430 
reinsert the holes up and fill from the
top<00:01:11.150> down<00:01:11.420> back<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:11.780> our<00:01:12.080> hole<00:01:12.500> in<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:12.770> middle

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
top down back to our hole in the middle

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.230 
top down back to our hole in the middle
full<00:01:15.440> cavity<00:01:15.710> like<00:01:16.100> this<00:01:16.369> 16<00:01:16.850> inches<00:01:17.090> on

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
full cavity like this 16 inches on

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.030 
full cavity like this 16 inches on
center<00:01:17.300> it<00:01:17.780> takes<00:01:17.990> about<00:01:18.140> four<00:01:18.470> minutes<00:01:18.500> start

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
center it takes about four minutes start

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:53.929 
center it takes about four minutes start
to<00:01:19.160> finish

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.310 

and<00:01:54.390> then<00:01:54.540> we're<00:01:54.689> filling<00:01:55.020> from<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.229> bottom

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
and then we're filling from the bottom

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.859 
and then we're filling from the bottom
up<00:01:55.860> insulation<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.850> moving<00:01:57.180> up<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.450> cavity

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
up insulation is moving up this cavity

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.469 
up insulation is moving up this cavity
right<00:01:58.079> now<00:01:58.289> so<00:01:59.070> after<00:01:59.250> we<00:01:59.549> insert<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.060> tube<00:02:00.270> up

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
right now so after we insert the tube up

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.990 
right now so after we insert the tube up
to<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> top<00:02:00.960> plate<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:02.340> won't<00:02:02.520> take<00:02:02.729> me<00:02:02.850> as

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
to the top plate it won't take me as

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.510 
to the top plate it won't take me as
long<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.600> pack<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.560> down<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> middle<00:02:05.220> as<00:02:05.340> it

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
long to pack it down to the middle as it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:14.490 
long to pack it down to the middle as it
does<00:02:05.700> from<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.970> bottom

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.080 

she's<00:02:15.500> backing<00:02:15.980> out<00:02:16.130> now<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:16.670> pull<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.000> out

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
she's backing out now so I pull it out

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.180 
she's backing out now so I pull it out
about<00:02:17.390> 46<00:02:17.960> inches<00:02:18.080> at<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.440> time<00:02:18.710> until<00:02:19.010> she

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
about 46 inches at a time until she

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:43.270 
about 46 inches at a time until she
stall

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.680 

got<00:02:44.280> marks<00:02:44.610> on<00:02:44.790> our<00:02:44.820> hose<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:45.540> know

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
got marks on our hose so we know

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.660 
got marks on our hose so we know
approximately<00:02:45.810> how<00:02:46.770> much<00:02:46.890> hose<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
approximately how much hose is in the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.120 
approximately how much hose is in the
wall<00:02:48.350> now<00:02:49.350> we're<00:02:49.500> gonna<00:02:49.620> go<00:02:49.800> up<00:02:52.010> see<00:02:53.010> it's

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
wall now we're gonna go up see it's

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:01.160 
wall now we're gonna go up see it's
packed<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.580> little<00:02:53.730> bit<00:02:53.970> already

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.809 

why<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.830> towel<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:03.300> towel<00:03:03.569> is<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:05.580> prevent

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
why the towel the towel is to prevent

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.960 
why the towel the towel is to prevent
the<00:03:06.000> air<00:03:06.180> with<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:07.370> cellulose<00:03:08.370> blown<00:03:08.730> out

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
the air with the cellulose blown out

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.260 
the air with the cellulose blown out
gets<00:03:09.270> a<00:03:09.360> little<00:03:09.540> dusty<00:03:13.940> inevitably<00:03:14.940> when<00:03:15.180> you

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
gets a little dusty inevitably when you

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.810 
gets a little dusty inevitably when you
do<00:03:15.420> several<00:03:15.750> stud<00:03:16.530> cavities<00:03:17.040> you're<00:03:17.370> gonna

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
do several stud cavities you're gonna

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.970 
do several stud cavities you're gonna
pull<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.420> about<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.720> too<00:03:18.840> quick<00:03:19.140> tell<00:03:19.890> it

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
pull that to about it too quick tell it

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.500 
pull that to about it too quick tell it
will<00:03:20.100> help<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.490> little<00:03:20.610> bit<00:03:20.850> but<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.300> probably

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
will help a little bit but you probably

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.180 
will help a little bit but you probably
get<00:03:21.750> blasted<00:03:22.020> with<00:03:22.260> some<00:03:22.560> cellulose<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:25.160> see<00:03:26.160> a

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
get blasted with some cellulose I see a

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.250 
get blasted with some cellulose I see a
bunch<00:03:28.040> yeah<00:03:29.450> this<00:03:30.450> one's<00:03:30.660> packed<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.140> I've

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
bunch yeah this one's packed and I've
