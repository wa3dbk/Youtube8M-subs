00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.760
 let's start the computer first 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.799
 start loading the motherboard click 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.730
 far you get to the menu of the buzz i version 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.520
 wheels of 3 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.529
 you may have another zombie house and 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.560
 do tweaker lower factor 10 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.240
 desirable 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.050
 set enabled ie we set 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.270
 settings that may change 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.710
 raise the frequency of work to 2 and 8 and 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.559
 reduce the frequency of the tire so that it is 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:47.760
 roughly similar to that standard 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:53.309
 loss we press them 10 we keep going 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:56.219
 restart the computer if suddenly you are on 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.559
 confuse with your options and squeeze 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.170
 something bigger you won't have it 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.470
 load simply but to 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.159
 you can easily fix this moment 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.280
 get rid of it if you if you have it 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.210
 not loaded further than the motherboard 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.840
 will have to open the lid 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.710
 there is a shiny little battery on the mother 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.920
 such and 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.140
 take out then insert and thereby 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.610
 reset the bios settings and everything will have 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.610
 you work on the standard settings 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.620
 here 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.210
 as we see already 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:44.240
 loaded now let's see how much 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.240
 increased strength to dive normally 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.600
 as we see 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.259
 the increase was significantly noticeable so it was 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:13.080
 two and two i have now 2 and 8 all 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.080
 thanks, bye
