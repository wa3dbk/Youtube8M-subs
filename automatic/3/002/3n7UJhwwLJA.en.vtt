00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello that's true but 73 we end up 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.849
 for a new tour of France with 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:12.960
 thibaut pinot and the fdj team 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:16.219
 so you see I have red anthony who 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.219
 is yellow jersey that won the prologue 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.850
 if yes then be told by an arrhythmia 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.150
 behind 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.619
 so that's fine then I have my banana 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.039
 but boonen that ends in the bars 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.279
 are thoroughly I rarely saw a bar 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.219
 green as beautiful at the end of the stage so I 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.380
 do not know if it's me who remember 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.770
 more or if it's really exceptional 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.290
 we do not remember a bar 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.690
 green rushes just before 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.480
 the arrival it's still good 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.739
 augury 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.110
 we will see how react the ibpt has 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.690
 joined reds 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.070
 so here it remains a gel we have six 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.850
 kilometers from the finish the breakaway 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.570
 ahead is dead in the spin spin at 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.530
 trough 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.530
 hunter it's over 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.080
 so now you have to save time 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.080
 on froome 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.390
 after accelerates a little bit 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:28.850
 the katusha is leading the way with BNC 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:30.250
 rally coup dias five kilometers from 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.240
 the arrival 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.070
 so the last two kilometers are 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.470
 on the hill not super violent but 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:45.979
 in side to make a small gap when 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:48.140
 even the clash can not be better so 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:53.479
 mongel you that take it to a 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:57.410
 kilometer 3 3 basically so it has to be 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.420
 I leave from the beginning of the coast and that 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.130
 I manage my red 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:08.899
 after that it starts to roll hard 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:10.789
 as a year game will put two bars if I have 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.940
 come on we'll be two and a half that'll go 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.940
 well 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.350
 cramped km 4 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.920
 if there is hot behind like embers 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:36.950
 gilbert also the punchers are there I 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.490
 think sanchez not be far 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.490
 valverde either 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.440
 at the yellow bar by against it goes down 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:52.390
 pretty quickly buying three bars 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.390
 almost and it's already going down a little bit 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.290
 I 'm going to take advantage of the hairpin bend at 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:16.760
 left to attack even from the first there 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.760
 I do not know how I'm going to do 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:26.000
 I rather the second but at a bar 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.000
 these two lÃ¤nder is there I attack 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:36.910
 I do not fear just a little 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.910
 hole 1.5 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.600
 I take my young gel well do 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.600
 almost thoroughly 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.220
 and then we'll see what happens 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.020
 I'm going to put myself at a bar so that 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:04.100
 the red bar go back a bit but I 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.100
 would not feel much of a gap 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:20.330
 and I dig anyway 10 12 14 16 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.260
 so that's all good against that 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:29.380
 go down 700 m so here I want to put to 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:34.690
 bottom bar where I finished 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.690
 i'm waiting 500 years yeah 400 i'm waiting 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.680
 400 summary 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.820
 it's a bit early shard a little 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.380
 to the gesture she quietly and I 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.360
 will need about ten seconds when 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:02.590
 even 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:04.510
 short for the 8 to 8 and 16 on the 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.240
 favorites so that's perfect 8 / room 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:13.330
 yann gilbert garonne fresh and valverde 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:16.240
 and 16 on chavanel wants to close martin 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:22.170
 will make nibali wiggins and company this 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:24.280
 morning even on sanchez wiggins taramae 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:29.940
 yeah after everyone invented 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.940
 a second 32 seconds for vinokourov 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:36.810
 the early conical breccia 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.789
 37 green lady 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:50.829
 like a lot of small groups getting together 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:52.269
 are trained good brief so here is a little 

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:53.999
 mountain point and more for the 

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:57.309
 stage victory 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:06:02.529
 the points of the best green jersey 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:06:04.569
 young is a team not too bad so 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:07.859
 in general to fourth pony at 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.859
 ranking of teams to ten seconds 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:14.139
 anthony roux takes the white jersey bah 

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:16.899
 this is great pino takes the shirt 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:21.759
 green ok it will not have to but it's very 

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:23.739
 well pineau point of cassava patois and 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:25.829
 anthony red remains in yellow and more 

00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:30.999
 it's great too 

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:34.659
 and our friend pinault is at 28 seconds 

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:38.379
 so it is 5 seconds from evans is to 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:43.449
 17 seconds from chris froome to 16 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:45.689

00:06:56.739 --> 00:07:00.969

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:10.929
 that's the problem anthony roux has 

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:15.639
