dear<00:01:01.510> wine<00:01:01.659> doors<00:01:01.989> on<00:01:02.170> him<00:01:02.319> just<00:01:03.129> so<00:01:03.249> it's

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
dear wine doors on him just so it's

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.020 
dear wine doors on him just so it's
harder<00:01:03.670> to<00:01:03.699> break<00:01:03.909> out<00:01:04.170> flip<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.290> switch<00:01:05.530> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
harder to break out flip the switch and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.960 
harder to break out flip the switch and
down<00:01:07.030> he<00:01:07.210> goes<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:10.000> there<00:01:10.570> goes<00:01:10.750> the<00:01:10.900> DNT<00:01:11.970> now

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
down he goes and there goes the DNT now

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.490 
down he goes and there goes the DNT now

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
here place the second one pretty easy

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.590 
here place the second one pretty easy
circuits<00:01:32.500> to<00:01:32.650> create<00:01:32.950> I'll<00:01:33.190> just<00:01:33.450> take<00:01:34.450> up

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
circuits to create I'll just take up

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.660 
circuits to create I'll just take up
here<00:01:34.840> circuit<00:01:35.740> goes<00:01:35.860> behind<00:01:36.220> this<00:01:36.370> first

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
here circuit goes behind this first

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.940 
here circuit goes behind this first
switch<00:01:36.970> all<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.780> way<00:01:37.870> down<00:01:38.080> here<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:38.620> opens

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
switch all the way down here and opens

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.920 
switch all the way down here and opens
the<00:01:39.010> first<00:01:39.310> door<00:01:42.390> can<00:01:43.390> just<00:01:43.570> see<00:01:43.690> it<00:01:43.780> opening

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
the first door can just see it opening

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.530 
the first door can just see it opening
and<00:01:44.260> closing<00:01:44.470> on<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.830> right-hand<00:01:45.190> side<00:01:45.280> there

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
and closing on the right-hand side there

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.430 
and closing on the right-hand side there
leave<00:01:46.540> it<00:01:46.690> open<00:01:47.050> circuit<00:01:47.650> on<00:01:47.740> this<00:01:47.890> side<00:01:48.100> goes

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
leave it open circuit on this side goes

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.600 
leave it open circuit on this side goes
all<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:50.470> way<00:01:50.650> up<00:01:50.770> here<00:01:50.920> has<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.250> go<00:01:51.370> slightly

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
all the way up here has to go slightly

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.760 
all the way up here has to go slightly
higher<00:01:52.000> than<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.420> first<00:01:52.660> door<00:01:52.930> or<00:01:53.200> it<00:01:53.590> will

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
higher than the first door or it will

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.430 
higher than the first door or it will
open<00:01:54.040> both<00:01:54.430> doors<00:01:54.730> which<00:01:55.390> you<00:01:55.840> could<00:01:56.050> use<00:01:56.230> once

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
open both doors which you could use once

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.110 
open both doors which you could use once
okay<00:01:56.740> to<00:01:56.830> open<00:01:56.860> both<00:01:57.220> doors<00:01:57.490> but<00:01:57.880> then<00:01:58.000> you'd

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
okay to open both doors but then you'd

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.550 
okay to open both doors but then you'd
have<00:01:58.150> to<00:01:58.390> be<00:01:58.510> perfect<00:01:58.900> with<00:01:58.990> your<00:01:59.020> timing

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
have to be perfect with your timing

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.490 
have to be perfect with your timing
because<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.490> second<00:02:00.910> door<00:02:01.200> I'm<00:02:02.200> straight

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
because the second door I'm straight

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.540 
because the second door I'm straight
that<00:02:02.680> now<00:02:02.890> i<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:04.750> get<00:02:04.870> it<00:02:04.990> yep<00:02:05.280> see<00:02:06.280> on<00:02:06.400> the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
that now i can get it yep see on the

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.980 
that now i can get it yep see on the
left<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:07.600> door<00:02:07.810> opening<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.200> closing

all right now I've shown you the actual

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.390 
all right now I've shown you the actual
mechanisms<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.960> door<00:02:13.140> we<00:02:13.890> are<00:02:14.040> going<00:02:14.250> to

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
mechanisms of the door we are going to

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.310 
mechanisms of the door we are going to
go<00:02:14.430> into<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.820> actual<00:02:15.120> inner<00:02:15.570> workings<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
go into the actual inner workings of the

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.110

this<00:02:28.380> here<00:02:28.650> is<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.340> actual<00:02:29.670> redstone<00:02:30.390> circuit

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
this here is the actual redstone circuit

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.540 
this here is the actual redstone circuit
that<00:02:30.780> sets<00:02:30.990> off<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.200> trap<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:32.040> may<00:02:32.220> have<00:02:32.340> seen

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
that sets off the trap you may have seen

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.990 
that sets off the trap you may have seen
it<00:02:32.760> from<00:02:33.330> above<00:02:34.370> I'll<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:35.580> show<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.790> that

it from above I'll just show you that

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.250 
it from above I'll just show you that
here<00:02:36.270> it's<00:02:37.340> right<00:02:38.340> by<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.520> doors<00:02:39.260> pretty

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
here it's right by the doors pretty

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.310 
here it's right by the doors pretty
simple<00:02:41.090> since<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.210> might<00:02:42.720> want<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:42.990> turn<00:02:43.140> this

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
simple since you might want to turn this

off when you reset obviously into place
your<00:02:47.310> block<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.730> TNT<00:02:48.300> will<00:02:48.600> go<00:02:48.780> right<00:02:49.110> in<00:02:49.380> line

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
your block of TNT will go right in line

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.590 
your block of TNT will go right in line
with<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:50.010> circuit<00:02:50.550> just<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.150> make<00:02:51.180> sure<00:02:51.330> you

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
with this circuit just to make sure you

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.620 
with this circuit just to make sure you
set<00:02:51.810> up<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.050> trap<00:02:52.260> now<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.730> can<00:02:53.850> use<00:02:54.060> sand<00:02:54.330> or

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
set up the trap now you can use sand or

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.550 
set up the trap now you can use sand or
gravel<00:02:55.160> to<00:02:56.360> create<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.420> trap<00:02:57.630> here<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:58.320> means

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
gravel to create the trap here it means

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.280 
gravel to create the trap here it means
that<00:02:58.710> when<00:02:59.100> this<00:02:59.460> GNT<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.720> triggered<00:03:01.080> by<00:03:01.110> the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
that when this GNT is triggered by the

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.670 
that when this GNT is triggered by the
redstone<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.850> TNT<00:03:03.300> will<00:03:03.450> fall<00:03:03.750> itself<00:03:04.200> into

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
redstone the TNT will fall itself into

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.360

this<00:03:04.860> obsidian<00:03:05.520> cage<00:03:05.970> we<00:03:06.330> have<00:03:06.510> down<00:03:06.720> here<00:03:06.930> and

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
this obsidian cage we have down here and

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.580 
this obsidian cage we have down here and
also<00:03:08.370> anything<00:03:09.180> on<00:03:09.300> top<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:10.290> falls

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
also anything on top of it that falls

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.850 
also anything on top of it that falls
will<00:03:11.070> fall<00:03:11.310> as<00:03:11.490> well<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:12.050> gravel<00:03:13.050> perfect

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
will fall as well so gravel perfect

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.740 
will fall as well so gravel perfect
choice<00:03:14.040> it's<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.400> closest<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.120> stone<00:03:15.480> we

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
choice it's the closest to stone we

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.660 
choice it's the closest to stone we
could<00:03:15.930> get<00:03:16.110> you<00:03:16.890> could<00:03:17.040> simply<00:03:17.250> make<00:03:17.490> your

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
could get you could simply make your

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.640 
could get you could simply make your
floor<00:03:17.970> out<00:03:18.180> of<00:03:18.300> gravel<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.320> would<00:03:19.500> make

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
floor out of gravel and that would make

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.850 
floor out of gravel and that would make
it<00:03:19.680> less<00:03:19.830> suspicious<00:03:20.550> that<00:03:21.450> will<00:03:21.840> leave<00:03:22.650> all

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
it less suspicious that will leave all

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.340 
it less suspicious that will leave all
the<00:03:23.120> minor<00:03:24.120> details<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:25.580> ya<00:03:26.990> now<00:03:27.990> I'll<00:03:28.200> go

the minor details to ya now I'll go

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.870 
the minor details to ya now I'll go
right<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:28.950> bottom<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.460> trap<00:03:29.700> I

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
right to the bottom of the trap I

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.730 
right to the bottom of the trap I
haven't<00:03:30.300> actually<00:03:30.390> dug<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.020> traffic<00:03:31.410> stream

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
haven't actually dug the traffic stream

friend now here's what it actually looks

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.740 
friend now here's what it actually looks
like<00:03:45.060> inside<00:03:45.770> when<00:03:46.770> the<00:03:46.890> TNT<00:03:47.430> falls<00:03:47.850> you<00:03:48.570> will

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
like inside when the TNT falls you will

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.990 
like inside when the TNT falls you will
need<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:48.930> reset<00:03:49.380> this<00:03:49.530> every<00:03:49.830> time<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.850> will

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
need to reset this every time you will

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.870 
need to reset this every time you will
place<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.600> ladder<00:03:51.920> around<00:03:52.920> halfway<00:03:53.490> down

place the ladder around halfway down

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.800 
place the ladder around halfway down
this<00:03:54.090> hole<00:03:54.770> that<00:03:55.770> you<00:03:55.920> will<00:03:56.130> have<00:03:56.250> dug

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
this hole that you will have dug

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.570 
this hole that you will have dug
directly<00:03:57.810> below<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.320> trap<00:03:58.560> now<00:03:58.800> the<00:03:58.860> TNT<00:03:59.430> will

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
directly below the trap now the TNT will

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.330 
directly below the trap now the TNT will
hit<00:03:59.820> this<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.300> so<00:04:00.630> will<00:04:00.810> all<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:00.960> the<00:04:01.140> sand<00:04:01.530> and

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
hit this and so will all of the sand and

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.550 
hit this and so will all of the sand and
any<00:04:02.550> blocks<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.270> may<00:04:03.420> have<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.410> will

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
any blocks you may have and it will

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.770 
any blocks you may have and it will
explode<00:04:04.830> it<00:04:05.700> will<00:04:05.880> simply<00:04:06.209> just<00:04:06.360> explode

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
explode it will simply just explode

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.900 
explode it will simply just explode
