00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
this weekend i mean i was obviously

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.750 
this weekend i mean i was obviously
rolling<00:06:19.910> down<00:06:20.210> felt<00:06:20.510> like<00:06:20.660> i<00:06:20.780> was<00:06:20.960> playing<00:06:21.229> on

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
rolling down felt like i was playing on

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.210 
rolling down felt like i was playing on
considering<00:06:22.760> a<00:06:23.600> lot<00:06:23.750> of<00:06:23.840> backgammon<00:06:24.199> and<00:06:24.590> I

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
considering a lot of backgammon and I

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.659 
considering a lot of backgammon and I
mean<00:06:25.820> in<00:06:26.000> the<00:06:26.419> end<00:06:26.510> it<00:06:26.720> turned<00:06:26.900> out<00:06:27.080> good<00:06:27.669> we

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669 
mean in the end it turned out good we

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:31.060 
mean in the end it turned out good we
had<00:06:28.850> that<00:06:28.970> we<00:06:29.030> had<00:06:29.300> the<00:06:29.449> leader<00:06:29.830> lead<00:06:30.830> the

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
had that we had the leader lead the

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.659 
had that we had the leader lead the
basically<00:06:31.940> the<00:06:32.060> entire<00:06:32.300> way<00:06:32.810> so<00:06:33.229> I<00:06:33.830> think

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
basically the entire way so I think

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:36.400 
basically the entire way so I think
everybody<00:06:35.240> on<00:06:35.389> the<00:06:35.479> Danish<00:06:35.750> team<00:06:35.960> was<00:06:36.139> pretty

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
everybody on the Danish team was pretty

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.610 
everybody on the Danish team was pretty
confident<00:06:36.889> then<00:06:37.130> I<00:06:37.789> turned<00:06:38.479> out<00:06:38.630> before<00:06:39.020> so<00:06:39.470> in

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
confident then I turned out before so in

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.439 
confident then I turned out before so in
the<00:06:39.740> final<00:06:40.099> match<00:06:40.190> was<00:06:40.490> it<00:06:40.669> the<00:06:40.789> lead<00:06:41.000> do<00:06:41.360> you

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:41.449 
the final match was it the lead do you

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:42.820 
the final match was it the lead do you
have<00:06:41.690> coming<00:06:42.020> in<00:06:42.199> their<00:06:42.380> help<00:06:42.560> together

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
have coming in their help together

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.159 
have coming in their help together
sometimes<00:06:43.639> in<00:06:43.820> back<00:06:44.000> in<00:06:44.180> other<00:06:44.360> words<00:06:44.599> it's

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169 
sometimes in back in other words it's

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:47.080 
sometimes in back in other words it's
easier<00:06:45.500> to<00:06:45.710> play<00:06:45.919> from<00:06:46.130> behind<00:06:46.280> because<00:06:46.940> you

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
easier to play from behind because you

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.820 
easier to play from behind because you
can<00:06:47.240> gamble<00:06:47.419> a<00:06:47.720> little<00:06:47.840> bit<00:06:48.080> more<00:06:48.259> and<00:06:48.560> you<00:06:48.680> can

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
can gamble a little bit more and you can

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.860 
can gamble a little bit more and you can
double<00:06:48.949> the<00:06:49.220> earlier<00:06:49.490> children<00:06:49.940> but<00:06:50.090> I<00:06:50.360> think

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
double the earlier children but I think

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.460 
double the earlier children but I think
we<00:06:51.440> made<00:06:51.590> some<00:06:51.620> good<00:06:51.889> decisions<00:06:51.949> I<00:06:53.260> mean<00:06:54.260> we

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470 
we made some good decisions I mean we

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.460 
we made some good decisions I mean we
just<00:06:54.620> held<00:06:55.099> on<00:06:55.280> to<00:06:55.520> leave<00:06:55.699> and<00:06:56.030> on<00:06:56.990> a<00:06:57.020> nice<00:06:57.229> and

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:57.470 
just held on to leave and on a nice and

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.909 
just held on to leave and on a nice and
black<00:06:57.590> first<00:06:58.580> game<00:06:58.760> is<00:06:58.970> crucial<00:06:59.389> yeah<00:07:00.139> it<00:07:00.710> was

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 
black first game is crucial yeah it was

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:05.290 
black first game is crucial yeah it was
very<00:07:01.150> tense<00:07:02.150> back<00:07:03.050> to<00:07:03.199> walk<00:07:03.530> later<00:07:04.090> we<00:07:05.090> had<00:07:05.150> a

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
very tense back to walk later we had a

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.149 
very tense back to walk later we had a
winning<00:07:05.539> so<00:07:05.780> gotta<00:07:06.050> have<00:07:06.229> night<00:07:06.440> one<00:07:06.740> which

00:07:07.149 --> 00:07:07.159 
winning so gotta have night one which

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:11.080 
winning so gotta have night one which
sort<00:07:07.490> of<00:07:07.580> like<00:07:08.919> we<00:07:09.919> could<00:07:10.070> easily<00:07:10.190> cause<00:07:10.729> more

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.090 
sort of like we could easily cause more

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.490 
sort of like we could easily cause more
points<00:07:13.330> we<00:07:14.330> got<00:07:14.510> over<00:07:14.630> that<00:07:14.900> hump<00:07:15.139> it<00:07:15.349> from

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500 
points we got over that hump it from

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.640 
points we got over that hump it from
there

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:16.650 
there

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.370 
there
did<00:07:17.550> you<00:07:17.639> play<00:07:17.850> together<00:07:18.060> well<00:07:18.389> as<00:07:18.479> a<00:07:18.509> team<00:07:18.600> I

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.380 
did you play together well as a team I

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.379 
did you play together well as a team I
actually<00:07:20.009> think<00:07:20.280> I<00:07:20.580> mean<00:07:20.729> you<00:07:20.880> can<00:07:21.030> see<00:07:21.210> more

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:21.389 
actually think I mean you can see more

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:22.909 
actually think I mean you can see more
salt<00:07:21.660> later<00:07:21.840> but<00:07:22.110> I<00:07:22.139> actually<00:07:22.350> think<00:07:22.650> that

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 
salt later but I actually think that

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:26.710 
salt later but I actually think that
both<00:07:23.520> teams<00:07:24.470> performing<00:07:25.470> at<00:07:25.650> night<00:07:25.889> well<00:07:26.160> no

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 
both teams performing at night well no

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.050 
both teams performing at night well no
doubt<00:07:27.770> gospellers<00:07:28.770> gets<00:07:29.130> the<00:07:29.280> VIP<00:07:29.639> for<00:07:30.000> a

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 
doubt gospellers gets the VIP for a

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.439 
doubt gospellers gets the VIP for a
tasty<00:07:30.539> we<00:07:31.199> didn't<00:07:32.070> feel<00:07:32.310> the<00:07:32.490> best<00:07:32.699> team<00:07:32.940> they

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:33.449 
tasty we didn't feel the best team they

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:35.240 
tasty we didn't feel the best team they
probably<00:07:33.810> didn't<00:07:34.289> either<00:07:34.410> if<00:07:34.770> they<00:07:34.949> could

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:35.250 
probably didn't either if they could

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.210 
probably didn't either if they could
choose<00:07:35.520> all<00:07:35.789> over<00:07:36.030> but<00:07:36.360> the<00:07:36.560> only<00:07:37.560> real<00:07:37.919> bet

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.220 
choose all over but the only real bet

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.749 
choose all over but the only real bet
that<00:07:38.430> was<00:07:38.610> made<00:07:38.789> this<00:07:39.090> event<00:07:40.520> they<00:07:41.520> made

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 
that was made this event they made

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:45.230 
that was made this event they made
twenty<00:07:42.180> cents<00:07:42.509> of<00:07:42.630> the<00:07:42.720> day<00:07:43.160> so<00:07:44.160> it<00:07:44.639> seems<00:07:44.880> like

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240
