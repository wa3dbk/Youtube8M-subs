00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.710
 let's talk now about the galaxy be the 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.710
 perfect complement to the menu of 3 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.570
 as you can see here is a device 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.790
 a complement 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.710
 very elegant we have incorporated a 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.840
 16 inch screen superamoled 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.960
 protected by a metallic bezel in addition 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.240
 a 19 megapixel camera with 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.130
 autofocus and a microphone and speaker 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.539
 incorporated with all this we could 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.239
 manage basic functionalities 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.950
 of the nou without the need to remove it from 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.800
 pro from the pocket we can also 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.260
 manage a series of applications and 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.200
 notifications and this is the interface that 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.969
 we could find as we appear l 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.890
 galaxy gyÃ¶r with our name 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.809
 Well, here we have what is the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.910
 charging station 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.390
 here in what we would find the galaxy 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.400
 gear and then connect to a port 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.520
 I will be the food 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.990
 and how can we match it in the 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.870
 charging base to the charging station and 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.060
 an nfc tag I would bring the 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.770
 terminal to the nfc tag 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.470
 then the terminal would recognize that there 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.400
 a galaxy gear that could be connected 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.100
 would activate the bluetooth and start 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.680
 look for devices at the garish gala 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.330
 for connection I would find the galaxy 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.180
 leader and I would have it 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.180
 matched I'm going to put myself in the chair 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.860
 how he managed the galaxy watched from the 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.140
 own galaxy we can manage in 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.060
 the rally followed there is an application 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.820
 who is brother and sister jr 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.439
 where we can verify all the 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.200
 options that we have one of the options 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.570
 is the option of not in this because we can 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.890
 change all the ceip that has the 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.080
 clock 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.420
 we can change and you see that the change 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.970
 it does otherwise matica we can go 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.970
 changing all types 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.380
 let's go back to the typical one like me 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.119
 I like it more 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.619
 we can also manage the 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.480
 applications that are running in the 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.370
 karachi I here you see some of those that 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.500
 there are at the moment we can mark them 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.599
 as favorites and good to order them 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.880
 according to the order that we consider it 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.599
 timely 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.220
 we will have a store called 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.860
 samsung apps in which there will be 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.989
 applications to install in the galaxy 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.250
 air here good as there will be applications 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.550
 of third parties that may run with 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.040
 our our galaxy also 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.500
 You might sleep I will remove the 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.050
 galaxy gear and when I get up then no 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.980
 find him 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:45.930
 with the galaxy no 3 tell you to look at 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.930
 that moment the galaxy seeks 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.390
 What else can we do good? 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.780
 from here we can manage all the 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.150
 settings that can be unlocked the 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.790
 mobile device from from the galaxy 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.040
 and manage what kind of notifications 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.230
 we will get to give sillero in 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.620
 this case then of course the basic 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.560
 calls and other messages as well 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.600
 we can manage my social networks my 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.500
 mail or if I have any alarm my 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.940
 calendar 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.370
 all this is also managed from 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.870
 the galaxy I may be able to receive these 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.870
 notifications on the crochet 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.250
 we can also configure the key 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.510
 physics of the galaxy gear to make a 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.069
 series of actions in this case is 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.989
 configured so that at the moment that 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.989
 I press the action key 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:46.770
 call nacho sounds all recognizes that 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.600
 I want to call nacho samson then it's 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.910
 voice translates this into actions that 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:58.530
 you have to make the phone and 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:04:00.900
 automatically made a call worth 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.370
 If nacho answered, we could 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.370
 speak perfectly with him 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.110
 in the same way that we can perform 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:15.780
 calls I've seen unlocked in the 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.040
 locker with voice then good then 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.140
 we could manage new here 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.090
 we have a store of all the settings 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.820
 we can modify the volumes on 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.370
 sound or the intensity of the screen 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.520
 what actions or how do we navigate the 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.490
 menu in a very simple way 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.889
 this movement indicates that it turns towards 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.780
 back move me to the sides I 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.620
 I'm moving through the back menu 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.780
 backward 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.270
 I'm on my watch I want to use the camera 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.069
 from the clock I make this movement and already 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.200
 I'm in camera mode to make a 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.640
 Photography 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:52.110
 and I already do the photograph directly 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:55.710
 I can also record video in hd up 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.569
 10 seconds of video I can record the 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.929
 video 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:04.339
 we can also go to the gallery and see 

00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:06.509
 all the videos we have 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:13.229
 you see all this is stored in the 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:14.939
 galaxy we go backwards also then 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.770
 good can come in the case where 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:18.509
 I want to make a call from the 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.499
 galaxy I can do it well from the 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:28.309
 own contact or I can do it 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:28.309
 from scratch 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:42.569
 another option is also started 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.069
 that we have to manage from the 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:47.060
 galaxy lyon is the voice note 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:49.180
 I can record a voice note 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.180
 ah 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:59.890
 we are testing the new samsung the 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:03.910
 voice memo is saved and directly 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:07.570
 transmits to the galaxy we do not go out we see that 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:10.020
 at the top it has been received 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.020
 voice note 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.620
 besides having the voice note what 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.740
 does is a transcript of the note of 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.740
 voice 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:33.480
 We are trying new samsung galaxy not 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:35.550
 receive an SMS 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.560
 galaxy can also manage the 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.130
 Chinese people receive them and at the same time 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.710
 receives from Wales and we can see the 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:46.370
 notification we see the message and we can 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.270
 force the device to see the message 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.000
 directly now on the device it 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:56.550
 see the screaming face message with 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.820
 ticbeat we can also manage 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.290
 incoming calls 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.290
 if we receive a call 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.490
 we can download our preparation 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.139
 and speaking from the galaxy itself we have 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.900
 different ways we can put new 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:19.639
 speaker with silent mode and this 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:23.090
 way we will only go at the time 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:25.530
 to approach the stands 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.910
 this is not something a fan of 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.680
 possibilities from one's own hands 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:32.190
 free and without the need to have 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.630
 Pending carrying the phone or not and 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:37.250
 well we can manage all the 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.250
 calls from the galaxy itself lyon
