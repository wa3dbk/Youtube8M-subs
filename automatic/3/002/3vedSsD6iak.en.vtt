something<00:04:07.510> like<00:04:07.660> brush<00:04:08.019> as<00:04:08.380> well<00:04:08.650> so<00:04:08.890> I<00:04:09.100> chose

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
something like brush as well so I chose

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.140 
something like brush as well so I chose
this<00:04:09.730> black<00:04:10.209> cat<00:04:10.540> brush<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.700> make<00:04:12.700> sure<00:04:12.880> your

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
forgot discover is still on black and

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.060 
forgot discover is still on black and
then<00:04:15.340> create<00:04:15.640> a<00:04:15.790> new<00:04:16.120> layer<00:04:16.329> and<00:04:16.769> can<00:04:17.769> call<00:04:17.979> the

doesn't look very good but when I do the
same<00:04:30.530> thing<00:04:30.770> again<00:04:31.010> and<00:04:31.220> make<00:04:31.400> sure<00:04:31.550> I'm<00:04:31.700> on<00:04:31.850> my

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030

and<00:04:35.470> do<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.560> same<00:04:36.740> thing<00:04:36.980> again<00:04:37.220> set<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:37.640> mode

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
and do the same thing again set the mode

to<00:04:38.290> saturation<00:04:40.450> it<00:04:41.450> looks<00:04:41.780> like<00:04:41.990> the<00:04:42.260> pain

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
to saturation it looks like the pain

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.800 
to saturation it looks like the pain
test<00:04:43.130> being<00:04:43.370> stripped<00:04:43.730> of<00:04:43.940> where<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.420> camp<00:04:44.660> is

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
test being stripped of where the camp is

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.350 
test being stripped of where the camp is
so<00:04:45.500> that's<00:04:46.010> basically<00:04:46.250> all<00:04:46.670> there<00:04:46.760> is<00:04:47.060> to<00:04:47.330> it

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
so that's basically all there is to it

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.260 
so that's basically all there is to it
