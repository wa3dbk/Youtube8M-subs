and also it doesn't move to Sophie and
I'm<00:02:09.250> moving<00:02:09.520> on<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.880> brand<00:02:10.150> wife<00:02:12.240> so<00:02:13.240> now<00:02:13.390> I'm

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
I'm moving on to brand wife so now I'm

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.540 
I'm moving on to brand wife so now I'm
going<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.810> rinse<00:02:13.960> off<00:02:14.230> both<00:02:14.560> conditioners<00:02:15.280> and

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
going to rinse off both conditioners and

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.240 
going to rinse off both conditioners and
here's<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.360> thing<00:02:16.540> about<00:02:16.630> conditioner<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.890> it

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
here's the thing about conditioner is it

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.310 
here's the thing about conditioner is it
is<00:02:18.430> well<00:02:18.670> absorbs<00:02:19.300> there<00:02:19.750> will<00:02:19.930> be<00:02:19.960> nothing

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
is well absorbs there will be nothing

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.920 
is well absorbs there will be nothing
residue<00:02:20.980> when<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.520> rinse<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.850> off<00:02:22.030> hence<00:02:22.660> the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
residue when you rinse it off hence the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.620 
residue when you rinse it off hence the
water<00:02:23.110> should<00:02:23.620> be<00:02:23.860> clearer<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:24.910> now<00:02:25.060> let's<00:02:25.420> put

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
water should be clearer so now let's put

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.890 
water should be clearer so now let's put
this<00:02:25.870> program<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:26.980> test<00:02:30.210> so<00:02:31.210> here<00:02:31.630> are<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
this program to the test so here are the

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.440 
this program to the test so here are the
results<00:02:32.020> and<00:02:32.740> look<00:02:33.070> at<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.730> difference<00:02:34.210> is

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
results and look at it the difference is

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.200 
results and look at it the difference is
so<00:02:34.810> obvious<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:35.800> as<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.340> can<00:02:36.490> see<00:02:36.550> brand<00:02:37.000> white

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
so obvious so as you can see brand white

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.930 
so obvious so as you can see brand white
is<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:37.720> much<00:02:38.050> cloudy<00:02:38.410> up<00:02:38.710> and<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.400> means<00:02:39.670> that

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
is so much cloudy up and that means that

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.240 
is so much cloudy up and that means that
there<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.270> more<00:02:40.540> residue<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.350> hence<00:02:41.920> less

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
there is more residue and hence less

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.700 
there is more residue and hence less
appearance<00:02:42.610> absorb<00:02:43.270> and<00:02:43.600> so<00:02:44.110> your<00:02:44.290> hair<00:02:44.500> gets

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
appearance absorb and so your hair gets

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.740 
appearance absorb and so your hair gets
nice<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.160> nourishment<00:02:45.640> where<00:02:46.330> else<00:02:46.480> were

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
nice and nourishment where else were

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.570 
nice and nourishment where else were
extraordinary<00:02:47.080> oil<00:02:47.530> conditioner<00:02:48.100> you<00:02:48.520> can

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
extraordinary oil conditioner you can

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.430 
extraordinary oil conditioner you can
see<00:02:48.820> that<00:02:48.940> it's<00:02:49.060> clearer<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.750> has<00:02:50.140> more

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
see that it's clearer and has more

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.740 
see that it's clearer and has more

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
products absorbs and there's more

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.530

I<00:03:09.810> will<00:03:10.020> now<00:03:10.140> conduct<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.950> hair<00:03:11.400> floating<00:03:11.670> test

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
I will now conduct a hair floating test

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.300 
I will now conduct a hair floating test
the<00:03:12.420> test<00:03:12.720> for<00:03:12.930> smooth<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.380> manageable<00:03:13.650> hair

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
the test for smooth and manageable hair

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.490 
the test for smooth and manageable hair
how<00:03:14.640> do<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.910> have<00:03:15.060> good<00:03:15.330> flow<00:03:15.630> because<00:03:16.320> they

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
how do you have good flow because they

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.080 
how do you have good flow because they
are<00:03:16.560> less<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.920> holes<00:03:17.160> on<00:03:17.400> each<00:03:17.640> strand<00:03:17.910> of

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
are less the holes on each strand of

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.060 
are less the holes on each strand of
hair<00:03:18.270> and<00:03:18.480> hence<00:03:18.960> water<00:03:19.320> will<00:03:19.560> not<00:03:19.680> enter

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
hair and hence water will not enter

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.330 
hair and hence water will not enter
