00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.970
 yes he is dead from session I'm up 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.710
 the Musikmesse in Frankfurt currently mdb 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.790
 stood next to me is raised one 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.300
 little thing to new dw foot machine 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.249
 It's good that you're here, so we are 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.380
 have the new machine direct dreyfus 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:24.630
 machine from us it is very first time 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.989
 that we even have a pedal with us 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.349
 develop direct drive at dew and how 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:33.059
 you just know us, we are 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.649
 chain drive specialists and have us 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.010
 so just let it take a while 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.960
 to go directly to the pedal and have 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.239
 the Sun brought out where we really proud 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.579
 it is very close to that 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.370
 the feeling of playing on the chain pedal 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.890
 but can also fully into 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.050
 direction of other known direct 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.859
 drive pedals just go to them 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.429
 not in a short time like that 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.429
 is working 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.320
 and so we have this program here 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.720
 This is just called "pointer just" 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.350
 open and here the lever point 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.210
 move 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.330
 this changes the geometry here 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.580
 crucial at the front and just does that 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.229
 much closer to the game feel 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.030
 chain drive in special if it continues 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.770
 inside is when it is further out 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.570
 we come in the field of tricks and 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.090
 trick and access what you get in that 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.179
 medium range also likes to have then 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.659
 we here the adjustment for the plates 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.000
 corner 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.470
 it is all nicely marked with the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.080
 lines here so you will find again and again 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.580
 back to the factory setup 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.799
 We at all imaginings here 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.850
 here at the side is the setting 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.850
 for the Schlegel angle 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.670
 So everything super simple to achieve and 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.650
 we stand at the 9000 football 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.020
 already knows the knows that we this 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.790
 floating rotor thus have a double 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.220
 stored system for the main source 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.900
 outside storage inside storage of leaves 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.760
 the dragonfly rotate separately 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.740
 That's why we have this too 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.259
 fault system hyenas and it was always 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.970
 a bit fiddly to get there 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.130
 downstairs and something really great 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.930
 come up with this idea 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.060
 so here on the page just here 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.760
 turn then the sled up and 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.980
 down and I can throw basically values 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.440
 just try out the sideways here 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.790
 Adjust spring tension 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.739
 a very nice thing is also the 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.470
 ride new spinning chuck front here 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.230
 he has those that he has imposed on the 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.790
 always fit the ones that fit 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.020
 My cock tires and the tilt 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.060
 from the bass drum 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.160
 and then comes the side 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.770
 Flu and I just play a big one 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.020
 Roll when I play my bassdrum peter 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.880
 would like to align the double pedal so 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.100
 center or often center I want you 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.150
 let it beat immediately or move there 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.670
 does it matter 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.900
 then new at the pedal is also 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.090
 that beating is a great thing 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.070
 and these blows are there by the way 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.799
 also single that comes with three 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.680
 different slices here 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.330
 there is this plan felt then there is 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.640
 the round felt we have up here 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.390
 and backstage we could have scene 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.390
 still on plastic 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.040
 every stroke comes from home 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.210
 four weights 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.640
 that's like loading one 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.210
 Revolver simply the weights here in front 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.210
 use 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:37.320
 now is exactly the disc 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.450
 unscrew and if all weights in it 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.660
 then it's just as hard as 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.980
 our normal debitel and if all 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.620
 weights are very light outside 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.720
 from the mallet on market of the weird 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.310
 automatically adapts to the best 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.140
 environment of an important thing 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.180
 that is, no matter when they airbus machine 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.070
 which is used because always fits 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.960
 so that the full impact area for 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.430
 disposal is I just go well 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.060
 much more punch from my bass drum 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.400
 get the last features out here 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.210
 Want to show the wave is this too 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.590
 a great thing 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.360
 we already have a very stable one 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.100
 wave with our red wave the one 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.810
 905,000 pay are 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.790
 but this wave is at eight 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.990
 equipped ball bearings that is still 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.290
 a completely different story 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.630
 So that's absolutely no game in it, too 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.760
 in our house is made in oxnard 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.600
 just like the whole pedal that it is 100 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.060
 percent made from aircraft aluminum 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.380
 At Oxnard we work 100 percent 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.670
 So every pedal is just one 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.210
 single piece and with much love for 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.210
 detail made
