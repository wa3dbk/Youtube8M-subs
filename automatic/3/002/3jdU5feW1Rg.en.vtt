00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.110
 welcome we bikeshop amersfoort i am 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.730
 bennet 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.450
 you probably know it with a nice hand 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.780
 bike on your racing bike and suddenly a flat one 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.900
 band 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.759
 in this video i'm going to show you how 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.000
 can quickly replace tire so that you soon 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.710
 you can continue your way for a flat tire 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.869
 on the road you can repair it 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.710
 following things 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.170
 tire levers a new inside rig 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.039
 and the pump connect the chain to the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.279
 front-and backside 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.170
 after the smallest gear this way 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.700
 has the chain with tension 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.440
 and the wheel can be easily dismantled 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.780
 to become 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.850
 step 2 slide the brake lever 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.410
 up there so that and beyond about it 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.270
 stand 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.180
 then open the quick release and lift the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.980
 cycle a bit on the wheel pocket now 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.059
 panning the deed i can taken from bike 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.280
 to become 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.059
 step three we are now going to the tire 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.420
 We will disassemble you the tire 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.010
 all the way to the inside of the rim 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.040
 pip the first tire lever under the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.990
 a hook casing week behind the spoke 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.479
 the second tire lever we place something 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.400
 further down the tire and how 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.700
 This forward so that we have the entire band 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.100
 can disassemble step four the cause 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.560
 of the leak must be found 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.270
 we look at the outside of the tire and 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.830
 meanwhile, feel careful to the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.890
 inside 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.570
 step 5 if you are the cause of the light 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.460
 have found the tire can 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.350
 reassemble 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.020
 put a side of abroad 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.240
 which replaces the valve of the new one 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.189
 inside because by the the had of the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.350
 rim 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.530
 for little air in the inner tube and lays 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.500
 this all around in the tire 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.170
 step 6 now go outside band completely 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.149
 assemble start with this 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.430
 valve 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.350
 pushed abroad under which and 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.740
 then this to the tire 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.360
 completely under what light sometimes it is 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.610
 awkward for the last piece of bottom sheet 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.890
 none to get 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.149
 then push your tire around it 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.830
 center of the rim 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.240
 yes is a lot easier 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.640
 Also it is help to change the inner tube we 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.710
 leave him a little empty 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.180
 step 7 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.610
 the tire can now be inflated again 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.360
 be check the during pinnacle of 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.430
 the band 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.260
 regularly or the tire a good one 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.630
 around it is 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.970
 step 8 the wheel can be put back into the bike 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.680
 being assembled we lay the chain 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.180
 at the rear at the smallest 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.200
 tooth from below 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.180
 that's how we have views 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.470
 disassembled 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.680
 let's now be careful on the wheel 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.570
 Finally, we make the quick release 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.209
 again and slide the lever off the 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.010
 brake down as far as this 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.989
 instruction on how to replace the 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.580
 inner tube good racing bike 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.080
 I hope you learned something from it 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.970
 but at the same time I hope you don't often 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.530
 in bringing the practice 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.739
 for more instructional films you can watch 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.739
