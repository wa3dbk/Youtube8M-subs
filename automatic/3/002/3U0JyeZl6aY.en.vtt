00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.859
 Stage guys will tell you how pretty 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.680
 relatively easy to come off 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.480
 prestige Chizhik forward than the rest 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.420
 others to get more 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.889
 varied colored sparkles and 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.379
 naturally open more diverse 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.050
 verses for something you need naturally if 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.730
 you can farm above the limit 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.369
 accordingly you will be stronger by 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.220
 compared to someone from sheer you will be able 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.869
 there it is easier for you to win gvp 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.750
 sciences of some data will be 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.210
 this can be done when you have left 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.790
 few 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.700
 currencies limits precisely sparks insight 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.739
 you need to bring this minimum level 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.390
 maxi i just to the minimum 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.730
 that is, leave the well almost miraculous 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.210
 really single values 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.190
 you can farm the little ones themselves 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.199
 there are original and especially on the lungs 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.320
 level in order for this indicator 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.030
 up little you know he is at 7,500 this in 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.590
 these limits are always every week 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.600
 and your eye is completed 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.489
 play them three and a half thousand to me 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.650
 Only this nonsense is left to farm 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.930
 it's also a little one day you can 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.049
 calmly not even steaming too much 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.500
 do it but im on class and fear 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.390
 may decide to break away so not the first 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.400
 step is giving an army to stay well 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.130
 really few but just isolated 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.270
 value is important not to cross over 0 so 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.900
 we have a little bit left 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.630
 we then go to the informator are looking 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.619
 dungeon in which it falls most likely 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.340
 one of 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.049
 group dungeons such as darnitsky 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.890
 the complex glow is group 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.659
 farther there it happens very often x5 they are there 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.970
 and so u dick give scary amount 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.649
 diverse and hide this three hundred 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.110
 twenty five years you will not exchange and I am afraid 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.680
 and with each level everything seems to be higher and 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:02:00.479
 above give them accordingly we get 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:02:02.270
 how many 325 325 sparks multiply by 5 this 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.479
 somewhere in 1000 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:11.390
 600 there boldly than average that is 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.910
 1600 sparks can be obtained in one go 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.640
 more this is basically good because 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.830
 she is our image of him then all development is not on 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.019
 This is unfortunately 2 how much class will leave 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.819
 she general atlas os development can 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.099
 reveal for example leave only 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.650
 green and pump them on 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.590
 endurance very well or bruises 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.660
 for example, for example, thumping uglich and 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.959
 we open a large temple which also 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.370
 give 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.579
 awesome growth wildly gives 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.190
 prestige will help hours and up throughout 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:45.410
 we can already drink for why not 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.260
 of course everyone looks relatively 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.630
 your class can accordingly be from 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.450
 growth per week for one thousand six hundred disks 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.349
 and so you understand 200 if completed 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.379
 take or even 100 different it 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:03.230
 it's pretty good to hang out but 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:07.819
 only small minus even if 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:11.510
 you will come off this amount for example you 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.459
 broke away in this week for 1500 well here 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.859
 all back and forth well let's get 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.569
 round the price of little things where to count not 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.060
 it is necessary here of course wrong 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.980
 multiplied well and so abstract it considers it 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.630
 I don't want a calculator 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.850
 include it is not so important given 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.049
 moment and so you came off this week 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.569
 at 1500 next week they give us 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.810
 7500 is the correct indicator 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:38.569
 but this indicator will be deducted 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.609
 what the world has done in the past week 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.739
 that is minus 1500 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.569
 sparks that is, it turns out 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.900
 those six thousand 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:50.090
 colored es erg plus 3 500 class ones 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.250
 that they are pretty hard to repharm there 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.720
 only you can take more 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.910
 small indicators because 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.599
 maximum this handbag any 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:02.120
 which is up to 79 and cherish 35 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:05.019
 there you can't even guess how much she will give 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.819
 can give with that real bag 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.729
 accordingly, why should we do this 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.440
 here they are a big jump and practically 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:14.720
 beauty last week 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.910
 and because everything is tightly controlled and 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.830
 it is impossible to break away anywhere 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.170
 correctly what should be relative 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.860
 correct from and uniform pumping 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.030
 characters 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:29.810
 should be why we can once a week 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.480
 make a pretty sharp jump on these 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.810
 1500 disc and why because it is one 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.420
 fifth of all of our 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.380
 limit last peep is very 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.620
 strong 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.330
 particle under respectively you will 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.290
 pretty sensitive more than 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.270
 other 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.180
 this week next week you 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.340
 back you form under 0 in order 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.340
 not to fly and then again 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.780
 make any sudden jump in here that you 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.570
 figure, respectively, and two times 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.650
 weeks a small increase that we all 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:06.740
 yes yes with a little force majeure such that 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:10.090
 a small win can even be said so 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.770
 who can help us a little bit 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.160
 have to trick it to survive 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:19.640
 and a little bit of some kind of prerogative 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.660
 and a plus in something at least some way 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.340
 quite interesting you can 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.700
 take advantage and not possible 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.730
 take advantage of the principle you are not a hoax 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.440
 it is written in the rules of the game which 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.180
 It was the last update who turned 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.880
 attention to that and so know and who does not 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.000
 knows now you will know guys 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:41.680
 thank you all for your attention everyone good luck with 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.680
 you were Damascus
