parallel<00:03:18.170> universe<00:03:18.650> almost<00:03:19.040> type<00:03:19.220> thing<00:03:21.430> was

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
parallel universe almost type thing was

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.640 
parallel universe almost type thing was
our<00:03:22.640> teleporting<00:03:23.299> here<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.480> misfire<00:03:23.989> I<00:03:26.650> would

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
our teleporting here a misfire I would

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.650 
our teleporting here a misfire I would
assume<00:03:27.739> so<00:03:27.920> because<00:03:28.340> there's<00:03:28.489> not<00:03:28.609> the<00:03:28.910> boo

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
assume so because there's not the boo

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:37.350 
assume so because there's not the boo
boo<00:03:29.810> boo<00:03:29.959> there's<00:03:30.200> not<00:03:30.410> seem<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:30.739> be<00:03:30.890> a<00:03:30.980> way<00:03:31.220> out

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.480 

but<00:03:37.960> now<00:03:38.050> that<00:03:38.230> we've<00:03:38.350> all<00:03:38.560> gotten<00:03:39.370> this

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
but now that we've all gotten this

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.030 
but now that we've all gotten this
ability<00:03:39.990> I'd<00:03:40.990> say<00:03:41.200> that<00:03:41.350> that<00:03:41.470> has<00:03:41.590> been<00:03:41.770> the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
ability I'd say that that has been the

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:55.450 
ability I'd say that that has been the
map<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.550> fair<00:03:43.240> bit<00:03:43.390> smaller

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:08.740 

get<00:03:56.060> in<00:03:56.270> now<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:03.260> right<00:04:03.590> left<00:04:04.250> up<00:04:04.840> nice<00:04:07.690> so<00:04:08.690> if

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
get in now and right left up nice so if

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.630 
get in now and right left up nice so if
you<00:04:08.840> teleport<00:04:09.320> to<00:04:09.440> that<00:04:09.590> same<00:04:12.280> top<00:04:13.280> order<00:04:13.460> the

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
you teleport to that same top order the

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:25.879 
you teleport to that same top order the
same<00:04:13.850> place<00:04:14.030> will<00:04:14.270> that<00:04:14.360> put<00:04:14.540> us<00:04:14.660> back<00:04:14.810> here

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889
