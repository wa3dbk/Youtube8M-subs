Namaskar
Welcome to nishamadhulika.com

00:00:07.022 --> 00:00:12.514
We frequently make parathas for breakfast or dinner

00:00:12.894 --> 00:00:19.517
if we make them in different ways with different flavours then those eating them will surely be happy.

00:00:20.037 --> 00:00:26.984
Today we will make Palak Laccha Paratha, which is very tasty and nutritious.

00:00:31.626 --> 00:00:33.436
Ingredients required:

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:36.099
Wheat flour - 2 cup.

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:39.006
We can also use maida (flour) instead of wheat flour (atta).

00:00:39.716 --> 00:00:42.002
Palak (spinach) - 200 grams

00:00:42.115 --> 00:00:46.369
The stems have been broken and the leaves are separated before hand.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.469
The Palak has already been washed twice then dried by placing in a strainer.

00:00:52.523 --> 00:00:54.753
Ghee - 3 to 4 tbsp

00:00:55.272 --> 00:00:57.359
Ginger - 1/2" long piece

00:00:58.195 --> 00:00:59.283
Green chilly - 1

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:03.420
Salt - 1/2 tsp or add to taste

00:01:04.138 --> 00:01:06.384
Ajwain (carom seeds) - 1/4 tsp

00:01:07.062 --> 00:01:12.427
First of all we need to grind Palak to make Palak Laccha Paratha

00:01:12.894 --> 00:01:16.203
we will also grind the green chilly and ginger along with Palak.

00:01:16.414 --> 00:01:30.454
Cut ginger into 4 halves, chilly into 2 halves and palak into fat pieces to grind.

00:01:40.638 --> 00:01:45.797
We will make a fine paste of the three, add some water in the mixer and grind.

00:02:03.757 --> 00:02:08.725
Palak Puree is ready after grinding the Palak and we will now put it in flour.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:30.243
Also add 2 tsp Ghee, salt and Ajwain(crush for a lovely aroma).

00:02:34.345 --> 00:02:36.607
Mix all the ingredients thoroughly.

00:02:39.796 --> 00:02:45.510
We will knead soft dough using little amounts of water.

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:55.728
We have now prepared soft dough for Paratha which required 1/2 cup water.

00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:02.361
Cover and leave the dough aside for 15-20 minutes allowing it to ferment.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.244
Then we will make Parathas.

00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:09.962
After 20 minutes our dough is ready.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:18.867
Now apply some Ghee to your hand and press the dough to smoothen it.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.268
Let us start making Palak Laccha Parathas.

00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:31.494
Take some dry flour then turn on the gas.

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:33.585
Allow the pan to heat.

00:03:33.864 --> 00:03:39.960
Break a small lemon sized piece

00:03:40.147 --> 00:03:46.076
(or according to how big paratha you want to make)from the dough and shape into a ball.

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:51.066
Press the ball to make it look like a Peda.

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:53.144
Wrap this piece with dry flour.

00:03:56.563 --> 00:04:03.929
Roll the piece thinly, again wrap with dry flour.

00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:19.097
Apply 1/2 tsp Ghee on this parantha and spread evenly.

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:52.263
Fold this parantha in pleats then wrap into a circle then close the end.

00:04:53.441 --> 00:05:03.041
We will this wrap this round dough piece in dry flour then roll it into a paratha.

00:05:05.294 --> 00:05:09.645
This time we need not roll the paratha very thin, we will keep it slightly thick.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.974
Paratha can be rolled into 5-6 inches in diameter.

00:05:13.303 --> 00:05:15.533
Our paratha is rolled and ready

00:05:15.805 --> 00:05:17.647
the pan also seems to be heated by now.

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:25.008
Put some Ghee in the pan and spread it all over.

00:05:27.754 --> 00:05:29.429
Place paratha on the hot pan.

00:05:31.688 --> 00:05:36.862
We come to know about the parantha being cooked as its upper surface will turn a little dark in colour.

00:05:37.185 --> 00:05:38.622
Turn over the parantha.

00:05:42.357 --> 00:05:45.111
Now that the parantha is cooked from the other side as well

00:05:46.862 --> 00:05:50.878
apply some Ghee on it and spread evenly.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.950
Then turn the parantha again.

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:04.894
Now apply Ghee to this side too.

00:06:07.002 --> 00:06:12.709
Press parantha gently with a ladle and cook till brown spots appear on both the sides.

00:06:13.097 --> 00:06:19.128
Keep a medium flame so that paratha is soft and crispy.

00:06:19.468 --> 00:06:22.158
Parantha is now cooked on both sides

00:06:24.775 --> 00:06:37.690
remove it from the pan and keep it on a small bowl on a plate, a plate covered with paper napkin/foil or directly on the dinner table.

00:06:38.035 --> 00:06:46.246
Parantha seems tastier when served straight from the pan to one's plate.

00:06:54.505 --> 00:07:00.858
Similarly cook all the paranthas. The parathas are all cooked.

00:07:01.783 --> 00:07:05.838
We were able to make 7-8 paranthas with 2 cups of flour.

00:07:06.255 --> 00:07:08.525
Palak Lachcha Parathas are ready.

00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:15.015
You can also make plain parathas instead of these Palak Laccha Parathas

00:07:15.328 --> 00:07:18.019
they are also very delicious.

00:07:18.435 --> 00:07:26.122
If Palak Laccha Parathas are pressed a bit before serving then their layers become prominent.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:34.473
Serve Palak Laccha Parathas with curd, raita, chutney, pickle or your favorite curry.

00:07:34.874 --> 00:07:41.374
