to a little pack opening highlights
thing<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.680> decided<00:00:05.069> rather<00:00:05.520> than<00:00:05.759> uploading

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
thing I decided rather than uploading

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.299 
thing I decided rather than uploading
the<00:00:06.390> whole<00:00:06.569> eight<00:00:06.990> hundred<00:00:07.529> thousand<00:00:08.069> coins

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
the whole eight hundred thousand coins

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.100 
the whole eight hundred thousand coins
were<00:00:08.610> four<00:00:08.820> packs<00:00:09.059> or<00:00:09.269> whatever<00:00:09.510> it<00:00:09.630> was<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.900> did

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
were four packs or whatever it was I did

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.290 
were four packs or whatever it was I did
I'd<00:00:10.410> split<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:10.889> up<00:00:10.950> into<00:00:11.099> two<00:00:11.280> little<00:00:11.880> episodes

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.629 
I'd split it up into two little episodes
of<00:00:12.450> highlights<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.650> hopefully<00:00:14.190> we<00:00:14.309> can<00:00:14.460> have

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
of highlights and hopefully we can have

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.490 
of highlights and hopefully we can have
some<00:00:15.000> some<00:00:15.660> good<00:00:15.809> fun<00:00:15.990> with<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.320> maybe

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
some some good fun with it and maybe

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.930 
some some good fun with it and maybe
that<00:00:16.890> way<00:00:16.980> you'll<00:00:17.130> only<00:00:17.250> have<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.520> see<00:00:17.789> the

better<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.539> pack<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.289> should<00:00:19.529> be<00:00:19.560> a

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
better of the pack so it should be a
