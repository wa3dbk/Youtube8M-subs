 users have requested this will not be a 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.799
 exact figure but I think more than 100 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.010
 users have not asked for this I created a 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.010
 video 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.409
 make this video because there are many 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.479
 parents that is watching this and me 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:37.010
 partner there he started working in the 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:40.100
 team of a jean for the version and boom 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.780
 that is, I believe the game that runs and not a 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.810
 accumulator and you will be wondering 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:51.890
 why this is a xy version 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.979
 pokemon jay that is a demo but it works 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.920
 so that via ok listen not very well that 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.250

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.750

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.729
 ethical pokemon that has water between me 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.040

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.209

 Once he has run as administrator 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.740
 you're going to get where it says failure because 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.319
 remember how well you're going to go where 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:33.189

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:39.469
 open automatically when the 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:41.299
 truth is that we already have point asks ok 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:45.400
 already when we have a file that ideas to 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.400
 open here will dig that is open 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:54.019

 transcript we continue 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:11.180
 and as the game is already running at 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.180
 100% does not require much 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:28.310
 I did not want to comment on the question of the day 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:30.860
