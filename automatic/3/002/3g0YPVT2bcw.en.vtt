 Dubbo N 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:24.220
 I went to Ryogoku Bridge Actually it was the opportunity to build this bridge in 1657 3rd year calendar 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.350
 Great fire of 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.920
 It's was Tan 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:37.040
 There is no fire this tournament burns out which timer 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.910
 There was a serious damage that 100,000 victims had appeared, but at that time Sumida River 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.850
 Yet 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:46.719
 I only bought the washing bridge . The blast that saw this a lot 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:53.110
 Sumida River west of Musashi country and east 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:57.159
 That was spent in the fact that Let's make a bridge connecting the two countries joining the Shimousa countries the two countries 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:03.040
 It is said that the Ryogoku Bridge is at the foot of this Ryogoku Bridge 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:04.269
 It seems that the pottery was formed and many people came to visit 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.550
 today as well 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:12.260

 Hiroshige ar I would like to take a small Edo walk with a map 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:21.200
 It's such that this area was the Edo most of the resort area 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.200
 The 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.460
 Hey 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.460
 You can see the signboards of both countries 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:36.940
 Yes 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:41.170
 It is feeling that what kind of store there are in the character and so on but this is this 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:45.850
 It is written that it is 100 of freedom and it is a letter already 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:51.740
 In other words , it was a shop that had put out a pot of Ning 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:53.740
 It is open from the middle of the Edo period in Kawabata of these two countries . 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.060
 It is a shop 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:04.310
 In fact, from the middle of the Edo period to the end of the Bakumatsu 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:11.090
 It's like had so much to eat meat for especially men something is to put a sex 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:17.569
 On the other character just put out a normal speaking Datte butcher signs that say this because wasæ†š

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:22.460
 It's a mountain whale after all, so it's a mountain whale, so it's safe to say 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:28.040
 It looks like it was being opened with a signboard like this 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:31.670
 And go in and go freak show to see this kind of is with the star I, for example, play the trailing edge 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:35.540
 Because fireworks that summer is late will rise 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:42.500
 It's say was such a place to enjoy until night 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:45.590
 It seems that there is a place that is related to the fireworks written by Hironari near here, so let's go there soon 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.569
 I would like 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.810
 The painful Attari 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.810
 Another 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.000
 Yup 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.800
 Yes, it is here 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.190
 This is 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:08.140
 Qin Les's One Hundred Famous Views of Edo of in the 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:13.330
 I came to the point that I wrote the fireworks of the two countries 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:16.880
 In fact , it is the place where the argument is divided whether it was written from the upper stream of this bridge or from the lower stream 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:23.720
 Masu downstream Nii but is now 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:24.560
 Speaking of fireworks in the Sumida River, it is still a summer feature, but it started from the Edo period 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:32.370
 is not it 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:38.610
 8th Shogun Yoshimune happened in the previous year in 1833 in Kyoho 18 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:41.459
 First it is best to have been started for your funeral of dead due to the danger from it was it came seconds 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:48.780
 It is that from which it is said that 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:51.710
 Fireworks every day if marked with a patron until the end of the Sumida River Kawabiraki from May to August 28, there is a 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.160
 It means that it was up 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:58.520
 But if you look at this picture of Mr. Hironari 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.670
 I get the impression, such as lonely or rather a little ephemeral up 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.970
 This is what this is 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:10.910
 In fact, by the end of the end of the Tokugawa period, recession and 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:12.590
 Since there was a second earthquake after the earthquake, the situation where fireworks can not be raised will continue for a while 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.150
 It's like had 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:20.970
 However, rest going out to this 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:28.139
 It seems that it was the year that the fireworks display was finally resumed in the year of five years 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:31.169
 However , one month after this meeting was published, Mr. Hironari himself, who wrote the picture, had these plagues 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:35.139
 It has been gone and it has gone 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:40.900
 So, in this picture, fireworks will go up after a long time 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:47.020
 It is as if Hironari's thought of the end of his cherry blossom life was 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:50.219
 It is a tasteful piece I like in the place that such kind of kanji is included 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.219
 I also love the picture
