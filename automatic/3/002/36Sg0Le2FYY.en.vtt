00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.290
 hello and welcome to the card 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.750
 is my next map &amp; guide deals 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.000
 to deal with the nice chip card effect 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.380
 I'll give you a quick tour with us 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.760
 On the one hand, of course, it wants to show 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.789
 on one side of the ship 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.860
 and then flown thereby on the 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.990
 Of course, I want to be on the other side 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.680
 as always first with the camping spots 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.990
 to begin 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.940
 The ship is so constructed that it 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.790
 So you have to lie on the sea 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.620
 of course an upper level a middle one 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.300
 level and a lower level 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.190
 I want to do some things for you today 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.880
 Show as best on this map 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.079
 and how best to play it 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.730
 Of course we'll look at it first 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.890
 times the domination points 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.020
 here would be the domination point c man 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.390
 domination in itself can be relatively good here 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.059
 take on one of these two sides 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.039
 but I prefer the tactical 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.510
 do not just change the middle of the way 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.850
 but there is the possibility 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.680
 to use these benches here 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.360
 if you like it she could 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.850
 actually take good yourself or that 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.590
 you are seen from behind or from 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.450
 the front at the one you can on both 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.340
 So make this take 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.160
 and of course if you are a couple 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.649
 makes 1000 times faster is difficult 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.170
 Of course, this card, too 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.420
 also to defend flags because I 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.369
 find one has from the position as well 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.929
 I'm here for example 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.390
 to defend quickly one comes here now 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:31.399
 From the park bench I like her so much 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.990
 baptized little down so not so 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.849
 fast down but you have of course 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.149
 then the possibility very very safe 

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:39.860
 one should take the flag 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.300
 really very fast 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.890
 you have the opportunity once 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.990
 to take this side you have to 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.440
 of course on the two corners here 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.970
 Watch out, that's what I say 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.619
 most dangerous spot so to an extreme 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.479
 Crisp spot to eat like me 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.030
 Personally, you should always agree 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.770
 make second most of the time you also has the 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.509
 Possibility here on the left to take away 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.899
 on the right side opponents away too 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.580
 pick up 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.440
 but if you are here on these two 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.090
 Pay attention and take care of yourself 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.250
 have targeted then you will already 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.429
 quickly see that you have the opportunity 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.390
 have accordingly there too 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.250
 show what you like 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.020
 I want to show it to me from the 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.360
 on the other side here you have the us sport 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.790
 that is in my opinion the shoulder 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.830
 or most blatant spot not the nomination 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.100
 I know you really have little cover 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.720
 So I know here no capture spot 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.840
 Really out of sight right here 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.250
 stand up and defend because you have 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.320
 little possibilities if opponent of 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.850
 left or right here is something 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.470
 to align because the sports are yes 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.540
 the back there in this thing has the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.250
 seen where I was born and then has 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.860
 you really no possibility here a 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.910
 perfect to take it over now 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.070
 all of course from the other side 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.450
 how to catchen at best here 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.950
 On the top of the thing, it is good 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.720
 caption here in the middle it can be 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.400
 good capture always on these two 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.920
 Points that I always watch show 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.400
 So left and right here these two 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.170
 metric tons 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.690
 yes that was it for the capture 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.550
 spots next I want you one 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.590
 Show some running spots or just 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.540
 Walks I like to run so 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.970
 example, my first spot I like 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.290
 shares is here then believes below 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.730
 long you have to be careful that no 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.500
 opponents come to meet you 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.360
 You should try on this map 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.070
 opinion to play with a smg 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.780
 I like it very much then you can 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.970
 right here at this point, however, on 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.040
 spawn few opponents intercept what I then 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.269
 I also like to do it here 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.280
 purely because then you have a good one 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.410
 look but of course without cover 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.510
 You can walk up the stairs here 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.340
 that is also a possibility here 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.410
 to rush up and there 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.260
 Accordingly, take a few opponents 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.820
 that 's all the stuff about here 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.100
 for example, a way to the box is 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.450
 a good spot where you can get away 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.190
 I think that's very good about that 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.410
 spawn right here in front of one and 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.350
 behind where I now drag 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.970
 So these are so hey traffic areas where 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.310
 I hold myself the most , too 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.470
 try to move your most 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.540
 student export which mostly increases 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.519
 weeks kiel leads in my next 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.790
 category while we are here beautiful from 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.079
 boat I want to see you a few 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.420
 spots show where you then yours 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.920
 use killstreaks or scores tricks 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.890
 I think that's a good one 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.870
 extension of my edgar that 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.030
 you somehow show a few places where 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.590
 you can use the whole thing in peace 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.390
 Can and I find this place here 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.310
 just perfect you come here 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.049
 I think I've never had one here 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.789
 seen below has done something 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.479
 now you probably know many 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.889
 so easy down there 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.729
 offer or here at this 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.930
 a job 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.600
 Here I show again how to 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.400
 there it is in the boats 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.470
 So either lay it down here or 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.630
 old on the back of the boats on it or then 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.199
 to the right side that our points 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.850
 I think there you have your rest and 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.320
 could also be here accordingly 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.630
 you can see it again directly on the ground 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.010
 there is a point on it you will 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.260
 probably if you had sport 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.280
 Of course, never next tells almost never 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.800
 fetched i have never met anyone 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.690
 seen used to his first war 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.620
 You can also put here here 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.610
 further ahead 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:04.280
 and then another point says where to 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.530
 can put his score street is here 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.380
 since this is the place that is natural 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.150
 even a spawn point is risky because there 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.350
 mostly aids come but me 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.240
 Do not think it's bad because 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.240
 you are not necessarily expected here 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.810
 Last but not least, I want you one more 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.270
 So few nate show one would be here 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.220
 not across this thing his room 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.990
 sauna as you can the opponent beautiful 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.669
 pick up the then try on w too 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.200
 you can also see how to wash 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.639
 from the po you here with the corner 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.580
 take with you if there any 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.990
 you can fight sniper too 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.210
 Retrieving it actually pretty much 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.099
 you can actually feel relative 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.289
 easy always do well about this thing 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:45.440
 over it and now my absolute betrayed 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:48.740
 spot on the map not in here and 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.020
 it's just bombing right here 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.940
 three if below exemptions which 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.990
 are there right here the position and 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.880
 then you can really opponents here 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.770
 perfect take away and usually gets 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.240
 a multi of course the same applies in 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.820
 Just throw the other way 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.490
 As shown then the ball rolls perfectly 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.320
 hurts and hopefully catch up 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.120
 want the same out here again 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.620
 you can also change your view 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:14.570
 combine with eg cossen green aids or 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.490
 a normal grenade then see that yes 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.139
 even talk the thing was rolled 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.090
 up and then usually catch up 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:21.830
 two opponents away the same applies 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.380
 Of course, as I said for the other 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.729
 direction when the red is the position 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.190
 if the opponent down a few dates 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:30.789
 can subject a few stan james 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.890
 Just throw it and you are 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:34.960
 accordingly down cool thing office 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.530
 you like 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.639
 unsightly continue to tell the spot well 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.530
 then I will with the 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:43.180
 Cruise ship again on steam 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.830
 my dear call of duty friends i 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.970
 say lots of hand by the minute to see you 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.800
 next time i hope i could give you 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.800
 help us and we hear us servus
