00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello and welcome to this kind of 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.309
 primax in this part we will learn 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.360
 how to install the virrey render engine 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.940
 for trimax 2012 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.940
 I already have the program 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.310
 open remember that to verify if 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.860
 we have the render engine installed to 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.860
 hunosa rendering 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.809
 let's hope it opens very well here 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:36.480
 we have the window we verify the engine 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.820
 of current render in the saint render 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.150
 we verify that they have metal production 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.000
 ray we enter here and verify the 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.250
 other options 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.090
 it is here where we need to have the viceroy 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.400
 installed 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.540
 in this case, do not have it installed 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.489
 then it is the objective of the class 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.550
 have it within these options then 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.809
 let's give it ok and we close this already 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.650
 we verify that we do not have it 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.440
 at present 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.150
 and it is necessary to close the program to 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.750
 that allows us to install the I'm going to 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.909
 close 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.869
 climax 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.280
 now here on the desk I have the folder 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.679
 of installation of viceroys for theory 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:24.170
 max 2012 let's open it shows us 32 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:27.920
 and 64 depending on the operating system 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:32.360
 that they use so we are going to use the version 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.770
 adequate in my case I have 64 bits 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.780
 I'm going to open 64 bits 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.380
 and I double click on this icon 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.380
 installation 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.210
 very well the installation begins let's 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.600
 verify that in the first window 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.060
 we have 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.580
 the start of installation we are going to give 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.950
 next 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:02:00.430
 here is the contract there is water 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.330
 again as workstation we are going to 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.910
 install 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.040
 we verify the routes that are directed to 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.610
 climax 2012 the version that we have 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.610
 installed 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.640
 then everything is automatically 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.870
 correct next 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.870
 we leave this option 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.480
 perhaps we deactivated it when installing web 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.980
 next next 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.980
 the installation begins 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.320
 we wait for it to finish 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.270
 at this moment they are adding all 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.860
 the plugins to tracy max 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.870
 remember that it is not a separate program 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.540
 it is installed within three max 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.870
 and we do not have to open any any 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.870
 another program 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.420
 then since trimax has been added 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.480
 monex 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.569
 here is going to open an information file 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.660
 of installation and how it was installed 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.530
 then we will remove them so as not to see 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.020
 those files 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.230
 phoenix 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:15.410
 and ready at this time is installed 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:20.180
 the program but it's not activated let's 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:23.410
 to go to the folder called crack and 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.660
 we found the activation files 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.720
 I select 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:33.170
 I'm going to copy these two files and I'm going 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.700
 to the team on the ce disk where you have 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.290
 installed the program files of 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.160
 autodesk program 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.300
 create max 2012 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.760
 and here I'm going to paste these files 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.090
 he asks me if I want to replace in vigo 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.090
 yes 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.270
 now I have a file in the folder 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:00.960
 plugins I'm going to copy 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:04.400
 and I'm going to paste it here on this same route 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.400
 in the plugins folder 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.940
 we stick 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.460
 we replace 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.350
 I can very well close now let's 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.040
 open the program and let's verify 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.790
 that if we have installed the viceroy for 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.790
 trimax 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.900
 we hope they charge 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.550
 very well opened the program we go equal to 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.550
 rendering 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.790
 let's go now 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.790
 third 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.390
 we go down to federer 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.300
 remember that we have here in production 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:07.840
 the option to choose and verify that 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.810
 now we have vibe advanced 2.0 what 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.360
 we select 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.490
 automatically change the entire window 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.069
 of render options 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.550
 and these are all the options of 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:24.560
 virrey check the other tabs if 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.280
 all the options appear mean 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.660
 which is active 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:33.760
 otherwise we would see a 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:36.550
 text nothing more than not active 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:40.510
 and we verify the version that is 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:42.670
 version 2.0 viceroy very well that has been 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.880
 everything in this tutorial we have already learned 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:49.230
 to install and activate the viceroy see you 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.230
 in the next class
