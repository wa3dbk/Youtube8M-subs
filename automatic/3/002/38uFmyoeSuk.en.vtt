00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 intention is my job too 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.770
 we are educated the structure and the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.860
 relations in society 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.660
 we need to educate in a certain way 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.000
 understand how this happens 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.830
 and we need to position ourselves in relation to 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.330
 this is important that the employee 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.520
 know that it is important that the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.250
 employee might think about it for 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.830
 establish other types of relationships in 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.820
 School is so important is so 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.769
 everything is that you feel sorry for this 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.469
 aspect of your relationship with the employee 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.670
 because we are also in a relationship of 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:42.270
 captive and work and finally management 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.010
 democratic school mean to 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.469
 same time we prepared that 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.800
 we help employees with your car 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.760
 training our relationship 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:57.829
 we are helping whoever is constituted 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.879
 as someone who feels able to 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.390
 participate in the educational process of 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.020
 giving their opinions by bringing their 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.570
 knowledge and telling how you can 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:15.090
 participate and integrate the process 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:18.439
 that you understand then 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:23.100
 quickly in a way that 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:28.460
 different look is so fundamental in 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.020
 professionalization process 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.770
 The purpose of the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.750
 the notebooks that need to be 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.430
 read carefully that will be studied 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.579
 and can be followed 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.640
 the notebooks bring the knowledge 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.399
 bring the problematization refer to 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.890
 practical activities and experiences 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.930
 important for understanding both the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.299
 knowledge with the transformation 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.180
 practices 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:02:00.020
 these notebooks make up the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.780
 specific training for each qualification 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.000
 that do not show again make up the axis 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.460
 pedagogical training that is common to 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.039
 all 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:14.140
 and that works with science education 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:16.120
 with their education and also the 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.660
 supervised work experience or 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.459
 is from the books that fu and all 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.459
 I study the notebooks that all the training 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:33.060
 if the ratio between the axes is 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.060
 gives the study the notebooks and thematizes 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.500
 very important situations for the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.070
 understanding of school reality 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.769
 then from one notebook to another of passage 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.709
 from one axis of formation to another is 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.500
 teaching specific training have the 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.540
 integral part of the practices 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.190
 professional professionals so that the 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:00.400
 accountant then in these 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.200
 different situations and gaza work 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.190
 in school the pedagogical project to 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.480
 thematic transversality of knowledge 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.300
 historically built experiences and 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.829
 practices that will enable 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.260
 build a business plan is and 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.090
 self-assessment that the 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.970
 teacher the dam will come to you 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:26.410
 at another time and that therefore I 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.350
 comment protection now 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.660
 on my part was this leaves the test 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.049
 for you to put all doubts 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.209
 that have in the virtual environment people 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.950
 can then continue the interaction over there 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.470
 A hug to all and I hope I can 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.060
 find them sometime in a way 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.060
 face- to- face soon 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.590
