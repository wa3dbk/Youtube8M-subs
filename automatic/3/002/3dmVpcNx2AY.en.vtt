and the middle right and then you have
obsidian<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.650> then<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.010> need<00:01:11.159> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
obsidian like so and then you need to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.670 
obsidian like so and then you need to
take<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.490> book<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.970> place<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.900> top<00:01:13.140> so

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
take a book and place it on the top so

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.770 
take a book and place it on the top so
it<00:01:14.010> comes<00:01:14.310> out<00:01:14.490> like<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.850> middle<00:01:15.330> left<00:01:15.479> it

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
bookshelves and we need to start placing

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.660 
bookshelves and we need to start placing
them<00:01:57.299> one<00:01:57.540> block<00:01:57.810> away<00:01:58.159> from<00:01:59.159> each<00:01:59.280> other<00:01:59.369> so

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
them one block away from each other so

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.480 
them one block away from each other so
imagine<00:02:00.180> that's<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.450> crime<00:02:01.320> Chapman<00:02:02.250> table

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
imagine that's the crime Chapman table

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.370 
imagine that's the crime Chapman table
there<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:03.090> need<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.509> place<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> one<00:02:04.140> block<00:02:04.350> away

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
there we need to place a one block away

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.190 
there we need to place a one block away
so<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.540> every<00:02:06.540> time<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.899> has<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.110> be

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
so like that and every time it has to be

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.040 
so like that and every time it has to be
one<00:02:07.409> block<00:02:07.649> away<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.420> like<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.599> one<00:02:09.840> block

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
one block away so like that one block

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.540 
one block away so like that one block
won't<00:02:10.259> block<00:02:10.410> one<00:02:10.619> block<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.099> then<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.459> is

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
won't block one block and then this is

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.850 
won't block one block and then this is
going<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.760> be<00:02:11.849> our<00:02:12.090> entrance<00:02:12.660> let's<00:02:12.900> say

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
going to be our entrance let's say

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.680 
going to be our entrance let's say
and<00:02:13.980> actually<00:02:14.760> had<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.210> make<00:02:15.330> this<00:02:15.510> our

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
and actually had to make this our

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.510 
and actually had to make this our
entrance<00:02:16.020> because<00:02:16.260> it's<00:02:16.530> like<00:02:16.650> street<00:02:17.040> for

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
entrance because it's like street for

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.870 
entrance because it's like street for
fries<00:02:17.970> facing<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.370> we<00:02:20.370> need<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.580> go<00:02:20.700> one

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
fries facing it and we need to go one

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.210 
fries facing it and we need to go one
block<00:02:21.030> or<00:02:21.300> block<00:02:23.390> one<00:02:24.390> block<00:02:24.750> there<00:02:25.500> we<00:02:25.590> go<00:02:25.710> so

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
block or block one block there we go so

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.730 
block or block one block there we go so
we<00:02:26.370> need<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.820> cover<00:02:27.270> this<00:02:27.510> up<00:02:27.690> exactly<00:02:28.260> like

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
we need to cover this up exactly like

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.670 
we need to cover this up exactly like
this<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.460> then<00:02:29.730> what<00:02:30.090> we<00:02:30.210> can<00:02:30.240> do<00:02:30.480> is<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:31.230> cool

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
this and then what we can do is a cool

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.000 
this and then what we can do is a cool
through<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.190> three<00:02:32.940> times<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.380> goes<00:02:34.770> up

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
through this three times so it goes up

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.480 
through this three times so it goes up
three<00:02:35.400> times<00:02:35.640> obviously<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:37.190> I<00:02:38.190> come<00:02:38.460> to

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
three times obviously and I come to

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.670 
three times obviously and I come to
further<00:02:38.910> awareness<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.660> need<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.050> break<00:02:40.470> that

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
further awareness I need to break that

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.350 
further awareness I need to break that
and<00:02:41.040> go<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:43.100> as<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.220> can<00:02:44.310> see<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:45.000> words<00:02:45.209> are

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
and go and as you can see the words are

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.449 
and go and as you can see the words are
already<00:02:45.720> starting<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.140> fly<00:02:46.350> in<00:02:46.410> but<00:02:46.800> if<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.130> try

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
already starting to fly in but if I try

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.330 
already starting to fly in but if I try
to<00:02:47.490> test<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:48.000> ice<00:02:48.150> très<00:02:48.750> test<00:02:49.320> this<00:02:49.500> out<00:02:49.740> noi<00:02:50.040> it
