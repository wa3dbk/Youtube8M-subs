00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.190
 session 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.599
 abandoning the ones that we all know that the previous delivery offered us 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:13.909
 fts 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.390
 the action continues to be on Mars 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.390
 although time after what happened 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.890
 from the first moments it is clear that gay clubs wanted to mark 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.569
 a big difference compared to the work of the previous ones developed 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.380
 maintaining that yes the framework where the action is located 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.080
 the visual style 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.680
 and above all destruction of the environment 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.680
 it was the engine of physics and fungi 2-0 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.560
 the changes that you notice the player formed 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.660
 and it may be that the usual to the series 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.180
 miss the freedom of play and open approach which is a draw 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.700
 previously 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.289
 as well as more other 3 5% and not so many 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.690
 after the versions differ victory at the same time he did not move 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.810
 in reference to the transformer 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.630
 we will provoke Armageddon by eliminating a structure that keeps the villain 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.810
 from that moment we will face 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.810
 bruno minions and above all 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.940
 against threats at the start 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.880
 strange creatures that nozar stages 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.300
 these seem everywhere normally of a mother sheath that we will have to 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.250
 exploit 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.440
 to prevent them from appearing anymore 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.420
 enemy chale has its own attack characteristics although there is no 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.710
 much variety than the feet 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.320
 whitelee artificial people is not excessive and most of the time 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.240
 the confrontations were intense difficult 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.960
 for the amount that varies between those who attacked us the shame not because 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.180
 this has been dotted with villaviciosa attack 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.650
 to face them 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.130
 the powerful weaponry 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.660
 of the series I think pack 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.010
 from rifles, futuristic pistols and jaramillo shotguns 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.430
 others that create austere facts others that threw objects against another 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.430
 spears and costumes granada 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.259
 we can only allocate 4 weapons to the crosshead 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.869
 we can change them in the appropriate places 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:15.219
 many neighbors after we will do 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:18.569
 and with it 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.229
 we will pay for two sports 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:22.559
 and those famous 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.559
 we have to recompose 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:29.079
 proforca 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.669
 we can continue 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:31.809
 that reconstruction 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.119
 It will also be basic for 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:36.839
 Castillo Cervantes things against enemy attacks 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:39.719
 especially against final enemies 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.559
 during our way we know enough ammunition information 

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:49.019
 compared to the previous delivery this proposal is less marine rounded 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.959
 a correct graphical aspect although without boasting little variety of missions with 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.919
 situations very similar to each other 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.510
 hard but somewhat scarce 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.379
 and only two bikes 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.379
 past one out rounds of hordes of enemies 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.349
 destroying its environment 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:12.759
 we can indicate that network 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.239
 is below the series
