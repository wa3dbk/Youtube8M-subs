00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.079
 Ourinhos now for 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.490
 and shows another step in our with the real 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.519
 let's think now about the atmosphere 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.749
 the atmosphere 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.909
 iziane our planet and the blue planet 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:22.509
 and to do this 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.029
 from that point we are 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.960
 I know that I'm here with the second ball the selected goal to add a 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.079
 third 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.449
 the teams 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.070
 and this 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.400
 comments a little bit you also have to download 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.400
 slightly larger 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.050
 if you want to see how much 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.260
 enough here 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.480
 once again the 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.480
 Andrew worked with size because - written here 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.100
 that does not even let you 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.220
 I do not know if it's too good. 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.460
 that's how much she is 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.570
 is not greater than the previous 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.680
 very good 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.370
 stupid 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.680
 let's go now 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.270
 draw regional material aside kimi is an athlete whom we stick to give in sphere 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.270
 clouds right 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.810
 make sure tatra bank hold 2 there is one of color and looted 92 wait 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.390
 we have 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.570
 let's go 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.680
 put thousand 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.800
 the next name 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.800
 we already have 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.580
 very good 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.630
 minds 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.970
 in this material but let's work with a texture just let's play here 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.790
 0 'specular plays with transparency 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.030
 and a crack sees what will happen tomorrow 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.990
 one of the options with the company badge 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.990
 with Luke's point 5 who already begins to realize that he was ready 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.650
 This is Iraq. 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.220
 in the Nikkei index 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.700
 bolzan in the middle 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.700
 s overthrew with official 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.900
 under another one expelled 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.900
 firth points 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:14.709
 we start from the idea of ​​the atmosphere and turn it into the sugo 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.349
 1 since with years a rain in this region 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.450
 if you 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.980
 that went wrong 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.149
 He left more or less 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:25.319
 curtains 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.349
 with 12 50 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.089
 net credited to qtrax 0 tdi de guedes 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:34.229
 of 58 7 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:36.159
 it's no different around here 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.679
 so confirm 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.789
 but is not fixed twelve provides connect 

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:43.049
 Just kidding 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.529
 remembering 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:47.089
 what 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:50.089
 until now I would have placed it 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.409
 the particularity and now we are putting a 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:58.039
 here we have bluish feather 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.780
 with the track causing this 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.449
 if the outbreak that its north line 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.459
 elano that got her 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.749
 that ring again here 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:12.399
 to solve this one more time I will trigger the saints fc ski 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:17.669
 so that the 8th and 12th of November will disappear 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:21.769
 captain long time with anderson paim for doing just the most 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.919
 that anyone who has aquino or before 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:30.049
 put the stars back here let's make a final pitch 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.599
 here below with another selected 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.669
 mothers day 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.359
 and then you and Decio yielded the 101 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.319
 in the united states star button 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.189
 here is not what we want people who is something 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:44.989
 a little less 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.009
 after starting the sites 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:49.189
 works with 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.249
 for everything that is there 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:52.559
 much smaller than 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:54.969
 yes you're hardly staying here right? 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:04:01.059
 we are going to put this separation between them here - distant cuca 5 but already 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:04.229
 you get to know some very 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:05.809
 nearest 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:08.399
 the 4th 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:11.839
 good as the stars 

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:14.839
 is this the minimum distance enters with the cacique 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.979
 essien and the other indicator here we go too 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:21.870
 caused 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.800
 colorful 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.710
 in the 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.650
 stars 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.999
 the councilor 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:31.469
 also suggested that people 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:33.840
 selected 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.840
 then selected 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.439
 and change a parameter here 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:41.490
 what is the clipping 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.990
 where he stands with this very high point art science suggests point locks 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.199
 of the incident 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.199
 200 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.400
 I'm chubby, active right now. 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.529
 before giving a radar 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:01.740
 because 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.680
 we run one 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.589
 that's why it's coming 

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:05.310
 let's avoid 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.310
 would bring 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.950
 São Paulo I'm here, let's give you 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.889
 by mistake because of pain 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.110
 it's always good 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.309
 and save your file, right? 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:20.169
 to each network 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.589
 remember that I 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:24.560
 then apply all the 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.729
 statues right 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.650
 needed 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.020
 reflection 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.909
 we put it now for the culture on the 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:38.839
 I used the saints 36 who wants to come in and take that shadow 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:41.479
 end here 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.569
 and here you already see in it 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:44.419
 some 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.599
 Little stars 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:49.189
 last year 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:50.550
 I tried 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.909
 set up of wood 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:54.909
 possible way and for you to see 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:00.439
 exposed in space 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:05.319
 - Let's leave it to the last part of our tutorial 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:07.199
 the work 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.029
 the composer of March first month we have worked with u 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.619
 can not we for textures and materials now 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:18.219
 but let's work 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:20.909
 with ours to do the final composition 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:24.429
 which is the goal is to put that doctor you saw 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:29.669
 from the beginning in the cast but we made our planet he is already very handsome 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:34.000
 but it still does not give more caprice they had used stainless composer in the next 

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:34.169
 class
