perfectly<00:00:43.750> obviously<00:00:44.410> as<00:00:44.530> this<00:00:44.710> is<00:00:44.890> still<00:00:45.070> a

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
perfectly obviously as this is still a

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.770 
perfectly obviously as this is still a
pretty<00:00:45.370> difficult<00:00:45.610> past<00:00:46.000> but<00:00:46.570> close<00:00:46.750> enough

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
pretty difficult past but close enough

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.569 
pretty difficult past but close enough
of<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.290> receiver<00:00:47.590> should<00:00:47.800> be<00:00:47.980> able<00:00:48.040> to<00:00:48.250> get<00:00:48.400> to

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
of the receiver should be able to get to

of the receiver should be able to get to
the<00:00:48.670> bowl<00:00:48.880> the<00:00:49.690> second<00:00:50.020> player<00:00:50.170> however<00:00:50.560> has<00:00:50.710> a

the bowl the second player however has a
low<00:00:50.950> skill<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:51.460> you<00:00:51.520> can<00:00:51.640> see<00:00:51.790> that<00:00:51.820> he<00:00:52.090> is<00:00:52.180> not

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
low skill and you can see that he is not

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.000 
low skill and you can see that he is not
able<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.720> control<00:00:52.930> the<00:00:53.050> class<00:00:53.230> nearly<00:00:53.530> as<00:00:53.800> well

able to control the class nearly as well

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.160 
able to control the class nearly as well
this<00:00:54.610> is<00:00:54.760> a<00:00:54.790> significant<00:00:55.450> change<00:00:55.690> for<00:00:55.899> FIFA

and<00:00:56.590> one<00:00:56.739> that<00:00:56.890> we<00:00:56.950> believe<00:00:57.250> a<00:00:57.280> lot<00:00:57.550> more<00:00:57.700> dead

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
and one that we believe a lot more dead
