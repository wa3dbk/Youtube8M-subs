let's see if they'll do anything cool

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.500 
let's see if they'll do anything cool
now<00:00:47.309> they've<00:00:47.579> been<00:00:47.670> doing<00:00:47.820> cool<00:00:48.059> stuff<00:00:48.120> all

now they've been doing cool stuff all

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.840 
now they've been doing cool stuff all
day<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.899> did<00:00:49.079> get<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.289> couple<00:00:49.469> cool<00:00:50.370> stuff<00:00:50.640> on

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
day and I did get a couple cool stuff on

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.079 
day and I did get a couple cool stuff on
tape<00:00:51.089> but<00:00:51.359> they<00:00:51.539> might<00:00:51.719> be<00:00:51.750> tired<00:00:52.079> out<00:00:52.289> now

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
tape but they might be tired out now

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.110 
tape but they might be tired out now
they<00:00:54.089> do<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.479> hand<00:00:54.989> waving<00:00:55.320> thing<00:00:55.969> that<00:00:56.969> I've

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
they do this hand waving thing that I've

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.490 
they do this hand waving thing that I've
been<00:00:57.239> reading<00:00:57.449> about<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.750> guess<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.229> sign

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
been reading about I guess it's a sign

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.959 
been reading about I guess it's a sign
of<00:00:58.679> submission<00:01:01.159> the<00:01:02.159> other<00:01:02.339> one<00:01:02.579> doesn't<00:01:02.820> even

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
of submission the other one doesn't even

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.910 
of submission the other one doesn't even
like<00:01:03.269> to<00:01:03.299> be<00:01:03.539> filmed<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.259> love<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.739> don't

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
like to be filmed but you love it don't

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.520 
like to be filmed but you love it don't
you<00:01:05.869> yeah<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.560> love<00:01:07.920> it

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:42.200 

yeah<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:12.830> are

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.830 

so<00:01:42.780> apparently<00:01:43.370> the<00:01:44.370> guy<00:01:44.790> at<00:01:45.120> the<00:01:45.300> pet<00:01:45.540> store

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
so apparently the guy at the pet store

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.540 
so apparently the guy at the pet store
said<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.440> they're<00:01:46.590> too<00:01:46.830> small<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.310> guess

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
said that they're too small I guess

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.950 
said that they're too small I guess
they're<00:01:47.850> gonna<00:01:47.940> get<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.240> foot<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.660> a<00:01:48.690> half<00:01:48.720> long

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
they're gonna get a foot and a half long

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.480 
they're gonna get a foot and a half long
right<00:01:49.350> now<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.530> don't<00:01:49.680> know<00:01:49.860> if<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.250> tell

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
right now I don't know if you can tell

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.590 
right now I don't know if you can tell
but<00:01:51.300> they're<00:01:51.480> only<00:01:51.570> about<00:01:51.810> four<00:01:52.320> inches<00:01:52.680> long

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
but they're only about four inches long

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.770 
but they're only about four inches long
the<00:01:54.600> guy<00:01:54.750> at<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.930> pet<00:01:55.140> store<00:01:55.380> said<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.780> it's

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
the guy at the pet store said that it's

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.530 
the guy at the pet store said that it's
too<00:01:58.050> early<00:01:58.080> to<00:01:58.350> tell<00:01:58.650> what<00:01:58.860> sex<00:01:59.190> they<00:01:59.400> are<00:01:59.540> but

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
too early to tell what sex they are but

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.560 
too early to tell what sex they are but
if<00:02:00.870> one<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.350> them<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.650> a<00:02:01.850> male<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.210> one's<00:02:03.420> a

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
if one of them is a male and one's a

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.190 
if one of them is a male and one's a
female<00:02:03.810> they'll<00:02:04.410> breed<00:02:04.800> in<00:02:05.190> about<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> year<00:02:05.910> and

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
female they'll breed in about a year and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.800 
female they'll breed in about a year and
they<00:02:07.459> buy<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.520> eggs<00:02:08.910> off<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.690> they

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
they buy the eggs off of you and they

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.530 
they buy the eggs off of you and they
split<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.410> profits<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.070> guess<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.580> selling

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
split the profits I guess of selling

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.199 
split the profits I guess of selling
them<00:02:13.010> this<00:02:14.010> size<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.459> bought<00:02:14.670> each<00:02:14.940> one<00:02:15.120> of

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
them this size I bought each one of

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.440 
them this size I bought each one of
these<00:02:15.300> for<00:02:15.540> $59<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:19.380> if<00:02:19.650> one<00:02:20.489> of<00:02:20.610> them<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:21.000> a

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
these for $59 and if one of them is a

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.949 
these for $59 and if one of them is a
male<00:02:22.050> if<00:02:22.620> they're<00:02:23.610> both<00:02:23.790> if<00:02:24.330> they're<00:02:24.750> both

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
male if they're both if they're both

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.860 
male if they're both if they're both
females<00:02:27.470> I<00:02:28.470> could<00:02:29.160> get<00:02:29.400> another<00:02:29.760> male<00:02:30.180> because

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
females I could get another male because

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.580 
females I could get another male because
one<00:02:31.140> male<00:02:31.410> impregnates<00:02:32.280> ten<00:02:32.760> females<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:34.560> I

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
one male impregnates ten females so I

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.170 
one male impregnates ten females so I
could<00:02:34.950> just<00:02:35.130> get<00:02:35.220> twice<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.489> babies<00:02:36.000> if

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
could just get twice the babies if

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.400 
could just get twice the babies if
they're<00:02:36.300> both<00:02:36.450> females<00:02:36.930> if<00:02:37.110> they're<00:02:37.230> both

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
they're both females if they're both

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.330 
they're both females if they're both
males<00:02:39.140> well<00:02:40.140> then<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.470> would<00:02:40.590> be<00:02:40.709> hard<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.130> add

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
males well then it would be hard to add

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.490 
males well then it would be hard to add
a<00:02:41.730> female<00:02:42.239> in<00:02:42.480> there<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:42.690> guess<00:02:42.989> because<00:02:43.200> they

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
a female in there I guess because they

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.289 
a female in there I guess because they
could<00:02:43.680> get<00:02:43.830> territorial<00:02:44.989> but<00:02:47.060> either<00:02:48.060> way

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
could get territorial but either way

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.650 
could get territorial but either way
they<00:02:48.540> are<00:02:48.660> some<00:02:48.870> cool<00:02:49.049> creatures
