why<00:00:21.560> the<00:00:21.620> scary<00:00:22.130> music<00:00:22.790> well<00:00:23.300> if<00:00:23.570> you've<00:00:23.750> ever

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
why the scary music well if you've ever

you've<00:00:26.180> probably<00:00:26.630> got<00:00:27.110> some<00:00:27.140> experience<00:00:27.950> with

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
you've probably got some experience with

you've probably got some experience with

nests whatever you call it it's no fun
and<00:00:40.430> it<00:00:40.879> keeps<00:00:41.030> a<00:00:41.210> lot<00:00:41.390> of<00:00:41.540> people<00:00:41.870> from

and it keeps a lot of people from

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.229 
and it keeps a lot of people from
fishing<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:42.559> best<00:00:42.770> that<00:00:42.949> they<00:00:43.040> could<00:00:43.100> be<00:00:43.430> but

thanks to some new engineering and some
pretty<00:00:46.610> smart<00:00:46.910> people<00:00:47.030> that<00:00:47.870> all<00:00:48.050> changes

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
pretty smart people that all changes

starting<00:00:49.340> with<00:00:49.370> this<00:00:51.760> this<00:00:52.760> is<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:53.390> enigma

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
starting with this this is the enigma

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.440 
starting with this this is the enigma
bait<00:00:54.110> cast<00:00:54.440> reel<00:00:54.770> it<00:00:55.219> has<00:00:55.550> something<00:00:55.880> called<00:00:56.059> a

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
bait cast reel it has something called a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.139 
bait cast reel it has something called a
smart<00:00:56.899> cat<00:00:57.110> system<00:00:57.680> and<00:00:58.280> it's<00:00:58.520> amazing<00:00:59.059> that's

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
smart cat system and it's amazing that's

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.850 
smart cat system and it's amazing that's
how<00:00:59.390> easy<00:00:59.420> it<00:00:59.899> is<00:01:00.200> almost<00:01:01.870> it's<00:01:02.870> true<00:01:03.230> and<00:01:03.500> I'm

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
how easy it is almost it's true and I'm

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.859 
how easy it is almost it's true and I'm
gonna<00:01:04.009> show<00:01:04.250> you<00:01:04.309> how<00:01:04.550> it<00:01:04.670> works<00:01:04.879> with<00:01:05.690> this

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
gonna show you how it works with this

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.290 
gonna show you how it works with this
reel<00:01:06.170> using<00:01:06.619> a<00:01:06.830> bait<00:01:07.039> caster<00:01:07.280> will<00:01:07.789> never<00:01:08.060> be

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
reel using a bait caster will never be

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.760 
reel using a bait caster will never be
safe<00:01:10.660> first<00:01:11.660> you<00:01:11.810> need<00:01:11.840> to<00:01:11.990> understand<00:01:12.530> why<00:01:12.710> an

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
safe first you need to understand why an

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.650 
safe first you need to understand why an
overrun<00:01:13.130> occurs<00:01:13.550> it's<00:01:14.060> because<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.509> first

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
overrun occurs it's because the first

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.480 
overrun occurs it's because the first
part<00:01:14.960> of<00:01:15.050> the<00:01:15.200> cast<00:01:15.410> makes<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.860> school<00:01:16.130> spin

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
part of the cast makes the school spin

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.850 
part of the cast makes the school spin
very<00:01:16.759> rapidly<00:01:17.180> but<00:01:17.780> sometimes<00:01:18.410> the<00:01:18.560> fishing

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
very rapidly but sometimes the fishing

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.590 
very rapidly but sometimes the fishing
line<00:01:18.890> stops<00:01:19.399> moving<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.210> real<00:01:20.360> keep

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600

you<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.299> breaking<00:01:29.659> system<00:01:29.840> in<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.320> reel<00:01:30.470> that

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
you the breaking system in the reel that

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.950 
you the breaking system in the reel that
floats<00:01:31.100> a<00:01:31.250> spinning<00:01:31.610> of<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.729> reel<00:01:31.939> down<00:01:32.210> but

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
floats a spinning of the reel down but

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.020 
floats a spinning of the reel down but
it<00:01:33.170> does<00:01:33.380> this<00:01:33.619> during<00:01:33.920> the<00:01:34.070> whole<00:01:34.310> cast<00:01:34.670> and

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
it does this during the whole cast and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.520 
it does this during the whole cast and
that<00:01:35.270> makes<00:01:35.540> it<00:01:35.689> harder<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:36.140> get<00:01:36.320> good

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
that makes it harder to get good

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.590 
that makes it harder to get good
distance<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.189> back<00:01:37.790> lashes<00:01:38.210> are<00:01:38.360> still<00:01:38.570> a

the<00:01:39.830> Enigma<00:01:40.070> reel<00:01:40.369> is<00:01:40.549> different<00:01:40.970> in<00:01:41.150> that<00:01:41.210> it

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
the Enigma reel is different in that it

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.080 
the Enigma reel is different in that it

that<00:01:44.299> works<00:01:44.450> is<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.720> first<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:45.080> the<00:01:45.110> cast<00:01:45.439> then

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
that works is the first of the cast then

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.530 
that works is the first of the cast then
another<00:01:46.430> that<00:01:46.670> works<00:01:46.850> at<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.119> end<00:01:47.270> of<00:01:47.450> the

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
freely giving you longer casts is less

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.109 
freely giving you longer casts is less

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119

a<00:01:56.390> bait<00:01:57.320> cast<00:01:57.619> reel<00:01:57.890> is<00:01:58.070> more<00:01:58.250> accurate<00:01:58.790> and

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
a bait cast reel is more accurate and

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.990 
a bait cast reel is more accurate and
powerful<00:01:59.210> in<00:01:59.720> those<00:01:59.900> fishing<00:02:00.259> situations<00:02:01.000> so

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
powerful in those fishing situations so

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.359
