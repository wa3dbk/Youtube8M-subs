00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello everyone with you shrimp today we 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.200
 consider a very cool mod which 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.300
 adds a bunch of all sorts of different doors like 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.550
 see these doors are too huge for 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.710
 normal minecraft, they are likely 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.580
 suitable for some cyclops or 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.890
 the giant 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.630
 these doors work as well as the most 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.240
 ordinary so the difference between them 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.519
 virtually no well apart from that 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.410
 that they are too huge though in many 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.539
 movies where the action takes place in 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.550
 Middle Ages doors are often 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.130
 much more than normal growth 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.680
 human but oh well it's not so 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.079
 important doors are added by this mod come in 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.270
 three types and they can consist of three 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.460
 different materials these doors can be 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.500
 large medium and small size 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.500
 they can consist of ferrous metal 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.570
 silver or wood also if we 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.149
 try to open this door to us 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.739
 write in chat the blaque gap is that 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.110
 literally translated as door 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.360
 locked locked on because 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.760
 that stands behind it's a block of stone 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.399
 if we break it then our door will be 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.589
 work again well also in order 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.750
 to break one of these doors to you 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.090
 need here is a hammer which 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.430
 called distraction Hammer for example 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.500
 let's break this door we take in 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.290
 hands this hammer and by simply pressing on 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.090
 right mouse button break this door 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.070
 Also in this fashion there is such 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.560
 fun wicket maybe you know 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.840
 such gates often stand somewhere on 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.180
 to American firms this gate can 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.520
 open both to the left and in 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.500
 right well and the last thing I wanted 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.780
 would you show this today 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.000
 the castle in which as you can see is not quite 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.100
 ordinary entrance and in order to enter 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.690
 we need to lower this lock 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.940
 bridge and in order to do this to us 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.800
 activate confuses from growling and as you see 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.420
 the bridge began to descend 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.940
 well and let me show you how to build 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.070
 and this mechanism to get you started 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.140
 you need absolutely any blocks 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.180
 build this arch then 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.250
 install a special mechanism on it 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.530
 which just will raise our 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.900
 the bridge but also after we need to put here 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.850
 a wooden plate well, thus 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.950
 the last thing left for us is just 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.170
 connect the wooden plate and the mechanism 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.450
 among themselves used here such 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.790
 grew up under the name connector well and now 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.800
 as you can see our brains are ready to go and 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.810
 the maximum we have to do is 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.420
 activate a special mechanism when 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.850
 help redstone well and basically it's all 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.070
 what is in this mod I'm on it with you 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.900

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.010
