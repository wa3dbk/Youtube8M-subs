00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello dear 1000 ps fans we test 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.580
 today for you four practical stylish 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.630
 scooter of the 300 cubic middle class with 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.330
 in the test crew are two of our 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.730
 200 interns left of me from you 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.560
 Tristan does not see the right 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.859
 sun the snow higher there for sure 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.369
 the first time martin from holland 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.099
 to my right to your left mine 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.410
 little and dear boss editor 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.410
 chaot wherever he is 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.420
 a 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.909
 No 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.760
 da j 300 from kawasaki is a very 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.940
 special scooter because kawasaki yes 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.800
 actually for good fast as well 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.450
 always known mainly motorcycles 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.730
 is now a role 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.590
 and he is not completely alone 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.300
 kawasaki you have to build now 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.540
 Immediately a kymco has arrived 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.400
 very much involved but on a large scale 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.230
 and quite positive 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.900
 because it's a very good one 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.390
 Scooter is he is with many people as 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.220
 I would like a very sporty scooter 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.770
 say because he really does 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.480
 Sporty is but that is also 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.580
 probably the really cool look 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.740
 looks very sharp looks very fast 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.600
 out has this typical kawasaki 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.070
 features of the slotted eyes 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.650
 front has just 28 ps for his 300th 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.860
 Kubik scooter is not bad 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.870
 but again 100 91 kilo and that is 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.940
 now not a lot that means it is 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.240
 have a certain mass to be moved 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.810
 the engine has to move 299 cubic meters 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.820
 So very close to these 300 and 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.500
 yes, what else is there to say overall 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.510
 he can say that later 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.860
 I'll be mine now 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.750
 ask interns like they do 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.180
 felt before I left there 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.220
 something tristan would rather say this 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.100
 animal fared with the year 300 he is 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.470
 really as athletic as I say 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.270
 already drive sporty so it is me 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.530
 say so I am with you on 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.680
 safest felt when I quickly around 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.380
 the corner is because I like the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.520
 sitting position is the child's health 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.959
 For example, the front wheel came to me 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.400
 not too far away you do not have that 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.320
 The more I feel that's where I found it 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.180
 pretty slutty and what I really like 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.130
 the first task is the 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.720
 kawasaki or is that rather little 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.070
 high quality processed from instead of that has 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.570
 one has to fall that one success 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.800
 that just does not look at all 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.420
 cheaper I thank you already now 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.090
 was close you was right what you 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.850
 Martin has decided to do it 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.769
 the energetic or find you 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.209
 find any points of criticism too 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.959
 quite sporty but also right 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.700
 comfortable 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.010
 hello the windshield and the stability 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.280
 is not really in my opinion 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.130
 the best in these 54 o'clock me 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.380
 find 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.310
 honestly also says that the comfort or 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.230
 the suspension tuning earlier 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.180
 but it is not comfortable now 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.430
 unsportsmanlike as well as by meant 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.080
 that you are in the curves very much with him 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.210
 feels comfortable or even happiest 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.680
 I can not help it 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.340
 say that's actually a good one 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.740
 Compromise 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.930
 and then very successful scooter 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.580
 even with a relatively large cargo space 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.580
 I would like to come straight to my heart 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.250
 before forgetting it will fit for sure 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.120
 two helmets may even be purely helmets 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.410
 smaller full sight and assess 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.870
 we could not quite out Print 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.090
 We do not have so many helmets 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.000
 colleague chews how did you find there 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.180
 300 when kawasaki makes scooter was clear 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.780
 that they are serious and serious 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.890
 mean 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.390
 you can see that for example on the 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.700
 small details or clutches and 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.710
 Brake lever can understand how 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.080
 usually with motorcycles or at 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.180
 many motorcycles also not the 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.880
 actually continue on a scooter 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.770
 are the same as the footpegs are not 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.140
 integrated in the lining as in 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.690
 the other but even of motorcycle 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.430
 Quasi free standing, I think so too 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.210
 that reminds me of a motorcycle in the sea 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.430
 can be in contrast to the sense now 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.200
 feet do not fall 45 degrees, so to speak 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.010
 You can only stretch your front 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.870
 Off 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.970
 you have enough space for that too 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.540
 my solve and a ferris wheel already 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.450
 not out somewhere or over 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:54.140
 second largest cargo space already mentioned 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:56.120
 on monday partly to the rubik find 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.250
 But I know that from Coco, too 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.580
 for other manufacturers for much more 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.050
 more expensive products engines built so the 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.570
 but most are until finally when to 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.330
 Listen to korean and taiwanese names 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.760
 that said but of course that's not 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.270
 as well as know and I think that's great 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.030
 high quality processed the surfaces 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.210
 there it was because I believe that even 34 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:23.330
 Color mark almost with the green 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.660
 then the matte black abs then I have 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.020
 the petrus design brake discs also like 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.610
 know that from the motorcycle 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.430
 Great, I think so 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.880
 a tinted windshield and then 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.820
 all that 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.900
 somehow really a real face must 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.240
 already says for us 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.520
 The only thing I find easier 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.810
 could be 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.510
 at the motorcycles they try too 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.670
 again and again a gram and kilo and 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.280
 that's just how it works 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.870
 but cheaper, he also agree so 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.960
 stable with that and that still has at the 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.180
 Camerawahrten notes so courageously with the 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.810
 otherwise we are not with the others 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:05.360
 the curve drive so you notice though 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.370
 kawasaki did not build it alone 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.300
 obviously they could do so much 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.790
 interfere 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.670
 that most likely a motorcycle 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.650
 would be there among the roland yes and miquel 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.960
 visually also very good I mean that there 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.330
 such a bit of this kawasaki green with 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.500
 is built-in just awesome that 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.400
 Fits that recognize immediately as 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.000
 kawasaki roll 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.620
 just this evil clear front the technology 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.230
 that works we are from kymco 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.050
 usual kawasaki has just one really 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.620
 good and nice role on the wheels 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.990
 posed 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.780
 thank you very much for giving me 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.810
 helped with the car and with 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:44.990
 the co moderation also dear katja 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.910
 if our meat is about you j 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:51.560
 300 just gave us one 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:53.900
 thumbs up and you can, of course 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.700
 also like to leave a comment if 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.350
 you do not like something or something 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.420
 I especially like something there 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.760
