00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello and welcome here 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.389
 pink panther and i play a round 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.910
 battlefield hotline raid and that is 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.530
 I believe the shortest round I 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.320
 played so far so it was real 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.330
 fix the matter we were not 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.710
 so many people now on the server 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.890
 maybe it was also because of that 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.900
 but has definitely made a mood 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.279
 have now times here ak u 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.580
 unlocked that's a bit 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.619
 stronger and can be in any case 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.430
 Play better than this 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.989
 At first I have weapons today 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.780

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.989

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.399
 Strange things happen so I have 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.500
 with a grenade launcher someone directly 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.850
 somehow he popped in front of his head and he is 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.489
 but still went on that was 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.079
