 Hello here it is that we now have a series of in their ranks 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:12.889
 and today it's lipstick on the Rhine 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.129
 Lieberknecht slightly exhausted again objectify 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.820
 To eliminate warnings for the same for Families 1 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.060
 I am doing this now by suspicious placed companies 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.230
 who I am second fastest 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.839
 in a day with light and 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.529
 Stringer 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.770
 It does not seem to often find their business keeps me sleeping hours 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.230
 Today I have my other hobbies of children just that the 24 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.430
 deal with 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.590
 but that's all 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.730
 it could be for him 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.790
 as mine distracts in the Europa League sink 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.480
 Most of you in the same chamber do not know that 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.890
 that's on 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.830
 after more beautiful 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.400
 Rumors that even the packaging does not play bad 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.860
 make sense of it 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.960
 "But what should we have suffered the man so are always very 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.020
 of course 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.900
 "Some like it hot" or "Years ago 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.070
 and it has a bit harder to apply, so me 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.550
 Immediately are not 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.180
 that very pleasant on the lips 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.470
 yes because Max Semler Natanz powerful cases rose 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.930
 by Mike Schelhorn I forgot to use the fourth piece or so 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.060
 they never really 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.430
 really nothing 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.010
 but supposedly to break there is still good to come to the thorough 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.010
 Kirsten business services were year 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.940
 I'd rather be so scared and 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.050
 and then filled after the "bio" -sprit is not so good now 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.050
 because he always took me back when he retired 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.429
 I have throat tan-list lipsticks from the NBA 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.700

 two classmates Görlich Canan surfaces are somewhere behind now 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.080
 reliable 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.020
 or does he have the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.029
 Shorten CAD employees or be right Schick concludes States of Tara m 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.539
 to bring the market that was the graduation ceremony 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.709
 really cool finch 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.429
 with us in the live ticker 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.769
 there was nothing in addition to the picture 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.409
 this technology board Ulrich blatantly applied 2 1 billion in part 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.559
 Simply Vellberg extreme case is just perfect 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.040

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.839
 Einstein have been registered 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:34.639
 the otherwise so strict Mamsell likes to be equally consistent 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.219
 I still have something that counts 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.599
 040 Kozuch but again when braking 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.219
 I would never fail that unfortunately does not work out that way 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.219
 but of course also liked 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:57.559
 Company figures are relatively new is that of Qigong 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.109
 This shows the packaging is a nice feeling 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.049
 Protestants 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.749
 also on possible sanctions 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:08.879
 but he was so the detention 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.530
 So I think CEST is easy to calculate Steffen «I want that now 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:16.590
 See dealer at the Tripoli so even the liability 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.069
 and so has Wikipedia and Dr 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.289
 hastily I had driven myself 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:26.269
 she is but also of barriers 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.689
 2k too, so I'm table manners 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.689
 to train him Stephan Atchison beautiful 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.049
 until then the decisive support 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.490
 as I said 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.389
 As he is teammate piece of concessions to me after others is super 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.389

 the two injured other cities gets dry from the Brandenburg Hiddensee 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:06.559
 and then Swansea bragged to breed Märki Communists 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.520
 itchy it keeps playing when the EU became us 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.420
 maybe he would have 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.849
 with 70's 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.619

 after all, on the surface depth closes with 14 CAD Reset press 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:23.840
