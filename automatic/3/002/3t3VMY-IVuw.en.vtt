building the tools that I'm going to use
to<00:01:45.720> shape<00:01:45.899> behavior<00:01:46.079> later<00:01:46.560> right<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.040> they're

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
to shape behavior later right so they're

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.620 
to shape behavior later right so they're
learning<00:01:47.310> our<00:01:47.579> communication<00:01:48.149> system<00:01:48.450> and

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
learning our communication system and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.620 
learning our communication system and
they're<00:01:49.020> learning<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.740> follow<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.700> lure<00:01:51.060> right

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
they're learning to follow a lure right

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.179 
they're learning to follow a lure right
so<00:01:51.869> by<00:01:52.020> moving<00:01:52.229> my<00:01:52.320> hand<00:01:52.680> around<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:52.979> that

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
so by moving my hand around like that

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.190 
so by moving my hand around like that
and<00:01:53.250> getting<00:01:53.549> them<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.729> chase<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.210> I'm<00:01:54.390> moving

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
and getting them to chase it I'm moving

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.800 
and getting them to chase it I'm moving
them<00:01:55.439> into<00:01:55.860> their<00:01:56.159> body<00:01:56.399> around<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.659> that

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
them into their body around and so that

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.780 
them into their body around and so that
I<00:01:57.840> now<00:01:58.229> have<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> tool<00:01:58.680> for<00:01:58.890> manipulating<00:01:59.460> them

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
I now have a tool for manipulating them

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.730 
I now have a tool for manipulating them
into<00:02:00.420> positions<00:02:00.930> when<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.229> start<00:02:01.469> trying<00:02:01.619> to

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
into positions when I start trying to

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.679 
into positions when I start trying to
teach<00:02:01.920> them<00:02:02.070> something<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.939> they<00:02:03.060> know<00:02:03.450> what

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
teach them something so they know what

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.230 
teach them something so they know what
their<00:02:04.049> reward<00:02:04.710> markers<00:02:05.040> are<00:02:05.219> they<00:02:05.790> know<00:02:06.090> how

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
their reward markers are they know how

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.809 
their reward markers are they know how
to<00:02:06.270> follow<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.689> lure<00:02:06.960> they<00:02:07.649> stay<00:02:08.039> focused<00:02:08.489> on<00:02:08.610> me

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
to follow a lure they stay focused on me

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.949 
to follow a lure they stay focused on me
they<00:02:09.090> want<00:02:09.420> what<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.599> have

they want what I have

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.580 
they want what I have
they'll<00:02:10.679> tune<00:02:10.979> out<00:02:11.099> distraction

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
they'll tune out distraction

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.010 
they'll tune out distraction
now<00:02:13.220> teaching<00:02:13.790> them<00:02:13.910> stuff<00:02:14.000> this<00:02:14.390> goes<00:02:14.780> boom

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.900 
try to do is there's a balance between
letting<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.350> dogs<00:03:18.500> experience<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.280> world<00:03:19.519> so

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
letting the dogs experience the world so

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.699 
letting the dogs experience the world so
they're<00:03:20.030> comfortable<00:03:20.269> with<00:03:20.570> it<00:03:20.840> and<00:03:20.959> making

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
they're comfortable with it and making

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.490 
they're comfortable with it and making
engagement<00:03:22.700> with<00:03:22.820> me<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.269> one<00:03:24.140> of<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.290> things

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
engagement with me and one of the things

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.840 
engagement with me and one of the things
that<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.680> want<00:03:25.040> to<00:03:25.100> do<00:03:25.220> with<00:03:25.340> little<00:03:25.579> puppies<00:03:25.820> a

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
that I want to do with little puppies a

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.870 
that I want to do with little puppies a
lot<00:03:26.239> in<00:03:26.359> the<00:03:26.450> beginning<00:03:26.750> is<00:03:27.430> get<00:03:28.430> them<00:03:28.579> out<00:03:28.700> in

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
lot in the beginning is get them out in

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.210 
lot in the beginning is get them out in
a<00:03:28.940> lot<00:03:29.090> of<00:03:29.120> environments<00:03:29.359> and<00:03:29.920> take<00:03:30.920> their

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
a lot of environments and take their

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.670 
a lot of environments and take their
energy<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:31.910> channel<00:03:32.630> it<00:03:32.870> into<00:03:32.959> an<00:03:33.200> activity

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
energy and channel it into an activity

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.199 
energy and channel it into an activity
that's<00:03:33.799> a<00:03:33.920> productive<00:03:34.310> activity<00:03:34.760> for<00:03:34.910> me

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
that's a productive activity for me

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.330 
that's a productive activity for me
so<00:03:35.690> just<00:03:36.049> pairing<00:03:36.470> around<00:03:36.769> checking

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
so just pairing around checking

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.130 
so just pairing around checking
everything<00:03:37.640> out<00:03:37.880> chasing<00:03:38.299> leaves<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:38.959> stuff

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
everything out chasing leaves and stuff

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.020 
everything out chasing leaves and stuff
is<00:03:39.350> not<00:03:39.799> a<00:03:39.829> productive<00:03:40.220> one<00:03:40.489> for<00:03:40.700> me

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
is not a productive one for me

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.910 
is not a productive one for me
the<00:03:41.450> dogs<00:03:41.600> having<00:03:41.870> fun<00:03:42.079> they<00:03:42.350> like<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.709> they<00:03:42.859> do

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
the dogs having fun they like it they do

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.170 
the dogs having fun they like it they do
burn<00:03:43.160> off<00:03:43.280> energy<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:43.700> sometimes<00:03:43.880> it's

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
burn off energy and sometimes it's

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.059 
burn off energy and sometimes it's
necessary<00:03:44.299> to<00:03:45.200> let<00:03:45.350> the<00:03:45.500> dog<00:03:45.620> get<00:03:45.799> a<00:03:45.859> little

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
necessary to let the dog get a little

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:47.680 
necessary to let the dog get a little
something<00:03:46.400> a<00:03:46.430> little<00:03:46.730> bit<00:03:46.850> out<00:03:47.120> of<00:03:47.480> their

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
something a little bit out of their

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.509 
something a little bit out of their
system<00:03:48.019> before<00:03:48.170> I<00:03:48.319> start<00:03:48.530> working<00:03:48.709> for<00:03:49.370> them

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
system before I start working for them

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.009 
system before I start working for them
to<00:03:49.700> kind<00:03:49.880> of<00:03:49.940> settle<00:03:50.180> down<00:03:50.389> in<00:03:50.569> their<00:03:50.690> head<00:03:50.840> and

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
to kind of settle down in their head and

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.270 
to kind of settle down in their head and
sometimes<00:03:51.230> it's<00:03:51.500> necessary<00:03:51.920> but<00:03:52.010> I<00:03:52.069> would

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
sometimes it's necessary but I would

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.490 
sometimes it's necessary but I would
prefer<00:03:52.670> to<00:03:52.970> take<00:03:53.359> that<00:03:53.540> energy<00:03:53.690> and<00:03:54.049> say<00:03:54.200> hey

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
prefer to take that energy and say hey

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.830 
prefer to take that energy and say hey
why<00:03:55.010> don't<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.220> put<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.400> into<00:03:55.700> this<00:03:55.850> and<00:03:56.180> we

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
why don't you put it into this and we

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.569 
why don't you put it into this and we
play<00:03:57.109> something<00:03:57.530> together<00:03:57.980> whether<00:03:58.400> it's

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
play something together whether it's

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.430 
play something together whether it's
chase<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.940> food<00:03:59.120> or<00:03:59.450> it's<00:03:59.569> with<00:03:59.870> a<00:03:59.900> toy<00:04:00.109> or

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
chase the food or it's with a toy or

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.080 
chase the food or it's with a toy or
whatever<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:00.920> is<00:04:00.950> right<00:04:01.100> and<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:01.819> take<00:04:02.060> that

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
whatever it is right and I take that

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.840 
whatever it is right and I take that
energy<00:04:02.389> and<00:04:02.720> make<00:04:02.870> a<00:04:02.900> game<00:04:03.200> from<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:03.859> that<00:04:04.579> I'll

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
energy and make a game from it that I'll

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.879 
energy and make a game from it that I'll
be<00:04:05.090> able<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.299> use<00:04:05.389> later<00:04:05.750> so<00:04:06.290> now<00:04:06.500> they<00:04:06.739> come

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
be able to use later so now they come

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:08.199 
be able to use later so now they come
out<00:04:07.010> and<00:04:07.160> they're<00:04:07.250> really<00:04:07.280> pumped<00:04:07.790> up<00:04:07.940> and

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
out and they're really pumped up and

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.120 
out and they're really pumped up and
they<00:04:08.840> have<00:04:09.019> all<00:04:09.139> this<00:04:09.230> energy<00:04:09.380> and<00:04:09.590> I<00:04:09.799> say<00:04:09.980> hey

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
they have all this energy and I say hey

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.580 
they have all this energy and I say hey
how<00:04:10.310> about<00:04:10.340> we<00:04:10.549> put<00:04:10.700> that<00:04:10.790> into<00:04:10.970> obedience

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
how about we put that into obedience

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.809 
how about we put that into obedience
instead<00:04:12.590> of<00:04:12.769> saying<00:04:13.040> okay<00:04:13.280> burn<00:04:13.670> off<00:04:13.790> your

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
instead of saying okay burn off your

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.640 
instead of saying okay burn off your
energy<00:04:14.030> now<00:04:14.569> we'll<00:04:14.810> do<00:04:14.900> obedience<00:04:15.380> where

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
energy now we'll do obedience where

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:16.469 
energy now we'll do obedience where
you're<00:04:15.829> like<00:04:15.980> okay

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
you're like okay

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.420 
you're like okay
obedience<00:04:17.479> whatever<00:04:17.780> right<00:04:18.169> and<00:04:18.350> so<00:04:18.950> it's

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
obedience whatever right and so it's

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.420 
obedience whatever right and so it's
channeling<00:04:20.120> of<00:04:20.239> those<00:04:21.229> those<00:04:21.890> energies<00:04:22.310> and

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
channeling of those those energies and

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.190 
channeling of those those energies and
intensities<00:04:22.909> into<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.419> right<00:04:23.659> activities

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
intensities into the right activities

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.470 
intensities into the right activities
like<00:04:24.680> what<00:04:25.070> I<00:04:25.099> like<00:04:25.280> to<00:04:25.400> call<00:04:25.580> it<00:04:25.849> with

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
like what I like to call it with

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.330 
like what I like to call it with
with<00:04:26.600> most<00:04:26.780> of<00:04:26.870> our<00:04:26.960> working<00:04:27.260> dogs<00:04:27.680> they're

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
with most of our working dogs they're

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.170 
with most of our working dogs they're
slightly<00:04:29.800> obsessive-compulsive<00:04:30.800> right<00:04:31.700> they

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
slightly obsessive-compulsive right they

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.270 
slightly obsessive-compulsive right they
get<00:04:32.630> obsessed<00:04:33.230> with<00:04:33.470> certain<00:04:33.830> physical

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
get obsessed with certain physical

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.190 
get obsessed with certain physical
activities<00:04:34.880> like<00:04:35.150> lots<00:04:35.390> of<00:04:35.540> chase<00:04:35.810> prey

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
activities like lots of chase prey

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.630 
activities like lots of chase prey
behaviors<00:04:36.680> that<00:04:36.830> kind<00:04:36.980> of<00:04:37.040> stuff<00:04:37.220> right<00:04:37.340> so

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
behaviors that kind of stuff right so

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.790 
behaviors that kind of stuff right so
the<00:04:37.880> dogs<00:04:38.030> want<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:38.270> chase<00:04:38.450> everything<00:04:39.110> but

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
the dogs want to chase everything but

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.350 
the dogs want to chase everything but
they<00:04:40.220> want<00:04:40.430> to<00:04:40.490> do<00:04:40.700> that<00:04:40.850> and<00:04:41.000> if<00:04:41.060> you<00:04:41.150> let<00:04:41.330> them

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
they want to do that and if you let them

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.600 
they want to do that and if you let them
rehearse<00:04:41.780> it<00:04:42.020> they'll<00:04:42.470> become<00:04:42.650> obsessed<00:04:43.520> with

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
rehearse it they'll become obsessed with

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.100 
rehearse it they'll become obsessed with
whatever<00:04:43.970> that<00:04:44.120> is<00:04:44.270> so<00:04:44.450> if<00:04:44.720> it's<00:04:44.900> chasing

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
whatever that is so if it's chasing

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.260 
whatever that is so if it's chasing
birds<00:04:45.410> in<00:04:45.650> your<00:04:45.680> backyard<00:04:46.250> or<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:46.790> neighbor's

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
birds in your backyard or the neighbor's

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.500 
birds in your backyard or the neighbor's
cat<00:04:47.510> or<00:04:47.990> whatever<00:04:48.740> they<00:04:49.340> really<00:04:50.030> quickly

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
cat or whatever they really quickly

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.570 
cat or whatever they really quickly
latch<00:04:50.720> onto<00:04:50.990> something<00:04:51.350> and<00:04:51.440> say<00:04:51.530> ah<00:04:51.680> this<00:04:52.370> is
