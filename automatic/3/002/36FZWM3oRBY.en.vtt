the<00:02:08.619> water

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
the water

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.160 
the water
pick<00:02:10.209> up<00:02:10.450> your<00:02:10.720> piece<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:12.489> then<00:02:13.420> just<00:02:13.900> stick

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
pick up your piece and then just stick

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.570 
pick up your piece and then just stick
it<00:02:14.319> where<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.739> want<00:02:15.010> it

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
it where you want it

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.870 
it where you want it
and<00:02:17.290> then<00:02:18.290> you're<00:02:18.500> going<00:02:18.770> to<00:02:18.920> do<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.310> with

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
and then you're going to do that with

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.370 
and then you're going to do that with
the<00:02:20.030> other<00:02:20.180> one<00:02:20.270> also

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:43.210 

okay

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.760 

and<00:02:43.310> there<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.060> go<00:02:44.200> once<00:02:45.200> you've<00:02:45.440> done<00:02:45.710> that

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
and there you go once you've done that

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.840 
and there you go once you've done that
you<00:02:46.190> can<00:02:46.220> create<00:02:46.790> her<00:02:47.210> nose<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:48.520> little<00:02:49.520> bit<00:02:49.730> of

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
you can create her nose a little bit of

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.180 
you can create her nose a little bit of
water<00:02:50.090> again<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:50.900> what<00:02:51.380> I'm<00:02:51.500> using<00:02:51.710> for<00:02:51.920> her

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
water again and what I'm using for her

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.680 
water again and what I'm using for her
nose<00:02:52.400> is<00:02:52.730> basically<00:02:53.330> just<00:02:53.980> some<00:02:55.660> candies<00:02:56.660> that

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
nose is basically just some candies that

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.430 
nose is basically just some candies that
I<00:02:56.930> bought<00:02:57.350> at<00:02:57.830> Walmart<00:02:59.050> they're<00:03:00.050> like<00:03:00.230> they

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
I bought at Walmart they're like they

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.680 
I bought at Walmart they're like they
look<00:03:00.470> like<00:03:00.860> this<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.640> basically<00:03:02.360> they're

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
look like this and basically they're

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:10.570 
look like this and basically they're
just<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:03.230> little<00:03:03.830> round<00:03:05.020> candy<00:03:09.100> for<00:03:10.100> this<00:03:10.280> maybe

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
just a little round candy for this maybe

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.890 
just a little round candy for this maybe
it's<00:03:10.820> gonna<00:03:10.970> be<00:03:11.180> a<00:03:11.210> little<00:03:11.390> bit<00:03:11.630> more

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
it's gonna be a little bit more

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.930 
it's gonna be a little bit more
difficult<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:12.740> you<00:03:12.800> can<00:03:13.100> use<00:03:13.280> a<00:03:13.310> little<00:03:13.580> bit<00:03:13.730> of

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
difficult so you can use a little bit of

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.620 
difficult so you can use a little bit of
the<00:03:14.120> chocolate<00:03:14.360> that<00:03:14.990> you<00:03:15.110> had<00:03:15.290> melted<00:03:16.630> and

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
the chocolate that you had melted and

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.890 
the chocolate that you had melted and
then<00:03:18.020> just<00:03:18.680> dip<00:03:18.890> it<00:03:19.090> goes<00:03:20.090> with<00:03:20.330> water<00:03:20.630> and

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
then just dip it goes with water and

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.260 
then just dip it goes with water and
notice<00:03:21.230> it's<00:03:21.440> not<00:03:21.530> gonna<00:03:21.970> then<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.090> have

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
notice it's not gonna then you have

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.930 
notice it's not gonna then you have
something<00:03:23.570> look<00:03:23.720> like<00:03:23.750> it's<00:03:24.020> like<00:03:24.170> this<00:03:24.350> and

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
something look like it's like this and

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.490 
something look like it's like this and
then<00:03:25.940> you're<00:03:26.120> ready<00:03:26.300> to<00:03:26.600> make<00:03:26.750> that<00:03:26.810> whiskers

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
then you're ready to make that whiskers

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.470 
then you're ready to make that whiskers
is<00:03:27.680> going<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.100> be<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.370> same<00:03:28.550> technique<00:03:28.970> as<00:03:29.180> the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
is going to be the same technique as the

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.720 
is going to be the same technique as the
eyes<00:03:29.660> so<00:03:30.500> you're<00:03:30.890> gonna<00:03:30.980> put<00:03:31.250> a<00:03:31.280> little<00:03:31.459> bit<00:03:31.640> of

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
eyes so you're gonna put a little bit of

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.140 
eyes so you're gonna put a little bit of
water

water
the<00:03:32.930> first<00:03:33.170> whisker<00:03:33.620> always<00:03:34.040> starts<00:03:34.400> near<00:03:34.790> the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
the first whisker always starts near the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.860 
the first whisker always starts near the
eye<00:03:35.180> and<00:03:35.750> then<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.709> nose<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.430> then<00:03:37.730> down<00:03:38.000> so<00:03:38.840> I

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
advance and I basically just used

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.060 
advance and I basically just used
fondant<00:04:01.959> but<00:04:02.959> a<00:04:03.019> lot<00:04:03.380> of<00:04:03.530> people<00:04:04.040> just<00:04:04.510> use

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
fondant but a lot of people just use

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.640 
fondant but a lot of people just use
edible<00:04:07.070> markers<00:04:08.110> then<00:04:09.110> I'm<00:04:09.200> gonna<00:04:09.320> show<00:04:09.590> you

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
edible markers then I'm gonna show you

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:16.010 
edible markers then I'm gonna show you
in<00:04:09.860> a<00:04:09.950> bit<00:04:09.980> what<00:04:10.970> they<00:04:11.150> look<00:04:11.390> like

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.970 

so<00:04:17.010> see<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.580> get<00:04:17.850> something<00:04:18.450> like<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.680> and

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
so see you get something like that and

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.290 
so see you get something like that and
then<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:20.310> do<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.580> same<00:04:20.760> thing<00:04:21.000> on<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.270> other

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:21.300 
then you do the same thing on the other

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.920 
then you do the same thing on the other
side<00:04:21.660> but<00:04:22.290> you<00:04:22.410> can<00:04:22.590> also<00:04:22.830> use<00:04:23.510> these<00:04:24.510> if

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
side but you can also use these if

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.200 
side but you can also use these if
you're<00:04:25.410> not<00:04:25.590> comfortable<00:04:25.950> with<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.730> font<00:04:27.000> on

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
you're not comfortable with the font on

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.150 
you're not comfortable with the font on
because<00:04:27.630> it's<00:04:27.780> it's<00:04:28.260> little<00:04:28.590> pieces<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:28.980> you

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
because it's it's little pieces and you

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.490 
because it's it's little pieces and you
kind<00:04:29.490> of<00:04:29.580> need<00:04:29.730> a<00:04:29.760> little<00:04:30.000> bit<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.500> practice

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
kind of need a little bit of practice
