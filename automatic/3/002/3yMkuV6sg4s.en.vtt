00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.160
 hello and welcome to modellbau 126 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.430
 so I have another video and you 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.580
 shown to the bmw by me and now show 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.630
 i also like the patterns of klaus 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.489
 police model as you can see 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.270
 and yes and a little bit of 30 to none 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.890
 but we have two individual 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.600
 blue light on the roof of the claus becomes 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.800
 you certainly one or the other 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.420
 can say more about it or me 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.870
 correct if I something wrong scene 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.269
 what a really big class is he klaus 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.620
 has full headlights 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:50.300
 let in the stickers quasi 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.969
 could the teeth I think so would have 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.370
 you can see that is natural 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.129
 really right so yes which one 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.019
 Metal headlights can do that 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.600
 Somewhat, therefore, I know I hope 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.499
 that's a bit like that 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.940
 difficult but that should actually 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:12.950
 fit with it so I have since you become her 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:15.890
 See what you want, where is mine? 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.140
 hello because my model is at 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.159
 not so much light blocked as 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.159
 at the alex but I'm very proud of it 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.439
 on it as well as here the light is over 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.600
 the remote control, a switchable 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.490
 this is the basic version here too 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.890
 switches are installed 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.299
 I decided to go back 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.090
 So they are built in the back 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.920
 Unfortunately there are still a few LEDs and we are missing 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:45.590
 The really see then but that comes 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:48.200
 still to turn on the light 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.930
 quasi this switch then he may as 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.430
 It was like that when he was 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.119
 That's how it works when you look at the others 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.750
 surfaces and flash underbody is now 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.750
 normal 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.970
 and of course with me the siren 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.150
 switchable what is also to 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.640
 Police cars are probably still one 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.870
 couple of blue light after in the disc with 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.310
 came in 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.730
 Unfortunately, these are not yet 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:43.620
 mounted ok we look at it all the time 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:46.220
 change suspected to have to 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.220
 stick 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.709
 klaus the whole story has of course 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.360
 wonderfully cleaned up he got it right 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.100
 put effort in laying the cable 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.069
 but we have here as one and 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.430
 so switch out very well out of need 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.810
 taken high and a switch dollar 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.310
 and with that I can do it all with the aux 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.230
 I can connect to the remote control 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.450
 turn that on and off then have the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.760
 whole electronics box the care for it 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.820
 as the individual judge addressed 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.769
 which is also very big class 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.630
 If we put these lamps in the back of the box 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.880
 clowns made of carbon itself because 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.109
 The LEDs introduced is a very great 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.680
 thing now you can see it still last 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.820
 holes in it when we recognize that and 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.769
 behind it is the LEDs 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.430
 used and then glued finished 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.430
 as for me the 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.489
 underbody lighting the siren 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.940
 the power supply is 9 volt blog the 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:44.970
 is completely sufficient for the whole 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.980
 it can also say the slices 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.820
 are separated so from the outside black 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:54.000
 but you want translucent with auto 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.070
 tinted film it has such a 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.170
 right car in the previous year 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.750
 and that works wonderfully so very much 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:08.480
 a lot of tangles 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.480
 Here is the siren of this clinic 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.540
 such a little tip if you 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.150
 hot glue on the body directly on it 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.650
 there should be something there should I 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.580
 do something wrong deduct 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.680
 the paint of the body therefore travels 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.100
 So everywhere we have two-sided 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.500
 used adhesive tape and that is called 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.570
 everyone sticks the cable with it as well 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.229
 you can see that everywhere, yes , yes 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.320
 that there are connections to the vehicle 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:43.030
 here you can see it everywhere that just 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.970
 do not stick the hot glue directly on 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.310
 The body around easy to avoid 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.100
 that the paint is peeled off with 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.260
 something needs to be corrected 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.990
 useful tip yes I hope you 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.370
 like the patterns as I said if you 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.770
 and what to ask you suggestions 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.169
 whatever ideas as well as at 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.169
 my bmw just in the comments I 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.520
 try on every little one yet 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.200
 to answer a little comment 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.370
 that will be absolutely nonsense then 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.680
 I do not answer that will happen 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.410
 see and these comments disappear 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.169
 So also some needs so 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.630
 I do not even write when flying out 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:22.240
 otherwise we would like to write fans 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.130
 comments even if you give us the 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.060
 Body are completely hand worked 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.960
 so painted and the whole in rheine 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.639
 built themselves 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.139
 that means we are pretty pretty 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:37.270
 everybody has to be proud of himself 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.639
 preferences build as we think 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.450
 I think we have ours 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.220
 tastes hit hard 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.840
 there is one or the other what you have 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.160
 but can improve from the big and 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.229
 I'm very happy with that 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:54.880
 what has become of it and I think 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:55.810
 that fits quite well then we wish 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.450
 you all the best 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.190
 if you have questions ask me exactly 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.500
 I hope you enjoyed the video and 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:06.510
 See you next time 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.510
 it works well on model 126 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:58.770
 listen 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.110
 O 

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:01.009
 front
