pretty soon these brackets bolt up using

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.450 
pretty soon these brackets bolt up using
the<00:00:24.480> factory<00:00:24.900> hardware<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:26.039> mounts<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
the factory hardware that mounts the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.589 
the factory hardware that mounts the
windshield<00:00:27.590> really<00:00:28.590> slick<00:00:28.830> setup<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:30.330> will

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
windshield really slick setup it will

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.120 
windshield really slick setup it will
put<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.019> right<00:00:31.230> up<00:00:31.380> against<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.710> painted

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
put this right up against that painted

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.350 
put this right up against that painted
surface<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.610> we're<00:00:32.700> going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.880> use<00:00:33.030> some

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
surface so we're going to use some

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.220 
surface so we're going to use some
closed<00:00:33.780> cell<00:00:34.050> foam<00:00:34.610> to<00:00:35.610> separate<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> two

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
closed cell foam to separate the two

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.420 
closed cell foam to separate the two
it's<00:00:37.230> important<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.770> use<00:00:37.800> something

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
it's important that you use something

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.709 
it's important that you use something
like<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.579> closed<00:00:38.879> cell<00:00:39.120> because<00:00:39.420> it'll<00:00:39.629> keep

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
like a closed cell because it'll keep

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.360 
like a closed cell because it'll keep
the<00:00:39.870> water<00:00:40.110> from<00:00:40.350> soaking<00:00:40.710> into<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.219> like<00:00:41.309> a

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the water from soaking into it like a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.610 
the water from soaking into it like a
sponge<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.480> know<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:43.020> will<00:00:43.110> repel<00:00:43.350> water

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
sponge and you know it will repel water

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.529 
sponge and you know it will repel water
more<00:00:43.860> than<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> let<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.430> capillary<00:00:45.300> action

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
more than the let in capillary action

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.540 
more than the let in capillary action
will<00:00:45.840> soak<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> water<00:00:46.410> into<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.010> middle<00:00:47.370> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
will soak the water into the middle and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.740 
will soak the water into the middle and
hold<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.940> up<00:00:48.000> against<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.239> paint<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.719> don't

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
hold it up against that paint you don't

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.270 
hold it up against that paint you don't
want<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.590> will<00:00:49.770> keep<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.219> from

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
want that so this will keep that from

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.869 
want that so this will keep that from
happening

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
happening

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.630 
happening
we<00:00:51.329> limited<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.930> foam<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:53.129> this<00:00:53.250> distance

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
we limited the foam to this distance

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.939 
we limited the foam to this distance
because<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.059> actually<00:00:54.300> comes<00:00:54.629> away<00:00:54.870> from

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
because this actually comes away from

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.110 
because this actually comes away from
the<00:00:55.949> rest<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> painted<00:00:56.489> surface<00:00:56.760> up<00:00:56.910> here

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the rest of the painted surface up here

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.389 
the rest of the painted surface up here
and<00:00:57.360> spreads<00:00:57.660> out<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> little<00:00:58.020> bit<00:00:58.250> this<00:00:59.250> will

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
and spreads out a little bit this will

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.970 
and spreads out a little bit this will
keep<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.699> from<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.359> know<00:01:00.559> giving<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.649> an<00:01:01.739> area

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
keep it from you know giving it an area

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.229 
keep it from you know giving it an area
for<00:01:02.309> water<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.699> get<00:01:02.820> down<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.120> there

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
for water to get down in there

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.329 
for water to get down in there
everywhere<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.769> painted<00:01:05.040> surface

we've<00:01:06.780> got<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.080> phone<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.710> we<00:01:07.830> obviously

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
we've got this phone and we obviously

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.640 
we've got this phone and we obviously
cut<00:01:08.909> around<00:01:09.150> for<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.390> screw<00:01:09.600> holes<00:01:09.780> make<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
cut around for the screw holes make a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.120 
cut around for the screw holes make a
little<00:01:10.830> easier<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.189> mount<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.689> these<00:01:12.689> are<00:01:12.840> the
