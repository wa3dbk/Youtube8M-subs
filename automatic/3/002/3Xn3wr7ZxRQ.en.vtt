00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
the movie or show yeah I guess this is

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.580 
the movie or show yeah I guess this is
how<00:02:38.819> it<00:02:38.909> works<00:02:41.989> it's<00:02:42.989> interesting<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.560> should

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
how it works it's interesting you should

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.830 
how it works it's interesting you should
have<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.250> way<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.430> type<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.000> in<00:02:45.150> I'd<00:02:45.420> like

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
have it the way you type it in I'd like

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:55.509 
have it the way you type it in I'd like
that<00:02:46.079> more<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.650> think<00:02:47.219> that'd<00:02:47.430> be<00:02:47.579> better<00:02:54.109> so

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
that more I think that'd be better so

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.369 
that more I think that'd be better so
you<00:02:56.519> could<00:02:56.669> buy<00:02:56.849> movies<00:02:57.419> straight<00:02:57.959> from<00:02:58.079> here

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
you could buy movies straight from here

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.080 
you could buy movies straight from here
I<00:02:58.650> guess<00:02:58.950> it's<00:02:59.129> like<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.459> video<00:02:59.760> store<00:03:00.030> and

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
I guess it's like the video store and

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.520 
I guess it's like the video store and
playstation<00:03:00.780> store<00:03:01.400> except<00:03:02.400> it's<00:03:03.030> like<00:03:03.719> has<00:03:04.500> a

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
playstation store except it's like has a
