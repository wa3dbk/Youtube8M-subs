00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
from that it's a good great aesthetic

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.200 
from that it's a good great aesthetic

of heat throughout the night is the

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.350 
of heat throughout the night is the

ideal location for it apart from that

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.680 
ideal location for it apart from that
you<00:01:50.420> have<00:01:50.540> internal<00:01:51.260> thermal<00:01:51.710> walls<00:01:52.690> so

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
you have internal thermal walls so

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.080 
you have internal thermal walls so
anything<00:01:54.110> that's<00:01:54.200> sort<00:01:54.410> of<00:01:54.470> in<00:01:55.220> shaded<00:01:55.790> areas

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
anything that's sort of in shaded areas

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.719 
anything that's sort of in shaded areas
preferably<00:01:56.540> from<00:01:56.750> say<00:01:57.140> behind<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:57.710> heater<00:01:58.460> and

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
preferably from say behind a heater and

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.700 
preferably from say behind a heater and
have<00:01:59.450> that<00:01:59.630> heat<00:01:59.810> storage<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:00.470> then<00:02:00.560> that

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
have that heat storage and then that

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.870 
have that heat storage and then that
slow<00:02:00.950> release<00:02:01.220> of<00:02:01.340> heat<00:02:01.460> throughout<00:02:01.729> the

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
slow release of heat throughout the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.140 
slow release of heat throughout the
night<00:02:02.470> it<00:02:03.470> can<00:02:03.590> also<00:02:03.770> be<00:02:03.979> used<00:02:04.190> in<00:02:04.369> fire<00:02:04.880> prone

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
night it can also be used in fire prone

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.730 
night it can also be used in fire prone
areas<00:02:05.510> because<00:02:05.780> it<00:02:05.810> is<00:02:05.990> fire<00:02:06.229> resistant

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
areas because it is fire resistant

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.919 
areas because it is fire resistant
material<00:02:06.800> the<00:02:07.490> CSIRO<00:02:08.060> gives<00:02:08.300> it<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.600> maximum

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
material the CSIRO gives it the maximum

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.160 
material the CSIRO gives it the maximum
fire<00:02:09.289> rating<00:02:10.150> so<00:02:11.150> if<00:02:11.450> you're<00:02:11.630> in<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.750> fire<00:02:11.930> prone

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
fire rating so if you're in a fire prone

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.190 
fire rating so if you're in a fire prone
area<00:02:12.380> it's<00:02:12.500> also<00:02:12.620> an<00:02:13.280> ideal<00:02:13.670> material<00:02:14.000> for<00:02:14.300> use

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
area it's also an ideal material for use

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.420 
area it's also an ideal material for use
there<00:02:16.540> basically<00:02:17.540> anywhere<00:02:17.989> where<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:18.440> want

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
there basically anywhere where you want

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.120 
there basically anywhere where you want
to<00:02:19.580> regulate<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.840> heat<00:02:20.989> in<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.380> house<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:21.890> the

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
to regulate the heat in the house is the
