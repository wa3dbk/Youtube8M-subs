Frankie<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.790> was<00:01:39.090> not<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.720> fight<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.259> know

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
Frankie I was not in the fight you know

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.010 
Frankie I was not in the fight you know
so<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.670> proved<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.409> point<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:44.780> floor<00:01:45.780> was

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
so it just proved a point that floor was

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.270 
so it just proved a point that floor was
definitely<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.770> superior<00:01:47.610> boxer<00:01:48.350> so<00:01:49.350> then<00:01:49.680> you

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
definitely a superior boxer so then you

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.190 
definitely a superior boxer so then you
probably<00:01:50.670> don't<00:01:51.060> understand<00:01:51.540> why<00:01:51.750> some

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
probably don't understand why some

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.780 
probably don't understand why some
things<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.799> small<00:01:53.070> percentage<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.549> fans

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
things it's a small percentage of fans

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.240 
things it's a small percentage of fans
trying<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.509> blame<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:55.250> Mayweather's

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
trying to blame for Mayweather's

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
dominance on why Manny Pacquiao didn't

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.550 
dominance on why Manny Pacquiao didn't
do<00:01:59.670> better<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.270> mean<00:02:00.570> are<00:02:00.719> you
