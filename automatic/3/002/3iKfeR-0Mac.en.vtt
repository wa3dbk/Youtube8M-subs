00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 today I give you a bit spicy advice 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.049
 but be careful, you understand 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.290
 today I want to talk about chili is 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.040
 very rich in vitamin c though 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.320
 be careful when drying 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.690
 you are therefore almost lost 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.390
 for those who want to take advantage of this too 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.220
 strong contribution of vitamin C present 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.310
 in chilli it is better to use it 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.890
 fresh use of chilli thanks to 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.380
 presence also of contained lecithin 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.690
 especially in seeds it lowers the rate of 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.020
 cholesterol in the blood and also a strong one 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.540
 has a strong antioxidant power the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.129
 chili pepper like many other vegetables a 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.309
 a stalk that allows us to understand 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.920
 when how beautiful is green if it is fresh 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.670
 or not if the pigeon is the tip of a 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.320
 intense green 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.289
 we are talking about a fresh chilli pepper 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.730
 naturally if instead it is blackened 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.829
 withered and bent over itself we are 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.910
 in front of an old pepper 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.949
 and dry 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.400
 carefully avoided buying of 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.040
 fresh chillies with light patches 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.610
 must be absolutely all red and 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.630
 homogeneous because those clear patches 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.330
 could be the symptom of 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.000
 dry chili peppers can 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.130
 be stored whole ground or 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.470
 on pole because you can put them 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.270
 some whole as of chilli peppers also 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.310
 in a bottle full of oil for a 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.950
 month to do what the common chin 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.400
 and call it is called holy oil ie 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.950
 spicy seasoning oil in the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.670
 Italian cuisine and in your kitchen a 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.650
 chili pepper 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.180
 if I finish it can never be missing 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.390
 more often you hear about success 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.950
 of china 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.840
 even in Italy there are not so many e 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.430
 there are a lot of things you ever thought 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.600
 to do business with the Chinese 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.600
 I had a wonderful idea
