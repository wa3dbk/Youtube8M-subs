welcome<00:00:00.840> back<00:00:00.989> settling<00:00:01.439> here<00:00:01.790> I<00:00:02.790> have<00:00:03.389> an

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
welcome back settling here I have an

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.269 
welcome back settling here I have an
idea<00:00:03.899> for<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.290> way<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.410> make<00:00:04.770> something<00:00:05.069> like

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
idea for a way to make something like

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.249 
idea for a way to make something like
pachinko<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:05.879> minecraft<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.810> so<00:00:07.049> I<00:00:07.080> went

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
pachinko and minecraft and so I went

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.549 
pachinko and minecraft and so I went
ahead<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.890> built<00:00:08.250> it<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:09.389> this<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.719> zit<00:00:10.349> right

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
ahead and built it and this is zit right

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.540 
ahead and built it and this is zit right
here

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
here

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.450 
here
the<00:00:11.910> idea<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.480> come<00:00:12.660> up<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.960> top<00:00:13.170> and

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
the idea is you come up to the top and

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.050 
the idea is you come up to the top and
use<00:00:14.460> spawn<00:00:14.849> eggs<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.509> drop<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.130> mobs<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.520> they

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
use spawn eggs to drop in mobs and they

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.200 
use spawn eggs to drop in mobs and they
will<00:00:18.330> sort<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.260> bounce<00:00:20.189> around<00:00:20.369> randomly<00:00:20.850> on

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
will sort of bounce around randomly on

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.359 
will sort of bounce around randomly on
the<00:00:21.270> pigs<00:00:21.800> kind<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.859> like<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.160> see<00:00:23.279> in

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
the pigs kind of like you see in

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.830 
the pigs kind of like you see in
pachinko<00:00:23.640> now<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.029> got<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.269> be<00:00:24.330> honest<00:00:24.630> I've

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
pachinko now I got to be honest I've

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.240 
pachinko now I got to be honest I've
never<00:00:25.019> actually<00:00:25.199> played<00:00:25.380> pachinko<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.099> real

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
never actually played pachinko in real

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.960 
never actually played pachinko in real
life<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:27.150> but<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.050> do<00:00:28.140> know<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:29.340> involves

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
life so but I do know that that involves

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.849 
life so but I do know that that involves
balls<00:00:30.210> bouncing<00:00:30.960> around<00:00:31.080> randomly<00:00:31.500> between

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
balls bouncing around randomly between

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.000 
balls bouncing around randomly between
pigs<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.570> didn't<00:00:33.960> make<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.110> whole<00:00:34.320> game<00:00:34.829> out

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
pigs so I didn't make a whole game out

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.680 
pigs so I didn't make a whole game out
of<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.190> because<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.910> don't<00:00:36.329> really<00:00:36.420> know<00:00:36.540> what

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
of it because I don't really know what

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.930 
of it because I don't really know what
I'm<00:00:36.750> doing<00:00:36.860> when<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.950> comes<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.309> chinko<00:00:38.640> but

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
I'm doing when it comes to chinko but

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.090 
I'm doing when it comes to chinko but
but<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:39.899> do<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.200> something<00:00:40.410> pretty<00:00:40.980> cool

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
but I do have something pretty cool

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.220 
but I do have something pretty cool
where<00:00:41.370> at<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.579> moment<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.210> notice<00:00:42.360> sometimes

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
where at the moment you notice sometimes

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.440 
where at the moment you notice sometimes
the<00:00:43.649> mobs<00:00:43.860> are<00:00:44.070> actually<00:00:44.460> kind<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.910> there's

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
the mobs are actually kind of there's

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.840 
the mobs are actually kind of there's
extra<00:00:45.809> ones<00:00:46.129> some<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.280> white<00:00:47.460> guys<00:00:47.489> are

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
extra ones some of the white guys are

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.950 
extra ones some of the white guys are
actually<00:00:48.559> escaping<00:00:49.559> their<00:00:50.000> pens<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.390> that's

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
actually escaping their pens and that's

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.920 
actually escaping their pens and that's
actually<00:00:52.199> because<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.770> bug<00:00:53.629> there's<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.719> bug

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
actually because of a bug there's a bug

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.110 
actually because of a bug there's a bug
where<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> mobs<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.739> think<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.670> go<00:00:56.820> through

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
where the mobs can think can go through

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.180 
where the mobs can think can go through
solid<00:00:57.449> blocks<00:00:57.690> there<00:00:58.289> are<00:00:58.410> ladders<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.949> I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
solid blocks there are ladders that I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.830 
solid blocks there are ladders that I
kind<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.520> cheated<00:00:59.699> into<00:01:00.000> place<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.539> get<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
kind of cheated into place to get the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.540 
kind of cheated into place to get the
villagers<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.379> stay<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.680> place<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
villagers to stay in place and the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.939 
villagers to stay in place and the
villagers<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.449> jump<00:01:03.899> boost<00:01:04.229> negative<00:01:04.739> ten

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
villagers have a jump boost negative ten

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.219 
villagers have a jump boost negative ten
effect<00:01:05.430> added<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.659> them<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:06.900> they<00:01:06.990> won't<00:01:07.110> be

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
effect added on them so they won't be

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.980 
effect added on them so they won't be
able<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.409> jump<00:01:07.590> out<00:01:07.799> but<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.420> add<00:01:09.570> you

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
able to jump out but so you can add you

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.179 
able to jump out but so you can add you
can<00:01:10.080> put<00:01:10.170> these<00:01:10.260> mobs<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.680> up<00:01:10.799> at<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:10.979> top<00:01:11.159> and

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
can put these mobs in up at the top and

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.530 
can put these mobs in up at the top and
have<00:01:11.549> them<00:01:11.670> bounce<00:01:11.850> around<00:01:12.000> randomly<00:01:12.479> it

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
have them bounce around randomly it

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.780 
have them bounce around randomly it
looks<00:01:12.689> kind<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.869> cool<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.670> make<00:01:14.760> a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
looks kind of cool and you can make a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.130 
looks kind of cool and you can make a
game<00:01:15.000> out<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.360> one<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.960> cool

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
game out of that one of the cool

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.109 
game out of that one of the cool
features<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:17.070> though<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.670> use

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
features this though is you can use

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.749 
features this though is you can use
different<00:01:18.930> mobs<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.740> create<00:01:20.130> different

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
different mobs to create different

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.210 
different mobs to create different
falling<00:01:21.630> patterns<00:01:22.080> different<00:01:22.409> effects<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.159> if

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
falling patterns different effects so if

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.399 
falling patterns different effects so if
I<00:01:23.280> drop<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.640> cave<00:01:23.880> spiders<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.450> instance<00:01:24.780> huge

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
I drop in cave spiders for instance huge

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.480 
I drop in cave spiders for instance huge
spiders<00:01:25.650> will<00:01:25.740> actually<00:01:25.979> climb<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> wall

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
spiders will actually climb the wall

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.370 
spiders will actually climb the wall
sometimes<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.570> kind<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.930> get<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.110> little

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
sometimes so you kind of get a little

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.870 
sometimes so you kind of get a little
bit<00:01:28.500> more<00:01:28.619> randomness<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.310> there<00:01:29.490> just

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
bit more randomness in there just

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.609 
bit more randomness in there just
because<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.329> AI<00:01:30.479> will<00:01:30.689> will<00:01:31.259> put<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.530> that

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
because the AI will will put in that

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.789 
because the AI will will put in that
extra<00:01:31.770> little<00:01:32.100> random<00:01:32.520> bits<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.290> so<00:01:34.290> if

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
extra little random bits and so if

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.980 
extra little random bits and so if
you're<00:01:35.400> gonna<00:01:35.520> make<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> game<00:01:36.150> out<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.659> I'd

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
you're gonna make a game out of this I'd

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.810 
you're gonna make a game out of this I'd
recommend<00:01:37.560> big<00:01:37.740> spiders<00:01:38.100> because<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.700> that

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
recommend big spiders because of that

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.819 
recommend big spiders because of that
randomness<00:01:39.210> they<00:01:39.960> still<00:01:40.200> fall<00:01:40.380> down<00:01:40.530> pretty

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
randomness they still fall down pretty

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.330 
randomness they still fall down pretty
quickly<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.290> pace<00:01:43.500> at<00:01:43.710> which<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
quickly and I like the pace at which the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.219 
quickly and I like the pace at which the
the<00:01:44.369> mobs<00:01:45.060> tend<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.390> fall<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.840> because<00:01:46.020> they

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the mobs tend to fall just because they

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.450 
the mobs tend to fall just because they
get<00:01:46.380> stuck<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.829> ladders<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> little<00:01:47.280> bit<00:01:47.369> so

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
get stuck on the ladders a little bit so

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.450 
get stuck on the ladders a little bit so
they<00:01:47.549> don't<00:01:47.700> fall<00:01:47.850> straight<00:01:48.119> down<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:49.460> it's

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
they don't fall straight down and it's

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.859 
they don't fall straight down and it's
kind<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.670> cool<00:01:52.520> if<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.640> use<00:01:53.790> ocelots<00:01:54.390> ocelots

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
kind of cool if you use ocelots ocelots

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.020 
kind of cool if you use ocelots ocelots
tend<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.140> go<00:01:55.229> down<00:01:55.409> very<00:01:55.710> quickly<00:01:56.189> actually<00:01:56.549> I

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
tend to go down very quickly actually I

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.850 
tend to go down very quickly actually I
don't<00:01:57.600> know<00:01:57.659> what<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:57.990> about<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.170> maybe

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
don't know what it is about that maybe

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.130 
don't know what it is about that maybe
they<00:01:59.009> don't<00:01:59.579> get<00:01:59.700> stuck<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> ladders<00:02:00.540> I'm

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
they don't get stuck on the ladders I'm

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.499 
they don't get stuck on the ladders I'm
not<00:02:01.439> really<00:02:01.590> sure<00:02:01.829> but<00:02:02.070> they<00:02:03.060> still<00:02:03.329> bounce

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
not really sure but they still bounce

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.410 
not really sure but they still bounce
around<00:02:03.689> quite<00:02:03.990> randomly<00:02:04.320> sometimes

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
around quite randomly sometimes

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.490 
around quite randomly sometimes
sometimes<00:02:06.420> they'll<00:02:06.570> get<00:02:06.689> stuck<00:02:06.869> within<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
sometimes they'll get stuck within the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.130 
sometimes they'll get stuck within the
pegs<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.009> villagers<00:02:08.690> which<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.869> kind<00:02:10.110> of

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
pegs like the villagers which is kind of

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.830 
pegs like the villagers which is kind of
silly<00:02:10.289> but<00:02:10.619> that's<00:02:10.920> fine

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
silly but that's fine

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.160 
silly but that's fine
if<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:12.350> put<00:02:12.530> in<00:02:12.650> chickens<00:02:13.400> let's<00:02:13.970> see<00:02:14.170> they

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
if you put in chickens let's see they

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.370 
if you put in chickens let's see they
tend<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.440> just<00:02:15.620> go<00:02:15.709> straight<00:02:16.069> down<00:02:17.020> except<00:02:18.020> if

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
tend to just go straight down except if

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.080 
tend to just go straight down except if
you<00:02:18.620> hit<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.040> pig<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.490> should<00:02:19.700> go<00:02:19.819> off<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.030> the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
you hit the pig it should go off to the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.330 
you hit the pig it should go off to the
side<00:02:20.150> yeah<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:21.260> they<00:02:21.590> get<00:02:21.680> bounced<00:02:22.010> around<00:02:22.130> a

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
side yeah so they get bounced around a

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.630 
side yeah so they get bounced around a
bit<00:02:22.459> too<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:24.040> they're<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.069> bit<00:02:25.250> slower

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
bit too and they're a bit slower

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.400 
bit too and they're a bit slower
probably<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.390> little<00:02:26.480> bit<00:02:26.630> too<00:02:26.990> slow<00:02:27.140> if<00:02:27.380> you

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
probably a little bit too slow if you

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.390 
probably a little bit too slow if you
wanted<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.800> try<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.100> do<00:02:28.190> something

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
wanted to try and do something

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.440 
wanted to try and do something
interesting<00:02:28.819> with<00:02:28.940> this<00:02:29.890> there's<00:02:30.890> mushrooms

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
interesting with this there's mushrooms

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.920 
interesting with this there's mushrooms
one<00:02:32.450> of<00:02:32.510> these<00:02:32.630> guys<00:02:32.780> in<00:02:33.610> they<00:02:34.610> yeah<00:02:35.060> they'll

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
one of these guys in they yeah they'll

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.050 
one of these guys in they yeah they'll
actually<00:02:36.140> get<00:02:36.380> stuck<00:02:36.800> oh<00:02:36.980> he<00:02:37.580> actually<00:02:37.700> died

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
actually get stuck oh he actually died

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.240 
actually get stuck oh he actually died
from<00:02:38.360> fall<00:02:38.780> damage<00:02:39.110> that's<00:02:39.830> funny

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
from fall damage that's funny

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.850 
from fall damage that's funny
never<00:02:41.000> actually<00:02:41.150> seen<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.480> happen<00:02:41.900> before

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
never actually seen that happen before

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.830 
never actually seen that happen before
but<00:02:43.280> they<00:02:43.400> tend<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:43.910> get<00:02:44.030> stuck<00:02:44.330> on<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.600> walls

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
but they tend to get stuck on the walls

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.900 
but they tend to get stuck on the walls
too<00:02:45.850> sometimes<00:02:47.050> but<00:02:48.370> they<00:02:49.370> just<00:02:49.489> all<00:02:49.640> follow

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
too sometimes but they just all follow

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.009 
too sometimes but they just all follow
but<00:02:50.090> differently<00:02:50.390> if<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.570> toss<00:02:50.750> in<00:02:50.930> an

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
but differently if you toss in an

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.960 
but differently if you toss in an
Enderman<00:02:51.410> once<00:02:52.220> they<00:02:52.340> start<00:02:52.580> taking<00:02:52.790> fall

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
Enderman once they start taking fall

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.400 
Enderman once they start taking fall
damage<00:02:53.000> they'll<00:02:53.660> actually<00:02:53.810> teleport<00:02:54.320> away

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
damage they'll actually teleport away

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.990 
damage they'll actually teleport away
kind<00:02:54.709> of<00:02:54.830> Cheeta<00:02:55.040> Cheeta<00:02:55.430> out<00:02:55.580> so<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:55.760> would<00:02:55.880> not

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
kind of Cheeta Cheeta out so I would not

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.580 
kind of Cheeta Cheeta out so I would not
recommend<00:02:56.209> using<00:02:56.540> intermón<00:02:56.959> for<00:02:57.110> this<00:02:57.260> but<00:02:58.090> Oh

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
recommend using intermón for this but Oh

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.270 
recommend using intermón for this but Oh
interesting<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.890> kind<00:03:01.040> of<00:03:01.069> got<00:03:01.220> stuck<00:03:01.400> there

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
interesting it kind of got stuck there

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.500 
interesting it kind of got stuck there
yeah<00:03:04.310> see<00:03:04.760> all<00:03:04.880> these<00:03:05.000> villagers<00:03:05.480> just

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
yeah see all these villagers just

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.690 
yeah see all these villagers just
falling<00:03:06.260> out<00:03:06.380> they're<00:03:07.160> really<00:03:07.280> not<00:03:07.489> supposed

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
falling out they're really not supposed

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.830 
falling out they're really not supposed
to<00:03:07.850> do<00:03:07.970> that<00:03:08.090> there's<00:03:08.300> solid<00:03:08.630> walls

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
to do that there's solid walls

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.350 
to do that there's solid walls
preventing<00:03:09.290> them<00:03:09.410> from<00:03:09.440> falling<00:03:09.890> out<00:03:10.360> but

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
preventing them from falling out but

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.430 
preventing them from falling out but
that's<00:03:11.780> how<00:03:11.959> it<00:03:12.019> goes

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
that's how it goes

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.259 
that's how it goes
anyway<00:03:13.010> just<00:03:13.190> kind<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:13.430> neat<00:03:13.640> concepts

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
anyway just kind of neat concepts

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.330 
anyway just kind of neat concepts
packing<00:03:15.080> all<00:03:15.170> these<00:03:15.319> villagers<00:03:15.709> I<00:03:15.890> know<00:03:15.950> Pete

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
packing all these villagers I know Pete

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.490 
packing all these villagers I know Pete
you<00:03:16.370> know<00:03:16.579> people<00:03:17.420> have<00:03:17.540> used<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:18.110> bunch<00:03:18.350> of

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
you know people have used a bunch of

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.229 
you know people have used a bunch of
mobs<00:03:18.739> packed<00:03:19.100> into<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.370> tight<00:03:19.579> space<00:03:19.790> before

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
mobs packed into a tight space before

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.150 
mobs packed into a tight space before
for<00:03:20.630> various<00:03:21.380> effects<00:03:21.650> but<00:03:21.860> I<00:03:21.890> thought<00:03:22.040> was

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
for various effects but I thought was

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.650 
for various effects but I thought was
kind<00:03:22.340> of<00:03:22.370> cool<00:03:22.549> to<00:03:22.700> have<00:03:22.730> like<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.269> random

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
kind of cool to have like a random

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.180 
kind of cool to have like a random
randomization<00:03:24.730> pachinko<00:03:25.730> type<00:03:26.390> delia<00:03:27.200> with

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
randomization pachinko type delia with

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.270 
randomization pachinko type delia with
it<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.930> it's<00:03:29.930> not<00:03:30.049> like<00:03:30.110> a<00:03:30.320> whole<00:03:30.560> complete

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
it and it's not like a whole complete

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.729 
it and it's not like a whole complete
redstone<00:03:31.700> game<00:03:31.910> or<00:03:32.060> anything<00:03:32.209> because<00:03:33.200> again
