00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
you might as well get a couple of studs

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.149 
you might as well get a couple of studs
along<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:30.549> way<00:01:31.200> another<00:01:32.200> big<00:01:32.470> treasure<00:01:32.710> chest

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
along the way another big treasure chest

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:49.320 
along the way another big treasure chest
remember<00:01:33.670> there's<00:01:33.820> five<00:01:34.150> of<00:01:34.180> them

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.990 

so<00:01:49.900> basically<00:01:50.320> we<00:01:50.560> have<00:01:50.710> to<00:01:50.950> hurt<00:01:51.370> the<00:01:51.610> riddler

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
so basically we have to hurt the riddler

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.810 
so basically we have to hurt the riddler
somehow<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.890> I'll<00:01:54.040> show<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:54.340> a<00:01:54.400> dude<00:01:54.700> enters

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
somehow so I'll show you a dude enters

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.840 
somehow so I'll show you a dude enters
per<00:01:55.210> second<00:01:55.660> is<00:01:55.750> one<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.230> collectively<00:01:56.800> starts

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.080 

almost<00:02:01.720> got<00:02:02.350> my<00:02:02.680> whole<00:02:03.009> chest<00:02:03.460> all<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.180> chest

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
almost got my whole chest all the chest

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.880 
almost got my whole chest all the chest
it's<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.240> last<00:02:07.450> one<00:02:07.780> right<00:02:08.110> here<00:02:10.890> so

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
it's the last one right here so

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.770 
it's the last one right here so
obviously<00:02:12.340> i<00:02:12.430> guess<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.880> get<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.090> couple<00:02:13.360> sucked

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
obviously i guess to get a couple sucked

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.540 
obviously i guess to get a couple sucked
or<00:02:13.930> something<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.410> already<00:02:14.560> did<00:02:14.739> this<00:02:15.069> and<00:02:15.400> I

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
or something I already did this and I

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.290 
or something I already did this and I
probably<00:02:16.360> was<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> canister<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.670> basically<00:02:19.000> now

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
probably was a canister so basically now

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.430 
probably was a canister so basically now
you<00:02:19.360> just<00:02:19.630> kind<00:02:19.870> of<00:02:19.900> destroy<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.410> gold<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:26.350> you

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
you just kind of destroy the gold so you

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.559 
you just kind of destroy the gold so you
can<00:02:26.650> build<00:02:27.660> something<00:02:28.660> kind<00:02:29.560> of<00:02:29.650> forgot<00:02:29.890> was

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
can build something kind of forgot was

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.220 
can build something kind of forgot was
basically<00:02:31.569> each<00:02:31.810> gold<00:02:32.230> thing<00:02:32.650> has<00:02:33.100> a<00:02:33.550> piece

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
basically each gold thing has a piece

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:44.640 
basically each gold thing has a piece
has<00:02:35.230> two<00:02:35.620> pieces<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.730> machine

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.789 

so<00:02:45.280> they<00:02:45.459> squeezed<00:02:45.849> me<00:02:46.540> basically<00:02:47.260> or<00:02:47.620> the

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
so they squeezed me basically or the

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.280 
so they squeezed me basically or the
mirror<00:02:48.069> I<00:02:48.189> guess<00:02:48.519> so<00:02:48.819> it<00:02:49.030> backfired<00:02:49.659> on<00:02:50.049> him

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
mirror I guess so it backfired on him

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.920 
mirror I guess so it backfired on him
yes<00:02:51.099> so<00:02:51.340> officially<00:02:51.819> superhero<00:02:52.299> that<00:02:52.450> really

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
yes so officially superhero that really

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.220 
yes so officially superhero that really
good<00:02:53.140> every<00:02:54.010> single<00:02:54.280> time<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:54.970> swear<00:02:55.659> every
