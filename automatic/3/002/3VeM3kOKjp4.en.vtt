with secondaries just like a peach and
samus<00:02:57.540> tend<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.110> be<00:02:58.200> characters<00:02:58.620> as<00:02:58.739> well<00:02:58.880> tend

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
samus tend to be characters as well tend

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
samus tend to be characters as well tend
to<00:02:59.970> have<00:03:00.090> just<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.510> one<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.600> think<00:03:03.780> with

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
to have just the one and I think with

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.630 
to have just the one and I think with
peach<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.290> Salma's<00:03:04.739> it's<00:03:04.920> because<00:03:05.220> they're

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
peach and Salma's it's because they're

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.130 
peach and Salma's it's because they're
so<00:03:06.000> different<00:03:06.299> than<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.750> other<00:03:06.840> characters

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
so different than the other characters

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.229 
so different than the other characters
it's<00:03:07.620> unlikely<00:03:07.980> that<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.370> what<00:03:09.060> you've

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.180 
gotten more percent on muffin on that
first<00:03:27.240> stock<00:03:27.540> then<00:03:27.930> he<00:03:28.260> almost<00:03:28.740> has<00:03:28.920> in<00:03:29.100> the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
first stock then he almost has in the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.280 
first stock then he almost has in the
entire<00:03:29.520> last<00:03:29.880> match<00:03:30.180> so<00:03:30.480> he<00:03:30.660> set<00:03:30.900> up<00:03:31.020> much

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
entire last match so he set up much

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.600 
entire last match so he set up much
better<00:03:31.500> here<00:03:31.860> yeah<00:03:34.100> it<00:03:35.100> looks<00:03:35.250> like<00:03:35.460> when

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
better here yeah it looks like when

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.190 
better here yeah it looks like when
scale<00:03:35.880> comes<00:03:36.120> throwing<00:03:36.420> out<00:03:36.570> these<00:03:36.690> aerials

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
scale comes throwing out these aerials

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.170 
scale comes throwing out these aerials
he's<00:03:37.380> not<00:03:37.560> using<00:03:37.890> his<00:03:38.040> cancels<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.850> keep<00:03:39.030> his

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
he's not using his cancels to keep his

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.330 
he's not using his cancels to keep his
movement<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:40.290> I<00:03:40.440> that<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:40.860> might<00:03:41.070> be<00:03:41.310> a

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
movement and I that that might be a

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.040 
movement and I that that might be a
product<00:03:41.760> of<00:03:41.850> nerves<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.420> know<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.570> want<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.900> see

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
product of nerves you know I want to see

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.010 
product of nerves you know I want to see
him<00:03:43.230> more<00:03:44.040> mobile<00:03:44.460> on<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.820> whole<00:03:45.000> cancelin<00:03:45.840> to

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
him more mobile on the whole cancelin to

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.250 
him more mobile on the whole cancelin to
