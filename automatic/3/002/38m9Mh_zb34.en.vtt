00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hello friends and in this video I want you 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.170
 show the model of the UAZ police 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.340
 which I modified a little bit were made 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.620
 following changes 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.590
 replaceable prize fog lights originally 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.890
 on the model were installed quite 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.380
 terrible portman and headlights see they were 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.100
 cast along with the bumper and just 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.630
 marked with silver paint i 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.080
 put 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.750
 invented headlights from the traffic model 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.260
 fire version of the painted themselves 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.420
 lenses 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.969
 yellow as on prototype model a 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.660
 also i'm behind the ink grille it 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.940
 gave the model a more realistic look 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.700
 paint turn signals on the roof was 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.510
 added antenna also taken with 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.660
 Fire Rafik was replaced Salon Salon 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.440
 I took from the civilian Oise military 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.500
 traffic police 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.390
 and put back the partition because 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.590
 originally salon which was on it 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.990
 UAZ he is not quite sure you see the salon 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.060
 he was a double behind were benches and 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:14.119
 the big minus was that the mounting 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.119
 the pin he passed through 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.659
 I also cut it, it gave the model 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.330
 see more realistic view in the back 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.360
 parts of the car are no longer mounting 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.780
 that a number of license plates were added 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.950
 I paint the taillights fire rear 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.930
 the course was rearranged bottom 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:43.770
 from UAZ military from inspection also 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:46.290
 track was sent according to drawings and 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.090
 Now the model, as you can see, is correct 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.230
 gearbox correct bridges and in general 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.290
 model 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.690
 in my opinion it became better to look at 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.820
 Later I will paint the model salon and who 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.880
 will make similar improvements 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.110
 consider the fact that the salons on the data 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.650
 models were 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.619
 or sand and dark green it 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.530
 due to the fact that originally the plant 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.440
 cars went and the same color it was or 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.520
 protective color or sand color and already in 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:24.000
 local cooperatives of various cars 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.290
 base altered logic militia 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.420
 option body repainted 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.860
 The inside of this mobile did not touch and 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.620
 thanks for attention it was a review 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.120
 small refinement of the medical UAZ 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.120
 and see you in the next video
