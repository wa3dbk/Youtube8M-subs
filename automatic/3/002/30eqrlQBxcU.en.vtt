00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.890
 1 0 got started with 1 2 lost 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.810
 in leverkusen 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.810
 in the first league game of the season 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.140
 insanely flexible front insane 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.160
 high quality 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.349
 that just makes it hard to defend 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.309
 But I think that we are big too 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.420
 opportunities or opportunities had with 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.350
 a draw from the game too 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.640
 Go and more chances 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.579
 out play 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.860
 where it was missing at little things focus 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.440
 then we just have to do better 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.280
 sometimes it looks like that 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.809
 LEVERKUSEN 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.590
 that's really good for the offensive 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.050
 Team this game very many 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.510
 So good passes into the interfaces and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.359
 it also has the very good on the outside 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.710
 people always have their chances there 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.260
 to recycle mostly one and just 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.420
 we just do not have the error that way 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.170
 We passed the last passes that came easy 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.090
 do not then if there's say 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.640
 come and that we are our super so 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.280
 chances there can save something or 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.710
 that our good approaches are better 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.380
 that he runs it better again with 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.119
 the thought still goes into the game 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.920
 that we want to grab something 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.970
 want to take 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.990
 that was also the case yesterday 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.240
 believe that you have seen 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.710
 I think you felt it too 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.730
 It has come into play well 1 0 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.620
 made then 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.940
 as leverkusen with too high quality 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:49.020
 then on the spot which is really nice 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.450
 feel finally to meet later 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.000
 very long work but at the end it has 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.850
 just do not score points to the so-handed 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.590
 we have significantly increased 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.520
 I better then come into play at 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.490
 better game made 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.350
 at the clear progress shown to 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.700
 Last week it has to be easy now 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.670
 be our scale 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.570
 leverkusen was up or down on it 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.650
 we have to build up 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.220
 sometimes everything is not so underneath 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.930
 accept 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.660
 the next weekend then the first one 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.650
 home match against the record champion the fc 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.650
 Bavaria from Munich
