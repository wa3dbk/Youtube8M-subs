00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
of course if it crashes it was all gyro

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:52.190 
of course if it crashes it was all gyro
you<00:03:41.010> believe<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.430> on<00:03:41.520> that

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
you can always land it and check the the

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.060 
you can always land it and check the the
voltage<00:04:21.090> man<00:04:21.330> it's<00:04:22.110> just<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.440> be<00:04:22.470> on<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.740> safe

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
voltage man it's just to be on the safe

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.459 
voltage man it's just to be on the safe
side

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:30.469 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:33.499

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
good I gave me the jitters it's kind of

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:39.950 
good I gave me the jitters it's kind of
close

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960

what about take talk with a tail down I

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:58.299 
what about take talk with a tail down I
would<00:05:54.469> probably<00:05:54.619> land<00:05:55.009> it<00:05:55.129> soon<00:05:57.009> when<00:05:58.009> I<00:05:58.039> need
