some of these balconies do interconnect

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.760 
some of these balconies do interconnect
you<00:02:04.480> can<00:02:04.630> see<00:02:04.810> there's<00:02:05.050> a<00:02:05.140> door<00:02:05.380> that<00:02:05.410> can<00:02:05.620> be

you can see there's a door that can be

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.260 
you can see there's a door that can be
opened<00:02:05.890> up<00:02:06.340> so<00:02:06.580> if<00:02:06.670> you<00:02:06.730> have<00:02:06.820> adjoining

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
opened up so if you have adjoining

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.170 
opened up so if you have adjoining
cabins<00:02:07.930> and<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:08.830> have<00:02:09.010> a<00:02:09.340> doorway<00:02:09.610> adjoining

then you can have a really long balcony
like<00:02:15.760> we<00:02:15.910> had<00:02:16.090> on<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:16.330> previous<00:02:16.510> cruise<00:02:17.100> there

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
like we had on the previous cruise there

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.750 
like we had on the previous cruise there
is<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:19.440> nice<00:02:20.440> big<00:02:20.710> window

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.059 

we<00:02:24.150> also<00:02:24.330> have<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:25.140> nice<00:02:25.890> big<00:02:25.950> door<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:28.590> in<00:02:28.830> case

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
we also have a nice big door and in case

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.360 
we also have a nice big door and in case
of<00:02:29.099> rough<00:02:29.519> weather<00:02:29.840> there<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:31.349> storm<00:02:32.129> door

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
of rough weather there is a storm door

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.770 
of rough weather there is a storm door
that<00:02:33.209> they<00:02:33.390> can<00:02:33.599> close<00:02:34.940> against<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.480> steel

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
that they can close against the steel

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.339 
that they can close against the steel
door<00:02:37.110> against<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.890> window<00:02:38.190> door<00:02:39.019> to<00:02:40.019> make<00:02:40.200> it

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
door against the window door to make it

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.050 
door against the window door to make it
watertight

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.680 

currently<00:02:43.810> we're<00:02:44.140> about<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:45.220> guess<00:02:46.180> about<00:02:46.420> 30

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
currently we're about I guess about 30

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.170 
currently we're about I guess about 30
feet<00:02:46.989> above<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.440> waterline<00:02:47.739> so<00:02:48.250> it's<00:02:48.400> pretty

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
feet above the waterline so it's pretty

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.990 
feet above the waterline so it's pretty
high<00:02:49.450> up<00:02:49.480> there<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.830> being<00:02:51.220> so<00:02:51.459> close<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.730> the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
high up there and being so close to the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.699 
high up there and being so close to the
water<00:02:52.209> is<00:02:52.390> actually<00:02:52.540> pretty<00:02:52.959> cool<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.440> get<00:02:53.560> to

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
water is actually pretty cool you get to

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.040 
water is actually pretty cool you get to
meet<00:02:53.920> awake<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.520> no<00:02:54.610> waves<00:02:54.849> and<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.900> whole

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
meet awake and no waves and a whole

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.260 
meet awake and no waves and a whole
