00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.820
 I tell you that this game has a weight 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.560
 240 megabytes approximately and that 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.840
 they require a version of android 2.3 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.489
 or higher to be able to function as 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.840
 I will always leave the link to the 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.879
 place torch if you like to check the 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.440
 compatibility with your devices or

 if you like to download the game design 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.070
 As well as on my website, they will be able to 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.840
 find the files that we need 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.030
 to install this game which are 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.470
 the Aztec and the data happens so 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.059
 to install the game the first thing that 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.900
 we have to do is move the data that 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:55.269
 is given to the route is edit android or bb and 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.160
 inside that folder we paste it once 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.200
 done this now we just install in 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.910
 He sins as usual and once 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.350
 finish installing we can open the 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.280
 game and it must work for us without any 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.280
 Type of problem 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.210
 the current version of this game is the 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.229
 1.0 point 0 but my website may 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.270
 find the updated files 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.780
 as the game is updated 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.780
 in the lawsuits 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.360
 the gameplay is based on gestures about 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.830
 the screen with which we will attack and 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.900
 we will reject the attacks of the enemies 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.880
 as well as the lower side 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.890
 right of the screen we will have a 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.900
 bar that when filled we can make a 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.790
 combo or special attack and side 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.650
 lower left a bar that we 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.420
 indicates the energy we have defense 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.650
 which will serve to cover us 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.650
 the special attacks of the enemies 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.680
 the game in truth that is pretty 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.390
 good and as you see has some 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.580

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.500

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.060
 240 megawatts and require

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.690
