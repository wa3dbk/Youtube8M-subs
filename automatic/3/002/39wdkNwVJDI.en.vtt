a conventional Brawley really

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.870 
a conventional Brawley really
straightforward<00:01:16.240> as<00:01:16.780> I<00:01:17.530> was<00:01:17.679> saying<00:01:17.920> about<00:01:18.520> if

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
straightforward as I was saying about if

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.669 
straightforward as I was saying about if
it's<00:01:19.090> just<00:01:19.360> about<00:01:19.479> to<00:01:19.780> rain<00:01:19.990> or<00:01:20.229> something

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
it's just about to rain or something

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:27.089 
it's just about to rain or something
it's<00:01:21.399> literally<00:01:21.910> that<00:01:22.060> quick<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.740> as<00:01:26.860> you<00:01:26.979> can

00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:27.099 
it's literally that quick and as you can

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:29.339 
it's literally that quick and as you can
see<00:01:27.310> I've<00:01:27.910> hardly<00:01:28.240> pushed<00:01:28.509> them<00:01:28.720> piles<00:01:29.020> in<00:01:29.229> at

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:29.349 
see I've hardly pushed them piles in at

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:33.870 
see I've hardly pushed them piles in at
all<00:01:29.590> but<00:01:30.490> because<00:01:31.090> of<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.300> way<00:01:31.509> the<00:01:32.369> ribs<00:01:33.369> all

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
all but because of the way the ribs all

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.900 
all but because of the way the ribs all
touch<00:01:34.270> right<00:01:35.200> around<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.530> back<00:01:35.729> you've<00:01:36.729> got

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
touch right around the back you've got

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.550

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.290 
stability straightaway the other
features<00:01:39.069> I<00:01:39.190> like<00:01:39.340> about<00:01:39.550> the<00:01:39.789> Brawley<00:01:40.030> are

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
features I like about the Brawley are

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.410 
features I like about the Brawley are
they're<00:01:40.899> fiberglass<00:01:41.229> ribs<00:01:42.149> strong<00:01:43.149> but

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
they're fiberglass ribs strong but

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.680 
they're fiberglass ribs strong but
extremely<00:01:43.899> light<00:01:44.289> and<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:45.239> material<00:01:46.239> is<00:01:46.450> the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
extremely light and the material is the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
new extremis HD material and we're so

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.139 
new extremis HD material and we're so
confident<00:01:50.229> in<00:01:50.410> it<00:01:50.590> that<00:01:51.009> we've<00:01:51.399> got<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.670> 5<00:01:51.910> year

for
ok<00:01:55.270> that's<00:01:55.539> how<00:01:55.630> I'd<00:01:55.780> usually<00:01:56.200> set<00:01:56.410> out<00:01:56.560> for<00:01:56.739> a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
ok that's how I'd usually set out for a

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.650 
ok that's how I'd usually set out for a
quick<00:01:56.920> I've<00:01:57.130> Ania<00:01:57.459> but<00:01:58.090> obviously<00:01:58.390> if<00:01:58.539> the

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
quick I've Ania but obviously if the

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.210 
quick I've Ania but obviously if the
wind<00:01:58.869> gets<00:01:59.140> up<00:01:59.289> in<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.590> night<00:01:59.800> you<00:02:00.039> want<00:02:00.190> to

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
wind gets up in the night you want to

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.910 
wind gets up in the night you want to
peg<00:02:00.429> it<00:02:00.550> down<00:02:00.989> various<00:02:01.989> pegging<00:02:02.410> points<00:02:02.739> right

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
peg it down various pegging points right

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.469 
peg it down various pegging points right
around<00:02:03.099> the<00:02:03.280> broadly<00:02:03.580> system<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.670> another

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
around the broadly system and another

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.699 
around the broadly system and another
unique<00:02:07.989> feature<00:02:08.050> is<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:09.099> rain<00:02:09.310> bar<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:11.140> just

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
unique feature is the rain bar you just

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.620 
unique feature is the rain bar you just
funnels<00:02:12.129> the<00:02:12.250> water<00:02:12.459> away<00:02:12.670> from<00:02:12.849> all<00:02:13.209> your<00:02:13.390> kit

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
funnels the water away from all your kit

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.920 
funnels the water away from all your kit
this<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.260> great<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.130> basically<00:02:15.970> good<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.780> go

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
this is great and basically good to go

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.620 
this is great and basically good to go
we're<00:02:17.290> fishing
