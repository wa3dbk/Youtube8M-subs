00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
hi my name is Andrew I'm a mechanical

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.430 
hi my name is Andrew I'm a mechanical
designer<00:00:03.120> and<00:00:03.270> I<00:00:03.600> use<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.750> mechanical<00:00:03.929> pencil

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
designer and I use a mechanical pencil

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.470 
designer and I use a mechanical pencil
everyday<00:00:05.160> mechanical<00:00:05.850> pencils<00:00:06.180> are<00:00:06.270> great

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
everyday mechanical pencils are great

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.690 
everyday mechanical pencils are great
they're<00:00:06.839> used<00:00:07.020> by<00:00:07.140> architects<00:00:07.740> designers<00:00:08.309> and

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
they're used by architects designers and

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.640 
they're used by architects designers and
engineers<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.450> Studios<00:00:09.870> all<00:00:10.110> over<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.440> world

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
engineers and Studios all over the world

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.530 
engineers and Studios all over the world
but<00:00:11.280> generally<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.820> night<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.000> am<00:00:12.210> now<00:00:12.480> you

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
but generally the night I am now you

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.820 
but generally the night I am now you
would<00:00:12.660> pull<00:00:12.809> out<00:00:12.840> your<00:00:13.049> pocket<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.500> show<00:00:13.620> off

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
would pull out your pocket and show off

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.829 
would pull out your pocket and show off
they<00:00:14.280> just<00:00:14.490> kind<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.700> throw<00:00:14.759> away<00:00:15.150> items<00:00:15.450> as

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
they just kind of throw away items as

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.720 
they just kind of throw away items as
soon<00:00:16.049> as<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.289> erasers<00:00:16.740> worn<00:00:16.949> down<00:00:17.160> our<00:00:17.460> LEDs

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
soon as the erasers worn down our LEDs

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.460 
soon as the erasers worn down our LEDs
run<00:00:17.970> out<00:00:18.150> we<00:00:18.330> just<00:00:18.359> throw<00:00:18.660> them<00:00:18.840> away<00:00:18.930> we<00:00:19.289> don't

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
run out we just throw them away we don't

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.470 
run out we just throw them away we don't
really<00:00:19.800> think<00:00:19.949> twice<00:00:20.220> about<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.730> we<00:00:21.000> kind<00:00:21.270> of

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
really think twice about it we kind of

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.939 
really think twice about it we kind of
behind<00:00:21.840> things<00:00:22.199> that<00:00:22.380> are<00:00:22.470> just<00:00:22.710> cheap

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
behind things that are just cheap

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.529 
behind things that are just cheap
because<00:00:23.279> they<00:00:23.430> are<00:00:23.670> cheap<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.119> convenient

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
because they are cheap and convenient

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.050 
because they are cheap and convenient
but<00:00:25.050> really<00:00:25.410> I've<00:00:25.619> learned<00:00:25.920> over<00:00:26.189> time<00:00:26.220> rather

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
but really I've learned over time rather

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.000 
but really I've learned over time rather
than<00:00:27.210> buying<00:00:27.510> seven<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.140> one<00:00:28.380> if<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.680> just<00:00:28.710> buy

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
than buying seven of one if you just buy

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.339 
than buying seven of one if you just buy
one<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.970> will<00:00:30.060> ask<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.300> much<00:00:30.510> longer<00:00:31.019> then

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
one and it will ask you much longer then

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.410 
one and it will ask you much longer then
it's<00:00:31.500> just<00:00:32.009> better<00:00:32.250> for<00:00:32.520> everything<00:00:33.239> really

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
it's just better for everything really

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.880 
it's just better for everything really
better<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.050> environment<00:00:34.170> better<00:00:34.739> for

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
better for the environment better for

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.760 
better for the environment better for
local<00:00:35.730> manufacturing<00:00:36.390> better<00:00:36.960> for<00:00:37.260> just<00:00:37.620> kind

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
local manufacturing better for just kind

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.770 
local manufacturing better for just kind
of<00:00:37.920> more<00:00:38.370> long<00:00:38.579> lasting<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:39.180> spend<00:00:39.420> more<00:00:39.570> time

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
of more long lasting you spend more time

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.180 
of more long lasting you spend more time
with<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.350> becomes<00:00:40.559> part<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.980> you

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
with it and it becomes part of you

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.100 
with it and it becomes part of you
rather<00:00:41.460> than<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:41.969> use<00:00:42.239> something<00:00:42.510> it's

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
rather than you just use something it's

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.229 
rather than you just use something it's
broke<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.770> throw<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.129> away<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.940> want<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
broke and you throw it away so I want to

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.639 
broke and you throw it away so I want to
design<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.600> pencil<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.260> would<00:00:46.350> last<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.620> a

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
design a pencil that would last you a

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.209 
design a pencil that would last you a
lifetime

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
lifetime

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.549 
lifetime
and<00:00:47.820> become<00:00:48.090> part<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> owner<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:49.050> really

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
and become part of the owner I really

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.590 
and become part of the owner I really
wanted<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> pencil<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.370> look<00:00:50.550> like<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.510> was

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
wanted the pencil to look like it was

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.510 
wanted the pencil to look like it was
one<00:00:51.750> piece<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.350> soon<00:00:52.680> realized<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.309> needed

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
one piece I soon realized that it needed

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.040 
one piece I soon realized that it needed
to<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:53.789> two<00:00:54.090> piece<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.510> hold<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
to be two piece to hold on to the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.840 
to be two piece to hold on to the
mechanism<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:55.739> then<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.129> kind<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.579> spent<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
mechanism but then I kind of spent a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.000 
mechanism but then I kind of spent a
long<00:00:57.030> time<00:00:57.059> trying<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.629> make<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.930> design<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
long time trying to make the design to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.860 
long time trying to make the design to
remove<00:00:59.309> any<00:00:59.520> visible<00:00:59.910> lines<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.539> just<00:01:00.629> kind

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
remove any visible lines and just kind

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.020 
remove any visible lines and just kind
of<00:01:00.930> make<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.289> sleep<00:01:01.620> as<00:01:01.800> possible<00:01:02.309> when<00:01:03.000> I

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
of make it as sleep as possible when I

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.109 
of make it as sleep as possible when I
find<00:01:03.719> something<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.290> or<00:01:04.830> when<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.000> pick<00:01:06.000> up

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
find something I like or when I pick up

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.539 
find something I like or when I pick up
something<00:01:06.360> pencil<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.650> always<00:01:08.220> tend<00:01:08.460> to

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
something pencil I like I always tend to

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.000 
something pencil I like I always tend to
take<00:01:08.760> apart<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.479> try<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.439> work<00:01:10.560> out<00:01:10.799> how<00:01:10.950> it

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
take apart and try and work out how it

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.620 
take apart and try and work out how it
was<00:01:11.159> put<00:01:11.369> together<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:11.970> wanted<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.330> design

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
was put together so I wanted to design

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.410 
was put together so I wanted to design
something<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.700> looks<00:01:14.760> good<00:01:15.150> and

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
something that it just looks good and

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.999 
something that it just looks good and
there's<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.689> high<00:01:15.840> quality<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> real

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
there's a high quality to it and a real

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.440 
there's a high quality to it and a real
nice<00:01:17.280> finish<00:01:17.820> but<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.119> couldn't<00:01:18.360> necessarily

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
nice finish but you couldn't necessarily

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.780 
nice finish but you couldn't necessarily
say<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.409> different<00:01:19.920> parts<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.430> how<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.670> was

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
say the different parts and how it was

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.899 
say the different parts and how it was
made<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.119> how<00:01:21.240> was

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
made and how was

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.029 
made and how was
the<00:01:22.060> pencil<00:01:22.689> has<00:01:22.840> two<00:01:23.049> versions<00:01:23.259> so<00:01:23.770> there's

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
the pencil has two versions so there's

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.609 
the pencil has two versions so there's
aluminum<00:01:24.520> and<00:01:24.670> brass<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.689> aluminum<00:01:26.140> pencil

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
aluminum and brass the aluminum pencil

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.649 
aluminum and brass the aluminum pencil
is<00:01:26.740> made<00:01:26.950> out<00:01:27.130> of<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.819> same<00:01:28.060> material<00:01:28.630> that

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
is made out of the same material that

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.959 
is made out of the same material that
you<00:01:28.929> use<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.350> aircraft<00:01:29.740> few<00:01:30.219> dodges<00:01:30.759> and

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
you use the aircraft few dodges and

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.240 
you use the aircraft few dodges and
wings<00:01:31.179> so<00:01:31.840> it's<00:01:31.990> extremely<00:01:32.350> lightweight<00:01:32.979> and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
wings so it's extremely lightweight and

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.819 
wings so it's extremely lightweight and
durable<00:01:33.640> and<00:01:34.179> the<00:01:34.689> brass<00:01:34.929> is<00:01:35.170> made<00:01:35.380> out<00:01:35.560> of<00:01:35.709> the

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
durable and the brass is made out of the

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.809 
durable and the brass is made out of the
complete<00:01:36.759> solid<00:01:37.509> piece<00:01:37.689> of<00:01:37.719> brass<00:01:38.140> so<00:01:39.039> it's<00:01:39.700> a

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
complete solid piece of brass so it's a

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:41.910 
complete solid piece of brass so it's a
much<00:01:39.969> heavier<00:01:40.179> feel<00:01:40.600> but<00:01:40.929> it's<00:01:41.560> just<00:01:41.740> as

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
much heavier feel but it's just as

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.639 
much heavier feel but it's just as
durable<00:01:42.399> both<00:01:43.149> pencils<00:01:43.630> are<00:01:43.780> made<00:01:43.959> from<00:01:44.259> one

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
durable both pencils are made from one

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.919 
durable both pencils are made from one
solid<00:01:45.130> piece<00:01:45.159> of<00:01:45.340> melt<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:46.270> then<00:01:46.450> it's<00:01:46.630> put<00:01:46.780> in

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
solid piece of melt and then it's put in

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.260 
solid piece of melt and then it's put in
two<00:01:47.109> pieces<00:01:47.319> and<00:01:47.799> then<00:01:48.340> it's<00:01:48.490> drilled<00:01:48.789> on<00:01:49.030> a

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
two pieces and then it's drilled on a

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.760 
two pieces and then it's drilled on a
CNC<00:01:49.780> lathe<00:01:50.259> and<00:01:50.829> is<00:01:51.039> finished<00:01:51.640> by<00:01:51.909> hand<00:01:51.939> and

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
CNC lathe and is finished by hand and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.800 
CNC lathe and is finished by hand and
all<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.920> seams<00:01:54.159> are<00:01:54.429> blended<00:01:55.119> down<00:01:55.270> so<00:01:55.750> it

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
all the seams are blended down so it

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.899 
all the seams are blended down so it
looks<00:01:55.989> like<00:01:56.049> one<00:01:56.319> piece<00:01:56.349> and<00:01:57.159> then<00:01:57.369> a<00:01:57.459> surface

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
looks like one piece and then a surface

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.260 
looks like one piece and then a surface
finish<00:01:58.209> is<00:01:58.329> applied<00:01:58.360> so<00:01:58.689> this

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
finish is applied so this

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.270 
finish is applied so this
each<00:02:00.570> pencil<00:02:01.080> comes<00:02:01.320> with<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> removable<00:02:01.830> clip

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280
