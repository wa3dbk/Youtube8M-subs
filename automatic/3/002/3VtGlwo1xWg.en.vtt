your<00:03:16.340> truth<00:03:16.670> is<00:03:16.909> enough<00:03:17.299> why<00:03:17.930> do<00:03:17.989> you<00:03:18.140> have<00:03:18.319> to

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:18.439 
your truth is enough why do you have to

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:20.830 
your truth is enough why do you have to
make<00:03:18.650> all<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.220> money<00:03:19.370> in<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:19.730> south<00:03:20.150> my<00:03:20.599> guess

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:22.939 
is easier to play the role in that car

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.550 
is easier to play the role in that car
because<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.689> don't<00:03:23.840> have<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.019> guts<00:03:24.349> and
