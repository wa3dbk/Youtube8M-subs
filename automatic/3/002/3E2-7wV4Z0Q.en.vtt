Bend<00:01:12.100> so<00:01:13.100> we<00:01:13.130> kept<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.119> a<00:01:14.150> thousand<00:01:14.659> six

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810

troubles of others the converter was
working<00:01:24.770> differently<00:01:25.250> because<00:01:25.460> we<00:01:25.759> were

working differently because we were

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.819 
working differently because we were

not meant to rev tonight thousand so it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.639 
not meant to rev tonight thousand so it
was<00:01:40.429> a<00:01:40.460> mistake<00:01:40.810> that<00:01:41.810> we<00:01:41.990> made<00:01:42.200> or<00:01:42.619> I

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
was a mistake that we made or I

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.739 
was a mistake that we made or I
particularly<00:01:43.399> made<00:01:43.819> on<00:01:44.119> raising<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.539> revenue

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:47.319

so<00:01:45.229> now<00:01:45.439> that's<00:01:45.890> a<00:01:46.159> learning<00:01:46.520> curve<00:01:46.939> so<00:01:47.299> we

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
so now that's a learning curve so we

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.880 
so now that's a learning curve so we
know<00:01:47.600> we<00:01:48.530> cannot<00:01:49.399> go<00:01:49.609> open<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.499> 8600<00:01:51.499> limits

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
know we cannot go open the 8600 limits

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.099 
know we cannot go open the 8600 limits
and<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.609> limiter<00:01:53.119> the<00:01:53.509> limits<00:01:53.810> that<00:01:53.929> we've

and the limiter the limits that we've

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.469 
and the limiter the limits that we've
got<00:01:54.350> will<00:01:54.560> never<00:01:54.799> go<00:01:54.979> over<00:01:55.009> 8,000<00:01:55.969> six<00:01:56.179> of<00:01:56.329> them

there's<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.079> water<00:01:57.289> block<00:01:57.679> so<00:01:57.950> it's<00:01:58.069> the<00:01:58.159> street

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
there's a water block so it's the street

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.929 
there's a water block so it's the street
it's<00:01:59.270> still<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.509> straight<00:01:59.869> tight<00:02:00.139> block<00:02:00.939> but

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
it's still a straight tight block but

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.929 
it's still a straight tight block but
it's<00:02:02.359> just<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.960> lot<00:02:03.109> lighter<00:02:04.060> very<00:02:05.060> very<00:02:05.329> strong

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
it's just a lot lighter very very strong

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.190 
it's just a lot lighter very very strong
and<00:02:07.939> it<00:02:08.179> was<00:02:08.270> what<00:02:08.450> we<00:02:08.569> were<00:02:08.660> looking<00:02:08.959> for

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
and it was what we were looking for

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.140 
and it was what we were looking for
something<00:02:09.590> we<00:02:10.190> wanted<00:02:10.520> something<00:02:10.910> that<00:02:10.940> would

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
something we wanted something that would

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.600 
something we wanted something that would
repair<00:02:11.840> easier<00:02:12.350> than<00:02:12.530> an<00:02:12.620> iron<00:02:12.770> block<00:02:13.160> and

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
repair easier than an iron block and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.610 
repair easier than an iron block and
this<00:02:13.790> repairs<00:02:14.270> warmer<00:02:14.569> a<00:02:14.630> paralyzed<00:02:15.110> in<00:02:15.530> an

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
this repairs warmer a paralyzed in an

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.949 
this repairs warmer a paralyzed in an
iron<00:02:15.800> block<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:16.730> was<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.000> good<00:02:17.209> choice<00:02:17.240> but

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
iron block so that was a good choice but

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.059 
iron block so that was a good choice but
it's<00:02:18.110> not<00:02:18.319> a<00:02:18.350> full-on<00:02:18.650> pivot<00:02:19.430> race<00:02:19.790> block

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
it's not a full-on pivot race block

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.699 
it's not a full-on pivot race block
wanted<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.519> winners<00:02:21.790> jackets<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:23.349> be<00:02:23.439> able<00:02:23.560> to

wanted the winners jackets to be able to

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:30.780 
wanted the winners jackets to be able to
drive<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.069> sell<00:02:24.400> drive<00:02:24.640> on<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:24.939> street<00:02:29.670> took<00:02:30.670> a

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
drive to sell drive on the street took a

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.190 
drive to sell drive on the street took a
long<00:02:30.939> time<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.389> get<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.599> pieces<00:02:31.810> together

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
long time to get the pieces together

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.619 
long time to get the pieces together
because<00:02:32.499> they're<00:02:32.829> expensive<00:02:33.219> then<00:02:33.790> it'll<00:02:34.510> be

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
because they're expensive then it'll be

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.580 
because they're expensive then it'll be
a<00:02:34.659> while<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.139> get<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.469> funds<00:02:36.370> together<00:02:37.590> but

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
a while to get the funds together but

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.959 
a while to get the funds together but
yeah<00:02:38.769> we<00:02:38.950> got<00:02:39.099> them<00:02:39.310> got<00:02:40.299> it<00:02:40.420> two<00:02:40.540> marks<00:02:40.930> and

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:41.969 
yeah we got them got it two marks and

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:44.910 
yeah we got them got it two marks and
then<00:02:42.969> they<00:02:43.180> started<00:02:43.629> the<00:02:43.780> lengthy<00:02:44.230> process<00:02:44.500> of

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
then they started the lengthy process of

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:54.330 
then they started the lengthy process of
building<00:02:45.129> it<00:02:45.519> from<00:02:46.090> scratch<00:02:46.209> engine

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.240 

so<00:02:54.849> it's<00:02:54.970> like<00:02:55.120> 35<00:02:55.660> days<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.260> took<00:02:56.470> him<00:02:56.680> 10

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
so it's like 35 days it took him 10

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.640 
so it's like 35 days it took him 10
hours<00:02:57.550> a<00:02:57.580> day<00:02:58.140> believers<00:02:59.140> were<00:02:59.290> he<00:02:59.470> was

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
hours a day believers were he was

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.220 
hours a day believers were he was
working<00:03:00.040> too<00:03:00.510> unbelievably<00:03:01.510> long<00:03:01.630> hours<00:03:02.050> he

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
working too unbelievably long hours he

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.589 
working too unbelievably long hours he
was<00:03:02.349> like<00:03:02.530> getting<00:03:02.800> up<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.360> starting<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:04.420> half

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
was like getting up and starting a half

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.059 
was like getting up and starting a half
eight<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.110> not<00:03:05.230> finishing<00:03:05.590> till<00:03:05.890> 1<00:03:06.040> o'clock

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
eight and not finishing till 1 o'clock

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.870 
eight and not finishing till 1 o'clock
in<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.459> morning<00:03:06.880> on<00:03:07.000> some<00:03:07.239> days<00:03:07.510> and<00:03:07.980> he<00:03:08.980> the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
in the morning on some days and he the

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.479 
in the morning on some days and he the
really<00:03:10.750> really<00:03:11.230> worked<00:03:11.500> hard<00:03:11.620> for<00:03:12.069> us<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.370> get

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
really really worked hard for us to get

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.940 
really really worked hard for us to get
back<00:03:12.790> this<00:03:13.720> quick<00:03:14.970> so<00:03:16.260> down<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.470> him<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:17.830> we

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.850 
back this quick so down to him that we
can<00:03:18.099> actually<00:03:18.220> get<00:03:18.550> it<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.760> John's<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.540> then

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
can actually get it to John's and then

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.770 
can actually get it to John's and then
and<00:03:20.860> kind<00:03:21.459> of<00:03:21.550> at<00:03:21.819> least<00:03:22.000> have<00:03:22.209> four<00:03:22.540> weeks

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
and kind of at least have four weeks

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:33.059 
and kind of at least have four weeks
before<00:03:23.080> we<00:03:23.410> Jim<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:23.950> go<00:03:24.069> out<00:03:31.319> no<00:03:32.319> I'm<00:03:32.590> the

before we Jim to go out no I'm the

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.009 
before we Jim to go out no I'm the
engine<00:03:33.370> when<00:03:33.519> he<00:03:33.610> pretty<00:03:33.850> easy<00:03:34.060> in<00:03:34.720> fairness

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
engine when he pretty easy in fairness

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.979 
engine when he pretty easy in fairness
it's<00:03:35.470> just<00:03:36.330> we<00:03:37.330> thought<00:03:37.480> were<00:03:37.600> gonna<00:03:37.780> have<00:03:37.870> all

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
the block was gonna be the same length

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.860 
the block was gonna be the same length
as<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.700> old<00:03:43.030> block

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870
