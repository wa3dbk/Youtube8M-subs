apply that to the rest of the lid just

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.750

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
applying the shadow try not to cover up

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.729

the purple shadow or the burgundy shadow

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.349

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
blending the top color away so it's not

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:15.309 
blending the top color away so it's not

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
completed yay and it turns out that I

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.320 
completed yay and it turns out that I
actually<00:05:32.220> have<00:05:32.520> some<00:05:32.670> clothes<00:05:32.910> that<00:05:32.940> kind<00:05:33.270> of

actually have some clothes that kind of

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.110 
actually have some clothes that kind of
went<00:05:33.540> along<00:05:33.600> with<00:05:33.960> her<00:05:34.110> theme<00:05:34.380> so<00:05:34.830> I<00:05:35.370> guess

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
went along with her theme so I guess
