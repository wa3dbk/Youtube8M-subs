00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.160 
like going back to childhood it was like
playing<00:03:00.250> with<00:03:00.580> blocks<00:03:00.880> if<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:01.540> say<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:01.930> the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
playing with blocks if you say to the

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.920 
playing with blocks if you say to the
designer<00:03:02.500> that<00:03:02.709> move<00:03:03.700> this<00:03:04.120> bar<00:03:04.390> a<00:03:04.570> bit<00:03:04.750> lower

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
designer that move this bar a bit lower

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.949 
designer that move this bar a bit lower
and<00:03:05.230> it<00:03:05.620> was<00:03:05.739> instantly<00:03:06.220> done<00:03:06.600> later<00:03:07.600> on<00:03:07.780> now

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
and it was instantly done later on now

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.800 
and it was instantly done later on now
after<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.470> few<00:03:08.650> months<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:09.280> can<00:03:10.120> hang<00:03:10.450> from<00:03:10.630> the

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
after a few months I can hang from the

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.780 
after a few months I can hang from the
same<00:03:10.989> bar<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.560> main<00:03:11.739> focus<00:03:12.160> with<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.489> design

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790

just<00:04:02.580> to<00:04:02.730> see<00:04:02.910> how<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.240> equipment<00:04:03.630> work<00:04:04.020> it's

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
just to see how the equipment work it's

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:12.479 
just to see how the equipment work it's
been<00:04:04.950> really<00:04:05.100> good

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.369 

the<00:04:13.489> whole<00:04:13.640> thing<00:04:13.939> has<00:04:14.239> had<00:04:14.420> a<00:04:14.450> very<00:04:14.930> promising

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
the whole thing has had a very promising

the whole thing has had a very promising
start<00:04:15.799> which<00:04:16.430> means<00:04:16.459> we<00:04:17.329> don't<00:04:17.389> stop<00:04:17.720> here

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
start which means we don't stop here
