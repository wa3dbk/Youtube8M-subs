we're<00:00:40.750> taught<00:00:41.019> for<00:00:41.290> example<00:00:41.739> how<00:00:41.890> to<00:00:41.920> program

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430

we're taught for example how to program
a<00:00:42.460> computer<00:00:42.699> and<00:00:43.290> what<00:00:44.290> my<00:00:44.470> students<00:00:44.949> do<00:00:45.100> is

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
a computer and what my students do is

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.149 
a computer and what my students do is
say<00:00:46.030> how<00:00:46.269> can<00:00:46.330> we<00:00:46.510> program<00:00:47.080> a<00:00:47.110> computer<00:00:47.710> so

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 
say how can we program a computer so

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:50.189 
say how can we program a computer so
that<00:00:48.190> we<00:00:48.549> can<00:00:48.790> enhance<00:00:49.089> the<00:00:49.600> ways<00:00:49.900> that

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
that we can enhance the ways that

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.500 
that we can enhance the ways that
surgeons<00:00:50.799> plan<00:00:51.159> and<00:00:51.400> perform<00:00:51.580> complex

they challenge my thinking and they make
a<00:01:12.039> difference<00:01:12.549> through<00:01:12.789> their<00:01:12.939> questions<00:01:13.570> in

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
a difference through their questions in

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.719 
a difference through their questions in

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
the kind of research questions that we

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.149 
the kind of research questions that we
ask<00:01:17.130> I'm<00:01:18.130> never<00:01:18.969> bored<00:01:19.299> of<00:01:19.509> my<00:01:19.899> work<00:01:20.140> I<00:01:20.500> really

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159
