much almost in the clouds you're very
very<00:00:54.010> close<00:00:54.280> it's<00:00:54.730> about<00:00:54.790> four<00:00:55.210> or<00:00:55.239> five

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
very close it's about four or five

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.990 
very close it's about four or five
blocks<00:00:55.750> and<00:00:56.079> then<00:00:56.710> you're<00:00:56.860> there<00:00:57.070> so<00:00:57.460> you're
