00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
know as you guys know my go-to move is

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.180 
know as you guys know my go-to move is
shining<00:02:19.240> slash<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:20.500> there's<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.740> teleport

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
shining slash so there's a teleport

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.680 
shining slash so there's a teleport
version<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:23.040> elite<00:02:24.040> version<00:02:24.570> just<00:02:25.570> like

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
version and the elite version just like

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.510 
version and the elite version just like
with<00:02:25.840> mock<00:02:26.020> kick<00:02:26.290> there's<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.650> regular<00:02:27.220> version

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
with mock kick there's a regular version

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.860 
with mock kick there's a regular version
you<00:02:27.580> can<00:02:27.730> use<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.120> another<00:02:28.330> version<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.720> can

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
you can use and another version you can

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.300 
you can use and another version you can
use<00:02:28.960> to<00:02:29.230> cancel<00:02:29.680> it

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
use to cancel it

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.730
