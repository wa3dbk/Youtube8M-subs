 So you're going to go through and I exchanging 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.079
 also no longer look at what your body is doing 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.289
 so you may necker is lohle 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.210
 so waiting in theater to grow up okay 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.480
 have shaken you enough 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.250
 yes i look at you as you then 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.100
 it is also impossible for you to know who if 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.239
 take a seat on this youtube train 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.280
 yes oh someone doesn't go yes then goes 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.260
 no one put okay look like that 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.150
 not said I knew those 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.409
 That was of course yes I am very sorry 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.470
 pay attention 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.570
 well I'm going to look at the behavior 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.520
 someone looks at it I can't do anything 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.290
 put 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.500
 someone looks very quiet that maybe 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.240
 a jus we are and nobody went late 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.689
 sit that could be clumsy godfather 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.640
 its yes that's tricky 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.220
 ok maybe you can all four one 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.540
 take stock to talk about yourself 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.470
 and then I suggest we 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.119
 here are not a heavy pull because yes or the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.130
 look star 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.380
 so if you grab the item in me 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.770
 can describe something about you 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.240
 maybe ok if you pick up an item 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.890
 sees that someone already has a clock 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.720
 picked up a compass someone who uses 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.549
 a lot of compass someone has one 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.840
 Redstone in such a way that would be official 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.119
 or be peter with it I remember now 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.229
 not and someone has a helmet 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.060
 well that is clear that that 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.829
 probably a kevin because he is 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.579
 always a construction helmet on the web and nobody 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.439
 has friend 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.750
 So with might be a belgian so 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.500
 I'm in doubt between 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.300
 this is leroy this is peter or you would this 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.009
 Kevin and this would be Peter officially 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.470
 to be 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.090
 and i'm going a definitive definitive one 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.480
 make decision because I think it should 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.040
 going to do at the 1st round I think 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.730
 that this is here 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.439
 Kevin is is that's right Kevin 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.349
 this cart here 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:28.970
 yes it is kevin you have another 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.310
 still and happy vocal cords 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.730
 Kevin is finished then have to lose 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.459
 let's do another round and we 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.540
 look you are and peter and and that is 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.579
 a she'll 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.959
 or it's the other way around i think this is peter 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:46.069
 but I am not sure so must be there 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:49.459
 still do something you can still 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.290
 give tip with an item yes am very 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.120
 curious 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.120
 well from watching 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.250
 someone has you all for 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.109
 I see a cookie and I see a rescue 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.540
 dumb the redstone you're just 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.769
 peter and jules one of these yes you 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.409
 are they 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.030
 I guess I watched I guess very much 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.590
 that this is godfather because he says too 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.870
 late boarding and peter is so one 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.480
 bit of a jumble 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.090
 paper too so I think your own me 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.900
 do not know whether a Godfather a minute 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.359
 look 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.410
 and and penetrates year they had a cookie 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.970
 I again yes 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.160
 shuffleboard cookies but Piet does that 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.989
 also but that makes more bonbons than 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.430
 crazy but you really bunch 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.799
 however, bakers 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.799
 well i think that's clear till 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.669
 nice though 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.109
 and then we only have this in it 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.730
 dementing difficult because here in all 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.019
 Belgians 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.239

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.510

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.069
 yes what I am going to gamble 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.310
 I'm just going to throw I really think this 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.310
 Peter is showing yourself again who is 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.919

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.810
 she now what me now 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:14.870
 being leroy me you do n't know who I am 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.379
 You can see that, but my video shows that 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.459
 not 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.970
 don't you take that 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.250

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.470
 turn around and going through each 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.639
 Messing up boys' brains will be the hessel 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.199
 the hessel 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.460
 look out that train card didn't demolish and 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.630
 I think we have enough geneuzeld 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.930

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.520
 yes then you can be ok and then when you talk 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.530
