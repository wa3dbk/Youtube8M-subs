super ship which is basically
alternating<00:00:22.800> two<00:00:22.980> different<00:00:23.279> exercises<00:00:23.699> that

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
alternating two different exercises that

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.550 
alternating two different exercises that
share<00:00:24.239> similar<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.900> start<00:00:25.140> at<00:00:25.230> your<00:00:25.289> ending

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:27.450 
point in this case this is going to be

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.420 
point in this case this is going to be
done<00:00:27.630> for<00:00:27.660> back<00:00:27.989> I'm<00:00:28.680> going<00:00:28.829> to<00:00:28.919> be<00:00:28.980> doing<00:00:29.099> a

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
done for back I'm going to be doing a

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.930 
done for back I'm going to be doing a
deadlift<00:00:29.879> along<00:00:30.869> with<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.379> barbell<00:00:31.739> row<00:00:31.950> so<00:00:32.399> I'm

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
deadlift along with a barbell row so I'm

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.700 
deadlift along with a barbell row so I'm
going<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.210> be<00:00:33.300> alternating<00:00:33.809> reps<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.379> the<00:00:34.590> two

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
going to be alternating reps of the two

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.860 
going to be alternating reps of the two
different<00:00:35.010> exercises<00:00:35.430> until<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.390> can't<00:00:36.719> go

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
different exercises until I can't go

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.290 
different exercises until I can't go
basically<00:00:37.829> as<00:00:37.920> far<00:00:38.100> as<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.250> can<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.700> which

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
basically as far as I can with one which

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.700 
basically as far as I can with one which
is<00:00:39.329> going<00:00:39.539> to<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> barbell<00:00:40.110> rope<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.530> then

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
is going to be the barbell rope and then

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.290 
is going to be the barbell rope and then
I'm<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:40.980> wrap<00:00:41.129> up<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.999> bed<00:00:42.149> looks

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
I'm going to wrap up on the bed looks

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.939 
I'm going to wrap up on the bed looks
getting<00:00:42.629> as<00:00:42.690> many<00:00:42.809> reps<00:00:43.079> as<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.289> can<00:00:43.499> finishing

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
getting as many reps as I can finishing

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.009 
getting as many reps as I can finishing
out<00:00:44.070> with<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.339> now<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.539> great<00:00:45.809> way<00:00:45.960> to

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
out with that now this is a great way to

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:48.439 
out with that now this is a great way to
add<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> lot<00:00:46.530> more<00:00:46.589> attention<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.489> muscle<00:00:47.879> and

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
add a lot more attention to a muscle and

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.389 
add a lot more attention to a muscle and
you<00:00:48.539> normally<00:00:48.960> can<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> regular<00:00:50.010> straight

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
you normally can with a regular straight

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.430 
you normally can with a regular straight
set<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.510> basically<00:00:51.780> doing<00:00:52.050> pre

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
set this is basically doing pre

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.770 
set this is basically doing pre
exhausted<00:00:52.920> post<00:00:53.129> exhaust<00:00:53.519> training<00:00:54.359> all<00:00:54.569> in

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
exhausted post exhaust training all in

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.779 
exhausted post exhaust training all in
one<00:00:54.929> set<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.649> you're<00:00:56.339> going<00:00:56.429> to<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.579> hitting

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
one set so you're going to be hitting

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.040 
one set so you're going to be hitting
the<00:00:56.819> muscles<00:00:57.149> from<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.329> few<00:00:57.479> different<00:00:57.569> angles

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the muscles from a few different angles

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.989 
the muscles from a few different angles
within<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.649> course<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.979> that<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.339> set<00:00:59.550> it's<00:00:59.940> a

00:00:59.989 --> 00:00:59.999 
within the course of that one set it's a

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:02.689 
within the course of that one set it's a
very<00:01:00.239> powerful<00:01:00.390> technique<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.229> for<00:01:02.100> back<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
very powerful technique and for back the

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.369 
very powerful technique and for back the
deadlift<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.749> barbell<00:01:04.080> were<00:01:04.140> always<00:01:04.350> a

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
deadlift and the barbell were always a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.170 
deadlift and the barbell were always a
great<00:01:04.530> combination<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.400> it's<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:05.940> to<00:01:06.000> be<00:01:06.090> an

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
great combination so it's going to be an

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.840 
great combination so it's going to be an
overhand<00:01:06.600> grip<00:01:06.720> barbell<00:01:07.650> row<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.520> an

overhand grip barbell row and an
overhand<00:01:09.270> grip<00:01:09.360> deadlift<00:01:10.190> basically<00:01:11.190> going

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
overhand grip deadlift basically going

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.520 
overhand grip deadlift basically going
