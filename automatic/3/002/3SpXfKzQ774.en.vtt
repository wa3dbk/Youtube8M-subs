00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.080
 Hello, I cook you today 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.870
 pork with sheep cabbage 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.190
 I always do that , too 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.400
 take a short leash 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.650
 I need lean pork cabbage 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.539
 I always take this year grandma 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.390
 carbonated wine that tastes good 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.160
 milder and a bit spellier than the normal one 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.349
 white cabbage but white cabbage goes naturally 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.930
 Even then, rows of carrots keep coming 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:35.540
 onions or onions and onions 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.339
 spicy spice in the original recipe always 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.049
 on the ball that I was not there but 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:41.049
 I'll take half an ode schiller 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.710
 Soy sauce pepper salt and saute 

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:50.479
 I need some oil 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.360
 I cut carrots into pens 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:54.440
 this cabbage and onions 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.379
 I will plane 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.420
 I am very good for that 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:05.380
 to adjust 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:09.170
 heat one tablespoon of 1 tablespoon of oil in 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:15.080
 a pan and no buck has got out 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:21.020
 good if it is really hot then 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:24.670
 I need the pork and that 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.670
 meat again off the off 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:32.020
 and gradually took the vegetables to the 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.590
 for the 7th 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.500
 but if you willing bible takes what 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.340
 could then pack from the good ones 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.390
 I would enter the replacement 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.390
 then the cards will be 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:02.860
 the heat is already reduced a bit 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.800
 and give it to the cabbage and take it 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.319
 everything is good is about 15 minutes 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.149
 last 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.920
 the vegetables were even faster now 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.530
 the ten minutes is about as well 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.569
 always a bit on how small 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.220
 that you have cut that I go 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.390
 now on your pressed 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.390
 garlic clove to it 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:40.920
 the meat back chilli I have 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.160
 now you can hack more so small 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.300
 take less of each one yourself 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.010
 be left to 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.010
 I can't eat so nice 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:03:01.720
 but it is called the show because of that 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.720
