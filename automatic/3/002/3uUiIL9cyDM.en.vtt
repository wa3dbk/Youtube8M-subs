00:00:03.606 --> 00:00:05.266
Front brake service

00:00:09.287 --> 00:00:13.006
put a spanner wrench to the side
&nbsp; right and one to the left side,

00:00:13.397 --> 00:00:16.635
We removed the rim axis
to the right side.

00:00:16.864 --> 00:00:21.268
loosen the brake cable nut,
to the right hand or wrench

00:00:21.425 --> 00:00:23.888
expansion, we took the rubber.

00:00:23.888 --> 00:00:25.962
we take the axis of the rim,

00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:27.399
the dismantle.

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:30.208
We took the carrier bands and bands.

00:00:30.381 --> 00:00:34.746
If this downhill is recommended that you also
&nbsp; brake with the engine, so that the bells

00:00:34.746 --> 00:00:37.837
do not overheat and crystallize asbestos.

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:41.843
Then with a Phillips screwdriver
guaya we get the speedometer.

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:49.402
We removed the cam with the cup # 10, then
we take the guide pin and rubber.

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:54.202
I proceed to clean the porta bands
and pin with gasoline.

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:58.343
This maintenance must have it
very present because it is the only security

00:00:58.905 --> 00:01:00.065
there when riding a bike.

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:02.516
We hope for it to dry.

00:01:03.803 --> 00:01:05.321
Then we apply grease.

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:09.640
If you use your bike much tensione
&nbsp; the brake every 8 days.

00:01:11.168 --> 00:01:13.090
We had to clean the hood.

00:01:13.324 --> 00:01:18.805
We continue with the brake cable, and we apply
5-56 to remove dust and lubricate well,

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:21.296
this can be done every month.

00:01:22.488 --> 00:01:28.617
greased the pin and put it in the
carrier bands, rubber, and cam guide.

00:01:28.975 --> 00:01:33.652
the guide put it right to left, this
is to find the brake wear.

00:01:33.652 --> 00:01:35.932
Guaya put the speedometer.

00:01:35.965 --> 00:01:39.523
You should be aware of the brakes,
&nbsp; if they are very long stress.

00:01:39.523 --> 00:01:41.099
That tire is free.

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:45.791
We proceed to put the bands in this
&nbsp; case had to be putting on new bands.

00:01:45.946 --> 00:01:48.015
Bands placed in the carrier bands.

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:53.806
each straps are worn or not
&nbsp; see asbestos, that can replace lead

00:01:54.185 --> 00:01:55.472
damage to the hood.

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:59.257
We proceed to put the brake cable and
place the carrier bands.

00:02:00.806 --> 00:02:02.115
greased and put the axle of the wheel.

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:05.395
finished putting the rim.

00:02:07.292 --> 00:02:11.227
Then we organize the cam;
Here we see this in the end;

00:02:11.227 --> 00:02:16.895
not stop there, let's put it a little
&nbsp; further, we hit a little, put the rubber

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.331
and we stress the brake.

00:02:20.847 --> 00:02:24.320
The brake can change each year,
This is depending on the use of the bike.

00:02:25.721 --> 00:02:30.049
If you ride your bike much weight will obviously
you are going to spend the brake faster.

00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:35.424
The good thing about the campaign brakes is that
&nbsp; these have a guide and at first glance we see

00:02:35.424 --> 00:02:37.663
how long to use the bands.

00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:43.134
the tire must be free while
&nbsp; paste is used to the bell.

00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:46.621
Ready and proceed to put
washer and nut.

00:02:46.842 --> 00:02:53.617
There are times when one puts new bands
and makes this maintenance at 2 or 3 months starting

00:02:53.617 --> 00:03:00.586
screaming, is that the brand is very bad,
recommended ride him or Japanese original bands.

00:03:00.797 --> 00:03:05.276
When this screaming, immediately lower the
&nbsp; rim that might burst a spring

00:03:05.276 --> 00:03:10.619
of the bands and this damage the hood
dust or asbestos wear.

00:03:12.137 --> 00:03:16.475
By doing this maintenance, we see that
may be failing, if we change the bands

00:03:16.475 --> 00:03:20.025
or are crystallized, among others.
