 I want to show and tell you how you are 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.439
 you can create your financial pyramid 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.260
 absolutely not afraid to lose anything and 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.310
 absolutely remained the law ie you 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.840

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.309
 stay with your 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:36.120

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.090
 cheating everything is absolutely honest and you are now 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.790
 see for yourself and more 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.329
 you can create it all 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.879
 repeat if you want literally 2-5 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.350
 minutes depending on the skill Well 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.120
 let's go create a financial pyramid 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:59.840
 the first thing we need to do is 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:09.200
 fold 100 dollars like this 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:15.380
 fold and gently bend given 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.380
 then we fold like this 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:28.710
 corner corner do then do here 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:35.509
 so we turn it turns out 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:43.130
 such as a pilot cap then unbend 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:48.090
 bend again now bend back 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:51.619
 like that you first need to bend 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:57.240
 your 100 dollars like this 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:02:04.439
 then here so there is a corner 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:09.300
 we do further bend like this 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.490
 Pilot it turns out unfold 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:19.550
 neatly 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:26.740
 expand again and now we do 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.740
 so cunning once so bend and 2 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:42.490
 so here once noticed yes how I did 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:42.490
 look once and so bend 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:52.790
 Here's a turned pilotochka 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:03:01.840
 now we turn this corner down 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:01.840
 here and the corner and substitute here in this 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.940
 a place 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:19.060
 It turned out such a thing now 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:29.830
 we need to do one more time like this 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:29.830
 flex's crushes are now unbend and 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.880
 along these fold lines 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:44.330
 we pass once again neatly and 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:52.180
 here again and now here here here 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:52.180
 so look bend 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:05.349
 and almost got a pyramid like you 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:09.400
 see already it stands and now these 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:19.900
 edges bent once bent 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:24.330
 once again two and skib im 3 again and here 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:29.250
 here in the corner you can for stamina 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.250
 so here promyat 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:55.039
 and bend 1 and do the same thing here 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:55.039
 corner itself for durability 1 and 2 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:04.380
 how to withdraw everything 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.530
 it took only a few minutes and 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.580
