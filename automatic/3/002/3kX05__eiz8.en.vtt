pretty<00:03:38.650> common<00:03:38.920> when<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.280> notice<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.819> modelers

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
pretty common when I notice the modelers

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.119 
pretty common when I notice the modelers
who<00:03:40.420> have<00:03:40.629> a<00:03:40.989> very<00:03:41.469> little<00:03:41.680> understanding<00:03:41.859> of

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
who have a very little understanding of

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:43.589 
who have a very little understanding of
drawing<00:03:42.430> they're<00:03:42.640> very<00:03:42.879> dependent<00:03:43.480> on

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
drawing they're very dependent on

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.679 
drawing they're very dependent on
concepts<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.549> it's<00:03:45.549> hard<00:03:45.790> for<00:03:46.000> them<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.150> kind

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:46.689 
concepts and it's hard for them to kind

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:49.770 
concepts and it's hard for them to kind
of<00:03:46.840> grasp<00:03:47.370> conceptually<00:03:48.629> what<00:03:49.629> they're

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
of grasp conceptually what they're

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.390 
of grasp conceptually what they're
creating<00:03:50.230> or<00:03:50.349> to<00:03:50.470> come<00:03:50.650> up<00:03:50.799> with<00:03:50.950> things<00:03:51.129> to

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
creating or to come up with things to

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.770 
creating or to come up with things to
embellish<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:53.290> model<00:03:53.620> they're<00:03:53.769> working<00:03:54.099> on

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
embellish the model they're working on

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.569 
embellish the model they're working on
whereas<00:03:55.780> those<00:03:56.049> modelers<00:03:56.620> who<00:03:56.859> do<00:03:57.069> have<00:03:57.250> some

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
whereas those modelers who do have some

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.610 
whereas those modelers who do have some
drawing<00:03:57.819> understanding<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.569> ability<00:03:58.959> they

have a better idea of not being

have a better idea of not being
completely<00:04:02.170> dependent<00:04:02.889> on<00:04:02.920> concepts<00:04:03.489> but

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
completely dependent on concepts but

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.960 
completely dependent on concepts but
finding<00:04:04.389> the<00:04:05.019> general<00:04:05.349> vibe<00:04:05.530> of<00:04:05.829> of<00:04:06.129> the

design and able to add to it because

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.009 
design and able to add to it because
they're<00:04:09.790> more<00:04:09.939> comfortable<00:04:10.150> based<00:04:10.750> on<00:04:10.900> their

they're more comfortable based on their

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.449 
they're more comfortable based on their
understanding<00:04:11.530> of<00:04:11.590> drawing<00:04:11.889> and<00:04:12.159> things<00:04:12.310> like

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
understanding of drawing and things like

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.650 
understanding of drawing and things like
that<00:04:12.519> so<00:04:13.049> that's<00:04:14.049> an<00:04:14.169> example<00:04:14.290> of<00:04:14.849> where<00:04:15.849> what

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
that so that's an example of where what

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.210 
that so that's an example of where what
your<00:04:16.840> passion<00:04:17.380> is<00:04:17.500> and<00:04:17.739> what<00:04:17.889> you're<00:04:18.009> good<00:04:18.190> at

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
your passion is and what you're good at

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.520 
your passion is and what you're good at
may<00:04:18.669> not<00:04:18.820> always<00:04:19.090> be<00:04:19.239> exactly<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:20.019> same<00:04:20.259> and

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
may not always be exactly the same and

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.409 
may not always be exactly the same and
you<00:04:21.280> always<00:04:21.400> have<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:21.759> have<00:04:21.789> sacrifice

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
you always have to have sacrifice

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.879 
you always have to have sacrifice
something<00:04:22.780> okay<00:04:23.199> you<00:04:23.259> don't<00:04:23.470> want<00:04:23.680> to<00:04:23.770> be<00:04:23.860> a

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
something okay you don't want to be a

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:26.370 
something okay you don't want to be a
jack<00:04:24.220> of<00:04:24.250> all<00:04:24.490> trades<00:04:24.820> master<00:04:24.970> of<00:04:25.360> none<00:04:25.479> I<00:04:25.870> mean

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
jack of all trades master of none I mean

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.350 
jack of all trades master of none I mean
for<00:04:26.560> those<00:04:26.650> people<00:04:26.860> who<00:04:27.060> can<00:04:28.060> do<00:04:28.210> multiple

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
for those people who can do multiple

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.659 
for those people who can do multiple
things<00:04:28.660> and<00:04:29.050> do<00:04:29.139> it<00:04:29.229> very<00:04:29.259> well<00:04:29.550> you<00:04:30.550> know

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
things and do it very well you know

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.409 
things and do it very well you know
that's<00:04:30.910> not<00:04:31.240> as<00:04:31.449> common<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:32.460> probably<00:04:33.460> we're

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
that's not as common and probably we're

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.990 
that's not as common and probably we're
willing<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:35.500> put<00:04:35.860> the<00:04:35.979> time<00:04:36.009> and<00:04:36.280> effort<00:04:36.639> into

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
willing to put the time and effort into

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.060 
willing to put the time and effort into
it<00:04:37.240> so<00:04:37.570> when<00:04:38.380> you<00:04:38.470> dedicate<00:04:38.650> time<00:04:39.010> to

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
it so when you dedicate time to

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.379 
it so when you dedicate time to
something<00:04:39.580> something<00:04:39.909> else<00:04:40.060> has<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:40.210> be

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
something something else has to be

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.230 
something something else has to be
sacrificed<00:04:40.960> and<00:04:41.229> that<00:04:42.190> may<00:04:42.430> change<00:04:42.729> through

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
sacrificed and that may change through

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.180 
sacrificed and that may change through
throughout<00:04:43.630> your<00:04:43.810> years<00:04:43.870> like<00:04:44.560> for<00:04:44.860> me<00:04:45.039> it

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
throughout your years like for me it

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.700 
throughout your years like for me it
changed<00:04:45.220> and<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.750> I'll<00:04:47.110> go<00:04:47.320> into<00:04:47.349> that

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
changed and and I'll go into that

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.529 
changed and and I'll go into that
further<00:04:48.010> specifically<00:04:48.820> in<00:04:48.909> terms<00:04:48.940> of<00:04:49.300> how<00:04:49.479> you

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
further specifically in terms of how you

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.070 
further specifically in terms of how you
go<00:04:49.810> about<00:04:49.840> finding<00:04:50.680> opportunities<00:04:51.130> and

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
go about finding opportunities and

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.800 
go about finding opportunities and
creating<00:04:53.080> opportunities<00:04:53.650> for<00:04:53.680> yourself<00:04:54.250> and

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
creating opportunities for yourself and

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.510 
creating opportunities for yourself and
me<00:04:55.810> I<00:04:55.840> think<00:04:56.229> maybe<00:04:56.440> that<00:04:56.560> that's<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.370> next

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
me I think maybe that that's the next

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.070 
me I think maybe that that's the next
thing<00:04:57.639> I'll<00:04:57.820> go<00:04:57.970> over<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.240> next<00:04:58.449> book<00:04:58.630> so

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
thing I'll go over the next book so

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.510 
thing I'll go over the next book so
until<00:04:59.289> then<00:04:59.409> thanks<00:04:59.740> for<00:04:59.800> watching<00:04:59.919> and<00:05:00.460> I
