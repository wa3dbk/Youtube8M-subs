00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.820 
front of the curtain but they don't
really<00:02:17.610> know<00:02:17.850> anything<00:02:18.300> about<00:02:18.560> who<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.680> are

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
really know anything about who you are

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.910 
really know anything about who you are
behind<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.400> curtain<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.080> in<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.350> sense<00:02:22.680> you

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
behind the curtain and in that sense you

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.680 
behind the curtain and in that sense you
are<00:02:22.950> very<00:02:23.400> still<00:02:24.060> very<00:02:24.770> alone<00:02:26.450> although<00:02:27.450> you

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
are very still very alone although you

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.450 
are very still very alone although you
think<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.260> have<00:02:28.440> all<00:02:28.620> these<00:02:28.800> people<00:02:29.220> as

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
think you have all these people as

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.100 
think you have all these people as
friends<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:31.080> know<00:02:31.170> given<00:02:31.500> your<00:02:31.620> love<00:02:33.110> no

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
friends and you know given your love no

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.560 
friends and you know given your love no
it's<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.830> very<00:02:35.430> interesting<00:02:35.730> point<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.270> view

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
it's a very interesting point of view

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.180 
it's a very interesting point of view
my<00:02:37.560> approach<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.090> TV<00:02:39.090> shooting<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:40.190> stage

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
my approach to TV shooting and stage

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.000 
my approach to TV shooting and stage
performing<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.300> completely<00:02:43.290> different<00:02:43.680> in

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
performing is completely different in

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.430 
performing is completely different in
that<00:02:44.160> sense<00:02:44.430> because<00:02:44.490> my<00:02:45.210> my<00:02:45.990> colleagues

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
that sense because my my colleagues

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.130 
that sense because my my colleagues
complain<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.340> lot<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:48.000> on<00:02:48.240> stage<00:02:48.570> I<00:02:48.720> never<00:02:48.930> do

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
complain a lot that on stage I never do

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.100 
complain a lot that on stage I never do
the<00:02:49.470> same<00:02:49.500> thing<00:02:49.890> twice<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:51.060> I'm<00:02:51.840> actually

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
the same thing twice and I'm actually

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.980 
the same thing twice and I'm actually
doing<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:53.090> probably<00:02:54.090> on<00:02:54.210> purpose<00:02:54.450> because<00:02:54.750> I

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
doing that probably on purpose because I

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.590 
doing that probably on purpose because I
hate<00:02:55.260> being<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:56.040> becoming<00:02:56.760> routine<00:02:56.970> work

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
hate being it becoming routine work

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.050 
hate being it becoming routine work
because<00:02:58.320> we<00:02:58.530> do<00:02:58.680> perform<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.220> same<00:02:59.430> show<00:02:59.730> over

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
because we do perform the same show over

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.990 
because we do perform the same show over
and<00:03:00.210> over<00:03:00.450> again<00:03:00.800> but<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:02.220> audience<00:03:02.580> only<00:03:02.730> see

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
and over again but the audience only see

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.450 
and over again but the audience only see
it<00:03:03.090> one<00:03:03.240> times<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.810> would<00:03:04.740> like<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.100> keep<00:03:05.280> it

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
it one times I would like to keep it

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.900 
it one times I would like to keep it
fresh<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.230> but<00:03:07.230> for<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.920> movie<00:03:08.730> shock

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
fresh and but for the movie shock

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.270 
fresh and but for the movie shock
because<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.360> know<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.900> edit<00:03:10.260> things<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:11.100> I

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
because you know you edit things and I

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.770 
because you know you edit things and I
hate<00:03:11.910> when<00:03:12.210> things<00:03:12.690> aren't<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:15.360> hair<00:03:15.600> was

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
hate when things aren't the hair was

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.320 
hate when things aren't the hair was
here<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.260> cut<00:03:16.980> before<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.550> suddenly<00:03:18.210> up

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
here the cut before and suddenly up

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.630 
here the cut before and suddenly up
there<00:03:18.570> you<00:03:19.410> can't<00:03:19.680> control<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.100> but<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.460> would

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
there you can't control that but I would

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.040 
there you can't control that but I would
like<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.820> control<00:03:21.480> my<00:03:22.040> motion<00:03:23.120> so<00:03:24.120> as<00:03:24.450> I'm

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
like to control my motion so as I'm

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.490 
like to control my motion so as I'm
performing<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.920> detach<00:03:26.250> myself<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.380> you<00:03:28.380> know

set the choreography on the music on the
beat<00:03:31.230> things<00:03:31.560> like<00:03:31.770> that<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.790> course<00:03:32.880> I<00:03:33.150> can't

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
beat things like that of course I can't

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.120 
beat things like that of course I can't
reenact<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.900> hundred<00:03:34.290> percent<00:03:34.650> what<00:03:34.800> I've<00:03:34.920> done

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
reenact a hundred percent what I've done

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.150 
reenact a hundred percent what I've done
every<00:03:36.000> single<00:03:36.330> take<00:03:36.570> but<00:03:37.010> when<00:03:38.010> it's

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
every single take but when it's

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.850 
every single take but when it's
something<00:03:38.370> slowly<00:03:38.880> slow<00:03:39.570> or<00:03:39.930> when<00:03:40.680> it's

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
something slowly slow or when it's

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.950 
something slowly slow or when it's
something<00:03:41.070> that<00:03:41.370> is<00:03:41.490> more<00:03:42.140> more<00:03:43.140> into<00:03:43.730> acting

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
something that is more more into acting

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.470 
something that is more more into acting
side<00:03:45.960> then<00:03:46.860> I<00:03:46.890> try<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.370> synchronize<00:03:48.300> it<00:03:48.450> with

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
side then I try to synchronize it with

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.920 
side then I try to synchronize it with
the<00:03:48.630> music<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:50.040> that<00:03:50.970> is<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.330> one<00:03:51.600> choice

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
the music so and that is the one choice

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.290 
the music so and that is the one choice
that<00:03:51.990> I<00:03:52.320> made<00:03:53.130> for<00:03:53.520> that<00:03:53.670> particular

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
that I made for that particular

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.570 
that I made for that particular
production<00:03:54.900> so<00:03:57.380> yeah<00:03:58.380> it's<00:03:58.950> not<00:03:59.190> that<00:03:59.430> I'm

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
production so yeah it's not that I'm

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.830 
production so yeah it's not that I'm
trying<00:04:00.260> to<00:04:01.260> fall<00:04:01.500> into<00:04:01.770> routine<00:04:01.980> it's<00:04:02.400> just

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
trying to fall into routine it's just

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.450 
trying to fall into routine it's just
because<00:04:03.840> there's<00:04:04.080> so<00:04:04.380> much<00:04:04.500> more<00:04:04.740> aspect<00:04:05.250> than

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
because there's so much more aspect than

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.660 
because there's so much more aspect than
live<00:04:06.060> theater<00:04:06.570> I'm<00:04:07.410> trying<00:04:07.860> to<00:04:08.070> stick<00:04:08.490> with

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670

live theater I'm trying to stick with
one<00:04:08.990> interpretation<00:04:09.990> and<00:04:10.730> follow<00:04:11.730> through

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
one interpretation and follow through

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.530 
one interpretation and follow through
I've<00:04:13.160> worked<00:04:14.160> closely<00:04:14.310> with<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:15.180> choreographer
