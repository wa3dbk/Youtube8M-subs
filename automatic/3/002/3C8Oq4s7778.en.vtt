properly<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.350> all<00:00:22.439> wheels<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.070> bits<00:00:23.279> and

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
properly and all wheels and bits and

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.970 
properly and all wheels and bits and
pieces<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.820> are<00:00:24.029> all<00:00:24.119> all<00:00:24.630> tip-top<00:00:25.590> before

pieces that are all all tip-top before

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.470 
pieces that are all all tip-top before
we<00:00:26.070> pull<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.369> all<00:00:26.490> apart<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:26.939> start<00:00:27.210> painting

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.790 
we pull it all apart and start painting

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
don't want to be happen to buddy dick

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.900 
don't want to be happen to buddy dick
around<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.949> scratch<00:00:32.219> paint<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.730> all<00:00:32.790> that

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
around and scratch paint and all that

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.660 
around and scratch paint and all that
kind<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.149> stuff<00:00:33.239> while<00:00:33.510> we're<00:00:33.630> fixing<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.170> so

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
kind of stuff while we're fixing it so

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.830 
kind of stuff while we're fixing it so
the<00:00:35.670> first<00:00:35.850> thing<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.149> we<00:00:36.329> found<00:00:36.510> was<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
the first thing that we found was the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.560 
the first thing that we found was the
front<00:00:37.110> wheel<00:00:37.670> had<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> bit<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.059> wobble<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.450> it

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
front wheel had a bit of a wobble in it

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.540 
front wheel had a bit of a wobble in it
so<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.320> presume<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:41.040> was<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.399> be

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
so we presume that that was going to be

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.639 
so we presume that that was going to be
wheel<00:00:41.790> bearing<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.390> went<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.660> bought<00:00:42.719> a

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
wheel bearing so we went and bought a

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.830 
wheel bearing so we went and bought a
set<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.219> wheel<00:00:44.340> bearings<00:00:44.640> which<00:00:44.789> was<00:00:44.940> $15<00:00:45.629> from

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
set of wheel bearings which was $15 from

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.529 
set of wheel bearings which was $15 from
Elliott<00:00:46.350> Brothers<00:00:47.000> but<00:00:48.000> I'll<00:00:48.120> show<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.390> what

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
Elliott Brothers but I'll show you what

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.900 
Elliott Brothers but I'll show you what
the<00:00:48.660> hell<00:00:48.960> when<00:00:49.770> we<00:00:49.890> pulled<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.789> other

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
the hell when we pulled the the other

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.779 
the hell when we pulled the the other
ones<00:00:51.120> out<00:00:51.860> actually<00:00:52.860> before<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.219> start<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.640> tell

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
ones out actually before I start to tell

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:54.639 
ones out actually before I start to tell
you<00:00:53.910> about<00:00:53.969> that

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
you about that

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.869 
you about that
I've<00:00:55.649> never<00:00:55.949> dive<00:00:56.280> never<00:00:56.520> done<00:00:56.730> wheel

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
I've never dive never done wheel

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.700 
I've never dive never done wheel
bearings<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> motorcycle<00:00:58.020> before<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.530> this

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
bearings on a motorcycle before so this

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.500 
bearings on a motorcycle before so this
is<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.430> first<00:00:59.670> for<00:00:59.820> me<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.390> now

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
is this is the first for me and for now

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.470 
is this is the first for me and for now
as<00:01:00.690> well<00:01:01.010> so<00:01:02.010> we<00:01:02.460> jumped<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.850> YouTube<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.420> I

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
as well so we jumped on YouTube and I

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.990 
as well so we jumped on YouTube and I
found<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:04.080> there's<00:01:04.830> nothing<00:01:05.070> about<00:01:05.250> CT<00:01:05.790> one

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
found a there's nothing about CT one

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.060 
found a there's nothing about CT one
tens<00:01:06.360> doing<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.049> changing<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> bearings

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
tens doing that changing the bearings

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.289 
tens doing that changing the bearings
but<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.310> found<00:01:08.520> one<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.880> was<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.150> a

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
but I found one that was just a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.480 
but I found one that was just a
motorcycle<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.950> seems<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.340> me<00:01:11.460> that

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
motorcycle and it seems to me that

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.910 
motorcycle and it seems to me that
pretty<00:01:11.790> much<00:01:11.939> they're<00:01:12.180> all<00:01:12.470> pretty<00:01:13.470> much<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.770 
pretty much they're all pretty much the
same<00:01:14.130> way<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.610> doing<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.000> I'm<00:01:15.360> gonna<00:01:15.540> put<00:01:15.750> a

same way of doing it I'm gonna put a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.380 
same way of doing it I'm gonna put a
link<00:01:16.049> up<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.189> guy<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.700> did<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
link up to the the guy that did the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.969 
link up to the the guy that did the
video<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.840> watched<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.650> we<00:01:19.799> watch

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
video that I watched all that we watch

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.490 
video that I watched all that we watch
just<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.400> see<00:01:20.549> how<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:20.960> so<00:01:21.960> far<00:01:22.259> it's

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
just to see how to do it so far it's

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.260 
just to see how to do it so far it's
worked<00:01:22.740> really<00:01:22.950> really<00:01:23.070> well<00:01:23.310> here's<00:01:24.210> that

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
worked really really well here's that

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.350 
worked really really well here's that
link<00:01:25.250> I'll<00:01:26.250> show<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.610> these<00:01:26.790> bearings<00:01:27.210> that

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
link I'll show you these bearings that

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.980 
link I'll show you these bearings that
we<00:01:27.450> pulled<00:01:27.869> out<00:01:34.340> this<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.549> what<00:01:35.729> came<00:01:35.939> out<00:01:36.240> so

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
we pulled out this is what came out so

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.679 
we pulled out this is what came out so
they've<00:01:37.200> got<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.619> side<00:01:38.159> there<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.850> then<00:01:39.540> on

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
they've got that side there and then on

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.649 
they've got that side there and then on
that<00:01:39.869> side<00:01:40.140> which<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.470> inside<00:01:41.189> part<00:01:42.030> you

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
that side which is the inside part you

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.310 
that side which is the inside part you
can<00:01:42.780> see<00:01:43.020> all<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:44.149> the<00:01:45.149> seal<00:01:45.420> has<00:01:45.840> all<00:01:46.049> come

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
can see all that the seal has all come

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.030 
can see all that the seal has all come
off<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.710> all<00:01:46.829> rusted<00:01:47.280> out<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:49.680> center

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
off it's all rusted out and the center

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.580 
off it's all rusted out and the center
the<00:01:50.340> center<00:01:50.670> piece<00:01:54.079> well<00:01:55.079> that's<00:01:55.259> what<00:01:55.470> they

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the center piece well that's what they

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.200 
the center piece well that's what they
call<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.890> spacer<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:57.270> basically<00:01:59.030> inside<00:02:00.030> the

call the spacer so basically inside the
middle<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.570> wheel<00:02:01.790> these<00:02:02.790> basically<00:02:03.509> sit

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
middle of the wheel these basically sit

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.010 
middle of the wheel these basically sit
like<00:02:04.229> like<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.030> was<00:02:06.270> all<00:02:06.450> rusted

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
like like that so this was all rusted

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.930 
like like that so this was all rusted
and<00:02:07.320> buddy<00:02:07.590> it's<00:02:07.979> all<00:02:08.099> pitted<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:08.670> we've<00:02:08.789> had

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
and buddy it's all pitted so we've had

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.260 
and buddy it's all pitted so we've had
to<00:02:09.950> what<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:10.979> call<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.190> sandpaper<00:02:11.459> down<00:02:12.000> just<00:02:12.180> to

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
to what I call a sandpaper down just to

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.640 
to what I call a sandpaper down just to
smooth<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.599> all<00:02:12.690> up

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
smooth it all up

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.960 
smooth it all up
so<00:02:13.799> hopefully<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.310> should<00:02:14.670> be<00:02:14.760> still

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
so hopefully that that should be still

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.750 
so hopefully that that should be still
all<00:02:15.090> right<00:02:15.620> so<00:02:16.620> we've<00:02:16.739> got<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.040> new<00:02:17.189> new<00:02:17.579> ones

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
standard so we're gonna use those unless

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.760 
standard so we're gonna use those unless
it<00:06:28.300> looks<00:06:28.750> will<00:06:29.259> change<00:06:29.529> it<00:06:29.680> for

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.650 
the base of underneath the the taillight

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.290 
the base of underneath the the taillight
and<00:06:48.060> I<00:06:49.060> had<00:06:49.870> to<00:06:49.990> get<00:06:50.139> I<00:06:50.620> had<00:06:51.400> to<00:06:51.580> buy<00:06:51.969> one<00:06:52.270> of

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 
and I had to get I had to buy one of

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.480 
and I had to get I had to buy one of
those<00:06:52.479> to<00:06:52.870> put<00:06:53.020> it<00:06:53.110> on<00:06:53.259> for<00:06:53.770> it<00:06:53.889> to<00:06:54.039> pass<00:06:54.279> the

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.490 
those to put it on for it to pass the

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.030 
those to put it on for it to pass the
road<00:06:54.669> wheelie

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:58.040 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.590 

so<00:06:59.040> what<00:06:59.220> we<00:06:59.340> did<00:06:59.490> was<00:06:59.669> on<00:06:59.970> that<00:07:00.090> one<00:07:00.330> team

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 
so what we did was on that one team

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.879 
so what we did was on that one team
motorcycles<00:07:01.410> place<00:07:02.540> they<00:07:03.540> sell<00:07:03.840> parts<00:07:04.650> and

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:04.889 
motorcycles place they sell parts and

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:06.379 
motorcycles place they sell parts and
they<00:07:05.010> sell<00:07:05.280> wrecking<00:07:05.639> parts<00:07:05.970> and<00:07:06.120> this<00:07:06.210> was

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:06.389 
they sell wrecking parts and this was

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:08.300 
they sell wrecking parts and this was
actually<00:07:06.570> a<00:07:06.780> wrecking<00:07:07.139> part<00:07:07.380> so<00:07:07.919> that's<00:07:08.100> the

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.310 
actually a wrecking part so that's the

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.070 
actually a wrecking part so that's the
original<00:07:08.729> one<00:07:08.910> so<00:07:09.389> hope<00:07:09.540> we<00:07:09.690> haven't<00:07:09.810> tested

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
original one so hope we haven't tested

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.610 
original one so hope we haven't tested
it<00:07:10.320> but<00:07:10.500> hopefully<00:07:10.970> that<00:07:11.970> will<00:07:12.570> all<00:07:12.750> work<00:07:12.960> but

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 
it but hopefully that will all work but

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.200 
it but hopefully that will all work but
this<00:07:13.830> one<00:07:14.040> won't<00:07:14.340> allow<00:07:14.639> you<00:07:14.699> to<00:07:14.850> have<00:07:15.030> the

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
this one won't allow you to have the

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.689 
this one won't allow you to have the
light<00:07:15.419> turned<00:07:16.320> off<00:07:16.530> which<00:07:17.130> means<00:07:17.400> will<00:07:17.610> be

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:17.699 
light turned off which means will be

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:24.080 
light turned off which means will be
sweet<00:07:17.940> for<00:07:17.970> the<00:07:18.180> roadway<00:07:18.479> alright<00:07:19.470> I<00:07:23.090> think
