at<00:01:17.399> random<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.119> they<00:01:18.270> don't<00:01:18.450> need<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.689> be

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
at random but they don't need to be

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:20.600 
at random but they don't need to be
closed<00:01:19.140> some<00:01:19.500> lines<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.920> be<00:01:19.950> thick<00:01:20.340> some

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
