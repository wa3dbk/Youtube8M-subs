00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 people what is going on here again 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.850
 start today I have another here 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.760
 portal 2 video for you and keep it 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:14.910
 here today at a june the website 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.350
 for the backplate touch and shape me 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.660
 I just want to start 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.710
 say and for now so long no 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.340
 videos came channel 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.350
 I have Wednesday with me last week 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.369
 pretty stressful short work 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.500
 written and must stop for freedom 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.970
 a lot of noise and yes right after that 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.439
 did not get sick first 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.730
 was also out of action because of that I can 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.160
 do not make videos 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.520
 and so now not even next week on 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.320
 course trip from today and therefore come 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.500
 by now definitely next 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.809
 week Saturday definitely not 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.850
 a bit sorry for me but me videos 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.489
 definitely have a lot going on 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.559
 stress outside so also with school 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.640
 and so so much so do 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.289
 I also do not have that many videos 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.050
 I just wanted to tell you that 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.940
 but now let's start directly 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.640
 So as I said today is here 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.580
 a unique weapon that has the belt 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.720
 mad moxxi's touch the traffic server of 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.659
 will never change 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.250
 It's a maxi weapon, after all 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.450
 it is already on it is one 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.950
 actually pretty cool weapons like me 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.270
 find 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:25.049
 to wish to have p8 is 100 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:29.220
 62,000 no idea what goes so therefore 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.299
 is ok thanks accuracy 94.4 is up 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.659
 pretty much okay in any case 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.150
 for 18 years is average 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.030
 I would say 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.729
 unity 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.549
 3 2 normal magazine size too 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.960
 a relatively average weapon that 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.270
 special about this weapon is that you 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.280
 Here are these +70 critical hits 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.140
 hurt what really is really strong 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.460
 so if above the bar behave in the 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.750
 Nativity scene shoots then you can 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.990
 really really harm properly 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.229
 and there it is jan o mat maxi 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.750
 Weapon is 25 percent of the damage 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.420
 the one with the weapon directly 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.130
 converted into life then it is at 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.500
 to harm those with the best 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.910
 can cause tender head up yet 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.900
 really a pretty big topic 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.400
 I would say so I'm doing this now 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.100
 was here with the siren 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.230
 i have the character of smbs here 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.959
 can do the most damage possible 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.959
 I also use the setup with 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.480
 this smg the highest possible harm 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.790
 to do and I have here the 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.440
 classes length direct the give me plus 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.620
 134 percent 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.180
 smg thereby we will become me 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.980
 presumably the damage could be thought 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.989
 Of course, then doubled 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.540
 that behitches and then here the 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.390
 bones of the ancestors with plus 37 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.250
 percent fire damage and absolute 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.660
 time improvement for a skill tree he 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.190
 for my skills so it's so loud 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.660
 with the man with the weapon the most 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.360
 we can look at us 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.530
 now first the damage values ​​on there 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.200
 we do not have critical hits 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.500
 area on an unkempt dummy 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.620
 damage of about four million and 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.540
 but still 62,000 but its here 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.739
 just a few crushed if he was 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.739
 then it starts to burn 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.390
 then makes it even hurt quite well to 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.520
 harm to 100,000 per second is 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.900
 pretty neat, I would say that 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.820
 Let's see the critical hit 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.260
 area 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.230
 Therefore, the damage lies with the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.490
 spotted dummy because nearly 20 million 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.960
 it's really very much 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.780
 not four million 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.880
 Critical 19 in the critical is on everyone 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.310
 fall too airy and if you are 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.770
 Just think about just 600,000 lives 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.540
 and you always get two of them 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.190
 caused damage as life back 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.050
 that's pretty neat 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.090
 Finally, let's have a look 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.800
 first when the fact was that we in 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.630
 not critical hit area 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:02.230
 damage of about that twelve 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:06.490
 million more than 12 million and a bern 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.460
 damage of about 300,000 so the 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.770
 track does not triples the damage 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.290
 meanwhile area was on 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.239
 triples so I can do something 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.979
 we now look the normal in 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.750
 Critical hit overreaching 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.440
 even if it is now difficult 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.509
 to see something or 62 million one 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.860
 otherwise often pretty good to recognize and 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:28.539
 in the critical hit area you have 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.030
 then a pretty big one too 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.590
 Increases in the damage except for everyone 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.360
 pretty neat my 60 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.729
 millions on the stretched type of 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.979
 The guy who mostly plays in her team 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.830
 that always someone because of the snack 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:45.150
 or so so surely that is already 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.470
 I want to be here 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.180
 No, that's really it 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.560
 cause quite a bit of damage 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.610
 especially the whole bern 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.080
 We can also write with you 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.699
 so if you look then you pressed 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.370
 has and a really poor one 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.690
 hit critical area then go 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.580
 we still have the opponent with this bern 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.979
 hurt love then shake himself 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.110
 it's really pretty fast 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:06.570
 can sums, I would say I do 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.919
 with the weapon already with the siren 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.960
 really could have caused a lot of damage 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.180
 I would say weapon is on the siren 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.570
 best to use so i think 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.659
 on the siren you can with the help of 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:22.260
 skills and class with the weapon 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:24.400
 I think most harm causes 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.020
 and now I am also very 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.310
 Quick as you get the weapon 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.840
 pretty easy for that just come in 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:34.310
 bit with coal and how dementia 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.790
 mailbox it was a fat tip 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.790
 Yes 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.040
 so and then you get a touch with 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.790
 slight variations 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:51.170
 I look the better 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.730
 yes this definitely cool the power 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.730
 definitely a thicker harm 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:01.100
 There are tens of thousands of people there 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:04.640
 the 90 rather and brussels bigger 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.240
 magazine size so I'm with you on each one 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.650
 cool 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.980
 So I forgot a few things 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.240
 to say and as I said that I 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.520
 believe it with the fix had already said 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.470
 that I always fix the maxi free fix 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.850
 Also , the weapon would always only 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.170
 with the free element get in with 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.290
 the other element is the weapons 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:23.300
 not so you can gun in 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.130
 principle and finally get the 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.780
 I could have the best variation here 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.270
 my windows in principle money that now 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.970
 really nothing you can do in the endgame 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.730
 Little has so you can just you 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.840
 your best is just faster here 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.780
 drive by just a bit 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.100
 interject here gratuity 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.790
 It is easy to get for that 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.790
 actually pretty good 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.940
 yes, that's about it 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.700
 the video I hope he liked it 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.050
 or further helped if that is so 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.610
 Of course, I'm talking about everyone 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.280
 numbness over every abo each 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.870
 Comment really very much 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.360
 and then I hope that in next 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.960
 time again a few more videos come 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.880
 or 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.300
 just to make some videos 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.190
 after the course was first and yes there 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:11.140
 skin will tell her people and we will see 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.140
 us as always next time bye
