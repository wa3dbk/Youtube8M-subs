sight in this episode I'm going to be

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.169 
sight in this episode I'm going to be
testing<00:00:11.190> three<00:00:11.460> different<00:00:11.730> things

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
testing three different things

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.879 
testing three different things
the<00:00:12.420> recoil<00:00:12.780> difference<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.469> magnification

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
the recoil difference the magnification

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.890 
the recoil difference the magnification
difference<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.000> zoom<00:00:15.240> time<00:00:15.509> difference

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
difference and the zoom time difference

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.980 
difference and the zoom time difference
between<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.440> two<00:00:16.590> sites<00:00:17.539> first<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
between the two sites first is the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.189 
between the two sites first is the
recoil<00:00:19.289> difference<00:00:19.710> test<00:00:20.779> what<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.810> did<00:00:22.020> was

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
recoil difference test what I did was

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.349 
recoil difference test what I did was
pretty<00:00:22.410> simple<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.980> got<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.430> same<00:00:23.640> weapon<00:00:23.970> one

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
pretty simple I got the same weapon one

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.580 
pretty simple I got the same weapon one
with<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.600> red<00:00:24.720> dot<00:00:24.900> sight<00:00:25.109> one<00:00:25.380> with<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
with the red dot sight one with the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.320 
with the red dot sight one with the
reflex<00:00:25.949> sight<00:00:26.010> had<00:00:26.340> him<00:00:26.430> both<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.789> my<00:00:26.880> person

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
reflex sight had him both of my person

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.109 
reflex sight had him both of my person
got<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> standardized<00:00:29.010> location<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.820> fired

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
got to a standardized location and fired

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.939 
got to a standardized location and fired
at<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> wall<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.810> looked<00:00:31.320> at<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.500> marks<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.920> left

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
at a wall I looked at the marks it left

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.979 
at a wall I looked at the marks it left
and<00:00:32.460> compared<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.180> two<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.540> see<00:00:33.570> which<00:00:33.840> one

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
and compared the two to see which one

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.440 
and compared the two to see which one
had<00:00:34.110> more<00:00:34.260> recoil<00:00:34.559> for<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.920> round<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.450> I

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
had more recoil for that round and I

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.240 
had more recoil for that round and I
would<00:00:36.660> write<00:00:36.809> down<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> result<00:00:37.380> now<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:37.950> did

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
would write down the result now I did

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.369 
would write down the result now I did
this<00:00:38.430> multiple<00:00:38.910> times<00:00:38.969> for<00:00:39.629> multiple<00:00:40.050> weapons

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
this multiple times for multiple weapons

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.170 
this multiple times for multiple weapons
and<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:41.040> will<00:00:41.219> show<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.610> data<00:00:41.820> which<00:00:42.059> are

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
and I will show you the data which are

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.049 
and I will show you the data which are
recorded<00:00:42.860> as<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.219> see<00:00:44.370> here<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.850> first

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
recorded as you can see here the first

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.420 
recorded as you can see here the first
number<00:00:45.390> represents<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.170> amount<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.010> times<00:00:47.250> I

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
number represents the amount of times I

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.360 
number represents the amount of times I
tested<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> weapon<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.649> amount<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
tested the weapon so the amount of the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.880 
tested the weapon so the amount of the
pair's<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.910> fired<00:00:51.239> with<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.570> red<00:00:52.140> dot<00:00:52.350> than<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
pair's I fired with the red dot than the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.750 
pair's I fired with the red dot than the
reflex<00:00:53.809> so<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.170> aki<00:00:55.590> if<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.010> did<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> hundred

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
reflex so for the aki if I did a hundred

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.569 
reflex so for the aki if I did a hundred
tests<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.719> red<00:00:57.930> dot<00:00:58.170> had<00:00:58.379> more<00:00:58.559> recoil<00:00:58.859> 43

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
tests and the red dot had more recoil 43

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.819 
tests and the red dot had more recoil 43
times<00:00:59.760> than<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.149> reflex<00:01:00.449> had<00:01:00.600> more<00:01:00.750> reco<00:01:01.020> 37

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
times than the reflex had more reco 37

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.250 
times than the reflex had more reco 37
times<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.460> 20<00:01:03.329> times<00:01:03.480> out<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.960> hundred

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
times and 20 times out of the hundred

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.170 
times and 20 times out of the hundred
tests<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.769> recoil<00:01:05.129> was<00:01:05.250> just<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.640> even<00:01:05.850> or

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
tests the recoil was just to even or

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.030 
tests the recoil was just to even or
just<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.510> hard<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.780> tell<00:01:07.020> which<00:01:07.560> one<00:01:07.710> was<00:01:07.830> more

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
just to hard to tell which one was more

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.890 
just to hard to tell which one was more
or<00:01:08.159> which<00:01:08.280> one<00:01:08.400> was<00:01:08.520> less<00:01:08.700> now<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.720> aughh

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
or which one was less now for the aughh

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.109 
or which one was less now for the aughh
I<00:01:10.140> only<00:01:10.290> tested<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.770> 26<00:01:11.310> times<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.970> sake

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
I only tested it 26 times for the sake

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.630 
I only tested it 26 times for the sake
of<00:01:12.150> time<00:01:12.560> because<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.680> did<00:01:13.920> take<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> while<00:01:14.220> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
of time because this did take a while to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.999 
of time because this did take a while to
do<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.540> red<00:01:15.720> dot<00:01:15.930> had<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.560> red<00:01:16.740> dot<00:01:16.890> and

do and the red dot had the red dot and

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.640 
do and the red dot had the red dot and
the<00:01:17.159> reflex<00:01:17.549> both<00:01:18.360> had<00:01:18.570> more<00:01:18.750> recoil<00:01:19.080> ten

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the reflex both had more recoil ten

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.070 
the reflex both had more recoil ten
times<00:01:19.920> out<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.159> 26<00:01:20.640> tests<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.090> there's<00:01:21.240> six

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
times out of 26 tests and there's six

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.789 
times out of 26 tests and there's six
ties<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.619> 26<00:01:23.159> tests<00:01:24.259> as<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.560> see<00:01:25.680> on

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
ties of 26 tests as you can see on

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.620 
ties of 26 tests as you can see on
screen<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.100> also<00:01:26.400> tested<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.970> Enfield<00:01:27.360> at<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
screen I also tested the Enfield at the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.700 
screen I also tested the Enfield at the
m16<00:01:28.170> 26<00:01:28.680> times<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:30.119> Enfield<00:01:30.710> actually

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
m16 26 times and the Enfield actually

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.969 
m16 26 times and the Enfield actually
the<00:01:32.009> reflex<00:01:32.460> sight<00:01:32.729> had<00:01:33.540> more<00:01:34.380> recoil<00:01:34.680> eight

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
reflex neither one it has less recoil

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.840 
reflex neither one it has less recoil
they<00:01:45.720> do<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.110> same<00:01:46.409> exact<00:01:46.860> thing<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.670> is

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
they do the same exact thing this is

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.030 
they do the same exact thing this is
just<00:01:48.060> out<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.240> averages<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.680> test

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
just out of averages and just this test

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.770 
just out of averages and just this test
obviously<00:01:50.399> isn't<00:01:50.520> perfect<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.570> just

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
obviously isn't perfect but it just

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.450 
obviously isn't perfect but it just
shows<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:51.990> neither<00:01:52.409> one<00:01:52.710> has<00:01:52.950> more<00:01:53.189> or<00:01:53.369> less

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
shows that neither one has more or less

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.319 
shows that neither one has more or less
recoil<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.799> odd<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:55.979> m16<00:01:56.700> had<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
recoil and like the odd the m16 had the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.940 
recoil and like the odd the m16 had the
same<00:01:57.540> amount<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.810> times<00:01:58.020> where<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.590> red<00:01:58.770> dot

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
same amount of times where the red dot

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.319 
same amount of times where the red dot
and<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.189> reflex<00:01:59.520> sight<00:01:59.579> had<00:01:59.850> more<00:02:00.030> recoil

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
and the reflex sight had more recoil

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.999 
and the reflex sight had more recoil
five<00:02:00.960> for<00:02:01.170> each<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.700> sixteen<00:02:02.700> ties<00:02:02.909> oh<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.890> on

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
five for each and sixteen ties oh and on

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.980 
five for each and sixteen ties oh and on
a<00:02:05.040> side<00:02:05.340> note<00:02:05.369> these<00:02:06.090> tests<00:02:06.479> aren't<00:02:06.659> saying

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
a side note these tests aren't saying

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.900 
a side note these tests aren't saying
that<00:02:07.140> like<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.380> aka<00:02:07.799> always<00:02:08.220> has<00:02:08.399> more<00:02:08.580> recoil

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
that like the aka always has more recoil

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.760 
that like the aka always has more recoil
with<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.209> red<00:02:09.390> dot<00:02:09.629> or<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.899> Enfield<00:02:10.530> always

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
with the red dot or the Enfield always

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.650 
with the red dot or the Enfield always
has<00:02:10.890> more<00:02:11.069> reco

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
has more reco

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.720 
has more reco
reflex<00:02:12.170> these<00:02:12.650> are<00:02:12.800> just<00:02:12.920> averages<00:02:13.460> and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
reflex these are just averages and

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.450 
reflex these are just averages and
obviously<00:02:14.530> different<00:02:15.530> times<00:02:15.770> they'll<00:02:16.250> have

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
obviously different times they'll have

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.250 
obviously different times they'll have
different<00:02:16.700> amounts<00:02:17.240> it's<00:02:17.360> just<00:02:17.540> all<00:02:17.750> based<00:02:18.110> on

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
different amounts it's just all based on

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.160 
different amounts it's just all based on
chance

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
chance

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.790 
chance
next<00:02:21.170> is<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.440> magnification<00:02:21.830> different<00:02:22.400> test

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
next is the magnification different test

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.530 
next is the magnification different test
this<00:02:24.800> one<00:02:25.040> was<00:02:25.220> really<00:02:25.340> easy<00:02:25.580> I<00:02:25.880> just<00:02:26.180> took<00:02:26.330> to

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
this one was really easy I just took to

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.570 
this one was really easy I just took to
freeze<00:02:26.870> frames<00:02:27.200> one<00:02:27.620> with<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.010> red<00:02:28.130> dot<00:02:28.340> sight

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
freeze frames one with the red dot sight

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.490 
freeze frames one with the red dot sight
and<00:02:28.790> one<00:02:28.940> with<00:02:29.090> reflex<00:02:29.570> Amy<00:02:29.840> at<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.050> same<00:02:30.320> like

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
and one with reflex Amy at the same like

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.860 
and one with reflex Amy at the same like
Target<00:02:30.830> from<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.100> same<00:02:31.370> exact<00:02:31.700> spot<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.600> from

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
Target from the same exact spot and from

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.750 
Target from the same exact spot and from
here<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.140> compared<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.830> two<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.160> see<00:02:34.190> if<00:02:34.370> one

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
here I compared the two to see if one

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.440 
here I compared the two to see if one
had<00:02:34.910> more<00:02:35.090> magnification<00:02:35.660> than<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.200> other

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
had more magnification than the other

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.090 
had more magnification than the other
this<00:02:38.450> image<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.230> both<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.740> pictures

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
this image is to both the pictures

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.520 
this image is to both the pictures
overlaid<00:02:40.610> on<00:02:40.760> top<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:41.060> each<00:02:41.210> other<00:02:41.330> so<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:42.050> see

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
overlaid on top of each other so you see

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.290 
overlaid on top of each other so you see
any<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.860> differences<00:02:43.340> in<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.760> two<00:02:43.970> photos

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
any the differences in the two photos

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.060 
any the differences in the two photos
and<00:02:44.780> obviously<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.320> can<00:02:45.440> see<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.710> difference

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
and obviously you can see the difference

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.860 
and obviously you can see the difference
in<00:02:46.190> between<00:02:46.460> the<00:02:46.850> red<00:02:47.090> dot<00:02:47.270> and<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.480> reflex

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
in between the red dot and the reflex

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.740 
in between the red dot and the reflex
natural<00:02:48.350> sight<00:02:48.530> but<00:02:49.280> um<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:50.240> target<00:02:50.600> looks

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
natural sight but um the target looks

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.270 
natural sight but um the target looks
exactly<00:02:50.960> the<00:02:51.200> same<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:51.770> there<00:02:52.040> is<00:02:52.130> no

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
exactly the same so there is no

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.390 
exactly the same so there is no
difference<00:02:52.640> in<00:02:52.700> magnification<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:54.310> here<00:02:55.310> are

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
difference in magnification and here are

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.080 
difference in magnification and here are
both<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.670> photos<00:02:56.000> side<00:02:56.210> by<00:02:56.360> side<00:02:57.490> last<00:02:58.490> is<00:02:58.850> the

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
both the photos side by side last is the

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.370 
both the photos side by side last is the
zoom<00:02:59.300> time<00:02:59.600> test<00:03:01.360> here<00:03:02.360> I<00:03:02.390> just<00:03:02.480> zoomed<00:03:03.170> in

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
zoom time test here I just zoomed in

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.700 
zoom time test here I just zoomed in
once<00:03:03.620> with<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:03.980> red<00:03:04.130> dot<00:03:04.310> once<00:03:04.550> at<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.850> reflex

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
once with the red dot once at the reflex

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.950 
once with the red dot once at the reflex
it's<00:03:06.710> the<00:03:06.800> same<00:03:07.010> exact<00:03:07.280> thing<00:03:07.370> they<00:03:07.970> took<00:03:08.600> both

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
it's the same exact thing they took both

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.750 
it's the same exact thing they took both
exactly<00:03:09.470> eight<00:03:09.650> frames<00:03:09.980> but<00:03:10.490> this<00:03:10.610> is

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
exactly eight frames but this is

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.390 
exactly eight frames but this is
recorded<00:03:11.300> at<00:03:11.450> 30<00:03:11.930> frames<00:03:12.110> a<00:03:12.350> second<00:03:12.710> so<00:03:13.250> I'm

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
recorded at 30 frames a second so I'm

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.640 
recorded at 30 frames a second so I'm
assuming<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:14.090> it<00:03:14.240> would<00:03:14.330> take<00:03:14.510> 15<00:03:14.690> frames<00:03:15.290> at

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
assuming that it would take 15 frames at

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.010 
assuming that it would take 15 frames at
60<00:03:16.520> frames<00:03:16.670> a<00:03:16.880> second<00:03:17.209> which<00:03:17.330> game<00:03:17.600> runs<00:03:17.810> at

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
60 frames a second which game runs at

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.220 
60 frames a second which game runs at
which<00:03:18.650> is<00:03:18.770> exactly<00:03:19.190> 1/4<00:03:19.640> of<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.820> second<00:03:20.180> so<00:03:21.110> as

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
which is exactly 1/4 of a second so as

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.870 
which is exactly 1/4 of a second so as
you<00:03:21.350> saw<00:03:21.560> they<00:03:21.740> both<00:03:21.920> raised<00:03:22.280> in<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:22.700> same

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
you saw they both raised in the same

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.210 
you saw they both raised in the same
amount<00:03:23.090> of<00:03:23.180> time<00:03:23.680> so<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:24.740> sum<00:03:24.950> it<00:03:24.980> all<00:03:25.160> up

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
amount of time so to sum it all up

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.550 
amount of time so to sum it all up
there's<00:03:25.670> really<00:03:25.940> no<00:03:26.330> difference<00:03:26.600> between<00:03:27.050> the

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
there's really no difference between the

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.440 
there's really no difference between the
red<00:03:27.709> dot<00:03:27.890> and<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.250> reflex<00:03:28.640> they're<00:03:29.150> basically

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
red dot and the reflex they're basically

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.940 
red dot and the reflex they're basically
the<00:03:29.690> same<00:03:29.720> thing<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.290> only<00:03:30.320> difference<00:03:30.530> is

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
the same thing the only difference is

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.760 
the same thing the only difference is
how<00:03:31.130> it<00:03:31.250> looks

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
how it looks

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.060 
how it looks
