00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.780
 a recipe that I love is about 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.520
 a wide chili soup that remains 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.950
 extraordinary the only thing you need 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.110
 Well evidently wide chiles removed 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.160
 seeds from the ancho chiles 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.500
 we can use more seeds 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.489
 forward for decoration now cut in 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.489

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.610
 and some oil to a pot 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.110

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.860
 little onion 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.510
 in the onion for inside now we're going 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.820
 to give all the aroma and a little fiber 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.860
 of course this recipe with a little bit of 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.400
 celery I tell you that the yogurt failed and I 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.280
 love it because it is 100% natural with milk 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.050
 pure and pasteurized cow does not contain 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.330
 sugar or thickeners what allows me 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.280

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.950
 heavy we now add beta-carotene 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.300

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.920

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.110
