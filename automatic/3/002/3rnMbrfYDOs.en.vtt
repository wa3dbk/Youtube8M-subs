00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.049
 Hello, today I want to show 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.710
 collection of vintage kitchen knives 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:13.710
 these are trail knives you are evolutionary 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:20.300
 well let's start from the bottom see 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:24.140
 a huge very thin rushka 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:30.840
 preserved original in my opinion 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:35.370
 stamp with a bell well, and this is such 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.230
 Here nickname fillet very very jaws knife but I 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.730
 I don't catch such a fish now 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.430
 buying from which one could take off 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.170
 fillet with such a big knife 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.079
 so in my opinion I'm great now 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.719
 need that length 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:56.300
 it is such a very long very flexible knife 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:01:05.339
 it will be convenient to shoot or something like that 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:08.420
 the next knife is out of work right now 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.939
 already pretty yuzany 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:16.200
 but he has an interesting feature 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:18.960
 his pen here since forging such not 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.770
 often at that time did with such and such 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.960
 forging handle 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.720
 often just turned into metal and 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.439
 the handle is already preserved handle 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.710
 original 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:37.130
 the knife was already very well developed 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.450
 Now is idle and not used 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.329
 our next here this here unfortunately 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.729
 the pen here was not original 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.729
 silver she lost 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.790
 so this blade is very interesting 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.130
 what build 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.960
 here the tip is at some first 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.149
 rounded so very comfortable butter 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.290
 smear and then here you can see 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:09.409
 came up with a transition here in Poland and 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:09.409
 envy because stigma is interesting 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.620
 for merit this knife is often at work 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:24.549
 it is quite convenient to cut it all 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.930
 carbon steel knives 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:31.519
 so they sort of make their edge well 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.530
 can keep but gradually change 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.650
 say changes its color but such 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.799
 dark here for example the Soviet 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:45.280
 stainless steel kitchenette with this what 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:46.430
 brilliant cheerful they he will be so 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.230
 long 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.650
 for a long time but at the same time with the point he 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:59.150
 keeps disgusting so the next knife 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:05.620
 such a triangular tee net video 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.620
 very thin shoes not very flexible knife 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.389
 there are no identification marks 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.700
 carbon steel 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.940
 I can see a lot I survived known knife 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.560
 follow here with this knife most often 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.450
 have to use it very much 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:38.870
 good shape very comfortable handle but to 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:41.150
 Sorry already cracked these with a knife 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.260
 some salads are great cut 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.140
 cabbage is just fine in hand sitting 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:53.500
 very comfortable to cut thin shoes 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:56.360
 here he will drive very well and 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.840
 it is my pleasure to work if I 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.620
 need to fix such a knife that happens 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.670
 very rarely 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.540
 due to rare use 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.790
 use such in this site and here 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:15.140
 in this way 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:18.739
 I rule on but if such a knife cut 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.320
 Only light salads cabbage the sharpness 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:26.000
 he keeps a very long time and therefore 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.680
 almost no sharpening 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.570
 best in my opinion of these knives here 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:35.300
 this one because of its shape 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:38.360
 convenient handle perfectly we will reduce the following 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.229
 this is again the fillets of the poor are very flexible 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.039
 also since tsarist times we'll see if 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:48.200
 here is the stigma 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:50.440
 yes this is pretty steward then this 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.440
 the knife 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:05:00.180
 pronounced there is a supply see here 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:06.919
 here here is the cutting edge for example u 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:12.449
 this one doesn't have this kind of zero and 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:15.860
 this smarter like this nickname 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.860
 the original handle has been preserved 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:23.729
 which adds another value in my 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:25.889
 eyes well except for sirloin works he 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.830
 it is no good for them to cut something 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:35.270
 uncomfortable completely in my opinion so 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:35.270
 the next knife is such a cool little knife 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.210
 vyrypaev straight 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:55.110
 terribly licks hands while he is a little 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:57.719
 so flinch something to cut very good 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:02.060
 the solution here is right fingers you are 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:04.909
 notches 1 hand falls 2 just awesome 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:09.150
 so there is still something to show 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:16.650
 knives of some service if pieces 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:20.610
 There are also apparently stupid with blunt 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.190
 end and he gives us an example of how not to 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.960
 sharpen knives 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:28.500
 here is such a knife too and a little less 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.840
 that's how he tells why it happens 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.370
 because some still 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.460
 use such stockings 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.800
 roller on which the knife is kept and 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:41.580
 removed a lot of metal from cutting 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.310
 the edges are a good example knife and 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:47.870
 soviet example which is feeling in 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:53.240
 such a device what kind of device 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:56.400
 she looks like she is shooting a lot of metal 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:00.330
 often kitchen knives can just 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.129
 straighten on mussat gets cutting 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:08.069
 not taking off the edge but swept up 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:10.379
 the knife will continue to cut so who 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:12.449
 this evil is your 

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:15.900
 relatives enjoy giving him a garden 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:21.080
 everything will be good to learn from them 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:26.310
 time on the mussat is righteous and will heal 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:29.159
 so what else did I want to show here 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:31.620
 such as here on there too it is set 

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:34.069
 too cool so are you cutting something 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.069
 such a 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:42.020
 Well, it's probably all old knives 

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:44.540
 I'll write another video about modern knives 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:49.190
 Now I put the transition if it is already 

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:51.500
 there is go show you about what i am 

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:55.390
 now I use the kitchen and now I'll eat 

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.390
 thank you for watching all bye
