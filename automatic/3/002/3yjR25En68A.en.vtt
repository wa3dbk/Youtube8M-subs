00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.480 
the tag but it's not easily removed when
we're<00:03:53.030> talking<00:03:53.180> about<00:03:53.420> shoes<00:03:53.990> have<00:03:54.860> some<00:03:55.040> cute

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
we're talking about shoes have some cute

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.270 
we're talking about shoes have some cute
shoes<00:03:55.520> here<00:03:55.790> and<00:03:56.690> what<00:03:56.900> I<00:03:56.930> did<00:03:57.200> was<00:03:57.500> I<00:03:57.680> took

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
shoes here and what I did was I took

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.310 
shoes here and what I did was I took
some<00:03:58.970> curling<00:03:59.330> ribbon<00:03:59.660> and<00:03:59.780> I<00:03:59.840> tied<00:04:00.110> it<00:04:00.140> around

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
some curling ribbon and I tied it around

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.410 
some curling ribbon and I tied it around
the<00:04:00.560> shoes<00:04:00.830> and<00:04:01.190> then<00:04:01.280> I<00:04:01.370> took<00:04:01.430> a<00:04:01.640> safety<00:04:01.940> pin

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
the shoes and then I took a safety pin

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.720 
the shoes and then I took a safety pin
and<00:04:02.750> put<00:04:03.440> that<00:04:03.590> through<00:04:03.950> the<00:04:04.100> curling<00:04:04.460> ribbon

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
and put that through the curling ribbon

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.600 
and put that through the curling ribbon
so<00:04:04.970> that's<00:04:05.590> securing<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.680> tag<00:04:06.920> on<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.250> shoes

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
so that's securing the tag on the shoes

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.300 
so that's securing the tag on the shoes
and<00:04:08.000> in<00:04:08.570> this<00:04:08.720> case<00:04:08.959> it<00:04:09.170> had<00:04:09.350> laces<00:04:09.770> so<00:04:09.980> I<00:04:10.010> just

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
and in this case it had laces so I just

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.920 
and in this case it had laces so I just
tied<00:04:10.550> the<00:04:10.580> laces<00:04:11.000> together<00:04:11.150> and<00:04:11.630> then<00:04:11.750> put<00:04:11.900> a

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
tied the laces together and then put a

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.020 
tied the laces together and then put a
safety<00:04:12.170> pin<00:04:12.610> through<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.670> laces<00:04:14.180> for<00:04:14.990> the<00:04:15.110> tag

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
safety pin through the laces for the tag

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.940 
safety pin through the laces for the tag

then I put that safety pin through the

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.920 
then I put that safety pin through the
hanger<00:05:02.640> again<00:05:02.910> so<00:05:03.180> you<00:05:03.270> can<00:05:03.510> see<00:05:03.720> that<00:05:03.900> that

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
hanger again so you can see that that

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.320 
hanger again so you can see that that
all<00:05:04.200> the<00:05:04.440> items<00:05:04.740> are<00:05:04.890> together<00:05:05.070> and<00:05:05.670> they're

all the items are together and they're

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.030 
all the items are together and they're
also<00:05:06.480> through<00:05:06.840> the<00:05:06.900> hanger<00:05:07.230> so<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:07.680> chances

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
also through the hanger so the chances

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.920 
also through the hanger so the chances
of<00:05:08.100> that<00:05:08.340> item<00:05:08.880> falling<00:05:09.360> off<00:05:09.480> and<00:05:09.690> all<00:05:09.810> of

of that item falling off and all of
those<00:05:10.020> coming<00:05:10.290> off<00:05:10.500> is<00:05:10.740> not<00:05:11.520> going<00:05:11.730> to<00:05:11.820> happen

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.380

bar<00:05:22.620> of<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.770> hanger<00:05:23.160> so<00:05:23.820> that<00:05:23.970> it's<00:05:24.090> secure<00:05:24.300> if
