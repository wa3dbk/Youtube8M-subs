gets<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:16.970> little<00:02:17.120> loose<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.740> I<00:02:18.740> need<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.070> do<00:02:19.220> is

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
gets a little loose and I need to do is

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.310 
gets a little loose and I need to do is
well<00:02:19.790> all<00:02:19.880> I<00:02:19.910> did<00:02:20.150> was<00:02:20.300> take<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.510> pen<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.110> stick

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
well all I did was take a pen and stick

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.920 
well all I did was take a pen and stick
it<00:02:21.440> in<00:02:21.530> one<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:21.710> them<00:02:21.800> holes<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.870> tighten<00:02:23.870> it

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
it in one of them holes and tighten it

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.210 
it in one of them holes and tighten it
up<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:25.190> it's<00:02:25.520> worked<00:02:25.730> great<00:02:25.970> ever<00:02:26.150> since<00:02:27.220> this

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
up and it's worked great ever since this

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.180 
up and it's worked great ever since this
bigger<00:02:28.520> one<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:30.020> well<00:02:30.230> sites<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.740> I<00:02:30.860> go<00:02:31.010> on

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
bigger one the well sites that I go on

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.340 
bigger one the well sites that I go on
are<00:02:31.430> typically<00:02:31.970> two<00:02:32.270> or<00:02:32.300> three<00:02:32.540> acres<00:02:33.140> across

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
are typically two or three acres across

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.570 
are typically two or three acres across
and<00:02:34.990> this<00:02:35.990> will<00:02:36.260> shine<00:02:36.560> from<00:02:36.860> one<00:02:37.100> end<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.460> the

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
and this will shine from one end to the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.070 
and this will shine from one end to the
other<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:38.320> it<00:02:39.320> will<00:02:39.590> illuminate<00:02:41.080> everything

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
other and it will illuminate everything

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.590 
other and it will illuminate everything
I<00:02:42.320> need<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.620> see<00:02:42.880> some<00:02:43.880> of<00:02:43.940> these<00:02:44.000> well<00:02:44.270> sites

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
I need to see some of these well sites

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.930 
I need to see some of these well sites
that<00:02:44.780> I<00:02:44.840> go<00:02:44.990> on<00:02:45.020> contain<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.560> gas<00:02:45.830> called<00:02:46.250> h2s

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
that I go on contain a gas called h2s

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.990 
that I go on contain a gas called h2s
and<00:02:47.240> if<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.020> breathe<00:02:48.290> it<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:49.730> will

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
and if you breathe it it will

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.740 
and if you breathe it it will
incapacitate<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.180> have<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.420> choose

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
incapacitate you so you have to choose

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.660 
incapacitate you so you have to choose
an<00:02:53.960> evacuation<00:02:54.530> route<00:02:54.890> when<00:02:55.130> you<00:02:55.220> go<00:02:55.340> on<00:02:55.490> these

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
an evacuation route when you go on these

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.100 
an evacuation route when you go on these
wealth<00:02:55.970> sites<00:02:56.270> you<00:02:56.450> have<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.750> constantly

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
wealth sites you have to constantly

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.410 
wealth sites you have to constantly
watch<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.980> windsock<00:02:58.490> to<00:02:58.820> determine<00:02:59.270> which

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
watch the windsock to determine which

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.090 
watch the windsock to determine which
direction<00:02:59.630> the<00:03:00.020> wind<00:03:00.050> is<00:03:00.350> blowing<00:03:00.500> in<00:03:00.860> and

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
direction the wind is blowing in and

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.670 
direction the wind is blowing in and
from<00:03:01.730> across<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.330> well<00:03:02.510> site<00:03:02.840> I<00:03:03.110> can<00:03:03.170> shine

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
from across the well site I can shine

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.520 
from across the well site I can shine
this<00:03:03.950> on<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.370> windsock<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.530> constantly

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
this on the windsock and constantly

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.480 
this on the windsock and constantly
monitor<00:03:07.220> wind<00:03:07.460> direction<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:09.370> that<00:03:10.370> is<00:03:10.460> a

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
monitor wind direction and that is a

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.360 
monitor wind direction and that is a
lifesaver<00:03:11.000> right<00:03:11.210> there<00:03:11.560> it's<00:03:12.560> a<00:03:12.710> lifesaver

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
lifesaver right there it's a lifesaver

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.260 
lifesaver right there it's a lifesaver
and<00:03:13.550> I<00:03:14.150> actually<00:03:15.010> thought<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.310> could<00:03:16.580> depend<00:03:16.790> on

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
and I actually thought I could depend on

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.690 
and I actually thought I could depend on
the<00:03:18.400> Pelican<00:03:19.400> light<00:03:19.640> that<00:03:19.850> I<00:03:20.470> returned<00:03:21.700> and

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
the Pelican light that I returned and

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.590 
the Pelican light that I returned and
then<00:03:22.910> got<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.180> broken<00:03:23.720> one<00:03:23.870> back<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:25.300> it<00:03:26.300> was

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
then got a broken one back and it was

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.810 
then got a broken one back and it was
undependable<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:27.650> when<00:03:27.890> your<00:03:28.040> life<00:03:28.250> depends

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
undependable and when your life depends

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.960 
undependable and when your life depends
on<00:03:28.970> something<00:03:29.620> I'm<00:03:30.620> not<00:03:30.770> exaggerating<00:03:31.070> and<00:03:31.700> if

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
on something I'm not exaggerating and if

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.060 
on something I'm not exaggerating and if
I<00:03:32.090> can't<00:03:32.360> see<00:03:32.600> to<00:03:32.750> evacuate<00:03:33.320> if<00:03:33.470> I<00:03:33.590> can't<00:03:33.830> see

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
I can't see to evacuate if I can't see

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.880 
I can't see to evacuate if I can't see
the<00:03:34.190> windsock<00:03:34.670> I<00:03:35.410> could<00:03:36.410> die

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
the windsock I could die

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.950 
the windsock I could die
not<00:03:37.340> so<00:03:37.460> important<00:03:37.940> having<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:38.270> reliable<00:03:38.510> light

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
the Bell is bigger than this one this

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.979 
the Bell is bigger than this one this
one's<00:04:15.650> really<00:04:16.549> bright<00:04:16.880> for<00:04:17.239> a<00:04:17.270> like<00:04:17.750> this
