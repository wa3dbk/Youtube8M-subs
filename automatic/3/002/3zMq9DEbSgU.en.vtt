00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 do not 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.630
 gym motivation friend is for me a 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.310
 pleasure to be once more with you in 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.720
 this time I'm going to talk a little bit about 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.279
 what are the best for me 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.009
 tips to reduce fat in 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.259
 our body especially the average fat 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.060
 of the abdominal part but before 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.820
 start I want to send a greeting very 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.140
 special to our friend juan gabriel 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.500
 who got the first place in the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.460
 classic paisa in the category of physicist 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.400
 congratulations friends for that great achievement 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.140
 for your dedication and for your effort the 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.870
 first advice and that many times we have 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.540
 listened to is to stay hydrated all 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.460
 the day to drink a lot of liquid 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.160
 approximately 2 to 3 liters 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.110
 in the morning when we get up the 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.730
 councilors take us a glass of water to 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.410
 eliminate the toxins that were generated in 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.519
 all the processes that happens in our 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.170
 body at night and likewise and taking 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.479
 liquid all day to also 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.880
 eliminate toxins and the same fat 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.409
 that we are burning will be eliminating well 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.290
 that way it goes out and comes out of our 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.630
 body 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.820
 the second advice is to eat more times at 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.100
 day many think that enduring hunger 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.320
 they will decrease the fat but it turns out 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.880
 that do the opposite, this is the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.320
 organism when it has absence of 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.990
 food for a long period of 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.870
 time will try to store more more 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.729
 fat you should every time we eat but 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.110
 if we eat every two or three hours this 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.030
 it's been like five or six 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.530
 meals a day we are saying to 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.270
 body that we have an abundance of 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.360
 food then that is not necessary 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.250
 store that fat 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.260
 the third council is going to be about 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.640
 meals at night these meals should 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.070
 be very light in terms of 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.660
 fat carbohydrates since sleeping does not 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.270
 we consume a lot of energy that we say 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.460
 then this last meal yes exact in 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.810
 Fatty carbohydrates or sugars are us 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.430
 will accumulate in the body in a 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.890
 fat especially in the abdominal area 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.740
 that it is so difficult to reduce this fat 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.080
 here we accumulate then you 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.840
 I recommend light meals after 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.550
 age six or seven at night eliminate or 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.830
 decrease the amount of rice potatoes 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.959
 soups and eat for example carbohydrates 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.860
 of sale absorption like oat bread 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.100
 integral 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.930
 whole-grain crackers vegetables and for 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.420
 take you can take are from a 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.790
 aromatic is also very important 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.530
 consume some clean protein as much 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.190
 recommended for this time of day is 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.140
 the casein of milk protein 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.110
 this long-acting protein 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.090
 then when you go to our body to 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.000
 throughout the night but also 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.580
 we can eat the meats to which 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.580
 we are used to like chicken 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.120
 the pork not very recommendable 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.580
 too much fat we can also consume 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.580
 tuna fish and procure these meats 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.380
 are thrown or cooked but not fried 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.900
 the fourth advice is to reduce to the maximum 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.940
 the sugars in our diet everything 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.480
 what are soda chocolates or candies 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.730
 in general 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.950
 first of all for health to prevent 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.300
 diseases like diabetes and second 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.980
 that we are going to notice the change our 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.140
 physical since the sugars are a 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.910
 very important source of energy and if 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.710
 we reduce them the body takes our 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.260
 accumulated fat and begins to consume 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.730
 to return energy an option if we 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.120
 It is very difficult because if we do not like it 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.860
 how eating without candy can be sweeten 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.870
 with sweeteners like stevia that does not 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.490
 give us calories the fifth and last 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.500
 advice is about the exercise 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.600
 cardiovascular that's why I'm here 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.370
 in my home gym because I eat 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.690
 you know a balanced diet and a 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.980
 little exercise are the best 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.840
 combination to keep us healthy 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.420
 and have that physique that we have always 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.550
 desired for that if in their homes or in the 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.740
 gym has a stationary bicycle or 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.209
 an elliptical one walked now we are going to 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.100
 print a rope to make a little 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.990
 of cardio I will present you a 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.160
 technique that is called change by 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.660
 intervals 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.240
 the technique is to work 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.100
 approximately 20 minutes in the 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.350
 which the first five minutes we're going 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:03.190
 to do a warming up 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.110
 Soft then let's do 30 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.510
 seconds that continue let's do fast 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.820
 fast to the maximum we will read maximum what 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.320
 that we can after the other 30 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.000
 seconds that continue and we're going to 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.800
 recover then we are going to lower the 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.720
 rhythm of a smooth rhythm and so 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.180
 successively during the 15 minutes that 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.820
 you gave us 9 is this way burning 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.800
 many more calories than working the 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.630
 traditional way to finish I want to 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.730
 send a very special greeting to our 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.850
