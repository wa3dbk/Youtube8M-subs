00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:12.019
 together we would be of you today 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:14.480
 top much the sr p 2 4 0 1 the good 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.250
 athlete receiver with integrated 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.109
 Hard disk is available in different 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.630
 versions we have a model with 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.420
 a 500 gb hard drive and model with 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.730
 one terabyte disk and two 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.869
 equipment then once each with ci 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.970
 plus module and hd + card and without before 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.640
 We come to the musician himself very briefly 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.149
 As always the content we have easy 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.309
 with of course the remote control 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:43.789
 then we have a hdmi cable with the 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:47.329
 title the quick start short manual 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:51.309
 so to speak everything important briefly explained 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.309
 is from the first commissioning, etc 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.770
 and as the model says 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.129
 optionally with a hd + card and ci 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.600
 plus module just out because 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.970
 Of course I want to show you too 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.550
 how to insert it to the receiver 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:12.460
 Here we come to the receiver itself 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:19.430
 the good one is a bit heavier the topfield 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:20.720
 srp 24 01 c plus has the possibility 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.170
 offers the possibility thanks to the 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.940
 Integrated hard disk and the dual lnb 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.400
 functions that means we have the 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.320
 possibility by two, so to speak 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.790
 satellite inputs four programs 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.360
 to record simultaneously 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.880
 Of course it is important that the 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.740
 Programs each on two frequencies 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.240
 that is not all distributed on 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.500
 the same transponder of the satellite 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:49.190
 send as always a receiver from all 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.280
 you do not see much from the front 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.200
 we have the one here then 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.870
 Conditions display as I said one 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.630
 switch off menu button ok button 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.980
 and 1 4 way steering wheel that is after 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.860
 top lower right left 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:08.090
 as here on the edge because of the slot 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.930
 for the ci plus module that will then 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.540
 just inserted here once briefly 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.850
 hard pressed in and that's it 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.990
 and we have two usb here 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.060
 ports on the back then basically 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.250
 then we have the important one 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.450
 connections 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.550
 we have here again also 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.920
 integrated power supply with a small 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.800
 fan the on and off switch 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.260
 without the power cord, so to speak 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.360
 need to disconnect the receiver from the power 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.910
 then once we have in optical 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.900
 audio output a coaxial 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.340
 audio output a usb port 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.740
 network connection with us then too 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.720
 have the possibility of the receiver 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.470
 half internetradio disturb 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.260
 we have a hdmi output we have one 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.230
 esata-port to another external 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.690
 hard disk to connect 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.190
 we have two scart sockets of which one 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.650
 goes to the tv and the others to 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.340
 then we still have a video recorder 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.760
 an analog audio output composite 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.489
 Output for video signals components 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.450
 output for video signals and we have 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:23.480
 here on the edge then the two inputs for 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.060
 the satellites that means we have here 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.430
 the possibility of finding two lnb , so to speak 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.959
 to close then as I said with 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.920
 two satellites hd tuner 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.130
 to look different programs 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.870
 record and so on 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.890
 basically it's the then already 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:47.360
 again from the topfield srp 24 01 c plus 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.610
 receiver satellite receiver and me 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.780
 Hope he liked you 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.780
 to the next market
