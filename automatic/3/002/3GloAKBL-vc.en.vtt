00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
look fantastic already I'm sure bounced

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:48.220 
look fantastic already I'm sure bounced
back<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:40.260> lot<00:00:45.530> and<00:00:46.530> again<00:00:47.100> as<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.399> said<00:00:47.430> it's<00:00:47.850> it's

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
back a lot and again as I said it's it's

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.080 
back a lot and again as I said it's it's
how<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.289> were<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:50.250> into<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.789> you're<00:00:50.969> gonna

how you were going into it you're gonna

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.299 
how you were going into it you're gonna
bounce<00:00:51.300> back<00:00:51.510> very<00:00:51.930> quickly<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.680> guess<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.160> just

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
bounce back very quickly I guess I just

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.670 
bounce back very quickly I guess I just
get<00:00:53.640> discouraged<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.270> look<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.660> I'm<00:00:54.809> like<00:00:54.989> see

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
get discouraged I look and I'm like see

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.650 
get discouraged I look and I'm like see
there<00:00:55.829> are<00:00:55.949> issues<00:00:56.670> three<00:00:57.000> issues<00:00:57.120> with<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
there are issues three issues with the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.540 
there are issues three issues with the
tummy<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.140> usually<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> tummy<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.129> what<00:00:59.340> mom

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
tummy and usually the tummy is what mom

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.939 
tummy and usually the tummy is what mom
looks<00:00:59.850> at<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.840> those<00:01:01.079> spread<00:01:01.469> muscles

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
looks at it can be those spread muscles

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.799 
looks at it can be those spread muscles
which<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.489> time<00:01:02.730> should<00:01:03.090> come<00:01:03.300> back<00:01:03.480> because

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
which in time should come back because

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.420 
which in time should come back because
you<00:01:03.930> were<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.140> shape<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.920> may<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> little

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
you were in shape you may have a little

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.490 
you were in shape you may have a little
extra<00:01:05.880> fat<00:01:06.090> down<00:01:06.330> there<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:07.080> time

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
extra fat down there in time

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.230 
extra fat down there in time
breastfeeding<00:01:07.830> helps<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.700> increases<00:01:09.210> your

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
breastfeeding helps that increases your

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.940 
breastfeeding helps that increases your
metabolic<00:01:09.479> rate<00:01:10.110> you're<00:01:10.590> burning<00:01:10.920> calories

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
metabolic rate you're burning calories

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.660 
metabolic rate you're burning calories
all<00:01:11.640> good<00:01:11.909> but<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.630> lose<00:01:12.900> skin<00:01:13.670> everybody's

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
all good but that lose skin everybody's

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.890 
all good but that lose skin everybody's
a<00:01:14.729> little<00:01:14.790> bit<00:01:15.000> different<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.540> your

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
a little bit different it just your

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.359 
a little bit different it just your
genetics<00:01:16.350> how<00:01:16.470> you're<00:01:16.650> gonna<00:01:16.740> bounce<00:01:16.950> back

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
genetics how you're gonna bounce back

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.490 
genetics how you're gonna bounce back
you<00:01:18.030> will<00:01:18.270> shrink<00:01:18.600> back<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.049> would<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
you will shrink back you would be a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.499 
you will shrink back you would be a

your<00:01:32.790> elastin<00:01:33.329> we<00:01:33.450> did<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.780> right<00:01:33.960> here<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
your elastin we did it right here on the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.890 
your elastin we did it right here on the
show<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.369> past<00:01:35.549> as<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.420> see<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.780> can

handpiece<00:01:39.570> it's<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.350> little<00:01:40.590> bit<00:01:40.710> warm<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
handpiece it's a little bit warm and

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.969 
handpiece it's a little bit warm and
what<00:01:42.150> you're<00:01:42.299> doing<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.049> tightening<00:01:43.680> some

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
what you're doing is is tightening some

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.100 
what you're doing is is tightening some
of<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.250> loose<00:01:44.520> skin<00:01:44.880> that's<00:01:45.479> stretch<00:01:45.899> so

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
of that loose skin that's stretch so

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.100 
of that loose skin that's stretch so
that's<00:01:46.290> something<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:47.420> if<00:01:48.420> you're<00:01:48.659> serious

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
that's something that if you're serious

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.109 
that's something that if you're serious
about<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.530> we<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.799> talk<00:01:50.009> about<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.640> would

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
about it we can talk about it I would

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.700 
about it we can talk about it I would
give<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.600> couple<00:01:51.869> more<00:01:52.110> months<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:52.590> that's

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
give it a couple more months but that's

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.800 
give it a couple more months but that's
that's<00:01:53.280> just<00:01:53.640> from<00:01:53.850> doing<00:01:54.119> Thermage<00:01:54.540> and
