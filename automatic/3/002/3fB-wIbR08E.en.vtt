00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
consistency and I think if they go two

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.560 
consistency and I think if they go two
three<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.070> four<00:02:49.310> wire<00:02:49.520> receiver<00:02:49.910> sets<00:02:50.150> they

like<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.709> believe<00:03:15.920> so<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.280> Cincinnati

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
like to believe so the Cincinnati

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.310 
like to believe so the Cincinnati
Bengals<00:03:16.880> will<00:03:17.239> have<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.600> stop<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.959> run<00:03:18.140> at

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
Bengals will have to stop the run at

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.320 
Bengals will have to stop the run at
some<00:03:18.860> point<00:03:19.130> in<00:03:19.220> time<00:03:19.250> in<00:03:19.580> this<00:03:19.670> ballgame<00:03:19.940> and

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
some point in time in this ballgame and

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.270 
some point in time in this ballgame and
I<00:03:20.660> love<00:03:20.930> their<00:03:21.170> linebackers<00:03:21.470> Rey<00:03:22.130> Maualuga

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280

Lawson<00:03:25.670> those<00:03:26.120> guys<00:03:26.360> can<00:03:26.720> really<00:03:26.930> stop<00:03:27.380> the

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
Lawson those guys can really stop the

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.009 
Lawson those guys can really stop the
run<00:03:27.800> and<00:03:28.160> I<00:03:28.250> think<00:03:28.519> against<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.660> Denver

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019
