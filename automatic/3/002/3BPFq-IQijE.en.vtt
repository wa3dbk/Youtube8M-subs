this is a really nice tool and almost a
must-have

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
must-have

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.660 
must-have
these<00:00:59.609> days<00:00:59.879> with<00:01:00.090> flybarless<00:01:00.539> okay<00:01:01.170> okay<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
these days with flybarless okay okay the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.700 
these days with flybarless okay okay the
second<00:01:03.090> pitch<00:01:03.300> gauge<00:01:03.539> available<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.500> to

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
second pitch gauge available is going to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.469 
second pitch gauge available is going to
be<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> mechanical<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.270> type

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
be the mechanical this is this the type

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.030 
be the mechanical this is this the type
that<00:01:06.659> most<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.960> us<00:01:07.049> are<00:01:07.170> used<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.500> saying<00:01:07.740> and

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
that most of us are used to saying and

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.179 
that most of us are used to saying and
this<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.119> really<00:01:09.600> good<00:01:09.810> even<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.740> fly<00:01:10.979> bar

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
this is really good even for the fly bar

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.940 
this is really good even for the fly bar
guys<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.670> actually<00:01:11.970> prefer<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:13.470> pitch<00:01:13.710> gauge

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
guys I actually prefer this pitch gauge

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.219 
guys I actually prefer this pitch gauge
over<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.310> digital<00:01:14.760> would<00:01:14.880> fly<00:01:15.090> bar<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.600> again

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
over the digital would fly bar so again

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.170 
over the digital would fly bar so again
this<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> very<00:01:17.340> important<00:01:17.850> piece<00:01:18.060> of

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
this is a very important piece of

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.280 
this is a very important piece of
equipment<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.930> your<00:01:18.960> toolbox

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
equipment to have in your toolbox

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.499 
equipment to have in your toolbox
whether<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.040> digital<00:01:20.220> for<00:01:20.640> flybarless<00:01:21.030> or

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
whether it's a digital for flybarless or

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.469 
whether it's a digital for flybarless or
mechanical<00:01:22.290> fly<00:01:22.439> bar<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.640> second<00:01:24.030> tool<00:01:24.180> I

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
mechanical fly bar the second tool I

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.140 
mechanical fly bar the second tool I
think<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:25.290> important<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
think is really important to have is the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.810 
think is really important to have is the
inside-outside<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.400> calipers<00:01:29.400> here<00:01:29.610> these

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
inside-outside the calipers here these

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.850 
inside-outside the calipers here these
these<00:01:30.240> are<00:01:30.509> really<00:01:30.930> handy<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.409> making<00:01:31.590> those

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
these are really handy for making those

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.280 
these are really handy for making those
