this<00:00:00.930> is<00:00:01.079> Fran<00:00:01.350> bradshaw's<00:00:01.949> straw<00:00:02.370> bale<00:00:02.610> house

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
this is Fran bradshaw's straw bale house

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.970 
this is Fran bradshaw's straw bale house
it's<00:00:03.629> quite<00:00:03.780> difficult<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.350> see<00:00:04.529> what's<00:00:04.740> going

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
it's quite difficult to see what's going

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.440 
it's quite difficult to see what's going
on<00:00:05.160> from<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.400> outside<00:00:05.490> because<00:00:06.150> it's<00:00:06.270> being

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
on from the outside because it's being

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.330 
on from the outside because it's being
protected<00:00:06.660> from<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.319> elements<00:00:07.440> but<00:00:08.189> it's

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
protected from the elements but it's

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.120 
protected from the elements but it's
progressing<00:00:08.910> well<00:00:09.139> the<00:00:10.139> timber<00:00:10.650> frames<00:00:10.889> in

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
progressing well the timber frames in

progressing well the timber frames in
the<00:00:11.700> straw<00:00:12.030> bales<00:00:12.300> works<00:00:13.290> done<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.980> it's<00:00:14.219> all

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
the straw bales works done and it's all

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.300 
the straw bales works done and it's all
compressed<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.740> the<00:00:16.740> little<00:00:17.010> bit<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.220> the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
compressed and the little bit of the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.910 
compressed and the little bit of the
plaster<00:00:17.609> ease<00:00:17.699> be<00:00:17.850> done<00:00:18.029> outside<00:00:18.529> but<00:00:19.529> none<00:00:19.890> of

plaster ease be done outside but none of
the<00:00:20.039> clusterings<00:00:20.460> insides<00:00:21.000> have<00:00:21.600> been<00:00:21.840> done

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
the clusterings insides have been done

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.320 
the clusterings insides have been done
and<00:00:22.350> some<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.220> tapes<00:00:23.460> have<00:00:23.730> been<00:00:23.760> blasted

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
and some of the tapes have been blasted

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.359 
and some of the tapes have been blasted
in<00:00:24.449> but<00:00:24.600> someone<00:00:24.869> haven't<00:00:25.170> been<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.949> quite<00:00:26.340> a

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
in but someone haven't been so quite a

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.640 
in but someone haven't been so quite a
good<00:00:26.580> moment<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.060> find<00:00:27.750> out<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> bit<00:00:28.199> about<00:00:28.439> all

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
good moment to find out a bit about all

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.200 
good moment to find out a bit about all
the<00:00:28.830> different<00:00:29.010> parts<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.849> how<00:00:29.970> they<00:00:30.150> were

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
the different parts and how they were

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.209 
the different parts and how they were
working<00:00:30.480> separately<00:00:31.410> that's<00:00:32.009> what<00:00:32.130> I'm

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
working separately that's what I'm

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.580 
working separately that's what I'm
hoping<00:00:32.369> they'll<00:00:32.640> find<00:00:32.669> out<00:00:33.000> anyway<00:00:33.380> it's<00:00:34.380> hope

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
hoping they'll find out anyway it's hope

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.990 
hoping they'll find out anyway it's hope
that<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:34.890> house<00:00:35.130> will<00:00:35.340> meet<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.610> Passivhaus

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
that this house will meet the Passivhaus

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.360 
that this house will meet the Passivhaus
standard<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.930> it's<00:00:37.320> been<00:00:37.500> designed<00:00:37.680> from<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
standard and it's been designed from the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.270 
standard and it's been designed from the
outset<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:39.030> work<00:00:39.300> with<00:00:39.510> straw<00:00:40.070> it's<00:00:41.070> got<00:00:41.250> a

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
outset to work with straw it's got a

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.459 
outset to work with straw it's got a
timber<00:00:41.730> frame<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.510> very<00:00:42.989> close<00:00:43.410> to

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
timber frame but it's very close to

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.529 
timber frame but it's very close to
being<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.980> load-bearing<00:00:44.239> building<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> way

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
being a load-bearing building in the way

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.819 
being a load-bearing building in the way
we've<00:00:45.719> constructed<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.440> because<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
we've constructed it because the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.880 
we've constructed it because the
framework<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> inside<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:49.230> we've<00:00:49.680> got

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
framework is on the inside and we've got

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.010 
framework is on the inside and we've got
a<00:00:49.920> 30<00:00:50.250> mil<00:00:50.550> plaster<00:00:51.000> gap<00:00:51.149> behind<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
a 30 mil plaster gap behind the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.410 
a 30 mil plaster gap behind the
framework<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> airtight<00:00:53.760> layer<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.239> on

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
framework but the airtight layer is on

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.740 
framework but the airtight layer is on
the<00:00:54.510> outside<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.039> straw<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.969> compressed

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the outside and the straw is compressed

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.119 
the outside and the straw is compressed
as<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.260> would<00:00:58.440> be<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.949> load-bearing

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
as it would be in a load-bearing

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.310 
as it would be in a load-bearing
building<00:01:00.000> all<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.600> way<00:01:00.690> around<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.140> outside

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
building all the way around the outside

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.709 
building all the way around the outside
and<00:01:01.949> we've<00:01:02.100> had<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.460> design<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:03.059> frame<00:01:03.329> very

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
and we've had to design the frame very

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.230 
and we've had to design the frame very
particularly<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:05.220> make<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.820> compression

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
particularly to make that compression

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.390 
particularly to make that compression
possible<00:01:06.900> because<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.619> have<00:01:07.650> part<00:01:08.189> of

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
possible because we have to have part of

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.750 
possible because we have to have part of
the<00:01:08.460> frame<00:01:08.780> centrally<00:01:09.780> above<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.350> straw<00:01:10.760> this

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
the frame centrally above the straw this

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.250 
the frame centrally above the straw this
is<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> much<00:01:12.180> earlier<00:01:12.360> test<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> air

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
is a much earlier test of the air

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.050 
is a much earlier test of the air
tightness<00:01:13.590> than<00:01:13.950> normal<00:01:14.340> because<00:01:14.760> its

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
tightness than normal because its

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.060 
tightness than normal because its
purpose<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.689> see<00:01:15.960> how<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.140> straw<00:01:16.500> performs

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
purpose is to see how the straw performs

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.700 
purpose is to see how the straw performs
all<00:01:17.340> by<00:01:17.759> itself<00:01:18.119> we<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.900> our<00:01:18.930> test<00:01:19.290> equipment

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
all by itself we have our test equipment

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.499 
all by itself we have our test equipment
we've<00:01:19.950> set<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.189> up<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.490> doorway<00:01:20.880> we'll

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
we've set it up in the doorway we'll

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.990 
we've set it up in the doorway we'll
blow<00:01:21.689> air<00:01:21.900> out<00:01:21.979> so<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.100> inside<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> lower

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
blow air out so the inside is a lower

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.609 
blow air out so the inside is a lower
pressure<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.780> they'll<00:01:24.930> basically<00:01:25.170> we'll<00:01:25.470> go

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
pressure and they'll basically we'll go

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.800 
pressure and they'll basically we'll go
around<00:01:25.860> looking<00:01:26.189> for<00:01:26.250> leaks<00:01:26.689> feeling<00:01:27.689> with

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
around looking for leaks feeling with

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.109 
around looking for leaks feeling with
our<00:01:27.900> hands<00:01:28.350> using<00:01:28.530> smoke<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.640> look<00:01:29.790> for<00:01:29.939> leaks

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
our hands using smoke to look for leaks

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.420 
our hands using smoke to look for leaks
the<00:01:31.049> obvious<00:01:31.350> place<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.710> being<00:01:31.950> around<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
the obvious place is being around the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.609 
the obvious place is being around the
windows<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.759> doors<00:01:33.229> possibly<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> edge<00:01:34.470> of

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
windows and doors possibly the edge of

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.710 
windows and doors possibly the edge of
the<00:01:34.680> floor<00:01:34.950> but<00:01:35.490> essentially<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.270> process

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the floor but essentially it's a process

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.030 
the floor but essentially it's a process
of<00:01:37.229> investigation

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.770 

so<00:01:41.040> that's<00:01:41.220> fully<00:01:41.580> open<00:01:42.090> which<00:01:42.630> is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
so that's fully open which is

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.560 
so that's fully open which is
disappointing<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:43.710> me<00:01:44.220> because<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.240> that

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
disappointing for me because that that

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.630 
disappointing for me because that that
would<00:01:45.750> test<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.110> small<00:01:46.350> school<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
would test the small school the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.710 
would test the small school the
Passivhaus<00:01:48.770> that's<00:01:49.880> that's<00:01:50.880> showing<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.360> flow

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
Passivhaus that's that's showing a flow

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.350 
Passivhaus that's that's showing a flow
of<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.890> under<00:01:53.159> nine<00:01:53.399> thousand<00:01:54.000> cubic<00:01:54.330> meters

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
of just under nine thousand cubic meters

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.139 
of just under nine thousand cubic meters
an<00:01:54.720> hour<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:56.009> reckon<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.640> volume<00:01:57.000> is

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
an hour and we reckon that the volume is

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.279 
an hour and we reckon that the volume is
just<00:01:57.330> over<00:01:57.990> three<00:01:58.229> hundred<00:01:59.180> so<00:02:00.180> nine<00:02:00.720> thousand

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
just over three hundred so nine thousand

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.460 
just over three hundred so nine thousand
divided<00:02:01.500> by<00:02:01.680> three<00:02:01.890> hundred<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.340> about<00:02:02.549> thirty

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
divided by three hundred is about thirty

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.200 
divided by three hundred is about thirty
it<00:02:04.470> doesn't<00:02:04.830> take<00:02:04.979> too<00:02:05.190> much<00:02:05.220> investigation

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
it doesn't take too much investigation

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.270 
it doesn't take too much investigation
to<00:02:06.360> realize<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.080> work<00:02:07.289> hasn't<00:02:07.710> advanced

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
to realize that the work hasn't advanced

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:18.400 
to realize that the work hasn't advanced
enough<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.759> guess<00:02:08.940> any<00:02:09.119> meaningful<00:02:09.630> readings

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.930 

even<00:02:19.410> though<00:02:19.739> there's<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.040> lot<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.370> air<00:02:20.519> leakage

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
even though there's a lot of air leakage

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.240 
even though there's a lot of air leakage
it's<00:02:21.450> still<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.780> good<00:02:21.989> exercise<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.560> establish

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
it's still a good exercise to establish

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.860 
it's still a good exercise to establish
where<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.730> air<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.180> getting<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:29.150> it's<00:02:30.150> no<00:02:30.450> it's

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
where the air is getting it it's no it's

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.610 
where the air is getting it it's no it's
the<00:02:31.110> contraband<00:02:31.680> or<00:02:31.950> whatever<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.500> well<00:02:34.500> we

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
the contraband or whatever it is well we

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.070 
the contraband or whatever it is well we
found<00:02:34.860> out<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.700> wasn't<00:02:35.910> really<00:02:36.480> as<00:02:36.780> ready

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
found out that it wasn't really as ready

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.530 
found out that it wasn't really as ready
as<00:02:37.170> we<00:02:37.380> thought<00:02:37.650> for<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.310> test<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:39.299> bits

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
as we thought for the test the bits

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.509 
as we thought for the test the bits
where<00:02:39.720> we<00:02:39.810> found<00:02:40.080> major<00:02:40.500> leaks<00:02:40.920> well<00:02:41.370> actually

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
where we found major leaks well actually

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.770 
where we found major leaks well actually
it's<00:02:41.819> because<00:02:41.910> it's<00:02:42.209> incomplete

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
it's because it's incomplete

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.170 
it's because it's incomplete
for<00:02:43.560> me<00:02:43.709> what<00:02:44.010> it's<00:02:44.190> told<00:02:44.430> us<00:02:44.670> is<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:44.880> the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
for me what it's told us is that the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.420 
for me what it's told us is that the
bulk<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.630> straw<00:02:45.870> is<00:02:46.110> absolutely<00:02:46.829> fine<00:02:47.040> and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
bulk of the straw is absolutely fine and

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.539 
bulk of the straw is absolutely fine and
that<00:02:48.090> we<00:02:48.360> have<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.690> pay<00:02:48.840> attention<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
that we have to pay attention to the

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.400 
that we have to pay attention to the
interfaces<00:02:51.239> between<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.630> two<00:02:51.870> bales<00:02:52.170> which

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
interfaces between the two bales which

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.890 
interfaces between the two bales which
is<00:02:52.560> what<00:02:52.739> we<00:02:52.860> do<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.790> stuffing<00:02:54.329> securely

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
is what we do and to stuffing securely

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.299 
is what we do and to stuffing securely
and<00:02:55.230> those<00:02:55.859> things<00:02:56.160> are<00:02:56.400> really<00:02:56.609> important
