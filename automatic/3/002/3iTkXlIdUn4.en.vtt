00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.289
 in summary of the panorama since January 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.049
 past we have been dabbling in the 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.729
 markets the Central American and Caribbean 

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:49.310
 next step is to enter a market 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:51.260
 from North America 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.080
 our permanent positioning in 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.050
 South America next year is that 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.140
 our biggest environment 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.360
 and if we have had good results in 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.410
 the markets of costa rica honduras and 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.180
 Jamaica 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.580
 we can say that until now it has not 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.890
 helped god 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.960
 However now we have to venture 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.240
 in Mexico and the USA 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.190
 speaking historically these markets 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.430
 they are the most competitive of all 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.530
 region 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.520
 It will not be an easy task but it is not impossible 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.260
 and what are our strengths 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.730
 we have a team that has come 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.240
 working put 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.170
 and their performance has been good they are 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.640
 focused on achieving our final goal 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.320
 truly they are a group of 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.240
 brave people we all admire 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.520
 quite committed to our 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.200
 short-term vision we will see or 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.810
 transmit our goal to him 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.520
 next year the greatest virtue of them is 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.140

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.880

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.880

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.490

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.220
 continue to help as before but 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.220
