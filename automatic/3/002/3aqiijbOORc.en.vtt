00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
okay so this is stage 12 and this is

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.470 
okay so this is stage 12 and this is
what<00:00:38.129> I'm<00:00:38.250> gonna<00:00:38.670> refer<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.180> as<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
what I'm gonna refer to as the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.360 
what I'm gonna refer to as the
long-range<00:00:40.050> stage<00:00:40.440> cuz<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.100> pretty<00:00:41.280> much

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
long-range stage cuz this is pretty much

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.060 
long-range stage cuz this is pretty much
as<00:00:41.670> long<00:00:42.000> as<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.300> gets<00:00:42.450> out<00:00:42.629> here<00:00:42.950> basically<00:00:43.950> we

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
as long as it gets out here basically we

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.229 
as long as it gets out here basically we
have<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:45.770> steel<00:00:46.770> target<00:00:47.190> set<00:00:47.309> around<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.820> hundred

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
have a steel target set around a hundred

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.420 
have a steel target set around a hundred
yards<00:00:48.570> probably<00:00:48.780> around<00:00:49.110> 90<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.680> they're

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
yards probably around 90 and they're

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.360 
yards probably around 90 and they're
about<00:00:50.610> eight<00:00:50.850> inch<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.300> size<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.340> what<00:00:53.340> I

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
about eight inch in size and what I

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.459 
about eight inch in size and what I
understand<00:00:53.789> everything<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.180> four<00:00:54.449> MOA<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.320> no

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
understand everything is four MOA so no

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.709 
understand everything is four MOA so no
matter<00:00:55.620> how<00:00:55.710> far<00:00:56.039> away<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.850> target<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.360> it's

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
matter how far away the target is it's

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.889 
matter how far away the target is it's
gonna<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:58.320> four<00:00:58.890> MOA<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.000> as<00:01:00.210> far<00:01:00.780> as

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
gonna be four MOA for you as far as

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.429 
gonna be four MOA for you as far as
optically<00:01:01.379> looking<00:01:01.800> at<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:04.110> eight

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
optically looking at it so we have eight

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.500 
optically looking at it so we have eight
and<00:01:04.680> ninety<00:01:05.100> yards<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.200> four<00:01:08.010> at<00:01:08.510> 200

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
and ninety yards and we have four at 200

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.140 
and ninety yards and we have four at 200
yards<00:01:09.540> roughly<00:01:10.170> 200<00:01:10.619> yards<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.100> then<00:01:11.460> way<00:01:11.850> out

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
yards roughly 200 yards and then way out

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.120 
yards roughly 200 yards and then way out
in<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.390> back<00:01:12.600> there's<00:01:12.930> two<00:01:13.170> small<00:01:13.380> berms<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
in the back there's two small berms and

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.590 
in the back there's two small berms and
they<00:01:15.060> are<00:01:15.360> at<00:01:15.720> roughly<00:01:16.170> around<00:01:16.680> 500<00:01:17.540> okay<00:01:18.540> so

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
they are at roughly around 500 okay so

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.450 
they are at roughly around 500 okay so
the<00:01:18.810> shooters<00:01:19.080> gonna<00:01:19.200> start<00:01:19.680> at<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.920> top<00:01:20.189> of

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
the shooters gonna start at the top of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.630 
the shooters gonna start at the top of
this<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:21.479> platform<00:01:21.780> here<00:01:22.259> at<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.130> with<00:01:23.490> your

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
this this platform here at the with your

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.539 
this this platform here at the with your
gun<00:01:23.970> fully<00:01:24.270> loaded<00:01:24.780> chamber<00:01:25.409> hot<00:01:25.890> everything

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
gun fully loaded chamber hot everything

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.460 
gun fully loaded chamber hot everything
and<00:01:26.970> then<00:01:27.420> upon<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> start<00:01:28.020> signal<00:01:28.200> you're

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and then upon the start signal you're

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.770 
and then upon the start signal you're
gonna<00:01:28.590> go<00:01:29.009> prone<00:01:29.369> using<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> sandbags<00:01:30.540> that

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
gonna go prone using the sandbags that

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.260 
gonna go prone using the sandbags that
as<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.049> rest<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.680> bipod<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.939> my

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
as a rest a bipod if you have it in my

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.490 
as a rest a bipod if you have it in my
case<00:01:33.479> I'm<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.750> use<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.049> sandbags

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
case I'm going to use the sandbags

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.440 
case I'm going to use the sandbags
because<00:01:34.650> I'm<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.040> don't<00:01:35.100> have<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> bipod<00:01:35.759> I'm

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
because I'm I don't have a bipod I'm

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.480 
because I'm I don't have a bipod I'm
gonna<00:01:36.630> engage<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.200> targets<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.680> around<00:01:38.070> 90

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
gonna engage the targets in around 90

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.789 
gonna engage the targets in around 90
yards<00:01:38.670> first<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.259> spotters<00:01:40.590> they're

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
yards first and we have spotters they're

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.230 
yards first and we have spotters they're
gonna<00:01:40.920> call<00:01:41.280> our<00:01:41.460> hits<00:01:41.729> because<00:01:41.939> it's<00:01:42.090> really

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
gonna call our hits because it's really

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.139 
gonna call our hits because it's really
hard<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.600> see<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.710> I'm<00:01:44.159> gonna<00:01:44.340> put<00:01:44.490> my<00:01:44.610> scope<00:01:44.939> on

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
hard to see so I'm gonna put my scope on

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.020 
hard to see so I'm gonna put my scope on
one<00:01:45.509> X<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.409> I'm<00:01:46.860> gonna<00:01:46.950> shoot<00:01:47.520> these<00:01:47.729> right

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
one X and I'm gonna shoot these right

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.230 
one X and I'm gonna shoot these right
here<00:01:48.360> once<00:01:48.990> I'm<00:01:49.200> done<00:01:49.229> there<00:01:49.619> I'm<00:01:50.189> gonna<00:01:50.340> crank

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
here once I'm done there I'm gonna crank

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.450 
here once I'm done there I'm gonna crank
up<00:01:51.420> my<00:01:51.450> sculpt<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.110> 4x<00:01:52.560> which<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.130> maximum

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
up my sculpt to 4x which is the maximum

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.429 
up my sculpt to 4x which is the maximum
for<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> breasts<00:01:54.090> or<00:01:54.210> scope<00:01:54.420> I'm<00:01:54.600> using<00:01:54.780> and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
for the breasts or scope I'm using and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.770 
for the breasts or scope I'm using and
then<00:01:55.770> I'm<00:01:56.070> gonna<00:01:56.159> engage<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.729> core<00:01:56.939> at<00:01:57.180> 200

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
then I'm gonna engage the core at 200

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.770 
then I'm gonna engage the core at 200
yards<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.290> my<00:01:58.950> zero<00:01:59.310> should<00:01:59.820> be<00:01:59.969> perfectly<00:02:00.509> on

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
yards and my zero should be perfectly on

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.499 
yards and my zero should be perfectly on
at<00:02:00.960> 200<00:02:01.350> yards<00:02:01.380> as<00:02:01.740> well<00:02:01.950> now<00:02:02.790> when<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.240> get<00:02:03.420> out

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
at 200 yards as well now when I get out

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.330 
at 200 yards as well now when I get out
to<00:02:03.659> 500<00:02:04.530> yards<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:04.890> going<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> little

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
to 500 yards it's going to be a little

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.270 
to 500 yards it's going to be a little
iffy<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:06.540> I've<00:02:06.780> I've<00:02:07.200> doped<00:02:07.530> my<00:02:07.740> rifle<00:02:08.160> and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
iffy but I've I've doped my rifle and

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.559 
iffy but I've I've doped my rifle and
figured<00:02:08.610> out<00:02:08.700> where<00:02:08.879> I'm<00:02:09.000> hitting<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.509> I'm

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
figured out where I'm hitting and I'm

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.710 
figured out where I'm hitting and I'm
gonna<00:02:09.660> use<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.989> first<00:02:10.289> mil<00:02:10.619> dot<00:02:10.860> below<00:02:11.569> Center

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
gonna use the first mil dot below Center

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.810 
gonna use the first mil dot below Center
Centrepointe<00:02:13.230> in<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.560> scope<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.580> I'm<00:02:14.730> gonna

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
Centrepointe in the scope and I'm gonna

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.390 
Centrepointe in the scope and I'm gonna
do<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.150> at<00:02:15.330> 500<00:02:15.840> yards<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:17.040> should<00:02:17.250> get

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
do that at 500 yards and I should get

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.760 
do that at 500 yards and I should get
some<00:02:17.550> hits<00:02:17.730> on<00:02:17.850> that<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.060> hope<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.530> part

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
some hits on that I hope and the part

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.100 
some hits on that I hope and the part
time<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.430> 90<00:02:21.060> seconds<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.600> believe<00:02:21.630> for<00:02:22.050> this

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
time is 90 seconds I believe for this

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.990 
time is 90 seconds I believe for this
stage<00:02:22.380> so<00:02:22.590> if<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.770> do<00:02:22.920> not<00:02:23.130> finish<00:02:23.400> everything

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
stage so if you do not finish everything

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.120 
stage so if you do not finish everything
in<00:02:24.390> 90<00:02:24.780> seconds<00:02:25.230> they'll<00:02:25.440> stop<00:02:25.710> you<00:02:25.950> and

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
in 90 seconds they'll stop you and

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.160 
in 90 seconds they'll stop you and
assess<00:02:26.850> any<00:02:27.030> penalties<00:02:27.540> basically<00:02:28.050> they're

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
assess any penalties basically they're

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.440 
assess any penalties basically they're
going<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.350> give<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.560> penalties<00:02:28.950> for<00:02:29.100> misses

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.160 

are<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.720> ready

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
are you ready

00:02:34.170 --> 00:03:55.350 
are you ready
stand<00:02:35.130> by

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.330 

so<00:03:56.360> this<00:03:56.540> is<00:03:56.690> my<00:03:56.810> second<00:03:57.260> stage<00:03:57.470> here<00:03:57.830> it<00:03:58.190> was

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
so this is my second stage here it was

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.710 
so this is my second stage here it was
an<00:03:58.400> early<00:03:58.519> in<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.790> morning<00:03:59.060> I<00:03:59.150> had<00:03:59.450> about<00:03:59.659> a

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
an early in the morning I had about a

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.259 
an early in the morning I had about a
half<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.049> pot<00:04:00.319> of<00:04:00.470> coffee<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:01.010> started<00:04:02.000> flowing

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
half a pot of coffee and started flowing

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.190 
half a pot of coffee and started flowing
but<00:04:02.659> I<00:04:02.720> must<00:04:03.019> say<00:04:03.170> everything<00:04:03.709> went<00:04:03.920> flying
