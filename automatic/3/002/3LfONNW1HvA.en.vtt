00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.619

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.199

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.989

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.260
 many youtuber let 's say they 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.000

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.320
 their strings in the description we 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.390

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.430

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.230

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.780
 look good this will please you we are 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.840
 found in the kitchen all the recipe of 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.780
 bourny minecraft that will make you 70 g of 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.449
 marshmallows 50 g plain puffed rice 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.629
 I'm going to explain how 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.199
 to make an upcoming video and 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.000
 green dye 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.159
 the first thing you will do 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.880
 it's just putting in a 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.950
 salad bowl your malo sleeves and you go 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.950
 pass that to the microphone until they are 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.530
 well melted here beware it's going very 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.270
 quickly a few seconds are then enough 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.439
 what you will do is all 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:26.580
 simply put your puffed rice 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:28.130
 as well as the green dye and well 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.049
 mix 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.880
 this is the result so we have some 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.650
 very very green thing so this is it 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.210
 we need and now we will put this 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.759
 in a container and I'm going to 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.790
 show what to do now 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.439
 it's very simple you will take 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.500
 our mixture which is quite sticky 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.210
 so we have to hurry 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.479
 that's it and you put it in your 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.790
 container and now you go 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.960
 take a sheet of aluminum paper you 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.509
 go well flattened your course and 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.130
 this is what we get so saw that 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.329
 my container was a little bit too 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.729
 big but it does not matter 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.740
 so you flatten not too much 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.560
 story to have some reliefs that that 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.150
 natural and you'll put that in 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.040
 fridge for a good half hour 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.319
 the story be it hard and we're going 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.569
 to be able to go to the training of taste 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.849
 so that's what we get once 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.319
 that we took it out of our container is 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.900
 so what you need to do is 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.690
 just take a day or you 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.920
 look at about the size of the burnished and at 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.360
 using a knife 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.459
 wanting to go cut so that's 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:39.810
 exactly what I'm going to do and that's it 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:42.959
 you have your square and you are left 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.510
 more than put it on your bouni and to 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.530
 watch if there remains to cut so there 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.400
 you see that it's a little too big 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.420
 able to cut and that's the result that 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.180
 you are going to get 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.569
 so frankly day that hyper realistic 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.280
 you do not need to stick to it 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.920
 piece because just when 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.690
 you 're going to put you down well and 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.300
 as the marshmallow is very sticky 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.019
 down you see it's holding so there's no 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.489
 there's no worries this is what I you 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.650
 advise is to simply finish 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.370
 the brownies and we will spend a little 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.370
 nice decor 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.180
 the burnished is right here so I find it 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.599
 downright fun actually so it's gone 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.849
 I will taste 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.980
 or if the recipe tarver longer hesitates 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.330
 not to put a little green thumb to go 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.520
 leave a comment and share it 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.620
 on social networks we end up 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.670
 very soon for many more 7 and 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.670
 on this chao
