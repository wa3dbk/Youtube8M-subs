00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.420 
going to set it alight and I think that
only<00:02:50.360> game<00:02:50.660> gets<00:02:50.870> Uruguay<00:02:51.290> it's<00:02:52.040> not<00:02:52.220> an<00:02:52.340> easy

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
only game gets Uruguay it's not an easy

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.710 
only game gets Uruguay it's not an easy
game<00:02:52.640> from<00:02:52.790> site<00:02:53.000> it's<00:02:53.150> not<00:02:53.270> year<00:02:53.420> ago<00:02:53.600> i've

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
game from site it's not year ago i've

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.080 
game from site it's not year ago i've
got<00:02:53.930> another<00:02:54.200> Suarez<00:02:54.800> they've<00:02:55.130> got<00:02:55.400> Diego

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
got another Suarez they've got Diego

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.240 
got another Suarez they've got Diego
Forlan<00:02:56.630> it's<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.020> Cavani<00:02:57.290> you<00:02:57.800> no<00:02:57.920> matter

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
Forlan it's and Cavani you no matter

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.030 
Forlan it's and Cavani you no matter
Martin<00:02:58.880> casa<00:02:59.180> res<00:02:59.420> so<00:02:59.690> they<00:03:00.380> got<00:03:00.710> a<00:03:00.740> good<00:03:00.860> team

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
Martin casa res so they got a good team

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.850 
Martin casa res so they got a good team
but<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.310> just<00:03:01.490> think<00:03:01.550> France<00:03:02.480> they<00:03:03.410> were<00:03:03.620> world

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
but I just think France they were world

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.110 
but I just think France they were world
champions<00:03:03.920> they<00:03:04.340> got<00:03:04.490> some<00:03:04.640> more<00:03:04.760> champions

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
champions they got some more champions

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.120 
champions they got some more champions
entities<00:03:05.300> still<00:03:05.780> there<00:03:05.960> yes<00:03:06.140> Pleasure<00:03:06.380> so<00:03:07.100> I

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
entities still there yes Pleasure so I

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.680 
entities still there yes Pleasure so I
think<00:03:07.340> they'll<00:03:07.490> just<00:03:07.520> come<00:03:07.700> together<00:03:08.000> despite

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
think they'll just come together despite

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.300 
think they'll just come together despite
what<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.020> managers<00:03:09.380> doing<00:03:09.650> behind<00:03:10.070> the

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
what the managers doing behind the

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.180 
what the managers doing behind the
scenes<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.700> I<00:03:10.760> think<00:03:11.000> 21<00:03:11.720> ice<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.680> lot<00:03:12.890> more

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
scenes and I think 21 ice a lot more

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.830 
scenes and I think 21 ice a lot more
money<00:03:13.310> we<00:03:13.550> go<00:03:13.700> nowhere<00:03:13.940> nowhere<00:03:14.330> near<00:03:14.630> France

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
to Mike us honestly I think that can

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.680 
to Mike us honestly I think that can
come<00:03:18.590> undone<00:03:18.830> i<00:03:18.860> think<00:03:19.130> i<00:03:19.220> uruguay<00:03:19.730> i<00:03:20.000> don't

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
come undone i think i uruguay i don't

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:21.760 
come undone i think i uruguay i don't
think<00:03:20.720> i<00:03:20.840> can<00:03:20.900> get<00:03:21.080> victory<00:03:21.380> but<00:03:21.500> i<00:03:21.560> think<00:03:21.739> that

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
think i can get victory but i think that

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:22.930 
think i can get victory but i think that
can<00:03:22.010> shop<00:03:22.250> for<00:03:22.370> answer<00:03:22.580> but<00:03:22.700> i<00:03:22.760> think<00:03:22.910> that

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
can shop for answer but i think that

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.940 
can shop for answer but i think that
might<00:03:23.150> be<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.450> one<00:03:23.720> or<00:03:23.870> maybe<00:03:24.140> if<00:03:24.440> we'd<00:03:24.560> probably

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
might be a one or maybe if we'd probably

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.830 
might be a one or maybe if we'd probably
a<00:03:25.070> pretty<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:25.730> snow<00:03:25.970> wouldn't<00:03:26.270> in<00:03:26.630> this<00:03:26.720> one

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
a pretty you snow wouldn't in this one

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.300 
a pretty you snow wouldn't in this one
really<00:03:27.050> there<00:03:27.200> will<00:03:27.500> be<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.620> close<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:27.950> know<00:03:28.070> but

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
really there will be a close to know but

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.930 
really there will be a close to know but
I<00:03:28.370> just<00:03:28.580> think<00:03:28.640> France<00:03:29.630> just<00:03:29.870> a<00:03:29.959> bit<00:03:30.140> today<00:03:30.980> ok

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
I just think France just a bit today ok

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.479 
I just think France just a bit today ok
we<00:03:32.170> will<00:03:33.170> be<00:03:33.290> decided<00:03:33.739> yet<00:03:33.830> we're<00:03:34.190> going<00:03:34.400> to

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
we will be decided yet we're going to

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.490 
we will be decided yet we're going to

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
disagree as they say so Muirfield go for

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.020 
disagree as they say so Muirfield go for
a<00:03:36.530> win<00:03:36.739> for<00:03:36.890> Mexico<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:37.580> a<00:03:37.640> closer<00:03:37.880> game

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
a win for Mexico and a closer game

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.610 
a win for Mexico and a closer game
between<00:03:38.270> france<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:38.750> uruguay<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.290> we're

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
between france and uruguay and we're

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.510 
between france and uruguay and we're
pretty<00:03:39.739> hot<00:03:39.950> in<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.070> Chancellor<00:03:40.400> met

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
pretty hot in the Chancellor met

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.220 
pretty hot in the Chancellor met
together<00:03:40.640> we<00:03:41.180> think<00:03:41.630> that<00:03:41.660> too<00:03:41.840> much<00:03:42.020> money

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230

together we think that too much money
right<00:03:42.290> on<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.620> yeah<00:03:42.770> they<00:03:42.950> don't<00:03:43.040> think<00:03:43.220> that's

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
right on it yeah they don't think that's

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.500 
right on it yeah they don't think that's
a<00:03:43.400> really<00:03:43.640> good<00:03:43.760> chance<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.090> mix<00:03:44.209> I've<00:03:44.360> got

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
a really good chance to mix I've got
