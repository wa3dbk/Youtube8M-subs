I<00:00:19.710> like<00:00:20.160> their<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.670> holographic<00:00:21.090> flash<00:00:21.449> great

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
I like their the holographic flash great

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.570 
I like their the holographic flash great

for fishing up to the high in the water
but<00:00:24.029> also<00:00:24.180> because<00:00:24.420> its<00:00:24.660> own<00:00:24.779> black<00:00:25.019> fly<00:00:25.260> out

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
but also because its own black fly out

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.259

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
when your tie in with this stuff make

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.560 
when your tie in with this stuff make
sure<00:01:46.549> people<00:01:47.549> just<00:01:47.729> tend<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.000> wane<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.390> odd

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
sure people just tend to wane to odd

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.990 
sure people just tend to wane to odd
when<00:01:49.439> you're<00:01:49.590> tying<00:01:49.829> with<00:01:50.009> any<00:01:50.220> fits<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.880> get

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
when you're tying with any fits to get

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.929 
when you're tying with any fits to get
the<00:01:51.119> most<00:01:51.329> out<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:52.310> stroke<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> fibers

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the most out of it stroke the fibers

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.310 
the most out of it stroke the fibers
back<00:01:55.130> when<00:01:56.130> your<00:01:56.280> tie<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.899> you'll<00:01:57.899> see<00:01:57.930> what<00:01:58.259> I

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
back when your tie in you'll see what I

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.179 
back when your tie in you'll see what I
mean<00:01:59.659> so<00:02:00.659> something<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.500> all<00:02:01.680> about<00:02:01.920> about<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
mean so something is all about about the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.350 
mean so something is all about about the
head<00:02:02.369> you've<00:02:02.549> got<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> lot<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.880> get<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.180> near

head you've got a lot to get on near

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.569 
head you've got a lot to get on near
remember<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:04.469> just<00:02:04.560> stroke<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.159> fibers

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
remember it's just stroke the fibers

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.520 
remember it's just stroke the fibers
back<00:02:05.790> every<00:02:06.689> time<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.869> go<00:02:07.049> down<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.320> shower

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.770 
back every time you go down the shower
stall<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.069> fibers<00:02:08.750> swim<00:02:09.750> back

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
stall the fibers swim back

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:19.410 
stall the fibers swim back
neat<00:02:11.530> touch<00:02:11.740> in<00:02:11.890> terms

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420

we've<00:02:24.550> got<00:02:24.580> my<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.880> get<00:02:25.270> on<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.569> up<00:02:26.880> secure<00:02:30.510> but

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
we've got my to get on the up secure but

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.040 
we've got my to get on the up secure but
one<00:02:31.660> thing<00:02:31.900> I'm<00:02:32.020> not<00:02:32.260> keen<00:02:32.590> on<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:34.420> struggle

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
one thing I'm not keen on this struggle

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.870 
one thing I'm not keen on this struggle
because<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.590> is<00:02:35.680> holographic<00:02:36.040> stuff<00:02:36.730> who

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
because it is holographic stuff who

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.040 
because it is holographic stuff who
using<00:02:37.300> is<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.260> thickness<00:02:38.500> of<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:38.860> core<00:02:41.340> ok
