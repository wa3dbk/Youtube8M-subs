means if you want or need to back up

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.800 
means if you want or need to back up
your<00:01:43.920> stuff<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.490> not<00:01:44.729> backed<00:01:45.000> up<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.450> if

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
it's not backed up it means that if

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.520 
it's not backed up it means that if
something<00:01:48.360> ever<00:01:48.630> happens<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.200> your<00:01:49.320> hard

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
something ever happens to your hard

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.530 
something ever happens to your hard
drive<00:01:49.560> crashing<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.490> example<00:01:50.939> while<00:01:51.360> you

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
drive crashing for example while you

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.429 
drive crashing for example while you
lose<00:01:51.750> everything<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.640> that<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.909> not<00:01:54.149> wise<00:01:54.479> so

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
lose everything and that is not wise so

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.260 
lose everything and that is not wise so
it's<00:01:55.890> not<00:01:56.100> even<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.430> question<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.060> should<00:01:57.090> ask

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
it's not even a question you should ask

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.020 
it's not even a question you should ask
because<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.079> should<00:01:58.380> have<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> backup<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.579> your

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
because you should have a backup of your

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.940 
because you should have a backup of your
stuff

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
stuff

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.130 
stuff
and<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:03.030> reason<00:02:03.330> why<00:02:03.450> people<00:02:03.780> don't<00:02:03.869> back<00:02:04.110> up

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
and the reason why people don't back up

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.620 
and the reason why people don't back up
is<00:02:04.500> because<00:02:04.979> either<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.729> costs<00:02:06.030> money<00:02:06.180> because

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
is because either it costs money because

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.040 
is because either it costs money because
you<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:07.229> buy<00:02:07.380> an<00:02:07.680> external<00:02:08.009> drive<00:02:08.310> or<00:02:09.300> in

you have to buy an external drive or in

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.930 
you have to buy an external drive or in
a<00:02:10.530> lot<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.800> cases<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:12.650> simply<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.860> because<00:02:14.670> it

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
a lot of cases it simply is because it

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.000 
a lot of cases it simply is because it
is<00:02:15.330> time-consuming<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.410> have<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.770> do

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010

even though the majority of you guys and

girls will upgrade fine one thing you

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.470 
girls will upgrade fine one thing you
need<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.319> know<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.769> that<00:02:37.880> there<00:02:38.880> are<00:02:39.180> some

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
need to know is that there are some

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.970 
need to know is that there are some
people<00:02:39.660> out<00:02:39.989> there<00:02:40.019> that<00:02:40.440> things<00:02:40.739> are<00:02:40.890> gonna

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
people out there that things are gonna

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.699 
people out there that things are gonna
go<00:02:41.220> wrong<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.790> they're<00:02:42.510> gonna<00:02:42.630> lose<00:02:42.900> the

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
go wrong and they're gonna lose the

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.890 
go wrong and they're gonna lose the
stuff<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.100> have<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:45.170> is<00:02:46.170> part<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:47.900> upgrading

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
stuff you have it is part of upgrading

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.990 
stuff you have it is part of upgrading
to<00:02:49.290> another<00:02:49.560> operating<00:02:50.040> system<00:02:50.100> the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
to another operating system the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.210 
to another operating system the
possibility<00:02:51.269> that<00:02:51.900> something<00:02:52.350> goes<00:02:52.680> wrong<00:02:52.950> is

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
possibility that something goes wrong is

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.830 
possibility that something goes wrong is
always<00:02:54.209> there<00:02:54.510> so<00:02:56.840> for<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:58.019> reason<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:59.840> will

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
always there so for that reason I will

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.710 
always there so for that reason I will
say<00:03:01.080> yes<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:01.709> need<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:02.010> backup<00:03:02.190> your<00:03:02.340> stuff<00:03:02.720> if

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
say yes you need to backup your stuff if

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.430 
say yes you need to backup your stuff if
you<00:03:03.900> don't<00:03:03.930> back<00:03:04.290> up<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.890> go<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.640> Windows<00:03:06.030> 10<00:03:06.440> I

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
you don't back up and go to Windows 10 I

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.150 
you don't back up and go to Windows 10 I
think<00:03:08.040> you're<00:03:08.190> taking<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:09.500> risk<00:03:10.500> here<00:03:10.739> you're

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
think you're taking a risk here you're

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.509 
think you're taking a risk here you're
taking<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.700> chance<00:03:11.730> of<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:13.620> know<00:03:13.650> probably

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
taking a chance of you know probably

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.090 
taking a chance of you know probably
things<00:03:15.000> will<00:03:15.180> go<00:03:15.359> right<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:15.959> for<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.440> lot<00:03:16.890> like

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
things will go right and for a lot like

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.310 
things will go right and for a lot like
I<00:03:17.220> said<00:03:17.459> for<00:03:17.670> probably<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.720> majority<00:03:18.840> of

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
I said for probably the majority of

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.009 
I said for probably the majority of
people<00:03:19.620> everything<00:03:19.980> will<00:03:20.130> be<00:03:20.250> ok<00:03:20.720> but<00:03:21.720> still

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
people everything will be ok but still

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.509 
people everything will be ok but still
you<00:03:22.380> should<00:03:22.799> back<00:03:23.310> up<00:03:23.340> your<00:03:23.609> stuff<00:03:24.590> as<00:03:25.590> for<00:03:26.430> the

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
you should back up your stuff as for the

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.670 
you should back up your stuff as for the
clean<00:03:26.760> install<00:03:27.180> possibilities<00:03:28.079> well<00:03:28.380> first

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
clean install possibilities well first

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.370 
clean install possibilities well first
of<00:03:28.829> all<00:03:28.950> as<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:30.120> was<00:03:30.540> answering<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.079> first

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
of all as I was answering the first

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.319 
of all as I was answering the first
question<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:32.359> told<00:03:33.359> you<00:03:33.480> there's<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.959> update<00:03:35.329> pad

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
question I told you there's a update pad

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.810 
question I told you there's a update pad
that<00:03:36.750> will<00:03:37.140> ask<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:37.650> if<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:37.859> want<00:03:38.070> to<00:03:38.160> erase

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
that will ask you if you want to erase

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.530 
that will ask you if you want to erase
everything<00:03:39.890> this<00:03:40.890> will<00:03:41.190> technically<00:03:41.790> be<00:03:41.940> a

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
everything this will technically be a

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.780 
everything this will technically be a
clean<00:03:42.840> install<00:03:43.140> from<00:03:43.709> your<00:03:44.010> existing

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
clean install from your existing

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.509 
clean install from your existing
operating<00:03:45.510> system<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:47.269> Windows<00:03:48.269> 10<00:03:49.100> so<00:03:50.100> it<00:03:50.370> is

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
operating system to Windows 10 so it is

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.509 
operating system to Windows 10 so it is
sort<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.540> clean<00:03:51.959> install<00:03:52.319> but<00:03:53.130> I<00:03:53.160> also

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
sort of a clean install but I also

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.640 
sort of a clean install but I also
understand<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:55.230> term<00:03:55.650> clean<00:03:56.010> install<00:03:57.500> in<00:03:58.500> a

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
understand the term clean install in a

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.069 
understand the term clean install in a
different<00:03:59.040> way<00:03:59.160> because<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.730> do<00:04:00.420> a<00:04:00.690> clean

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
different way because I do a clean

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.809 
different way because I do a clean
install<00:04:01.440> for<00:04:01.769> example<00:04:02.160> this<00:04:02.310> built<00:04:02.609> of

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
install for example this built of

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.140 
install for example this built of
Windows<00:04:03.150> 10<00:04:03.750> was<00:04:04.410> clean<00:04:04.799> installed<00:04:05.370> from<00:04:05.910> a

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
Windows 10 was clean installed from a

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.470 
Windows 10 was clean installed from a
thumb<00:04:06.660> drive<00:04:06.989> and<00:04:07.310> that's<00:04:08.310> probably<00:04:08.760> more

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
thumb drive and that's probably more

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.360 
thumb drive and that's probably more
type<00:04:09.930> of<00:04:10.110> clean<00:04:10.349> install<00:04:10.709> that<00:04:10.890> people<00:04:11.220> are

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
type of clean install that people are

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.530 
type of clean install that people are
talking<00:04:11.760> about

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
talking about

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.569 
talking about
we<00:04:13.019> know<00:04:13.230> that<00:04:14.420> for<00:04:15.420> now<00:04:16.100> what<00:04:17.100> you'll<00:04:17.340> have<00:04:17.519> to

that<00:05:01.110> Microsoft<00:05:01.979> will<00:05:02.550> give<00:05:03.949> image<00:05:04.949> files<00:05:05.280> of

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
that Microsoft will give image files of

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.900 
that Microsoft will give image files of
Windows<00:05:06.240> 10<00:05:06.800> but<00:05:07.800> in<00:05:07.949> order<00:05:08.250> to<00:05:08.280> use<00:05:08.669> them

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
Windows 10 but in order to use them

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.820 
Windows 10 but in order to use them
you'll<00:05:09.150> have<00:05:09.180> to<00:05:09.419> do<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.110> first<00:05:10.320> step<00:05:10.620> which

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
you'll have to do the first step which

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.100 
you'll have to do the first step which
is<00:05:10.860> to<00:05:11.250> upgrade<00:05:11.490> from<00:05:11.940> your<00:05:12.060> existing<00:05:12.720> system

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
is to upgrade from your existing system

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.439 
is to upgrade from your existing system
to<00:05:13.650> Windows<00:05:14.039> 10<00:05:14.070> and<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.850> reason<00:05:15.180> why<00:05:15.389> you

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
to Windows 10 and the reason why you

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.560 
to Windows 10 and the reason why you
have<00:05:15.780> to<00:05:15.810> do<00:05:16.139> that<00:05:16.320> is<00:05:16.560> because<00:05:17.340> that's<00:05:18.150> how

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
have to do that is because that's how

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.350 
have to do that is because that's how
your<00:05:18.990> Windows<00:05:19.440> 10<00:05:19.470> will<00:05:20.250> be<00:05:20.460> linked<00:05:20.849> to<00:05:21.030> your

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
your Windows 10 will be linked to your

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.350 
your Windows 10 will be linked to your
computer<00:05:21.900> and<00:05:22.050> that<00:05:22.680> they'll<00:05:22.919> know<00:05:23.160> that<00:05:24.030> that

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
computer and that they'll know that that

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.900 
computer and that they'll know that that
computer<00:05:24.900> has<00:05:25.050> a<00:05:25.440> free<00:05:25.919> copy<00:05:26.160> of<00:05:26.310> Windows<00:05:26.669> 10

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
computer has a free copy of Windows 10

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.800 
computer has a free copy of Windows 10
and<00:05:27.470> that's<00:05:28.470> how<00:05:28.940> Microsoft<00:05:29.940> will<00:05:30.270> also<00:05:30.630> know

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
and that's how Microsoft will also know

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.540 
and that's how Microsoft will also know
in<00:05:30.930> the<00:05:30.960> future<00:05:31.199> when<00:05:31.620> you<00:05:31.710> want<00:05:31.889> to<00:05:32.039> reinstall

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
in the future when you want to reinstall

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.950 
in the future when you want to reinstall
that<00:05:33.139> you<00:05:34.139> have<00:05:34.349> a<00:05:34.380> free<00:05:34.710> copy<00:05:34.949> that<00:05:35.789> is<00:05:36.120> ok<00:05:36.660> to

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
that you have a free copy that is ok to

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.550 
that you have a free copy that is ok to
install<00:05:37.349> on<00:05:37.560> your<00:05:37.919> computer<00:05:38.990> so<00:05:39.990> that's

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
install on your computer so that's

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.719 
install on your computer so that's
basically<00:05:41.099> how<00:05:41.220> it's<00:05:41.520> gonna<00:05:41.639> be<00:05:41.760> done<00:05:42.710> for<00:05:43.729> now

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
basically how it's gonna be done for now

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.469 
basically how it's gonna be done for now
there's<00:05:45.090> no<00:05:45.630> talk<00:05:46.020> about<00:05:46.190> having<00:05:47.190> a<00:05:47.479> image

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
there's no talk about having a image

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.839 
there's no talk about having a image
file<00:05:48.750> immediately<00:05:49.590> available<00:05:49.860> that<00:05:50.580> you<00:05:50.729> can

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
file immediately available that you can

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:54.200 
file immediately available that you can
just<00:05:51.180> do<00:05:51.449> a<00:05:51.479> clean<00:05:51.720> install<00:05:52.169> with<00:05:52.760> which<00:05:53.760> force

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
just do a clean install with which force

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.360 
just do a clean install with which force
a<00:05:54.360> guy<00:05:54.960> for<00:05:55.199> example<00:05:55.590> the<00:05:55.680> tech<00:05:55.860> guy<00:05:55.979> like<00:05:56.190> me

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
a guy for example the tech guy like me

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.100 
a guy for example the tech guy like me
would<00:05:56.639> be<00:05:56.669> the<00:05:57.120> best<00:05:57.389> thing<00:05:57.690> because<00:05:57.960> I'd

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
would be the best thing because I'd

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.339 
would be the best thing because I'd
rather<00:05:58.710> have<00:05:58.889> that<00:05:59.370> option<00:05:59.580> then<00:06:00.570> go<00:06:01.110> from

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
rather have that option then go from

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:04.310 
rather have that option then go from
Windows<00:06:01.710> 8.1<00:06:01.919> to<00:06:02.909> Windows<00:06:03.210> 10<00:06:03.240> but<00:06:03.780> I<00:06:03.840> have<00:06:04.139> no

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 but I have no

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.770 
Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 but I have no
choice<00:06:04.620> for<00:06:04.919> now<00:06:05.070> that's<00:06:05.370> pretty<00:06:05.520> much<00:06:05.780> what

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
choice for now that's pretty much what

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.430 
choice for now that's pretty much what
they<00:06:06.960> say<00:06:07.199> we<00:06:07.349> need<00:06:07.530> to<00:06:07.560> do<00:06:07.860> so<00:06:08.930> first<00:06:09.930> step<00:06:10.199> I

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
they say we need to do so first step I
