this morning and nothing came off on my
coffee<00:01:10.170> cup<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:12.110> it<00:01:13.110> doesn't<00:01:13.380> last<00:01:13.530> all<00:01:14.010> day

that<00:01:47.490> we<00:01:47.640> use<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.180> figure<00:01:48.420> out<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.220> chemical

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
that we use to figure out the chemical

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.749 
that we use to figure out the chemical
toxicity<00:01:50.640> called<00:01:51.270> skin<00:01:51.689> deep<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:53.610> just

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
toxicity called skin deep and you just

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.310 
toxicity called skin deep and you just
put<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.000> all<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> ingredients<00:01:54.390> or<00:01:54.869> surgery<00:01:55.229> on

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
put in all the ingredients or surgery on

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.399 
put in all the ingredients or surgery on
the<00:01:55.439> website<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.729> will<00:01:56.939> tell<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.689> what

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
the website and it will tell you what

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.219 
the website and it will tell you what
the<00:01:58.590> chemicals<00:01:59.040> are<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.490> how<00:02:00.299> toxic<00:02:00.659> they<00:02:01.079> are

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
the chemicals are and how toxic they are

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.929 
the chemicals are and how toxic they are
for<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.009> environment<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.670> whether

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
for you in the environment and whether

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.840 
for you in the environment and whether
that<00:02:03.000> they're<00:02:03.360> tested<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.719> animals<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.790> 0<00:02:05.790> is

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
that they're tested on animals so 0 is

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.640 
that they're tested on animals so 0 is
the

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
the

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.800 
the
whisp<00:02:06.800> toxicity<00:02:07.640> things<00:02:07.970> like<00:02:08.240> water<00:02:08.509> and

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
whisp toxicity things like water and

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.740 
whisp toxicity things like water and
natural<00:02:08.960> products<00:02:09.619> have<00:02:09.830> this<00:02:10.100> as<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.150> number

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
natural products have this as a number

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.600 
natural products have this as a number
and<00:02:11.960> each<00:02:12.140> ingredient<00:02:12.320> is<00:02:12.740> also<00:02:13.070> rated<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:13.580> I

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
and each ingredient is also rated so I

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.770 
and each ingredient is also rated so I
guess<00:02:13.790> they<00:02:13.940> average<00:02:14.240> them<00:02:14.450> out<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.690> I'll

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
guess they average them out and I'll

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
guess they average them out and I'll
really<00:02:14.930> know<00:02:15.110> how<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:15.260> number<00:02:15.710> is

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
really know how this number is

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.330 
really know how this number is
calculated<00:02:16.370> but<00:02:17.030> um<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:18.320> then<00:02:18.650> 10<00:02:18.890> is<00:02:19.130> the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
calculated but um and then 10 is the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.400 
calculated but um and then 10 is the
absolute<00:02:19.760> worst<00:02:19.970> I<00:02:20.300> got<00:02:20.570> a<00:02:20.600> 4<00:02:20.990> which<00:02:21.200> is

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
absolute worst I got a 4 which is

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.010 
absolute worst I got a 4 which is
considered<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:22.130> moderate<00:02:22.610> hazard<00:02:23.180> flow<00:02:23.600> hazard

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
considered a moderate hazard flow hazard

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.710 
considered a moderate hazard flow hazard
moderate<00:02:24.380> hazard<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:24.890> high<00:02:25.130> hazard<00:02:25.550> and<00:02:25.940> 326

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
moderate hazard and high hazard and 326

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.520 
moderate hazard and high hazard and 326
is<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.410> range<00:02:27.710> for<00:02:28.390> moderate<00:02:29.390> so<00:02:29.990> it's<00:02:30.350> not

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
is the range for moderate so it's not

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.970 
is the range for moderate so it's not
really<00:02:30.590> great<00:02:31.160> for<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.490> but<00:02:32.710> really<00:02:33.710> it<00:02:33.950> just

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
really great for you but really it just

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.530 
really great for you but really it just
kind<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.400> food<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:34.790> have<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.030> figure<00:02:35.330> out

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
kind of food you have to figure out

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.300 
kind of food you have to figure out
whether<00:02:35.720> or<00:02:35.870> not<00:02:35.960> it's<00:02:36.170> worth<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.620> for<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:37.100> it

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
whether or not it's worth it for you it

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.430 
whether or not it's worth it for you it
says<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.030> high<00:02:38.300> concerns<00:02:38.930> for<00:02:39.320> this

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
says that the high concerns for this

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.190 
says that the high concerns for this
product<00:02:39.680> are<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:41.090> it's<00:02:41.240> a<00:02:41.330> skin<00:02:41.630> irritant

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
product are that it's a skin irritant

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.750 
product are that it's a skin irritant
which<00:02:42.350> I<00:02:42.500> mean<00:02:42.680> that's<00:02:42.920> normal<00:02:43.430> for<00:02:43.459> anything

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
which I mean that's normal for anything

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.100 
which I mean that's normal for anything
that<00:02:43.910> you're<00:02:44.090> putting<00:02:44.300> on<00:02:44.450> your<00:02:44.510> skin<00:02:44.870> really

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
that you're putting on your skin really

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.070 
that you're putting on your skin really
but<00:02:45.380> it<00:02:45.530> also<00:02:45.770> affects<00:02:46.459> your<00:02:46.940> organ<00:02:47.600> systems

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
but it also affects your organ systems

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.860 
but it also affects your organ systems
that<00:02:48.320> are<00:02:48.500> not<00:02:48.740> reproductive<00:02:49.550> so<00:02:50.209> I<00:02:50.240> don't<00:02:50.720> I

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
that are not reproductive so I don't I

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.330 
that are not reproductive so I don't I
don't<00:02:50.930> really<00:02:51.170> know<00:02:51.380> exactly<00:02:51.410> what<00:02:52.310> that

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
don't really know exactly what that

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.300 
don't really know exactly what that
means<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:53.060> is<00:02:53.090> also<00:02:53.780> big<00:02:54.140> for<00:02:54.380> persistence<00:02:55.160> and

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
means it is also big for persistence and

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.340 
means it is also big for persistence and
bioaccumulation<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.570> what<00:02:57.050> my<00:02:57.200> own

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
bioaccumulation and what my own

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.220 
bioaccumulation and what my own
cumulation<00:02:57.830> means<00:02:58.280> is<00:02:58.580> when<00:02:59.030> there<00:02:59.510> when<00:03:00.140> the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
cumulation means is when there when the

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.870 
cumulation means is when there when the
chemicals<00:03:01.040> are<00:03:01.160> absorbed<00:03:01.520> into<00:03:01.640> your<00:03:01.760> skin

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
chemicals are absorbed into your skin

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.210 
chemicals are absorbed into your skin
they<00:03:02.510> are<00:03:02.720> absorbed<00:03:03.230> at<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.410> much<00:03:03.620> faster<00:03:03.650> rate

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
they are absorbed at a much faster rate

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.160 
they are absorbed at a much faster rate
than<00:03:04.640> they<00:03:05.240> can<00:03:05.300> be<00:03:05.840> um<00:03:07.360> then<00:03:08.360> they<00:03:08.690> go<00:03:08.840> out<00:03:08.990> of

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
than they can be um then they go out of

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.600 
than they can be um then they go out of
your<00:03:09.290> body<00:03:09.440> so<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.800> toxins<00:03:10.160> come<00:03:10.340> in<00:03:10.459> at<00:03:10.550> a

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
your body so the toxins come in at a

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.699 
your body so the toxins come in at a
much<00:03:10.760> higher<00:03:10.790> rate<00:03:11.000> than<00:03:11.480> they<00:03:11.840> leave<00:03:12.050> so

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
much higher rate than they leave so

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.759 
much higher rate than they leave so
that's<00:03:12.980> really<00:03:13.280> bad<00:03:13.720> but<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:14.780> lot<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.140> makeup

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
that's really bad but a lot of makeup

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.300 
that's really bad but a lot of makeup
