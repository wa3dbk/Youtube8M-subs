00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
up here we were broke onto distracted so

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.070 
up here we were broke onto distracted so
we<00:01:07.979> actually<00:01:08.130> missed<00:01:08.760> our<00:01:09.060> exit<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.750> we<00:01:09.869> ended

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
we actually missed our exit so we ended

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.710 
we actually missed our exit so we ended
up<00:01:10.170> going<00:01:10.380> over<00:01:10.560> some<00:01:10.920> Ridge<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:12.450> no<00:01:12.570> idea

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
up going over some Ridge I have no idea

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.230 
up going over some Ridge I have no idea
what<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.049> name<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.350> bridges<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:14.119> then<00:01:15.119> we

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
what the name of the bridges and then we

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.179 
what the name of the bridges and then we
actually<00:01:15.360> consequently<00:01:16.200> had<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.890> go<00:01:16.979> through

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
actually consequently had to go through

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.219 
actually consequently had to go through
a<00:01:17.250> tunnel<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.790> get<00:01:17.880> us<00:01:18.060> right<00:01:18.330> back<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.960> track

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
a tunnel to get us right back on track

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.539 
a tunnel to get us right back on track
so<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.220> ended<00:01:20.460> up<00:01:20.580> popping<00:01:20.909> back<00:01:21.270> out<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:22.549> some

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
so we ended up popping back out in some

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.460 
so we ended up popping back out in some
place<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.090> New<00:01:24.180> York<00:01:24.390> City<00:01:24.540> because<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> GPS

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
place in New York City because the GPS

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.350 
place in New York City because the GPS
kept<00:01:25.860> talking<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.729> us<00:01:26.850> because<00:01:27.000> they<00:01:27.119> had

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
kept talking on on us because they had

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.840 
kept talking on on us because they had
bad<00:01:27.600> satellite<00:01:28.080> reception<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.640> basically

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
bad satellite reception so we basically

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.910 
bad satellite reception so we basically
could<00:01:30.509> not<00:01:30.720> find<00:01:30.990> time<00:01:31.200> square<00:01:31.470> we're<00:01:31.680> just

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
could not find time square we're just

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.569 
could not find time square we're just
driving<00:01:32.610> through<00:01:32.640> New<00:01:32.850> York<00:01:33.259> Amos<00:01:34.259> Lee<00:01:34.579> but

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
driving through New York Amos Lee but

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.429 
driving through New York Amos Lee but
it's<00:01:35.729> okay<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.360> was<00:01:36.509> okay<00:01:36.750> because<00:01:36.840> what<00:01:37.200> did

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
it's okay it was okay because what did
