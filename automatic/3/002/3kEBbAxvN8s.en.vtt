 less meal than the one you 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.539
 habitual strategy then we start 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.329
 immediately to recharge us with sugar with 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.239
 lunch, snack at dinners, kids find 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.239
 a buffet where they can choose between 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.580

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.369
 consume of complex carbohydrates and 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.330

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.530
 and two alternatives of seconds and 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.320
 they will then consume a snack first 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.189
 to go to sleep on this occasion 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.830
 then of 12 and 30 the real meal is 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.150
 just to give it will coincide with that 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.170
 which I call a breakfast 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.720
 reinforced 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.060
 so two alternatives the sweet one 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.500
 the salty one the sweet one for the boys 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.700
 they have cereal yogurt at their disposal 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.729

 fresh fruit but also tea and coffee 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.619

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.640
 of the warm tos and of the juices of the 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:54.000

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.229
 to make me prepare some pasta and 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.920
 rice and where I asked for cooking at 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.270
 tooth that allows me to keep the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.289
 the glycemic index of low pasta e 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.809
 so don't give me glycemic swings 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.809
