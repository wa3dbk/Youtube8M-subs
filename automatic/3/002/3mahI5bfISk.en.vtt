didn't notify the intelligence
committees<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.390> mean<00:02:06.540> obviously<00:02:06.630> some<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.200> us

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320

discussions<00:02:09.750> three<00:02:10.019> or<00:02:10.140> four<00:02:10.289> years<00:02:10.500> ago<00:02:10.769> but

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
discussions three or four years ago but

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.680 
discussions three or four years ago but
he<00:02:11.370> didn't<00:02:11.580> notify<00:02:11.790> anybody<00:02:12.239> he<00:02:12.330> went<00:02:12.480> out<00:02:12.569> in

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
he didn't notify anybody he went out in

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.119 
he didn't notify anybody he went out in
unilaterally<00:02:13.319> did<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:13.980> would

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
unilaterally did this and I would

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.399 
unilaterally did this and I would
mention<00:02:14.310> in<00:02:14.640> violation<00:02:15.239> of<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.480> law<00:02:15.629> and

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
mention in violation of the law and

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.839 
mention in violation of the law and
again<00:02:16.769> I<00:02:16.799> mean<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.099> is<00:02:17.159> a<00:02:17.280> pattern<00:02:17.580> of

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
again I mean this is a pattern of

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.390 
again I mean this is a pattern of
behavior<00:02:17.970> by<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:18.629> White<00:02:18.840> House<00:02:19.049> he<00:02:19.650> has<00:02:19.860> he

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
behavior by this White House he has he

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.220 
behavior by this White House he has he
believes<00:02:20.730> somehow<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.599> he's<00:02:21.870> become<00:02:22.200> a

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
believes somehow that he's become a

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.559 
believes somehow that he's become a
monarch<00:02:22.769> or<00:02:23.010> an<00:02:23.220> emperor<00:02:23.549> that<00:02:23.819> can<00:02:24.000> basically

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
monarch or an emperor that can basically

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.809 
monarch or an emperor that can basically
ignore<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.650> law<00:02:25.769> and<00:02:25.950> do<00:02:26.040> whatever<00:02:26.250> he<00:02:26.400> wants

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
ignore the law and do whatever he wants

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.339 
ignore the law and do whatever he wants
and<00:02:26.909> there's<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.180> real<00:02:27.510> growing<00:02:27.810> frustration

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
and there's a real growing frustration

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.259 
and there's a real growing frustration
even<00:02:29.040> among<00:02:29.220> Democrats<00:02:29.730> at<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:30.000> sort<00:02:30.209> of

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
even among Democrats at the sort of

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.119 
even among Democrats at the sort of
behavior<00:02:30.390> well<00:02:30.989> Democrats<00:02:31.470> yes<00:02:31.590> they<00:02:31.799> are

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
behavior well Democrats yes they are

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.530 
behavior well Democrats yes they are
very<00:02:32.159> upset<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.640> they<00:02:32.819> didn't<00:02:33.120> know<00:02:33.390> about

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
very upset that they didn't know about

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.509 
very upset that they didn't know about
it<00:02:33.810> but<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:33.959> guess<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.799> different<00:02:35.190> question

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
it but I guess it's a different question

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.130 
it but I guess it's a different question
to<00:02:35.610> ask<00:02:35.760> what<00:02:36.299> would<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.599> have<00:02:36.720> done<00:02:36.780> instead

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
to ask what would you have done instead

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.229 
to ask what would you have done instead
so<00:02:37.860> senator<00:02:38.250> Rubio<00:02:38.610> what<00:02:38.909> would<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.150> have

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
so senator Rubio what would you have

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.330 
so senator Rubio what would you have
done<00:02:39.299> instead<00:02:39.709> well<00:02:40.709> first<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.099> all<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.220> would

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
done instead well first of all I would

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.530 
done instead well first of all I would
have<00:02:41.370> loved<00:02:41.549> to<00:02:41.579> have<00:02:41.730> him<00:02:42.060> back<00:02:42.180> with<00:02:42.420> his

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
have loved to have him back with his

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.759 
have loved to have him back with his
family<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.019> I<00:02:43.109> think<00:02:43.290> that's<00:02:43.410> something<00:02:43.560> I

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
family and I think that's something I

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.530 
family and I think that's something I
would<00:02:43.799> continue<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.400> work<00:02:44.549> towards<00:02:44.910> but<00:02:45.390> not

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
would continue to work towards but not

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.390 
would continue to work towards but not
in<00:02:45.660> exchange<00:02:46.049> for<00:02:46.230> what<00:02:46.349> he's<00:02:46.500> done<00:02:46.739> here<00:02:47.040> he

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400
