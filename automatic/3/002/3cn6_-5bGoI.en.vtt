are the Teflon coated sheets so before
we<00:01:58.259> open<00:01:58.469> up<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.950> dehydrator<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.670> want<00:02:00.000> to

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
we open up this dehydrator I want to

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.030 
we open up this dehydrator I want to
just<00:02:00.240> let<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.540> know<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:01.320> dehydrator<00:02:02.009> is

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
just let you know this dehydrator is

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.910 
just let you know this dehydrator is
currently<00:02:02.490> running<00:02:02.759> at<00:02:03.030> with<00:02:03.869> one<00:02:04.110> fan<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.680> on

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
currently running at with one fan on on

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.280 
currently running at with one fan on on
night<00:02:05.310> mode<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.880> I'll<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.750> quiet<00:02:07.020> for<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
night mode and I'll be quiet for a

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.040 
night mode and I'll be quiet for a
second<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:07.799> kind<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.069> hear<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.459> and

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
second so you can kind of hear that and

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.119 
second so you can kind of hear that and
I<00:02:10.050> don't<00:02:10.110> know<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.440> can<00:02:10.530> even<00:02:10.590> pick<00:02:10.979> that

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
I don't know if you can even pick that

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.650 
I don't know if you can even pick that
up<00:02:11.190> it's<00:02:11.459> actually<00:02:11.580> relatively<00:02:12.180> quiet<00:02:12.510> we

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
up it's actually relatively quiet we

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.309 
up it's actually relatively quiet we
could<00:02:12.810> turn<00:02:12.930> Bo

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
could turn Bo

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.209 
could turn Bo
hands-on<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.829> we'll<00:02:13.920> see<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.189> difference

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:14.219 
hands-on and we'll see the difference

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:18.970 
hands-on and we'll see the difference
okay<00:02:14.819> this<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.209> one<00:02:15.420> fan<00:02:15.749> there's<00:02:16.680> both<00:02:16.950> fans

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
okay this is one fan there's both fans

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.170 
okay this is one fan there's both fans
doesn't<00:02:19.980> really<00:02:20.129> sound<00:02:20.430> like<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.849> made<00:02:21.030> too

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
doesn't really sound like it made too

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.449 
doesn't really sound like it made too
much<00:02:21.299> a<00:02:21.359> difference<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.620> is<00:02:22.680> on<00:02:22.920> night<00:02:23.159> mode

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
much a difference this is on night mode

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.399 
much a difference this is on night mode
so<00:02:23.999> that's<00:02:24.150> running<00:02:24.389> the<00:02:24.540> fans<00:02:24.810> at<00:02:25.019> a<00:02:25.049> slower

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
so that's running the fans at a slower

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.080 
so that's running the fans at a slower
speed<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.889> be<00:02:26.010> more<00:02:26.189> quiet<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:26.700> say<00:02:26.849> you<00:02:26.909> have

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
speed to be more quiet so say you have

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.610 
speed to be more quiet so say you have
company<00:02:27.510> over<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.719> mean<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:28.049> thing<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:28.379> almost

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
company over I mean this thing is almost

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.490 
company over I mean this thing is almost
a<00:02:29.129> silent<00:02:29.969> dehydrator<00:02:30.510> let's<00:02:31.049> go<00:02:31.170> ahead<00:02:31.260> and

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
a silent dehydrator let's go ahead and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.160 
a silent dehydrator let's go ahead and
turn<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.650> up<00:02:31.799> to<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.069> full<00:02:32.459> speed<00:02:32.730> here<00:02:33.170> and

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
turn it up to you a full speed here and

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.720 
turn it up to you a full speed here and
you<00:02:34.680> could<00:02:34.799> you<00:02:35.010> could<00:02:35.159> hear<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.519> little

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
you could you could hear it a little

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.399 
you could you could hear it a little
more<00:02:35.849> but<00:02:36.060> this<00:02:36.359> one<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:36.689> definitely<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:37.200> lot

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
more but this one is definitely a lot

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.069 
more but this one is definitely a lot
more<00:02:37.439> quieter<00:02:38.129> than<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.879> excalibur<00:02:39.629> above

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
more quieter than the excalibur above

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.959 
more quieter than the excalibur above

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.589 
literally destroying our crackers I mean
it<00:03:32.009> is<00:03:32.129> kind<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.519> working<00:03:32.879> but<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.180> is<00:03:33.299> kind<00:03:33.540> of

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
it is kind of working but it is kind of

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.050 
it is kind of working but it is kind of
not<00:03:33.780> let's<00:03:34.739> see<00:03:34.979> here<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:35.489> yeah<00:03:35.639> just<00:03:35.879> gotta

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
not let's see here so yeah just gotta

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.179 
not let's see here so yeah just gotta
bend<00:03:36.389> that<00:03:36.509> up<00:03:36.569> so<00:03:37.319> what<00:03:37.560> might<00:03:37.739> help<00:03:37.979> this

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:38.189 
bend that up so what might help this

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.249 
bend that up so what might help this
process<00:03:38.819> is<00:03:39.000> if<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:39.269> put<00:03:39.479> a<00:03:39.509> coating<00:03:39.810> of<00:03:40.049> some

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:40.259 
process is if you put a coating of some

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:42.229 
process is if you put a coating of some
kind<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.500> like<00:03:40.709> coconut<00:03:41.280> oil<00:03:41.459> on<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.970> sheets

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
kind of like coconut oil on the sheets

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.990 
kind of like coconut oil on the sheets
first<00:03:42.540> so<00:03:43.409> that<00:03:43.439> they'll<00:03:43.709> pop<00:03:44.009> off<00:03:44.250> easier<00:03:44.790> or

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
first so that they'll pop off easier or

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.640 
first so that they'll pop off easier or
actually<00:03:45.419> put<00:03:45.569> some<00:03:45.720> oil<00:03:45.959> into<00:03:46.229> your<00:03:46.439> batter

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
actually put some oil into your batter

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.219 
actually put some oil into your batter
in<00:03:47.579> general<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.090> don't<00:03:48.150> actually<00:03:48.449> like<00:03:48.780> adding

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:49.229 
in general I don't actually like adding

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.259 
in general I don't actually like adding
oils<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:50.009> my<00:03:50.159> recipes<00:03:50.699> because<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.030> don't

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
oils to my recipes because I don't

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.960 
oils to my recipes because I don't
change<00:03:51.599> the<00:03:51.870> recipe<00:03:52.489> but<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:53.609> might<00:03:53.759> have<00:03:53.879> to

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
change the recipe but you might have to

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.490 
change the recipe but you might have to
do<00:03:54.090> this<00:03:54.209> if<00:03:54.479> you<00:03:54.629> want<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.049> use<00:03:55.290> these

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
do this if you want to use these

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.339 
do this if you want to use these
bpa-free<00:03:56.009> sheets<00:03:56.759> because<00:03:57.180> looks<00:03:57.959> like<00:03:58.109> to<00:03:58.229> me

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
bpa-free sheets because looks like to me

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.069 
bpa-free sheets because looks like to me
I<00:03:58.379> mean<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.590> does<00:03:58.919> kind<00:03:59.459> of<00:03:59.669> work<00:03:59.879> but<00:04:00.629> it's<00:04:00.810> not

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
I mean it does kind of work but it's not

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.300 
I mean it does kind of work but it's not
necessarily<00:04:01.919> coming<00:04:02.189> off<00:04:02.430> as<00:04:02.609> easy<00:04:02.909> as<00:04:03.269> the

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
necessarily coming off as easy as the

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.890 
necessarily coming off as easy as the
nonstick<00:04:05.310> sheets<00:04:05.669> it<00:04:06.239> is<00:04:06.269> actually<00:04:06.689> kind<00:04:06.840> of

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
nonstick sheets it is actually kind of

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.289 
nonstick sheets it is actually kind of
working<00:04:07.229> so<00:04:07.349> I<00:04:07.379> guess<00:04:07.590> some<00:04:07.799> crackers<00:04:08.699> can<00:04:09.000> be

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
working so I guess some crackers can be

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.629 
working so I guess some crackers can be
a<00:04:09.329> little<00:04:09.479> bit<00:04:09.659> tougher<00:04:10.409> to<00:04:10.459> separate<00:04:11.459> off

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
a little bit tougher to separate off

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.729 
a little bit tougher to separate off
maybe<00:04:12.389> if<00:04:12.569> they're<00:04:12.689> too<00:04:12.900> thin<00:04:13.169> they'll<00:04:13.439> tend

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
maybe if they're too thin they'll tend

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.430 
maybe if they're too thin they'll tend
to<00:04:13.969> break<00:04:14.969> up<00:04:15.209> instead<00:04:15.509> of<00:04:15.569> come<00:04:15.840> off<00:04:15.989> in<00:04:16.169> full

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
to break up instead of come off in full

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.520 
to break up instead of come off in full
chunks<00:04:16.919> so<00:04:17.419> this<00:04:18.419> is<00:04:18.659> the<00:04:18.900> once<00:04:19.259> again<00:04:19.349> the

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
chunks so this is the once again the

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.459 
chunks so this is the once again the
tribest<00:04:20.039> bpa-free<00:04:20.900> nonstick<00:04:21.900> sheets<00:04:22.229> and

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:22.469 
tribest bpa-free nonstick sheets and

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.950 
tribest bpa-free nonstick sheets and
here's<00:04:23.400> another<00:04:23.550> thing<00:04:23.789> of<00:04:24.240> crackers<00:04:24.659> we<00:04:24.779> did

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
here's another thing of crackers we did

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.590 
here's another thing of crackers we did
and<00:04:25.110> we<00:04:25.229> just<00:04:25.260> lay<00:04:25.680> this<00:04:25.860> out<00:04:26.070> as

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
and we just lay this out as

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.670 
and we just lay this out as
whole<00:04:26.890> big<00:04:28.000> piece<00:04:29.000> and<00:04:29.360> this<00:04:30.200> looks<00:04:30.500> rather

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
whole big piece and this looks rather

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.070 
whole big piece and this looks rather
thin<00:04:31.070> so<00:04:31.280> let's<00:04:31.460> go<00:04:31.610> ahead<00:04:31.700> and<00:04:31.970> take<00:04:32.210> it<00:04:32.240> from

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
thin so let's go ahead and take it from

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.200 
thin so let's go ahead and take it from
the<00:04:33.260> end<00:04:33.440> here<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:34.160> we're<00:04:34.790> gonna<00:04:34.910> go<00:04:35.120> ahead

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
the end here and we're gonna go ahead

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.000 
the end here and we're gonna go ahead
and<00:04:35.510> lift<00:04:35.780> that<00:04:35.930> up<00:04:36.140> so<00:04:36.320> check<00:04:36.530> it<00:04:36.650> out<00:04:36.770> it

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
and lift that up so check it out it

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.610 
and lift that up so check it out it
actually<00:04:37.220> is<00:04:37.610> working<00:04:38.180> fairly<00:04:38.870> well<00:04:39.110> we<00:04:39.440> are

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
actually is working fairly well we are

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.280 
actually is working fairly well we are
getting<00:04:39.920> some<00:04:40.100> residual<00:04:40.670> stuff<00:04:41.480> left<00:04:41.870> on<00:04:42.110> the

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
getting some residual stuff left on the

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.100 
getting some residual stuff left on the
sheet<00:04:42.880> but<00:04:43.880> it<00:04:44.030> is<00:04:44.150> separating<00:04:44.750> although<00:04:44.990> at

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
sheet but it is separating although at

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.200 
sheet but it is separating although at
some<00:04:45.140> points<00:04:45.740> you<00:04:45.830> know<00:04:45.950> it's<00:04:46.700> just<00:04:47.000> coming

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
some points you know it's just coming

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.240 
some points you know it's just coming
apart<00:04:47.600> and<00:04:47.810> it's<00:04:47.960> not<00:04:48.260> separating<00:04:48.950> it's<00:04:49.070> not

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
apart and it's not separating it's not

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.000 
apart and it's not separating it's not
keeping<00:04:49.520> one<00:04:49.910> continuous<00:04:50.600> large<00:04:51.380> piece<00:04:51.800> I

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
keeping one continuous large piece I

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.560 
keeping one continuous large piece I
think<00:04:52.280> this<00:04:52.400> could<00:04:52.580> be<00:04:52.610> rectified<00:04:53.000> by<00:04:53.210> once

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
think this could be rectified by once

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.000 
think this could be rectified by once
again<00:04:53.660> making<00:04:54.050> the<00:04:54.290> batter<00:04:54.470> a<00:04:54.680> little<00:04:54.800> bit

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
again making the batter a little bit

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.680 
again making the batter a little bit
thicker<00:04:55.280> when<00:04:55.970> it's<00:04:56.090> thinner<00:04:56.330> it<00:04:56.450> doesn't

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
thicker when it's thinner it doesn't

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.210 
thicker when it's thinner it doesn't
separate<00:04:57.080> as<00:04:57.200> you<00:04:57.320> could<00:04:57.440> also<00:04:57.620> see<00:04:57.980> there's

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
separate as you could also see there's

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.300 
separate as you could also see there's
some<00:04:58.400> extra<00:04:59.150> material<00:04:59.720> left<00:05:00.560> on<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.890> bpa-free

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
some extra material left on the bpa-free

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.090 
some extra material left on the bpa-free
sheet<00:05:02.180> now<00:05:02.420> these<00:05:02.630> sheets<00:05:02.930> are<00:05:03.080> made<00:05:03.260> of<00:05:03.470> PPR

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
sheet now these sheets are made of PPR

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.880 
sheet now these sheets are made of PPR
polypropylene<00:05:04.730> so<00:05:05.600> this<00:05:05.750> is<00:05:05.960> you<00:05:06.500> know<00:05:06.590> once

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
polypropylene so this is you know once

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.580 
polypropylene so this is you know once
again<00:05:07.010> a<00:05:07.400> type<00:05:07.700> of<00:05:07.730> plastic<00:05:08.120> let<00:05:09.050> next<00:05:09.290> let's

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
again a type of plastic let next let's

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.320 
again a type of plastic let next let's
take<00:05:09.800> a<00:05:09.830> look<00:05:10.070> at<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.520> tray<00:05:10.820> that<00:05:10.970> has<00:05:11.150> the

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
take a look at the tray that has the

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.900 
take a look at the tray that has the
Prima<00:05:11.600> flex<00:05:11.840> sheets<00:05:12.080> on<00:05:12.260> it<00:05:12.290> and<00:05:12.760> here<00:05:13.760> it<00:05:13.850> is

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
Prima flex sheets on it and here it is

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.520 
Prima flex sheets on it and here it is
and<00:05:14.180> as<00:05:14.270> you<00:05:14.300> can<00:05:14.540> see<00:05:14.600> these<00:05:15.050> are<00:05:15.230> just<00:05:15.380> an

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
and as you can see these are just an

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.070 
and as you can see these are just an
easy<00:05:15.830> release<00:05:16.310> they<00:05:17.090> come<00:05:17.330> off<00:05:17.510> nice<00:05:17.750> and<00:05:17.780> easy

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
easy release they come off nice and easy

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.860 
easy release they come off nice and easy
and<00:05:18.350> there's<00:05:18.470> barely<00:05:18.680> any<00:05:19.270> residue<00:05:20.270> left<00:05:20.600> on

the<00:05:21.170> regular<00:05:21.880> non-stick<00:05:22.880> sheets<00:05:22.910> so<00:05:23.510> there

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
the regular non-stick sheets so there

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.810 
the regular non-stick sheets so there
are<00:05:23.780> no<00:05:23.990> non-stick<00:05:24.950> sheets<00:05:24.980> that<00:05:25.370> directly

are no non-stick sheets that directly

are no non-stick sheets that directly
fit<00:05:26.120> the<00:05:26.270> Sedona<00:05:26.660> dehydrator<00:05:26.900> but<00:05:27.410> what<00:05:27.530> you

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
fit the Sedona dehydrator but what you

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.280 
fit the Sedona dehydrator but what you
can<00:05:27.920> do<00:05:28.190> is<00:05:28.340> order<00:05:28.670> the<00:05:28.700> standard<00:05:29.120> Prima<00:05:30.050> flex

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
can do is order the standard Prima flex

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.750 
can do is order the standard Prima flex
sheets<00:05:30.530> that<00:05:30.680> fit<00:05:30.890> the<00:05:31.070> excalibur<00:05:31.730> dehydrator

sheets that fit the excalibur dehydrator

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.340 
sheets that fit the excalibur dehydrator
and<00:05:32.360> then<00:05:32.480> you're<00:05:32.570> going<00:05:32.690> to<00:05:32.750> trim<00:05:32.990> off<00:05:33.020> one

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
and then you're going to trim off one

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.830 
and then you're going to trim off one
edge<00:05:33.620> so<00:05:34.370> that<00:05:34.520> it'll<00:05:34.670> it'll<00:05:35.060> fit<00:05:35.330> perfectly

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840

nonstick Prima flex sheets worked much

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.550 
nonstick Prima flex sheets worked much
better<00:05:42.770> than<00:05:43.520> the<00:05:43.730> bpa-free<00:05:44.390> sheets<00:05:45.170> but<00:05:45.410> you

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
better than the bpa-free sheets but you

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.830 
better than the bpa-free sheets but you
know<00:05:45.680> what<00:05:45.860> these<00:05:46.130> actually<00:05:46.640> performed<00:05:47.210> quite

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
know what these actually performed quite

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.660 
know what these actually performed quite
well<00:05:47.900> and<00:05:48.260> I'm<00:05:48.380> quite<00:05:48.650> happy<00:05:48.710> with<00:05:49.250> how<00:05:49.460> they

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
well and I'm quite happy with how they

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.670 
well and I'm quite happy with how they
did<00:05:49.880> now<00:05:50.060> once<00:05:50.720> again<00:05:50.960> you<00:05:51.080> need<00:05:51.260> to<00:05:51.320> keep<00:05:51.560> in

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
did now once again you need to keep in

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.260 
did now once again you need to keep in
mind<00:05:51.860> that<00:05:52.100> these<00:05:52.220> are<00:05:52.280> not<00:05:52.640> going<00:05:52.790> to<00:05:52.880> work<00:05:53.060> as

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
mind that these are not going to work as

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.350 
mind that these are not going to work as
good<00:05:53.840> as<00:05:54.080> the<00:05:54.590> non-stick<00:05:55.220> sheets<00:05:55.250> the<00:05:56.000> Prima

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
good as the non-stick sheets the Prima

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.210 
good as the non-stick sheets the Prima
flex<00:05:56.600> sheets<00:05:56.900> or<00:05:57.080> the<00:05:57.110> Teflon<00:05:57.620> coated<00:05:58.010> sheets

flex sheets or the Teflon coated sheets

flex sheets or the Teflon coated sheets
but<00:05:58.910> once<00:05:59.090> again<00:05:59.210> these<00:05:59.540> don't<00:05:59.930> have<00:06:00.110> the

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
but once again these don't have the

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.100 
but once again these don't have the
Teflon<00:06:00.770> so<00:06:01.070> if<00:06:01.310> having<00:06:02.030> some<00:06:02.360> Teflon<00:06:02.840> in

contact<00:06:03.980> with<00:06:04.070> your<00:06:04.190> food<00:06:04.370> bothers<00:06:04.850> you<00:06:05.030> then

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
contact with your food bothers you then

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.240 
contact with your food bothers you then
by<00:06:05.420> all<00:06:05.450> means<00:06:05.900> go<00:06:06.200> with<00:06:06.320> this<00:06:06.470> but<00:06:06.770> be<00:06:07.160> aware

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
by all means go with this but be aware

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.100 
by all means go with this but be aware
that<00:06:07.430> you're<00:06:07.760> not<00:06:07.940> going<00:06:08.090> to<00:06:08.180> get<00:06:08.300> exactly<00:06:08.930> the

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
that you're not going to get exactly the

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.320 
that you're not going to get exactly the
same<00:06:09.320> performance<00:06:09.650> but<00:06:10.400> I<00:06:10.430> do<00:06:10.550> believe<00:06:10.820> this

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
same performance but I do believe this

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.740 
same performance but I do believe this
is<00:06:11.540> acceptable<00:06:12.640> so<00:06:13.640> that'll<00:06:13.970> do<00:06:14.150> it<00:06:14.300> and<00:06:14.510> hope

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
is acceptable so that'll do it and hope

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.540 
is acceptable so that'll do it and hope

to try best bpa-free sheets work in a

to try best bpa-free sheets work in a
real<00:06:19.850> world<00:06:20.090> situation<00:06:20.720> now<00:06:20.810> once<00:06:21.020> again<00:06:21.170> we

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
real world situation now once again we

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.790 
real world situation now once again we
did<00:06:21.650> do<00:06:21.890> chia<00:06:22.850> seed<00:06:23.210> crackers<00:06:23.570> which<00:06:24.500> you<00:06:24.710> know

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
did do chia seed crackers which you know

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.530 
did do chia seed crackers which you know
because<00:06:24.950> of<00:06:25.220> the<00:06:25.250> oils<00:06:25.760> in<00:06:25.940> the<00:06:26.060> chia<00:06:26.330> seeds

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
because of the oils in the chia seeds

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.880 
because of the oils in the chia seeds
will<00:06:26.720> release<00:06:26.990> a<00:06:27.020> little<00:06:27.200> bit<00:06:27.290> easier<00:06:27.710> than

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:27.890 
will release a little bit easier than

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.040 
will release a little bit easier than
something<00:06:28.130> like<00:06:28.400> fruit<00:06:29.120> roll-ups<00:06:29.390> which<00:06:29.750> may

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
something like fruit roll-ups which may

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.340 
something like fruit roll-ups which may
not<00:06:30.200> release<00:06:30.650> as<00:06:30.980> easily<00:06:31.700> but<00:06:32.090> I<00:06:32.330> believe<00:06:32.750> they

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
not release as easily but I believe they

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.860 
not release as easily but I believe they
do<00:06:33.410> work<00:06:33.770> to<00:06:34.070> a<00:06:34.100> point<00:06:34.910> and<00:06:35.210> they<00:06:35.270> work<00:06:35.450> fairly

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
do work to a point and they work fairly

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.630 
do work to a point and they work fairly
good<00:06:36.020> but<00:06:36.169> if<00:06:36.260> you're<00:06:36.380> expecting<00:06:36.470> them<00:06:37.460> to

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:37.640 
good but if you're expecting them to

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.490 
good but if you're expecting them to
work<00:06:37.820> exactly<00:06:38.090> like<00:06:38.660> and<00:06:38.900> as<00:06:39.050> good

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
work exactly like and as good

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.910 
work exactly like and as good
as<00:06:39.590> the<00:06:40.370> you<00:06:40.760> know<00:06:40.880> teflon-coated<00:06:41.680> prima<00:06:42.680> flex

sheets you got another thing coming so

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.810 
sheets you got another thing coming so
keep<00:06:45.080> in<00:06:45.200> mind<00:06:45.230> they<00:06:45.530> are<00:06:45.740> BPA<00:06:46.100> free<00:06:46.370> and

keep in mind they are BPA free and
Teflon<00:06:47.690> free<00:06:48.020> but<00:06:48.650> they<00:06:48.830> don't<00:06:49.010> quite<00:06:49.280> work

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
Teflon free but they don't quite work

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.820 
Teflon free but they don't quite work
just<00:06:50.150> as<00:06:50.330> well<00:06:50.360> the<00:06:50.870> good<00:06:51.050> thing<00:06:51.260> about<00:06:51.290> it<00:06:51.680> all

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
just as well the good thing about it all

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.200 
just as well the good thing about it all
is<00:06:51.980> that<00:06:52.010> now<00:06:52.280> you<00:06:52.340> have<00:06:52.520> a<00:06:52.580> choice<00:06:52.850> you<00:06:53.090> get

is that now you have a choice you get

the BPA free sheets for your Sedona
dehydrator<00:06:56.360> or<00:06:56.900> you<00:06:57.200> could<00:06:57.350> get<00:06:57.410> the<00:06:57.590> de<00:06:57.800> facto
