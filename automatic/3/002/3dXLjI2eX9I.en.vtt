can find around the house is basically

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.329 
can find around the house is basically
what<00:00:31.369> makes<00:00:31.550> up<00:00:31.699> our<00:00:31.820> Park<00:00:32.379> so<00:00:33.379> I<00:00:33.410> guess<00:00:33.860> we're

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:34.339 
what makes up our Park so I guess we're

00:00:34.339 --> 00:01:14.560 
what makes up our Park so I guess we're
gonna<00:00:34.460> start<00:00:34.760> with<00:00:34.850> the<00:00:34.970> back<00:01:13.420> you<00:01:14.420> can<00:01:14.509> see

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
gonna start with the back you can see

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.539 
gonna start with the back you can see
they<00:01:15.500> have<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.890> holes<00:01:16.100> all<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.369> way<00:01:16.460> around

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
they have the holes all the way around

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.249 
they have the holes all the way around
which<00:01:16.970> means<00:01:17.180> they<00:01:17.330> won't<00:01:17.450> move<00:01:17.689> as<00:01:17.900> much<00:01:18.080> you

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
which means they won't move as much you

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:19.870 
which means they won't move as much you
can't<00:01:18.470> really<00:01:18.710> throw<00:01:18.890> any<00:01:19.190> curveballs<00:01:19.700> or

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.770 
can't really throw any curveballs or
stuff<00:01:20.120> like<00:01:20.300> that<00:01:20.480> with<00:01:20.660> them<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.610> then<00:01:22.780> have

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
these two bats they're basically the

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.740 
these two bats they're basically the
same<00:02:00.740> one<00:02:01.729> had<00:02:02.030> a<00:02:02.060> hole<00:02:02.299> in<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.479> so<00:02:02.630> we<00:02:02.720> just

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
same one had a hole in it so we just

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
same one had a hole in it so we just
tape<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.170> up<00:02:04.810> these<00:02:05.810> are<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:06.110> bats<00:02:06.290> that<00:02:06.530> we

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
tape it up these are the bats that we

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.419 
tape it up these are the bats that we
use<00:02:06.979> for<00:02:07.250> games<00:02:07.899> they're<00:02:08.979> mildly<00:02:09.979> sturdy

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
use for games they're mildly sturdy

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.949 
use for games they're mildly sturdy
they're<00:02:10.670> not<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:10.970> best<00:02:11.150> I<00:02:11.569> won't<00:02:11.750> say<00:02:11.930> that

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
they're not the best I won't say that

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.440 
they're not the best I won't say that
but<00:02:12.440> they're<00:02:13.250> actually<00:02:13.610> good<00:02:13.790> for<00:02:13.970> our<00:02:14.120> park

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
but they're actually good for our park

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.880 
but they're actually good for our park
considering<00:02:15.049> ours<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.379> more<00:02:15.590> of<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.709> hitter

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
considering ours is more of a hitter

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.520 
considering ours is more of a hitter
park<00:02:16.220> as<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.150> can<00:02:17.330> see<00:02:17.510> there<00:02:17.750> we'd<00:02:18.319> four

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
park as you can see there we'd four

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.480 
park as you can see there we'd four
dimensions<00:02:18.980> later<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.459> such<00:02:20.170> we<00:02:21.170> have

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
dimensions later and such we have

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.570 
dimensions later and such we have
this<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.600> like<00:02:23.780> four<00:02:24.470> games<00:02:24.740> this<00:02:25.130> bat<00:02:25.340> would

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
this is like four games this bat would

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.160 
this is like four games this bat would
be<00:02:25.700> like<00:02:25.850> our<00:02:25.970> last<00:02:26.270> resort<00:02:26.510> because<00:02:26.870> it's<00:02:27.050> got

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
be like our last resort because it's got

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.560 
be like our last resort because it's got
a<00:02:27.200> big<00:02:27.440> crack<00:02:27.470> right<00:02:27.980> here<00:02:28.210> but<00:02:29.210> it's<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.450> same

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
a big crack right here but it's the same

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.230 
a big crack right here but it's the same
size<00:02:30.020> these<00:02:30.500> two<00:02:30.830> so<00:02:31.100> if<00:02:31.310> we<00:02:31.580> needed<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:32.060> play<00:02:32.210> a

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
size these two so if we needed to play a

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:49.030 
size these two so if we needed to play a
game<00:02:32.540> those<00:02:33.380> bats<00:02:47.200> we<00:02:48.200> didn't<00:02:48.500> use<00:02:48.590> this<00:02:48.770> bat

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
game those bats we didn't use this bat

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.300 
game those bats we didn't use this bat
last<00:02:49.340> year<00:02:50.110> our<00:02:51.110> Park<00:02:51.440> didn't<00:02:51.890> look<00:02:51.950> anything

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
last year our Park didn't look anything

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.640 
last year our Park didn't look anything
like<00:02:52.520> it<00:02:52.790> does<00:02:52.970> now<00:02:53.210> it<00:02:53.510> was<00:02:53.660> completely

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
like it does now it was completely

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.530 
like it does now it was completely
different<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.790> was<00:02:55.970> much<00:02:56.180> more<00:02:56.390> of<00:02:56.450> a

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
different it was much more of a

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:04.710 
different it was much more of a
pitcher's<00:02:56.870> Park<00:02:56.900> so<00:02:57.350> we<00:02:57.380> used<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.710> bigger<00:02:57.890> bat

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.060 

basically<00:03:05.720> our<00:03:06.020> bases<00:03:06.440> you<00:03:06.560> can<00:03:06.710> just<00:03:06.860> find

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
basically our bases you can just find

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.960 
basically our bases you can just find
anywhere<00:03:07.550> this<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:10.190> it<00:03:10.280> works<00:03:10.430> perfectly<00:03:10.820> as

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
anywhere this and it works perfectly as

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.660 
anywhere this and it works perfectly as
a<00:03:11.000> home<00:03:11.210> plate<00:03:11.510> is<00:03:11.720> it<00:03:12.320> lines<00:03:12.980> up<00:03:13.220> with<00:03:13.520> our

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
a home plate is it lines up with our
