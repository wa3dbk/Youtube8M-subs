00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 ae 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.419
 and look at the sun, how will the 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.970
 cases where I was here but I remember 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:29.060
 recommended to be here today and see a 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.640
 dominich gameplay site where it was that 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.280
 we sent a lot of the victory but not 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.280
 I was talking about a top that is 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.190
 basically tips here for the cause of 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.260
 ask and I was talking about how to be a 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.780
 player is not to know the 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.489
 players that you see but as I think 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.420
 I must throw at least one name here 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.309
 nation will climb in blitz must arrive from 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.140
 a slightly more aggressive and 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.359
 Let's talk about this, you were not. 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.620
 here to see a boy was not playing with 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:02.870
 this mg again game gives is that sng 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.410
 by constriction with you I thought very 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.170
 small 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.090
 smg is one of the very weapons away from here 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.789
 land and you will see here in this time 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.570
 it was basically that I will be playing 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:19.009
 aggressively I will not be doing 11 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:22.009
 two more wii- type breaks and stay there 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.319
 see saved no one will kill me and they will stay 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.390
 waiting for the enemy to come in 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.959
 I do not think it's the way 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.459
 ideal for you to play nor domination 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:38.869
 with the map the forum montijo that is 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:41.330
 for example 10 should not camp and 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.280
 let a player will not camp but 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.259
 help a little more defensive and leave 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.539
 base commented the player to do nobody 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.429
 want to help you must have three 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.920
 players making a macro control 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.509
 ideal and a player to present 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.830
 witnesses that people put 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.140
 three other people can also 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.679
 eventually the katz 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.780
 we do not have players especially 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.399
 to have these covers but basically it is 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.640
 that in this field in watson chances will 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:13.280
 involve being to make your choices 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:15.410
 but 12 mix has always of the sporting and 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.970
 try to make some hash in the 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.190
 enemies because they did not vote 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.049
 I hope to win again if 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.239
 offered already know ourselves can 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.970
 Are you going to be anything of the sort? 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.070
 But you are 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.100
 What will happen is that you will have 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.350
 a control mac control map will start 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.780
 walking 15 Mandaqui rivers and is unique 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.660
 You're going to end up finding a 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.510
 map that will let the team find and 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.610
 completely without hypothesis but I commented 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.860
 I only came here today with one more 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.760
 vehicle and commented on a comment 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.730
 tiny 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.060
 I'm just going to explain this is also for 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.480
 explain perhaps that is often 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.670
 they should make the kind of kits and stay 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.670
 It's kind of right. 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.470
 these two caption angus in me do not have 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.560
 It can come off easily. I do not think so. 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.350
 works ie even if they have the acrid 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.150
 two years ago there is 1 creek a game of erc 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.160
 is a central player and take control 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.760
 very offensive even this kind of 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.230
 player 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.450
 I think it must have been that they were 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.220
 here at least in this role of 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.440
 goal always worked so slightly more 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.450
 The most aggressive game is that it ends up 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.980
 be more talk extensively basically 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.780
 kind of staff 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.470
 As I said, you were the video like that. 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.470
 very small next I hope to have 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.690
 liked this your usual feedback 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.690
 basically I just went 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:51.980
 in exchange where the light equals the pierre 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.980
