00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.710
 his paws then initial menu here at 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.590
 load and without starting the post because 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.410
 that otherwise there is no access it allows 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:22.920
 to activate so the connection mode 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:26.070
 sub special pioneer this is what makes 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.160
 that's going to turn off the fader mode a 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.599
 once the post is on 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:36.630
 so here is enough to turn on the post 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:39.840
 now and it's active and so 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.530
 now the back part out 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.690
 audio sends on the south with a 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.690
 branch a little chelou 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.030
 besides, he is where and where we have both 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.399
 less than they go on the less this of the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:02.609
 boomer she's over here and the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.880
 remains basic totally basic 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:10.140
 so here we talk on both ways put 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.740
 to larache to test on the menu on 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.040
 do not forget then there the normal menu the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.600
 normal mode or dream following the 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:25.159
 so use in audio menu on 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.159
 can cut the frequencies too 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.979
 this is 825 hertz suddenly it does not happen anymore 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.930
 for the caisson and we can do it for 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:43.930
 to see them for once this is not the 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.649
 little boost little boost is here huh 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.540
 must be for the cutoff slope 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.710
 maybe - 6 - 12 db it's not too much 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.229
 explain on the doc 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.159
 then part of the small cable 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:02.080
 oddly branching that comes on the 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:05.369
 south behind basic with a branch 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.940
 domino not to do obviously 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.940
 and it works 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.030
 here
