00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:14.719
 Today I show you mine 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:14.719
 Of course my group is also a building 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:28.310
 All in all I have seven tines and yes 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:35.030
 I attached that to my back 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:36.860
 hydraulics or my home here I am 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.930
 Of course I can lift all of this 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:52.250
 and lower the whole time now a piece 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:55.730
 high in the air it is the land 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:02.450
 course to drive up to 15 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:05.050
 centimeters from the ground arrived am 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.240
 This is natural and natural 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.789
 works great next time 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.270
 I'll show you then a video about it well 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:17.570
 the whole in action is yes who it 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.649
 wants to do it can make it is like 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.740
 rather simple front and rear 24 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:27.350
 control with the crosses 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.659
 so that the whole does not distort then 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:35.570
 hold the suspension here to the tractor 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:40.310
 I just hang a cylinder 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:43.520
 set the height then it happened 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.170
 I made two things myself 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.150
 millimeter thick sheet steel that is 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.490
 Cut out to the appropriate size 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:59.420
 Of course it works very well 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.280

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.840
