00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
and here we had the pipe side before

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.330 
and here we had the pipe side before
those<00:01:00.510> two<00:01:00.660> modifications<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.590> here<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.220> is

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
those two modifications and here it is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.740

after<00:01:04.640> now<00:01:05.640> let's<00:01:05.790> move<00:01:05.909> up<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.300> swing<00:01:06.540> arm

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
after now let's move up to the swing arm

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.480 
after now let's move up to the swing arm
and<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:06.990> swing<00:01:07.170> arm<00:01:07.320> pivot<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.250> what<00:01:08.400> it

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
and the swing arm pivot this is what it

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.550 
and the swing arm pivot this is what it
looks<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.759> stock<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.869> really<00:01:10.110> dark<00:01:10.290> back

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
looks like stock it's really dark back

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.310 
looks like stock it's really dark back
inside<00:01:10.950> there<00:01:11.270> you<00:01:12.270> had<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.420> couple<00:01:12.630> pieces<00:01:12.869> and

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
inside there you had a couple pieces and

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.310 
inside there you had a couple pieces and
boom<00:01:13.770> there<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.460> shines<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.869> hard<00:01:16.050> to<00:01:16.140> see

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
boom there it shines it's hard to see

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.690 
boom there it shines it's hard to see
but<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> swing<00:01:16.890> arm<00:01:17.040> covered<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.490> looks

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
but the swing arm covered really looks

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.380 
but the swing arm covered really looks
good<00:01:17.910> back<00:01:18.150> behind<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.600> pipe<00:01:18.810> take<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> look

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
good back behind the pipe take a look

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.730 
good back behind the pipe take a look
with<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.450> absence<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.050> pipes<00:01:22.289> on<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.560> other

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
side the swing arm and driveshaft

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.139 
side the swing arm and driveshaft
transformation<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.380> awesome<00:01:25.950> here's<00:01:26.880> what<00:01:27.030> it
