00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.820
 Milan 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.800
 king of Japanese manga and initiator of 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.629
 all that the shows are in today 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.489
 dragon ball is a name that is practically 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.559
 impossible to never have heard the 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.360
 nowadays will also be passed e 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.260
 he was honest when his chapters came out 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.850
 weekly 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.159
 but the fanbase of the opera magna 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.780
 toriyama never fell and the brand is 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.030
 still a chicken with golden eggs 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.559
 given his unwavering strength it seems 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.149
 incredible that it didn't turn out a 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.699
 indecent video dedicated to the series 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.440
 from tenkaichi three fans never have 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.000
 stopped praising that game as ad 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.399
 example to inspire to create a 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.619
 product worthy of their money that 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.030
 even the Japanese developers seem 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.590
 no longer able to reproduce 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.200
 something equally cared for and 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.789
 fun for some time however the 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.229
 hopes of the dragon ball fan page 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.479
 they rekindled stronger than ever 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.670
 thanks to a title developed by the deans 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.619
 of name dragon ball xero towards one 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.110
 scopiazzatura time we think of you 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.820
 but you are mistaken because xenon 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.800
 versa is a video game different from everything 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.420
 what the series has offered so far e 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.210
 seems to want to stand on the top of the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.530
 mount thanks to its comedy 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.540
 let them start to stand out from the 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.430
 his predecessors instantly with one 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.140
 baby carriage showing the dragon epic 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.000
 ball completely transformed to be able 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.890
 unknown with the heroes we have learned 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.689
 to love in the brutalized years of the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.030
 main antagonists of the series without 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.310
 apparent reason is a desperate trans 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.259
 that to save goats and cabbages decides to 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.000
 turn to dragon share by formulating a 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.250
 desire as simple as it is clever 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.110
 warrior strong enough to save the 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.180
 time to that warrior you will have to 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.009
 obviously give life to you thanks to the menu 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.689
 of creating the character he leaves 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.829
 quickly guess the complexity of the 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.500
 game in front of us 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.570
 the choice is between five breeds divided between 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.670
 the clan of human fizzing sawyer ship 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.440
 cyans and images is not just about 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.209
 aesthetic changes but true and 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.670
 own starting bases recommended for 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.350
 particular bild the original characters 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.570
 of the planet from mac for example are 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.730
 debolucci hand much energy attacks 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.100
 powerful and extremely fast 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.660
 while sayan have few life points there 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.400
 I cover their weaknesses with the 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.290
 Higher damage potential than the game 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.549
 these characteristics are not however 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.290
 thrown to the wind 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.150
 as a dragon is more than one 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.160
 sort of gdr that a real beat'em e 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.400
 just where the main purpose and 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.319
 complete a long one 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.120
 spain that spans the entire history of 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.470
 dragon ball z enhancing e 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.720
 customizing your alter ego 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.459
 mission after mission better enter 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.680
 in detail starting right from the 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.420
 campaign just mentioned the story mode of 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.370
 dragon ball xenon towards and long-lived ed 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.599
 exciting and will see them engaged in 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.519
 fight against some mysterious ones 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.620
 individuals to restore order in 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.909
 various timelines where cattivoni 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.250
 of the saga have been enhanced 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.750
 magically to give a hard time 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.819
 to the heroes who in the past had them 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.010
 defeated the number of missions is 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.420
 commendable and xvi rovers succeeds big time 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.129
 to transport the player to the world 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.420
 created by torriglia but making it 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.980
 relive some of the most moments 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.269
 unforgettable of the manga da co 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.950
 protagonist 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.629
 of course there are non-inconsistencies 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.849
 indifferent but not too much effort 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.920
 to leave aside while you bot with 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.629
 bus or face vegeta and rafa after 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.549
 their arrival on earth 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.769
 besides these nations stories then there 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.329
 they are a flood of secondary tasks 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.170
 designed to get technical experience 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.780
 and various objects 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.250
 already because customization is a 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.230
 another very important element in this 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.120
 game to the point that your character 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.620
 will not only be modified with 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.930
 targeted increases in its characteristics 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.120
 but his fighting style will depend 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.440
 exclusively from your choices 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.660
 you want to create a super sayan with lo 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.440
 same mosley vegeta you can do it without 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.000
 problems 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.859
 provided that he unlocks his techniques e 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.840
 to advance sufficiently in the campaign 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.400
 you want to fight with a super 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.440
 idiot who destroys enemies by dint of 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.690
 posed plastic ballets and absurd powers 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.549
 nothing has precluded an interesting one from you 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.109
 mentor system included in the title 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.519
 it even guarantees to get almost 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.440
 all the most famous moves of the warriors 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.090
 of the saga with lots of missions 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.900
 dedicated and super moved by the damage 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.489
 increased 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.229
 in short, the basic idea works 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.729
 great and it takes little to do 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:15.470
 take from the whirlwind of attacks e 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:17.659
 character customization 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.459
 though novels is not a title without 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:21.859
 structurally defects has 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.270
 characteristics marked by mmo contact 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.580
 cooperative online multiplayer e 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.349
 competitive and these elements carry the 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.479
 game to have some marked weaknesses 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:31.159
 first of all the cooperative that has 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.720
 obliged developers to calculate 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:34.880
 certain missions around groups of 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.830
 players a situation that makes the 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.659
 difficulty rather than dancer and then 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.280
 transform performs designed as a face 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:42.110
 you fight in hell if you face it in 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.940
 single accompanied by deficiency 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.740
 game-friendly artificial intelligence 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.020
 the competitive then is immensely 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.020
 unbalanced until the venue is played 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.699
 with friends 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.560
 they are big problems since they are used 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.080
 mainly the pre-existing characters 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.940
 of the series and roster and very nutritious the 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.740
 problem becomes evident only when there 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.479
 he throws himself into matches rehn asks and yes 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.190
 discovers that there are some 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.870
 absolutely skill combinations 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.550
 crazy or potentially i 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.979
 passive that favor mass spam 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.750
 brutal other little problem is related to 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.580
 farming that is an integral part of 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.229
 INPS title to get the myriad 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.759
 of techniques and objects present there 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.009
 they want dozens and dozens of hours 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:19.020
 game and will be necessary in some cases and 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.979
 repeat certain missions to make your own 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.080
 in certain abilities 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.120
 however, the software house did 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.770
 smart and changed the quests in a way 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.229
 to activate certain drops only when 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.639
 some conditions are met 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.889
 for example if you want one 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.539
 specific kicking animals does not suffice 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.550
 defeat him in the specific vision 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.620
 you will have to eliminate the other sawyers first 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.449
 in a specific order and then wait 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.680
 that says certain beats in combat 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:43.620
 because within object price 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.110
 desired increase a pretty confining idea 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.759
 very repetition cut on 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.159
 combat system instead we have little to 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:51.840
 recriminate is true and wood said not 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:54.240
 prevents spam and does not have the 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.130
 precision of standing aic never complex 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.810
 allows you to perform perfect saves 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.699
 sudden dodges dependent on one 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.830
 force bar with variable 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.240
 attacks from distance on to shoot 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.460
 and interruption of combinations 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.930
 opponents there are many mechanics from 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.550
 master already in the breast vers 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.539
 and the ability to customize the 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.159
 own style does nothing but add 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:12.659
 points to the clashes 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:14.940
 technically we find ourselves in front of a 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:16.770
 crossgen title and unfortunately yes 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.020
 see but xeno vers is not anyway 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.460
 terribly graphically 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.199
 masking polygonal poverty thanks 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.880
 to cell shading the options of 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:25.889
 customization of faces are not 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.779
 many, yet they allow you to create 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:29.880
 unique and style-appropriate characters 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:31.620
 of the manga and the settings result 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.380
 rather varied despite a quality 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.969
 visual bassina careful though if you have not 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.639
 a current generation console on 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:40.229
 it seems to play on ps3 and xbox 360 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.330
 there are occasional drops of 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:43.949
 rather serious framerates 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.150
 not that we care that much anyway 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:47.729
 when there is such a godly thing 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:50.250
 content to enjoy the countryside 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:51.690
 the only one can last more than 15 hours also a 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.400
 due to final levels with peaks of 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.690
 difficulties that require developing 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.540
 your hero's duty to be 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.940
 exceeded without 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.770
 overhangs and between multiplayer enormity of 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.450
 technical objects and secondary missions 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.740
 we are in front of a video game capable of
