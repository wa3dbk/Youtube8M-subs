00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.920
 not if you are always a funny 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.920
 that question must ask but what if you say 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:11.249
 ability 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:12.719
 rhenen 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.469
 rita of them 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.699
 take to or as you always have 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.839
 no not at all one I do not know if that is true that is also completely 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:23.199
 not me but me 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:24.669
 I think when I 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.869
 16 and 16 was or something 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.619
 then if you then i saw you i saw certain artist on the un 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.430
 then you notice that you have something 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.650
 that you do something or something how should you then pit lane and then it was not over yet 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.330
 t fence 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.680
 I can do that and that's why I really enjoyed it 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.860
 but i also thought jacobs may is not for me at all with the 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.670
 Topicality because it took its legs later I saw people who were also there 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.180
 stood completely unrelated to current events 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.160
 and then thought then I thought maybe 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.740
 is that reserved for me? 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.270
 And then when I was nineteen I decided to do it myself 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.560
 in the angel box 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.090
 to do fifteen minutes there 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.630
 well say why I do this you tour something 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.920
 something like that is what you want but had fallen but I don't believe that there was 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.000
 a decision is the moment 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.800
 tim vos me that is a development 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.800
 sordo realize that slowly 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.180
 you fall apart slowly one day 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.180
 I think you can do it yourself and if you do it 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.940
 and get the confirmation 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.520
 or maybe not 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.760
 that I then think of all those at my 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.760
 then you should also not be able to get long-term assistance on a chair 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.630
 get the directions 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.200
 so not specifically directly on stage that it is a very very very direct 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.990
 what for themselves but that you for example do not always succeed troops 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.640
 noted that they don't work better I don't believe the best 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.909
 set up cabertiers 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.700
 the area is that there are people out there 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.009
 but by definition being funny I believed that people are feeling 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.190
 those who feel this form suit me 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.950
 This is the day buses full of people 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.060
 and they speak as if it is one person 12 are more people that is a form 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.009
 That 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.009
 that is a way I would like to communicate 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:20.489
 at a given moment you feel that abstract feeling that you never do 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.059
 have thought of 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.319
 I think I can make that choice now 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.649
 what was the much larger requirement 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:29.450
 a pity that 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.039
 that is still going on now 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.199
 I mean I still have it now 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:36.639
 Well the feeling of should I do this I am good 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.459
 just interesting enough 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.479
 or fits me 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:42.559
 increasingly 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:46.379
 my whole life ranks to give up because even after and that starts in after 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.939
 appearance earlier 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.939
 the school must be not doing your homework 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:53.529
 have the feeling of everything 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:54.669
 the coming 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:56.349
 the day is coming 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.779
 on which proof is provided that it may not need or that 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:03.359
 those kind of little things but it would also talk a lot what keeps it up 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:04.250
 be different 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.250
 doing that is i know in the comedy field 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:10.919
 no but i think just like for comedy 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:13.979
 just like with comedy for almost all others 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:16.679
 Occupations also call you money 

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:18.819
 that it feels normal on a ship 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.229
 one that it's a pretty abstract 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:23.369
 abstract given
