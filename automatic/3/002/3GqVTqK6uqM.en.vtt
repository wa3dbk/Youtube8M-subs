00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 hi in this video he talked about a 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.350
 product that has a really high price and 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.230
 I invite you to test if you have not 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.389
 still tested it is the pencils 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.269
 for lips that replace or e 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.080
 lipstick or gloss in this case 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.750
 we have a specimen for each species 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.300
 here we have the pencil lip gloss by 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.680
 kiko that I have in three colors but I have 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.369
 find only two so there 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.869
 we will be content with these two which are the 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.930
 015 that this one in his hand 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.850
 first it looks like a ruby ​​red with del 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.430
 macro glitter 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.180
 obviously nothing more false and half the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.860
 7 which instead is a very pale rose that 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.100
 obviously you can't see but 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.160
 it doesn't matter if you trust me instead 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.379
 transparent little little colored but 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.489
 too much a thing far away moment instead 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:01.109
 like real lipstick 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.830
 I've tried the nfine color that it is 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.770
 this pencils what is the color at 0 2 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:11.630
 living detail you see sees 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.360
 something I don't know anyway from that 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.380
 to the box from the tube package 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.140
 from the mine 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.790
 I don't know it looks fuchsia once it does 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.920
 roll out looks like it's more on the red rose not 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.619
 it's such a blinding color it's not a 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.720
 color that we say not all 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.500
 however, they will appreciate me frankly 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.299
 like it is not even too flashy here 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.299
 then we start with them from the pencil 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.600
 lip gloss I fell in love with it 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.750
 so much so that in a year I flew down 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.570
 quite heavily once they were 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.280
 quite longer the beautiful thing is 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.329
 that this product is not just the price 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.270
 because it seems to me that they cost 3 94 90 that 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.719
 however it is a more than reasonable price but 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.149
 also the fact that they mix together 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.549
 they mix together the brilliance of a 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.469
 gloss and duration that if not equal to 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.539
 that of a lipstick anyway 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.700
 approaches these pencil lip gloss by 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.670
 nice not only that they therefore have one 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.640
 golden 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.500
 quite good but above all not 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.450
 they disappear suddenly but tend 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.260
 first lose brilliance and then 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.590
 disappear 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.150
 anyway a new pass is enough and you are 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.160
 pretty much okay 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.540
 obviously being pencils also the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.239
 problem of having to be tempered 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.550
 so of course severe carry around and 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.360
 you have the tip 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.400
 no even tip here becomes a bit of a 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.150
 problem however I have to say that if i 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.550
 used at random however we tell you 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.590
 so you realize you have the tip almost 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.600
 undone just that temperate before 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.970
 get out and you're good to go 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.910
 personally I find them very good at 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.160
 also like a lot 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:01.260
 shine is not that they are excessive now 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:10.019
 I show you how we are put 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:13.140
 and this then in pink as you see 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.900
 it's almost here that you can't see it 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.690
 this almost no longer sees an effect 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.769
 brilliance that another red instead 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.510
 you see but it is far from the glitter that 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.329
 they are misleading ie I am not there 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.820
 i see twitter is bright yes but how 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:34.150
 the other is not bright 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.269
 very big difference indeed I would say 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.060
 that there is no difference at all though 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:47.820
 anyway this is the comparison I am 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:52.600
 very nice as a covering for pink 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.980
 we are on a 10 percent maybe red 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.489
 it covers a bit more however we are 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:02.829
 away from a lipstick so that you 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:05.470
 I say a 40 percent fifty own 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.140
 serious past several times anyway I have to 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.269
 to say that they are really good I like them 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.150
 whereas my experience with i 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.370
 kiko gloss was not very positive 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.530
 these yes I liked them instead 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.170
 but I don't know if I put them in the category 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.050
 I will think big 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:26.010
 a product that I didn't like instead 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:30.780
 this is the lipstick in the form but you 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:33.480
 toned but German from essence pencils 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.420
 is the reason is this but I do it to you 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.800
 see better in a video clip 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.800
 that I recorded last night 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.030
 this is why it is not 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.430
 I appreciate this pencil I don't know if 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.620
 you see 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.260
 here is how you see there is left 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.690
 a practically the entire tip of the 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.370
 Pencil and I went to do just one 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.190
 strip so you can imagine 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.280
 how can this pencil be? 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.490
 really so very soft and it's one 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.160
 which in general is priced but this 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.280
 Pencil is too soft too 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.630
 creamy and not creamy because I have it 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.570
 kept near a heat source 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.830
 because here I do not have for a siphon or 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.690
 calorifer inge 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.390
 I have nothing is like this in the summer and 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.310
 in winter it is an absurd thing is a 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.260
 sin because by age and even now that 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:30.050
 for example, the tip did not you come 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:32.610
 an excrescence how can I say that 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.530
 let's say it's not that I do it 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.800
 all this great pleasure to have you here 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:40.290
 the color on the other hand very nice one 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.060
 kind of raspberry I can call you 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.690
 raspberry do not know 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.930
 a pink with a hint of fuchsia but a lot 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:52.020
 far away, here is a decidedly color 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:54.810
 less a color decidedly less 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.750
 wearable of these two below however that 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:01.200
 with color that does not require occasions 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:04.350
 particularly festive to be 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.200
 put here I said the brightness is there 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.640
 because it is actually there is less 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.910
 compared to the other two because yes 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.520
 proposes to be a lipstick will think 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:18.090
 a lipsic do you think though I have to say that a 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.160
 bit of brightness there is huge huge 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.250
 immense defect is that 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:26.040
 and soft too soft so it tends to 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.960
 disappear very quickly and to do 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.900
 a light layer you have to go there that 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:33.330
 brush and I assure you it is not 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.390
 very comfortable it is already inconvenient to use it 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.890
 starting from a lipstick maybe of those 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:40.470
 with the teardrop shape starting from a 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:42.210
 in fact this is impossible 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.980
 I use the product very rarely 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.110
 only when I need this 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.030
 color I can not help it because it 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.440
 I really find a lot of clash between 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.960
 the other even when you temper it e 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:55.350
 difficult because the foil remains 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.870
 stuck between the sheet we say 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:01.020
 so of the pencil sharpener among other things 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:04.560
 specific for matic for pencils of america 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:07.470
 and no, it's really hard to do one 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:11.220
 decent tip or keep it that way with a 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:13.290
 little more tip or used 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.210
 otherwise and I can't tell you which one I can 

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.860
 be another way 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.850
 I hope this video has been there 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:24.710
 useful a kiss to the next hello finger 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:24.710
 rare dirt
