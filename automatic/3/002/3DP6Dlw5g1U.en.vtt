00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.649
 Malaga - the business sector between 

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:13.649
 let's talk a little about my work 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.970
 actually I wanted to study engineering 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.130
 industrial 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.789
 I loved it 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.599
 michael had bonis 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.339
 in it are collected more effective I wanted the road does not believe that the way 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:27.280
 after that side 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.160
 with a teacher on the subject 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.780
 that has to do with the plastic the faithful in the neck 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.650
 I had a very big taste because Welsh giggs 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.520
 and he told me that the profile of the traveler the school was like the king in which 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.730
 have the capacity to develop after the giner illustration 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.290
 did the doctors 2 pef 2010 that are examined looks for the way to enter the 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.510
 great classic because as well as the extension of the design of the unam 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.230
 and that was how it was as a species as 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.000
 I liked it a lot and to say that I still have it as theirs 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.450
 I always liked more like honesty what now 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.329
 cumaná - like all that 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:11.610
 sequel to things that I like 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.070
 certain things starting from not just letters and graphic notes and started 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.770
 with the posters explain us 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.140
 defend poor nations 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.470
 entering the enap 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.620
 Draw mpc but since she is like to draw 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.800
 cristina a style I usually do not know work - I think the 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.320
 purpose is the domestic stilton itself these processes etc 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.000
 the gallery josé maría velasco that is of the world 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.630
 I had no idea for how 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.649
 an expulsion 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.310
 collective where they could show 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.520
 the vision of each artist 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.190
 with his graphical proposal nutrition seen fusion that had to add 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.720
 a very good example because 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.110
 because with a lot of people leave that opening cell exhibition missions the 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.580
 height the invitation to intervene the facade to the gallery 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.460
 and that was like it was the first 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.950
 big intervention so to speak and with that it was like 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.799
 the case to the increasingly 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.449
 the increase up to the advertising campaign and a way of saying the 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:16.010
 things in work 2 800 points to carry as 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.029
 that confidence that I have been given to other graphic levels 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:22.029
 more luck with the great port searchers 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.619
 do not 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:29.529
 I was a charger for a while for a brand of juice greater than the one in charge of 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:33.099
 accumulate costs Latin juices in shopping centers in eu 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.349
 Ines and soldier too lazy but then there was nothing else for me in this 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.930
 Flat Compostela moment honored as 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.959
 now I think that it is something well you can live on that is valid or I do not mean 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.669
 to this because finally 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:50.459
 you bless work not as if you already sold the other August but in the end 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.979
 I say good Jose a although it is preferable that I go then this one 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:59.309
 walk by a desk 7 10 hours 15 hours doing what I do not 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:03.699
 like and when I have time then I will devote myself to painting clear that I do not know if 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:07.669
 I can live from what I know how to do and that fills me fully my family is happy 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:10.849
 Of course I'm going to do it 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.859
 efe illustrated wanted to flee 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.179
 it was not a format you do not expect how far you can simulate 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:21.329
 I think we all have something that pickets that is capable of amazing the 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.589
 The other issue is to know that and develop 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:28.749
 I what this one what people now know 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:32.429
 are the colors this type of format I've been practicing for four years 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:35.810
 years but for ten years actually I started to paint for the 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:39.599
 streets more than one of its ships the quart-loft area all this 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.859
 what were the cycles of nc 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.989
 It is still a very large choice of urban artists poggi teror 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.409
 if it is normally the same looking not because here there is a 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.280
 is typical in the calligraphy of all the people who do it and there are people 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:56.549
 they say they reach a very very 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:57.570
 if you are still you 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.770
 momo and anonymous because 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.299
 they really like london recording 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.389
 and even the judgment of each person and I do not want to lose it 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:07.389
 to what extent with those affected to third 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:12.040
 this can lead as good work 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.559
 outside the Persian country 

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:17.489
 to a mural that the cnt is in phase 4 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.539
 goes then in de citi loquillo prob lópez 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.669
 and what about the owner of your cuado charcoal buds saw him in Vancouver and he made me a 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.909
 invitation to travel to vancouver for internet 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:29.199
 does not stop your store 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.129
 I wanted to do the number shot 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:33.259
 to celebrate the one hundred thousand children that 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.389
 If I was willing to continue 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.360
 For try 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.460
 is that the doctor 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.500
 to my surprise market he sent it to said my doctor was making me 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.430
 force 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.749
 said without light 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:49.770
 for me it is still something very valuable because in Mexico there is no 

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:53.879
 a collaborator no company epsilon mexican artists who have done something 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.680
 with very different 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.529
 seven years to come 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.520
 the purpose of these 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.240
 sure them but really great format looks for the spaces as sixth with my 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.229
 own money many times to the scaffolding in order to be able to do works that 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.860
 transcend we have done when I say transcend I do not mean jae I want to be 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.870
 more than the others but transcend for me what it is that they break with 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.759
 all 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.099
 with everything I've been doing 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.169
 something very simple 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.229
 a cleaning 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.800
 doing it very well if it is not quite the opposite a path to be followed 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.079
 but if you really want to be no matter how tulum 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.520
 if you are painting making music designing any type of disciplines 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.410
 with the constancy of what is making you better than the practice 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.770
 that being in search of that clooney process I do not say it now good 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.080
 and 17 projects I will not sit down to see what happens in life but everything 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.120
 opposite more than ever I am committed to my own work 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.479
 because I want to demonstrate I want to show people that there is more inside their 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:57.439
 farm 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:00.379
 placed in national 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:01.990
 answer 5 enclosure 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.669
 like the twitter @ secret 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.810
 and to see how a little more of my work currently has been my 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.559
 stalin page that has 

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:12.639
 they wrote together but a little more 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.659
 thousands of neighbors present 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:16.280
 joseline enters the page 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.800
 I point mx set where you can find the way how they go gaal the 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.490
 greens that will be there 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.809
 giving away 

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:26.689
 the bases the page is consumed visit it in the loins of peace
