 only the dead do not care about death all her 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.380
 afraid and some people think it is 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.870
 will be either death from old age or 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.059
 attempted suicide but few 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.369
 think that in the world I am a force which 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.619
 can erase all living things in one second 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.939
 faces of the earth and if you thought about god 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.220
 I'll disappoint you 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.680
 he will not kill you instead 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.119
 mother nature meet the five most 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.340
 deadly natural phenomena father 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.759
 often said the proverb fever bones not 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.350
 ache 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.989
 it is about what is better once again 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.550
 sweat than freeze today i 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.750
 I understand why he left me and my mother 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.120
 hot mulatto 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.899
 change in atmospheric temperature by 5 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.899
 place of our top 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.739
 the greenhouse effect is now active 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.660
 discussion of an increase in the average 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.820
 planetary temperature associated with 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.160
 co2 growth result of burning 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.710
 hydrocarbon fuels coal and oil and 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.930
 gas optimistic scenario man-made 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.730
 co2 selection constant 1 doubling 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.769
 concentration after a hundred years of development 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.080
 world energy critical stage 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.869
 greenhouse catastrophe t is 50 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.720
 terminal stage t is 150 through 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.460
 six thousand years in a realistic scenario 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.619
 man-made co2 emissions will grow by those 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.630
 same pace as today and doubling 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.330
 co2 concentrations will occur 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.580
 every 50 years the critical stage will be 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.390
 reached in a hundred years and terminal 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.390
 in three hundred 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.159
 pressure is nothing good described 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.560
 this word be pressure like blackmail 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.009
 or pressure as the action of the surgeons 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.540
 hiding the chest of the patient or 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.430
 sexy woman pressure creepy 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.380
 words and at least so she had to 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.729
 be in our top pressure 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.409
 atmospheric fourth atmospheric 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.920
 pressure decreases with increasing 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.509
 heights because it is created only 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.310
 overlying atmospheric dependence 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.470
 pressure from height are described so 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.869
 called the barometric formula this 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.789
 highly volatile element of his 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.890
 the definition follows that it depends on 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.170
 the height of the corresponding air column 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.660
 its density from acceleration of gravity 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.000
 which varies from the latitude of the place and 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.860
 altitude uncontrolled 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.049
 decompression is one of the possible 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.940
 deadly hazards this is unexpected 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.410
 closed air pressure drop 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.780
 volume for example due to 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.850
 depressurization of the cabin if 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.010
 pressure drop rate is higher than 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.810
 the rate of air from the lungs then it 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.810
 a phenomenon called explosive decompression 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.220
 you know what bothers me about the story 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.630
 the world flood the fact is that on the ark 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.269
 I was and therefore survived only 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.070
 only one family several relatives 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.590
 therefore at some time 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.940
 they practiced incest because they are the same 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.600
 he managed to recover 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.000
 populations 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.040
 7 billion scum apparently in terms of 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.530
 post flood on in time to or mixing 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.609
 does not cause terrible genetic mutations 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:59.079
 and degeneration adore this book water 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:03:01.400
 flood in third place of our top 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.379
 the great flood of catastrophes 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.879
 scale legend which is widely 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.219
 prevalent in mythological 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.319
 representations of the peoples of the world and described in 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.150
 a number of religious texts representing 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.980
 a massive flood 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.079
 led to the death of almost all people 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.659
 flood flooding areas 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:20.090
 result of rising water levels in rivers and 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.670
 lakes seas due to wind rains 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.829
 coastal surge and other causes 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.239
 which damage the health of people alas 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.639
 and oh we don't own 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.829
 anaerobic respiration and in case all 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.150
 glaciers will melt and we will cover h2o 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:36.650
 most of us 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.209
 choke and get wet know what 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.169
 kills when you have for example not 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.409
 parachute opened 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:44.780
 or you fell into the elevator shaft or you 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.480
 hit on the head a huge hail in general 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:52.040
 stupidity but now this is not about gravity 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.949
 in second place is our top gravity 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.730
 attraction of world wide 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:57.709
 universal fundamental 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.169
 the interaction between all material 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.969
 bodies people usually do not even pay 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:04.549
 attention to gravity though 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:06.019
 internal organs of it without this power are unlikely 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.479
 whether would function and meanwhile 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.259
 gravity can kill you even if you 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:11.689
 slip over 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:14.120
 and fall from a height equal to your height 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:14.540
 huge amount of suicides and just 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.699
 the killers 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.220
 uses these qualities daily 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:21.400
 nature or a hole in the wall or a window 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.750
 balcony yes even the roof at the worst 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.630
 attraction is not always the result 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.280
 attraction and love of attraction can 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.539
 flatten you 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.879
 taste of oxygen from when you create it 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.219
 becomes extremely small if you do not believe 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:37.270
 can do the following experiment 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:39.430
 pull a condom over your head and 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.349
 try to breathe your girl 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.810
 so surprised that most likely 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:46.180
 you start to choke change gas 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.409
 air composition in the first place of ours 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.389
 top global composition change 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:54.669
 the earth's atmosphere occurred in the very 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.419
 proterozoic early about 200 billion 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.460
 years ago 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.469
 the result of an oxygen catastrophe was 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.719
 appearance in the atmosphere of free 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:03.909
 oxygen and general changes 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:06.219
 atmosphere of reducing to 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:08.080
 thus oxidizing the biosphere 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:10.120
 could develop and in these 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.099
 conditions there are current living 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.229
 organisms before oxygen catastrophe 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:17.199
 most living things lived in the water 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:19.150
 and had anaerobic breathing and after 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.490
 oxygen catastrophe diametrically 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.659
 opposite aerobic breathing he 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.310
 more profitable 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.589
 energy of positive 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.960
 the effects of the ozone layer and 

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:31.389
 a sharp decrease in the greenhouse effect in 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.979
 the case of changing the general nature of the atmosphere 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.020
 with numeral back to 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:39.490
 recovery most creatures are not 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.110
 will be able to adapt and die after 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.300
 Watching this video I hope you understand 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.250
 how many things can interrupt your 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.979
 way of life and how insignificant it is 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.870
 and vulnerable to the slightest 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.300
 vibrations are natural to the earth 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.610
 processes like and subscribe to 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.259
 this channel and also go to my channel 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.599
 maybe I 'll surprise you with something 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:00.520
 and remember don't fear death from 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.509
 natural phenomena you can always 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.819
 avoid it 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:06.690
 if you die beforehand from household 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:09.640
 stabbing all bye 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.100
 i will be glad like a fish during the world 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.140
 flood if you subscribe to channel a 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:18.870
