Optifine video I covered the connected

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.560 
Optifine video I covered the connected
textures<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.640> just<00:00:20.820> quickly<00:00:21.060> want<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.390> show

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
textures and I just quickly want to show

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.120 
textures and I just quickly want to show
you<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.289> show<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.859> guys<00:00:22.890> again

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
confused let's see if I can set the time

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.770 
confused let's see if I can set the time
see<00:00:27.720> time<00:00:28.260> set<00:00:28.890> day<00:00:30.019> okay<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.590> basically<00:00:31.949> I

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
see time set day okay so basically I

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.930 
see time set day okay so basically I
said<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:34.020> my<00:00:34.170> previous<00:00:34.350> video<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.820> can

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
said in my previous video that you can

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.850 
said in my previous video that you can
connect<00:00:36.270> textures<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.960> some<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.590> do<00:00:37.710> know

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
connect textures and some of you do know

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.160 
connect textures and some of you do know
what<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.100> means<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:39.059> I'll<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:40.079> quickly

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
what that means so I'll just quickly

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.840 
what that means so I'll just quickly
show<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.530> guys<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.800> again<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.610> need<00:00:41.730> an

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
show you guys that again I just need an

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.229 
show you guys that again I just need an
iron<00:00:42.090> block<00:00:42.590> okay<00:00:43.590> here's<00:00:43.829> an<00:00:43.980> iron<00:00:44.100> block<00:00:44.579> so

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
iron block okay here's an iron block so

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.790 
iron block okay here's an iron block so
here's<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> thing<00:00:45.750> when<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.320> put<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> block

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
here's the thing when you put a block

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.250 
here's the thing when you put a block
down<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.399> if<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.210> vertex<00:00:48.629> track<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.110> good

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
down on if the vertex track is good

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.350 
down on if the vertex track is good
enough<00:00:49.440> it'll<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> connected<00:00:50.430> texture<00:00:50.820> so

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
enough it'll have a connected texture so

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.330 
enough it'll have a connected texture so
when<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.600> put<00:00:51.840> one<00:00:51.960> right<00:00:52.050> there<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:53.039> know<00:00:53.070> how

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
when I put one right there you know how

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.939 
when I put one right there you know how
you<00:00:53.820> see<00:00:53.969> how<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.210> let<00:00:54.600> me<00:00:54.809> zoom<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.500> control

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
you see how that let me zoom in control

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.450 
you see how that let me zoom in control
zoom<00:00:56.430> okay<00:00:56.820> as<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.109> see<00:00:58.350> there<00:00:59.250> would<00:00:59.399> be

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
zoom okay as you can see there would be

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.490 
zoom okay as you can see there would be
a<00:00:59.609> border<00:01:00.059> here<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.629> there's<00:01:00.840> actually<00:01:01.050> none

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
a border here but there's actually none

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.490 
a border here but there's actually none
that<00:01:02.430> there's<00:01:02.640> no<00:01:02.789> no<00:01:03.059> border<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.930> if<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.290> wanted

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
that there's no no border so if I wanted

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.289 
that there's no no border so if I wanted
to<00:01:04.559> opt<00:01:04.739> fine<00:01:05.129> when<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.489> video<00:01:05.700> settings<00:01:05.939> went

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
to opt fine when to video settings went

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.390 
to opt fine when to video settings went
to<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> forum<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.080> sight<00:01:07.290> no<00:01:07.470> sorry<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.310> not

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
to a forum in sight no sorry it's not

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.039 
to a forum in sight no sorry it's not
performance<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.970> think<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.210> under<00:01:09.420> quality

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
performance I think it's under quality

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.000 
performance I think it's under quality
and<00:01:11.240> connected<00:01:12.240> connected<00:01:12.840> textures<00:01:13.320> on/off

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and connected connected textures on/off

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.520 
and connected connected textures on/off
as<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:14.909> see<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.630> turned<00:01:15.900> back<00:01:16.110> to

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
as you can see and is turned back to

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.820 
as you can see and is turned back to
normal<00:01:17.159> block<00:01:17.460> but<00:01:18.259> with<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> connected

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
normal block but with the connected

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.370 
normal block but with the connected
textures<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.490> then<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.689> can<00:01:21.720> clearly<00:01:22.049> see

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
textures on then you can clearly see

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.359 
textures on then you can clearly see
that<00:01:22.759> it<00:01:23.759> looks<00:01:24.119> nice<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:24.960> fanciful<00:01:25.950> and

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
that it looks nice all fanciful and

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.910 
that it looks nice all fanciful and
stuff<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.509> also<00:01:27.810> some<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.409> wonder<00:01:28.740> how<00:01:28.890> i

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
stuff so also some of you wonder how i

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.830 
stuff so also some of you wonder how i
zoom<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.430> well<00:01:29.670> actually<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.150> show<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.420> how<00:01:30.810> i

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
zoom in well actually to show you how i

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.929 
zoom in well actually to show you how i
zoomed<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.590> all<00:01:31.770> i<00:01:31.799> have<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.400> do<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.640> go<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.820> your

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
zoomed in all i have to do is go to your

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.170 
zoomed in all i have to do is go to your
options<00:01:33.509> controls<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.560> change<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.070> f<00:01:35.490> so

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
options controls and change that to f so

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.420 
options controls and change that to f so
you<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.360> zoom<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.750> as<00:01:37.020> far<00:01:37.650> as<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> one<00:01:38.310> point

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
you can zoom in as far as a one point

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.210 
you can zoom in as far as a one point
four<00:01:38.640> point<00:01:38.700> four<00:01:39.150> texturepacks<00:01:40.110> ago<00:01:40.320> i<00:01:40.920> don't

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
four point four texturepacks ago i don't

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.679 
four point four texturepacks ago i don't
think<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.520> really<00:01:41.640> need<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.909> upgrade<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.659> i

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
think you really need to upgrade so i

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.850 
think you really need to upgrade so i
think<00:01:42.840> you're<00:01:43.770> fine<00:01:43.950> as<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:45.770> let<00:01:46.770> me

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860

think you're fine as it is and let me
quickly<00:01:47.070> talk<00:01:47.250> about<00:01:47.310> my<00:01:47.610> server<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.509> let<00:01:49.439> me

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
quickly talk about my server so let me

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.370 
quickly talk about my server so let me
just<00:01:49.680> log<00:01:49.890> out<00:01:50.070> as<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.850> see<00:01:51.119> my<00:01:51.810> server<00:01:52.110> is
