00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
look once it's inside of the case as you

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.600 
look once it's inside of the case as you
can<00:02:19.300> see<00:02:19.510> this<00:02:19.989> case<00:02:20.290> gives<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.769> enough<00:02:21.340> space

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610
