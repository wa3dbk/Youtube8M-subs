 and well I tell you the rice that I'm going to 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.410
 use today to do the 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.670
 this 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.070
 is this and excel long brain brown and is 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.229
 they see that it is a bit more recessive 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.030
 then more more chubby why 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.530
 it takes longer to shrink 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.479
 but good you can choose 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.800
 any rice of your preference that 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.950
 be it integrating 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.950
 and well I did little here 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.810
 it's delicious, it's very good 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.000
 I already tried it and well I'll be using 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.670
 this because sometimes I lose my hand and 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.550
 I put him over and it's a disaster 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.110
 It is serious and I will use as I have here 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.170
 quite the teddy because now nothing more 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.070
 I'm going to make half a cup that's here 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.070
 I 'm not going to empty 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.350
 I always like to use him 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.590
 because sometimes I lose my hand and 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.810
 also 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.060
 here it is 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:07.619
 francs and we will use 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.530
 ok let's use olive oil this 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.520
 that you have a garlic 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.770
 a little like that 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.960
 and it's the one the quito gives the perfect touch 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.550
 I promise you to the rose 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.510
 I am very fond of garlic and eat it 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.870
 forever 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.450
 removing but but if you give that yes that 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.630
 he gives the touch very well rich when 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.340
 you are putting them in the pot smells 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.620
 today I can not write them the smell 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.300
 but if you do they will know that 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.760
 They smell delicious with olive oil 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.760
 and garlic and well I'm peeling my son 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.680
 I'm struggling a bit here 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.910
 you did not leave 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.910
 good 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.189
 we do not want sharp edges 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:06.600
 so 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:09.980
 we are going to start it in miramar 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.590
 some thin 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.129
 sterile 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:22.930
 there they are 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:25.550
 so if you want to put everything whole 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.030
 do it but I like it that way for me 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.470
 power is because he exposed me and likes 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.170
 then I put it all relax 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.750
 good and here we did that or equal and so 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.920
 rich 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.670
 [Applause] 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:44.090
 a knife since we did this from the 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.010
 agito we already have our brodsky our 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.069
 olive oil 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.239
 if our pot is I'm going to preferred 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.239
 because that way be more 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:00.440
 already more than 100 thousand I already put an oil of 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.290
 olive tree in my pot I put the rice and the 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.840
 I put in our garlic smells delicious 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.700
 I wish they could grind the 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.700
 garlic oil combination 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.700
 good 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.470
 and we are going to stir everything up so that 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.970
 Fill all the rice with oil 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.970
 olive in this way 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.560
 since you are and then we are going to empty 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.540
 our water 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.780
 it depends on what rice you do is what you're going 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.230
 to make water that is nothing more with that 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.230
 I covered it 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:54.120
 What this rice has is that it 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:56.600
 is going to get shaken are they traveled if you want 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.820
 add more flavor 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.540
 although we already have our garlic if you want 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.370
 and give it a little bit and good what you 're going to 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:08.030
 do with this rice is that you're going to 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.980
 leave an hour or so dependent because 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.160
 I already had you here that really but good 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:16.340
 I had to leave an hour in me in 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.500
 my stove and with my cover you have to 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.570
 be reviewing if we have to be 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.240
 checking and putting it not so high 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.710
 put the flame as a half low 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.760
 but you have to leave it more 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:31.940
 about an hour in it 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.620
 in the here in the pot ok then 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.250
 good you have to be very patient with 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.360
 this router I suggest that if you leave it 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:42.170
 after it is cooked, leave it 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.730
 rest about 5 - d5 I do not know less than 5 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.700
 minutes since it lets it sit then 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.080
 you can already serve it ok this but if 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.680
 you have to be very patient with this 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.689
 rice and well let's leave it that that 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.979
 do and now we come back ok 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:06:00.540
 and what I do is that it looks great 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.700
 rich 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:06.210
 the truth if it's worth waiting for 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:09.240
 rice we are not going to cover it 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:12.340
 and it is ready that we are going to lower the 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:18.280
 low temperature ok is ready 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:20.610
 and our rice is ready already and this is 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:25.729
 I'm going for him 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.729
 is ready our delicious red smells 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:34.100
 yes 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:35.180
 and our rice is ready and I'm not 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.810
 letting your audience cool down a 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.540
 little because they see 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:42.560
 Daddy 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.560
 what do you want to tell them 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.789

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:57.299
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:07:00.839
 good recipe is super simple 

00:06:57.299 --> 00:07:02.579
 true this but I hope they do and 

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:04.649

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:05.879
