00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.430 
was very important so that's that's kind
of<00:02:36.910> how<00:02:37.030> we<00:02:37.060> built<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.360> campaign<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.290> think

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
of how we built the campaign so I think

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.970 
of how we built the campaign so I think
the<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.700> lead-up<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:43.780> terms<00:02:43.989> of<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.350> planning

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
the the lead-up in terms of the planning

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.270 
the the lead-up in terms of the planning
phase<00:02:45.100> from<00:02:45.340> when<00:02:45.610> we<00:02:45.700> were<00:02:45.790> notified<00:02:46.120> of<00:02:46.300> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
phase from when we were notified of the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.460 
phase from when we were notified of the
Election<00:02:47.910> Day<00:02:47.940> with<00:02:48.270> just<00:02:48.780> under<00:02:48.990> a<00:02:49.020> month<00:02:49.230> and

when<00:03:14.819> you<00:03:14.910> have<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:15.120> transitory<00:03:15.810> group<00:03:16.170> because

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
when you have a transitory group because

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.160 
when you have a transitory group because
pilots<00:03:17.130> are<00:03:17.340> constantly<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.780> know<00:03:18.870> it's<00:03:19.050> not

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
pilots are constantly you know it's not

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.780 
pilots are constantly you know it's not
like<00:03:19.230> there's<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.620> headquarters<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.519> folks

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
like there's a headquarters and folks

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.509

can<00:03:21.080> tactical<00:03:22.080> exactly<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:22.739> picture<00:03:23.070> so<00:03:23.310> it's

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
can tactical exactly so picture so it's

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.830 
can tactical exactly so picture so it's
how<00:03:23.700> do<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:23.880> reach<00:03:24.060> them<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.690> was

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
how do you reach them and that was

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.199 
how do you reach them and that was
really<00:03:24.989> one<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.380> main<00:03:25.560> challenges<00:03:26.209> we

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
really one of the main challenges we

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.759 
really one of the main challenges we
encountered<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.840> then<00:03:27.930> also<00:03:28.140> you<00:03:28.709> know

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
encountered and then also you know

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:29.840 
encountered and then also you know
what's<00:03:29.010> really<00:03:29.310> important<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.700> them

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
what's really important to them

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.229

in their schedule to visit all four of
the<00:04:35.919> team<00:04:36.400> basis<00:04:36.789> so<00:04:38.069> obviously<00:04:39.069> there's<00:04:39.430> one

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
the team basis so obviously there's one

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
successfully kept a direct relationship

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.140 
successfully kept a direct relationship
so<00:04:52.720> how<00:04:52.960> long<00:04:53.139> ago<00:04:53.320> when<00:04:53.590> did<00:04:53.710> this<00:04:53.800> in<00:04:54.150> August

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
so how long ago when did this in August

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.050 
so how long ago when did this in August
it<00:04:55.449> was<00:04:55.570> mid-august

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
it was mid-august

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.570 
it was mid-august
how's<00:04:58.060> the<00:04:58.330> feeling<00:04:58.479> now<00:04:58.810> I<00:04:59.280> think<00:05:00.280> we've

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
how's the feeling now I think we've

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.219 
how's the feeling now I think we've
gained<00:05:00.820> a<00:05:00.940> lot<00:05:01.090> of<00:05:01.120> momentum<00:05:01.270> from<00:05:01.870> all<00:05:02.050> the

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
gained a lot of momentum from all the

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:03.749 
gained a lot of momentum from all the
efforts<00:05:02.590> that<00:05:02.710> we<00:05:02.889> put<00:05:03.070> in<00:05:03.160> obviously<00:05:03.580> was<00:05:03.729> a

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
efforts that we put in obviously was a

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.260 
efforts that we put in obviously was a
very<00:05:04.349> robust<00:05:05.349> and<00:05:05.650> intense<00:05:06.160> time<00:05:06.699> for<00:05:07.000> well

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
very robust and intense time for well

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.740 
very robust and intense time for well
communications<00:05:08.020> but<00:05:08.560> it<00:05:08.650> also<00:05:09.659> reinforced<00:05:10.659> to

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
communications but it also reinforced to

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.420 
communications but it also reinforced to
us<00:05:10.870> that<00:05:11.139> the<00:05:11.560> most<00:05:11.770> effective<00:05:12.159> form<00:05:12.370> of

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
us that the most effective form of

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.189 
us that the most effective form of
communication<00:05:12.520> is<00:05:13.330> always<00:05:13.659> going<00:05:13.810> to<00:05:13.900> be<00:05:13.960> face

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
communication is always going to be face

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.110 
communication is always going to be face
to<00:05:14.229> face<00:05:14.440> nothing<00:05:15.430> is<00:05:15.550> ever<00:05:15.699> going<00:05:15.849> to<00:05:15.909> replace

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
to face nothing is ever going to replace

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.570 
to face nothing is ever going to replace
that<00:05:16.300> and<00:05:16.949> you<00:05:17.949> know<00:05:18.009> there<00:05:18.190> are<00:05:18.280> legitimate

that and you know there are legitimate

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.350 
that and you know there are legitimate

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
is to address those in the way that we

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.050 
is to address those in the way that we

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
product now we have to live up to that

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.050 
product now we have to live up to that
and<00:05:32.590> I<00:05:32.740> think<00:05:32.830> over<00:05:33.159> the<00:05:33.280> last<00:05:33.400> year<00:05:33.729> we<00:05:33.880> made<00:05:34.000> a

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
and I think over the last year we made a

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.060 
and I think over the last year we made a
lot<00:05:34.300> of<00:05:34.360> changes<00:05:34.630> I<00:05:35.110> think<00:05:35.620> a<00:05:35.680> lot<00:05:35.830> of<00:05:35.949> pilots

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
lot of changes I think a lot of pilots

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.980 
lot of changes I think a lot of pilots
are<00:05:36.430> satisfied<00:05:36.969> I<00:05:37.270> think<00:05:37.570> there<00:05:37.719> are<00:05:37.750> still

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
are satisfied I think there are still

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.080 
are satisfied I think there are still
legitimate<00:05:38.500> concern

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
legitimate concern

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.600 
legitimate concern
the<00:05:40.990> relationship<00:05:41.680> not<00:05:41.889> just<00:05:42.130> with<00:05:42.250> pilots

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
the relationship not just with pilots

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.720 
the relationship not just with pilots
but<00:05:42.760> with<00:05:42.940> all<00:05:43.060> three<00:05:43.270> members<00:05:43.950> so<00:05:44.950> I'll<00:05:45.340> ask

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
but with all three members so I'll ask

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.790 
but with all three members so I'll ask
this<00:05:46.090> of<00:05:46.270> each<00:05:46.450> of<00:05:46.630> you<00:05:46.780> one<00:05:47.230> thing<00:05:47.500> that<00:05:47.560> you

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
this of each of you one thing that you

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.590 
this of each of you one thing that you
think<00:05:47.860> PR<00:05:48.430> pro<00:05:48.669> should<00:05:48.910> take<00:05:49.090> away<00:05:49.240> from<00:05:49.360> this

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
think PR pro should take away from this

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.090 
think PR pro should take away from this
campaign

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.730 

you<00:05:52.700> have<00:05:53.000> to<00:05:53.300> believe<00:05:53.630> that<00:05:54.500> you're<00:05:54.650> doing

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
you have to believe that you're doing
