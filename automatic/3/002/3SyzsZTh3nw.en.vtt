00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.150 
harmful but instead we're looking at the
ways<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:45.910> use<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.660> educational<00:03:47.410> benefits<00:03:47.860> and

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
ways to use the educational benefits and

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.590 
ways to use the educational benefits and
the<00:03:48.190> learning<00:03:48.580> that<00:03:48.850> can<00:03:49.000> occur<00:03:49.240> in<00:03:49.360> games

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
the learning that can occur in games

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.560 
the learning that can occur in games
turn<00:03:50.200> it<00:03:50.320> around<00:03:50.410> to<00:03:50.740> positive<00:03:51.190> uses<00:03:51.550> so<00:03:52.210> all

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
turn it around to positive uses so all

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.780 
turn it around to positive uses so all
of<00:03:52.600> these<00:03:52.780> factors<00:03:53.020> come<00:03:53.500> into<00:03:53.530> play<00:03:53.710> plus<00:03:54.370> the

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
of these factors come into play plus the

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.880 
of these factors come into play plus the
growing<00:03:55.270> body<00:03:55.480> of<00:03:55.600> research<00:03:55.690> that<00:03:56.050> now<00:03:56.470> really

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
growing body of research that now really

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.830 
growing body of research that now really
shows<00:03:57.130> that<00:03:57.430> well-designed<00:03:58.000> games<00:03:58.480> can

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
shows that well-designed games can

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.860 
shows that well-designed games can
improve<00:03:59.680> health<00:03:59.950> so<00:04:00.910> we're<00:04:01.060> ready<00:04:01.210> to<00:04:01.360> really

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
improve health so we're ready to really

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.470 
improve health so we're ready to really
take<00:04:02.050> off<00:04:02.260> if<00:04:02.710> you<00:04:02.890> could<00:04:03.070> say<00:04:03.310> what<00:04:03.580> are<00:04:03.700> some

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
take off if you could say what are some

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.420 
take off if you could say what are some
of<00:04:04.600> the<00:04:04.690> immediate<00:04:05.020> goals<00:04:05.560> that<00:04:06.040> you<00:04:06.250> would

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
of the immediate goals that you would

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.730 
of the immediate goals that you would
like<00:04:06.610> to<00:04:06.790> see<00:04:07.060> in<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.300> next<00:04:07.450> year<00:04:08.050> with<00:04:08.260> with

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
like to see in the next year with with

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.380 
like to see in the next year with with
this<00:04:09.010> new<00:04:09.310> money<00:04:09.610> coming<00:04:09.880> in<00:04:10.150> for<00:04:10.300> your

this new money coming in for your
program<00:04:10.660> what<00:04:11.080> would<00:04:11.440> it<00:04:11.530> be<00:04:11.560> yes<00:04:12.010> I<00:04:12.220> would

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
program what would it be yes I would

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.820 
program what would it be yes I would
like<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:12.790> see<00:04:13.180> this<00:04:13.450> money<00:04:13.780> really<00:04:14.290> improve

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
like to see this money really improve

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.400 
like to see this money really improve
the<00:04:15.160> quality<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:16.239> quantity<00:04:16.690> of<00:04:16.960> research

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410

that's being done in the field to really

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.590 
that's being done in the field to really
make<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.410> case<00:04:20.620> that<00:04:20.790> good<00:04:21.790> design<00:04:21.910> can

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
make the case that good design can

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.420 
make the case that good design can
really<00:04:22.960> lead<00:04:23.140> to<00:04:23.169> better<00:04:23.470> health

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
really lead to better health

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.890 
really lead to better health
games<00:04:24.580> that<00:04:24.820> lead<00:04:25.090> to<00:04:25.120> better<00:04:25.600> health

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900

discover new ways to use games they

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.159 
discover new ways to use games they

data answer questions about how you're

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.629 
data answer questions about how you're
feeling<00:04:47.199> right<00:04:47.229> now<00:04:47.530> and<00:04:47.830> not<00:04:48.039> only<00:04:48.160> does<00:04:48.430> that

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
feeling right now and not only does that

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.580 
feeling right now and not only does that
impact<00:04:49.120> how<00:04:49.300> you<00:04:49.360> play<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:49.630> game<00:04:49.780> but<00:04:50.470> it

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
impact how you play the game but it

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.990 
impact how you play the game but it
could<00:04:50.740> be<00:04:50.830> shared<00:04:51.070> with<00:04:51.250> your<00:04:51.370> doctor<00:04:51.759> as<00:04:51.940> a

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
could be shared with your doctor as a

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.610 
could be shared with your doctor as a
way<00:04:52.210> to<00:04:52.240> learn<00:04:52.539> about<00:04:52.780> how<00:04:52.930> you're<00:04:53.080> doing<00:04:53.440> and

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
way to learn about how you're doing and

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.980 
way to learn about how you're doing and
so<00:04:54.520> in<00:04:54.850> addition<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.210> improving<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.600> research

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
so in addition to improving the research

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.350 
so in addition to improving the research
I'd<00:04:56.259> like<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:56.530> see<00:04:56.770> our<00:04:56.800> program<00:04:57.490> really<00:04:58.030> get

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
I'd like to see our program really get

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.719 
I'd like to see our program really get
the<00:04:58.479> word<00:04:58.630> out<00:04:58.840> about<00:04:59.080> health<00:04:59.650> games<00:04:59.919> to<00:05:00.250> the
