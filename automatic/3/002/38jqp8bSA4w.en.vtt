on an aftermarket model this tab does
not<00:02:53.810> exist<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:54.610> unfortunately<00:02:55.610> now<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:56.720> will

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
not exist and unfortunately now it will

not<00:02:57.080> stay<00:02:57.410> in<00:02:57.560> there<00:02:57.740> I<00:02:57.950> had<00:02:58.550> a<00:02:58.580> problem<00:02:58.850> where

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
not stay in there I had a problem where

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.660 
not stay in there I had a problem where
the<00:02:59.630> unit<00:02:59.960> actually<00:03:00.170> was<00:03:00.740> sort<00:03:01.070> of<00:03:01.190> sitted<00:03:01.550> in

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
the unit actually was sort of sitted in

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.130 
the unit actually was sort of sitted in
there<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.090> then<00:03:02.210> it<00:03:02.330> eventually<00:03:02.630> just

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
there and then it eventually just

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.980 
there and then it eventually just
vibrated<00:03:03.650> itself<00:03:03.950> out<00:03:04.100> of<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.340> um<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:05.780> will

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
vibrated itself out of that um it will

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.980 
vibrated itself out of that um it will
not<00:03:06.200> fit<00:03:06.500> so<00:03:06.790> just<00:03:07.790> keep<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.210> in<00:03:08.270> mind<00:03:08.360> you're

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
not fit so just keep that in mind you're

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.960 
not fit so just keep that in mind you're
better<00:03:09.200> off<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.530> go<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.680> get<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.280> GM<00:03:10.670> part

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
better off to go and get a GM part

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.320 
better off to go and get a GM part
because<00:03:11.450> trust<00:03:11.720> me<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:12.440> won't<00:03:12.680> fit<00:03:12.910> it<00:03:13.910> may<00:03:14.090> fit

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
because trust me it won't fit it may fit

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.880 
because trust me it won't fit it may fit
certain<00:03:14.570> applications<00:03:15.260> but<00:03:15.440> it<00:03:15.530> won't<00:03:15.680> fit

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
certain applications but it won't fit

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.930 
certain applications but it won't fit

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.910 

and<00:03:46.340> it's<00:03:46.730> just<00:03:47.000> that<00:03:47.150> simple<00:03:47.390> nothing<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.620> it

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
and it's just that simple nothing to it

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.160 
and it's just that simple nothing to it

this unit isn't seated properly it will

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.140 
this unit isn't seated properly it will
fall<00:03:57.440> out<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.860> if<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.459> motor<00:03:58.640> is<00:03:58.819> running<00:03:58.970> at

fall out and if the motor is running at

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.570 
fall out and if the motor is running at
high<00:03:59.300> speed<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.870> cage<00:04:00.110> will<00:04:00.530> melt<00:04:00.830> against

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
high speed the cage will melt against

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.300 
high speed the cage will melt against
the<00:04:01.670> housing<00:04:02.090> where<00:04:02.989> it<00:04:03.110> is<00:04:03.230> situated<00:04:03.560> and<00:04:04.040> so

the housing where it is situated and so

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.949 
the housing where it is situated and so
keep<00:04:04.580> that<00:04:04.730> in<00:04:04.790> mind<00:04:04.880> just<00:04:05.330> grab<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.780> motor

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
keep that in mind just grab the motor

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.350 
keep that in mind just grab the motor
housing<00:04:06.520> shake<00:04:07.520> it<00:04:07.640> around<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.970> bit<00:04:08.000> make<00:04:08.330> sure

housing shake it around a bit make sure
it's<00:04:08.600> nice<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:08.780> tight<00:04:09.310> reach<00:04:10.310> underneath

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
it's nice and tight reach underneath
