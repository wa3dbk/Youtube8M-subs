00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
Intel we're able to actually

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.210 
Intel we're able to actually
revolutionize<00:01:05.810> our<00:01:06.020> toolset<00:01:06.470> here<00:01:06.710> working

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
revolutionize our toolset here working

revolutionize our toolset here working
on<00:01:07.340> this<00:01:07.490> new<00:01:07.939> software<00:01:08.210> pretty<00:01:08.990> mo<00:01:09.110> now<00:01:09.740> we're

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
on this new software pretty mo now we're

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.980 
on this new software pretty mo now we're
able<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.369> turn<00:01:10.610> things<00:01:10.820> around<00:01:10.970> way<00:01:11.420> faster

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
able to turn things around way faster

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.230 
able to turn things around way faster
and<00:01:12.110> get<00:01:12.500> more<00:01:12.710> iterations<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:13.670> it's

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
and get more iterations and it's

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.179 
and get more iterations and it's
actually<00:01:14.600> brought<00:01:14.869> us<00:01:15.079> closer<00:01:15.500> to<00:01:15.950> being<00:01:16.130> a

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
actually brought us closer to being a

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:23.450 
actually brought us closer to being a
traditional<00:01:16.700> artist
