00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.460 
the cubes put in here pretty snug
alright<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:39.390> 6<00:01:40.390> of<00:01:40.539> them<00:01:40.660> come<00:01:40.899> in<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.080> package

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.919 

of<00:01:44.470> course<00:01:45.069> I<00:01:45.369> know<00:01:46.209> we're<00:01:46.479> going<00:01:46.599> to<00:01:46.660> keep<00:01:46.780> a

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
of course I know we're going to keep a

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.270 
of course I know we're going to keep a
few<00:01:47.080> of<00:01:47.140> these<00:01:47.289> I<00:01:47.560> probably<00:01:47.800> going<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.069> sell

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
few of these I probably going to sell

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.940 
few of these I probably going to sell
the<00:01:48.429> rest<00:01:48.700> I'm<00:01:49.630> not<00:01:49.840> exactly<00:01:50.170> sure<00:01:50.380> I'm<00:01:50.740> going

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.589 
the rest I'm not exactly sure I'm going
to<00:01:51.009> do<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:53.619> could<00:01:53.830> be<00:01:53.860> a<00:01:54.039> giveaway<00:01:54.429> I'm<00:01:55.360> not

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:55.599 
to do it could be a giveaway I'm not

00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:01.469 
to do it could be a giveaway I'm not
sure<00:01:55.869> so<00:01:56.399> don't<00:01:57.399> put<00:01:58.360> me<00:01:58.509> on<00:01:58.630> there<00:01:59.039> so<00:02:00.479> it

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
sure so don't put me on there so it

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.690 
sure so don't put me on there so it
comes<00:02:01.750> with<00:02:01.959> these<00:02:02.170> little<00:02:02.500> books<00:02:02.920> looks<00:02:03.459> like

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
comes with these little books looks like

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.839 
comes with these little books looks like
and<00:02:04.599> I<00:02:05.470> guess<00:02:05.679> it's<00:02:05.890> on<00:02:06.069> how<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.340> solve<00:02:06.670> the

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:06.849 
and I guess it's on how to solve the

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:10.169 
and I guess it's on how to solve the
cube<00:02:07.289> and<00:02:08.289> everything<00:02:09.009> that<00:02:09.580> nobody<00:02:10.000> ever

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
cube and everything that nobody ever

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.420 
cube and everything that nobody ever
paid<00:02:10.420> attention<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.739> I<00:02:11.800> guess<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.130> comes<00:02:12.310> with

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
paid attention and I guess it comes with

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.699 
paid attention and I guess it comes with
six<00:02:12.730> of<00:02:12.880> them

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.380 

doesn't<00:02:16.640> look<00:02:16.700> like<00:02:16.760> they<00:02:17.030> come<00:02:17.240> with

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
doesn't look like they come with

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.630 
doesn't look like they come with
stickers<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:18.140> thought<00:02:18.620> they<00:02:18.770> did<00:02:18.980> but<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:19.250> could

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
stickers I thought they did but I could

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.030 
stickers I thought they did but I could
be<00:02:19.730> mistaken<00:02:19.880> that<00:02:20.510> was<00:02:21.440> realistic<00:02:21.650> oh<00:02:21.920> these

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
be mistaken that was realistic oh these

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.840 
be mistaken that was realistic oh these
are<00:02:22.190> just<00:02:22.310> six<00:02:22.610> little<00:02:23.770> books<00:02:24.770> or<00:02:25.010> whatever<00:02:26.440> so

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
are just six little books or whatever so

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:44.320 
are just six little books or whatever so
go<00:02:28.850> ahead<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.060> open<00:02:29.480> one<00:02:29.510> of<00:02:29.750> these<00:02:29.840> up<00:02:43.330> all
