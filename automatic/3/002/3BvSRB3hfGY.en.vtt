and I apologized for that so I'll talk
about<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.840> in<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.200> video

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
about it in this video

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.340 
about it in this video
me<00:00:14.490> personally<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:15.269> hit<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.750> lot<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:15.929> use<00:00:16.230> to

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
me personally I hit a lot of use to

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.170 
me personally I hit a lot of use to
bookstores<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.490> reason<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.880> do<00:00:17.940> is

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
bookstores and the reason I do is

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.849 
bookstores and the reason I do is
because<00:00:18.210> they<00:00:18.570> typically<00:00:18.869> deal<00:00:19.109> in<00:00:19.289> media<00:00:19.680> in

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
because they typically deal in media in

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.040 
because they typically deal in media in
general<00:00:19.890> DVDs<00:00:20.820> CDs<00:00:21.119> whatever<00:00:21.539> they<00:00:21.720> do<00:00:21.779> get

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
general DVDs CDs whatever they do get

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.769 
general DVDs CDs whatever they do get
records<00:00:22.609> now<00:00:23.609> they're<00:00:23.939> not<00:00:24.119> really<00:00:24.420> music

records now they're not really music
people<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.289> they<00:00:25.380> don't<00:00:25.410> know<00:00:25.560> how<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.740> price

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
this stuff they usually buy it just by

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.720 
this stuff they usually buy it just by
the<00:00:28.230> box<00:00:28.710> or<00:00:29.010> whatever<00:00:29.279> they<00:00:29.429> give<00:00:29.609> them<00:00:29.699> a
