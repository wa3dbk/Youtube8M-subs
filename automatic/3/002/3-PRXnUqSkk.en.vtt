00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.570
 I'm stronger than any force or problems you want to solve the And I 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:14.880
 Asking for existence to solve them 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.500
 That's why we pray and people who are doing this file and justice 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.080
 Surprisingly many 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:25.890
 We will be done on earth as the will is done in heaven. 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.800
 Prayer is that God can not fail, and His will is our prayer 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.120
 I do not want to be shaken by that. 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:37.770
 So we will not let the waver in our prayers 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:43.410
 Prayer is that the dead spirit will come to life, 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:48.360
 I am going to go to this world where I can not keep pushing me, 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.760
 The only thing that I can do to cope with that disturbance at that moment is 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.480
 It's a prayer. 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.710
 The premise of prayer is that He is the Father. 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.030
 If a man is convinced that he is my Father, 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.739
 I could not . 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:10.860
 Let's pray that mouth going to eat the way I mean to stop there at the end of cup 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:14.729
 From there, it is possible to count the will of God in God's righteousness. 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.659
 So pray to God ohreusi we'll pray, and while 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:23.520
 When I'm having trouble with God's strength so we sat our surrender and islands 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:27.030
 God jusineunde it isnt God wants, then why I play 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:32.400
 It will show you that I'm giving that training 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:35.220
 It makes us to pray, so it is God after it is done. 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.930
 You have to pray 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.009
 In comparison , we admit that God's kingdom was all this way. 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.860
 He gives you. 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:51.930
 So that's the way I am now able to talk to God 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:55.790
 It has become a genius to be lost. 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.790
 The moment you kneel down your father 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.520
 wow
