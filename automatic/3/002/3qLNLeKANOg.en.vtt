00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
role in the I think the opening trap of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.970 
role in the I think the opening trap of
this<00:00:53.070> one<00:00:53.430> with<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.570> weight<00:00:55.290> whoever<00:00:55.770> could

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
this one with the weight whoever could

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.430 
this one with the weight whoever could
produce<00:00:56.340> them<00:00:56.700> but<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.180> most<00:00:57.360> weight<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:58.290> get

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
produce them but the most weight to get

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.630 
produce them but the most weight to get
out<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> trap<00:00:59.070> oh<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.489> pretty

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
out of the trap oh it's pretty

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.910 
out of the trap oh it's pretty
disturbing<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.570> amazing<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.469> love<00:01:01.739> it

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
disturbing and amazing I love it

now<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.190> really<00:01:02.640> enjoyed<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.149> one<00:01:03.480> however<00:01:04.020> it

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
now I really enjoyed this one however it

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.639 
now I really enjoyed this one however it
is<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.890> lowest-grossing<00:01:05.430> saw<00:01:06.270> film<00:01:06.690> to<00:01:07.440> come

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.830 
is the lowest-grossing saw film to come
out<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.910> think<00:01:09.149> that's<00:01:09.509> kind<00:01:09.720> of

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
out so I think that's kind of

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.840 
out so I think that's kind of
interesting<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.649> like<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.190> plot<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.670> like

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850

the plot of the insurance agents and the
company<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.180> stuff<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
company and stuff like that and the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.469 
company and stuff like that and the
symbolism<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> piranhas<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
symbolism of the piranhas in the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.800 
symbolism of the piranhas in the
beginning<00:01:18.810> when<00:01:19.580> jigsaw<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:20.940> goes<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.570> there

beginning when jigsaw like goes in there

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.930

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
a lot of symbolism there but I will say

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.350 
a lot of symbolism there but I will say
there<00:01:26.010> is<00:01:26.130> one<00:01:26.310> thing<00:01:26.520> about<00:01:26.640> or<00:01:27.119> there's

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
there is one thing about or there's

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.359 
there is one thing about or there's
something<00:01:27.750> about<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.409> makes<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.830> not

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
something about this that makes it not

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.550 
something about this that makes it not
all<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.210> interesting<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.110> don't<00:01:31.170> know<00:01:31.350> it's

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
all that interesting I don't know it's

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.440 
all that interesting I don't know it's
less<00:01:31.830> about<00:01:32.010> the<00:01:32.100> detectives<00:01:32.700> kind<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.360> an

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
less about the detectives kind of an

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.170 
less about the detectives kind of an
it's<00:01:33.600> more<00:01:33.960> about<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.920> insurance<00:01:35.130> agents<00:01:36.000> and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
it's more about the insurance agents and

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.179 
it's more about the insurance agents and
like<00:01:36.299> their<00:01:36.540> trap<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.229> very<00:01:37.409> similar<00:01:37.830> to

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
like their trap and it's very similar to

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.380 
like their trap and it's very similar to
me<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:40.010> soft<00:01:41.010> 3<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.520> soft<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:41.970> films

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
me like the soft 3 and soft for films

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.289 
me like the soft 3 and soft for films
because<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.409> has<00:01:44.070> one<00:01:44.369> main<00:01:44.580> character<00:01:44.820> going

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
because it has one main character going

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.870 
because it has one main character going
through<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.810> traps<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.610> having<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.729> either

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
through the traps and having to either

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.050 
through the traps and having to either
save<00:01:48.390> someone<00:01:48.900> or<00:01:49.530> kill<00:01:49.890> someone<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.670> order<00:01:50.790> to

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
save someone or kill someone in order to

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.179 
save someone or kill someone in order to
survive<00:01:51.390> or<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:51.900> choose<00:01:52.229> between<00:01:52.500> people

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
survive or like choose between people

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.160 
survive or like choose between people
who<00:01:53.520> should<00:01:53.759> survive<00:01:54.090> or<00:01:54.330> not<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:54.960> kind

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
who should survive or not so it's kind

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.050 
who should survive or not so it's kind
of<00:01:55.229> similar<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:56.100> kind<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.549> sense<00:01:56.790> and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
of similar in that kind of sense and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.300 
of similar in that kind of sense and
like<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.360> said<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.630> like<00:01:58.049> individual<00:01:58.650> traps<00:01:58.950> more

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
like I said I like individual traps more

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.179 
like I said I like individual traps more
than<00:01:59.520> group<00:01:59.850> traps<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:00.930> guess<00:02:01.229> sometimes

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
than group traps but I guess sometimes

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.950 
than group traps but I guess sometimes
their<00:02:02.490> individual<00:02:03.150> sometimes<00:02:03.630> he<00:02:03.840> has<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
their individual sometimes he has to

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.469 
their individual sometimes he has to
make<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> decision<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.920> things<00:02:05.130> like<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.479> but

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
make a decision and things like that but

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.300 
make a decision and things like that but
I<00:02:06.720> don't<00:02:06.990> know<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.560> has<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.920> infamous

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
carousel scene in it and it was

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.870 
carousel scene in it and it was
originally<00:02:11.070> supposed<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.310> have<00:02:11.459> 10<00:02:11.610> people

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
originally supposed to have 10 people

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.210 
originally supposed to have 10 people
but<00:02:12.209> they<00:02:12.299> cut<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.630> down<00:02:12.660> because<00:02:13.079> well<00:02:14.040> for

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
but they cut it down because well for

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.979 
but they cut it down because well for
one<00:02:14.400> timing<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.239> already<00:02:15.420> took<00:02:15.720> 2<00:02:15.900> 8

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
one timing and it already took 2 8

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.360 
one timing and it already took 2 8
minutes<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.500> couldn't<00:02:16.769> imagine<00:02:16.890> if<00:02:17.160> there<00:02:17.310> was

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
minutes I couldn't imagine if there was

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.280 
minutes I couldn't imagine if there was
4<00:02:17.700> more<00:02:17.880> people<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.329> it<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.690> then<00:02:18.959> they<00:02:19.079> wanted

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
4 more people in it and then they wanted

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.840 
4 more people in it and then they wanted
to<00:02:19.410> tie<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.620> into<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:19.950> title<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.459> movie<00:02:20.579> I

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
about it so in the end Hoffman is set up

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.860 
about it so in the end Hoffman is set up
in<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.919> Reverse<00:03:04.919> bear<00:03:05.190> trap<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.880> he<00:03:06.419> figures

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
in the Reverse bear trap and he figures

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.080 
in the Reverse bear trap and he figures
out<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:07.019> way<00:03:07.109> to<00:03:07.290> survive<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.579> which<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:08.940> the

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
out a way to survive it which is the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.659 
out a way to survive it which is the
first<00:03:09.389> time<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.720> think<00:03:09.870> anyone<00:03:10.859> survived<00:03:11.310> and

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:11.669 
first time I think anyone survived and

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.420 
first time I think anyone survived and
in<00:03:12.239> survivable<00:03:13.169> unsurvivable

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
in survivable unsurvivable

in survivable unsurvivable

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
trap that actually like exploded or like

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.400 
trap that actually like exploded or like
you<00:03:17.579> know<00:03:17.699> that<00:03:18.150> actually<00:03:18.600> trigger<00:03:18.989> because

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
you know that actually trigger because

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.349 
you know that actually trigger because
obviously<00:03:19.590> we<00:03:20.280> know<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.549> Amanda<00:03:20.790> survived

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
obviously we know that Amanda survived

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.569 
obviously we know that Amanda survived
that<00:03:21.540> trap<00:03:21.870> but<00:03:22.169> she<00:03:22.590> successfully<00:03:23.430> unlocked

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
that trap but she successfully unlocked

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.409 
that trap but she successfully unlocked
it<00:03:24.090> versus<00:03:24.660> his<00:03:25.199> actually<00:03:25.709> deployed<00:03:26.609> and<00:03:27.090> he

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
it versus his actually deployed and he
