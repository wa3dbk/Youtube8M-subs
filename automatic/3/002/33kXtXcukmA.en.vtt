tada we got the white lights now which
is<00:00:05.759> much<00:00:05.970> visit<00:00:06.450> more<00:00:06.629> visible<00:00:07.020> from<00:00:07.200> the

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
is much visit more visible from the

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.110 
is much visit more visible from the
other<00:00:07.440> side<00:00:08.240> can<00:00:09.240> see<00:00:09.450> it<00:00:09.540> all<00:00:09.750> over<00:00:09.780> here<00:00:11.120> all

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
other side can see it all over here all

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.400 
other side can see it all over here all
the<00:00:12.269> way<00:00:12.300> over<00:00:12.570> on<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.900> other<00:00:13.019> side<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.320> the

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
the way over on the other side of the

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.990 
the way over on the other side of the
bike<00:00:14.179> almost<00:00:16.369> go<00:00:17.369> ahead<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.670> show<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.880> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
bike almost go ahead and show you the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.519 
bike almost go ahead and show you the
other<00:00:18.060> side

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.019 

BAM<00:00:24.810> much<00:00:25.810> more<00:00:26.140> visible<00:00:26.320> almost<00:00:27.029> probably

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
BAM much more visible almost probably

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.019 
BAM much more visible almost probably
more<00:00:28.689> visible<00:00:29.140> than<00:00:29.200> the<00:00:29.439> stock<00:00:29.770> ones<00:00:30.070> I<00:00:30.400> can

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
more visible than the stock ones I can

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.360 
more visible than the stock ones I can
almost<00:00:31.210> bet<00:00:31.599> because<00:00:31.900> I<00:00:32.320> could<00:00:32.890> swing<00:00:33.129> all<00:00:33.340> the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
almost bet because I could swing all the

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.840 
almost bet because I could swing all the
way<00:00:33.489> around<00:00:33.670> and<00:00:34.030> still<00:00:34.329> see<00:00:34.540> it<00:00:35.220> there<00:00:36.220> almost

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
way around and still see it there almost

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.939 
way around and still see it there almost
to<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.210> other<00:00:37.269> side<00:00:37.739> actually<00:00:39.390> barely

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
to the other side actually barely

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.990 
to the other side actually barely
probably<00:00:41.949> during<00:00:42.070> the<00:00:42.160> day<00:00:42.340> you<00:00:42.400> can't<00:00:42.730> but<00:00:42.879> it

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
probably during the day you can't but it

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.220 
probably during the day you can't but it
might<00:00:43.150> definitely<00:00:43.449> can<00:00:43.750> see<00:00:43.900> it<00:00:43.989> from<00:00:44.080> the

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
might definitely can see it from the

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.079 
might definitely can see it from the
other<00:00:44.290> side<00:00:44.589> this<00:00:45.309> is<00:00:45.400> definitely<00:00:45.610> better

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
other side this is definitely better

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.579 
other side this is definitely better
than<00:00:46.239> the<00:00:46.390> stock<00:00:46.629> ones<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.670> then<00:00:49.500> show<00:00:50.500> you

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
than the stock ones and then show you

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.260 
than the stock ones and then show you
what<00:00:50.710> they<00:00:50.830> look<00:00:50.860> like<00:00:51.100> off

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
what they look like off

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.410 
what they look like off
I'm<00:00:54.270> go<00:00:54.480> ahead<00:00:54.720> and<00:00:55.520> get<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> back<00:00:56.820> give<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
I'm go ahead and get the back give it a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.630 
I'm go ahead and get the back give it a
light<00:00:58.070> she<00:00:59.070> can<00:01:00.060> barely<00:01:00.300> see<00:01:00.600> him<00:01:00.750> over<00:01:00.840> there

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
light she can barely see him over there

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.600 
light she can barely see him over there
from<00:01:02.640> back<00:01:02.970> here<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.390> probably<00:01:03.660> can't<00:01:03.990> even

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
from back here you probably can't even

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.340 
from back here you probably can't even
can't<00:01:05.610> even<00:01:05.700> tell<00:01:08.060> they<00:01:09.060> were<00:01:09.120> 15<00:01:09.780> bucks<00:01:10.110> from

can't even tell they were 15 bucks from

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.240 
can't even tell they were 15 bucks from
autozone<00:01:11.960> just<00:01:12.960> stuck<00:01:13.290> they<00:01:13.560> had<00:01:13.830> self

in up and through the fairing

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.719 
in up and through the fairing
accidentally<00:01:35.670> went<00:01:35.820> over<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.470> this<00:01:37.470> piece<00:01:37.860> on

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
accidentally went over the this piece on

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.210 
accidentally went over the this piece on
accident<00:01:39.320> and<00:01:40.320> wired<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.830> I<00:01:40.860> was<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.040> at

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.460 
no going back now don't have any more
splicers<00:01:44.700> thingies<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.840> we'll<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.050> leave<00:01:46.410> it

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
splicers thingies so we'll just leave it

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.270 
splicers thingies so we'll just leave it
on<00:01:46.590> top<00:01:46.830> which<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.190> fine<00:01:47.430> not<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> big<00:01:48.180> deal

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
on top which is fine not a big deal

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.240 
on top which is fine not a big deal
runner<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.490> goes<00:01:51.180> into<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.479> normal<00:01:52.070> in<00:01:53.070> with

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
runner and goes into the normal in with

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.180 
runner and goes into the normal in with
the<00:01:53.369> rest<00:01:53.550> of<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:54.350> along<00:01:55.350> with<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.530> LEDs<00:01:55.950> on

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
the rest of it along with the LEDs on

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.940 
the rest of it along with the LEDs on
the<00:01:56.280> sides<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:57.080> I<00:01:58.080> can<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:58.259> push<00:01:58.530> them<00:01:58.649> up<00:01:58.770> in

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the sides and I can just push them up in

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.520 
the sides and I can just push them up in
the<00:01:59.009> back<00:01:59.190> up<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.490> here<00:02:00.020> wiring<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.110> gone<00:02:01.289> just

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
the back up in here wiring is gone just

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.630 
the back up in here wiring is gone just
like<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:03.259> so<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.800> is<00:02:05.039> that<00:02:05.630> again<00:02:07.399> give<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.990 

my<00:02:48.040> cat<00:02:48.310> back<00:02:48.550> on

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:08.319 

one

it<00:03:20.390> works<00:03:20.540> pretty<00:03:20.750> good<00:03:22.540> it's<00:03:23.540> almost<00:03:23.750> better

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
it works pretty good it's almost better

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.809 
it works pretty good it's almost better
than<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.319> integrated<00:03:24.769> lights<00:03:24.980> pack<00:03:25.430> just

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
than the integrated lights pack just

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.580 
than the integrated lights pack just
kidding<00:03:27.010> not<00:03:28.010> really<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.370> almost<00:03:28.580> this<00:03:29.590> and
