the speed bench is incline dumbbell
bench<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.370> reason<00:00:50.789> why<00:00:50.879> I'm<00:00:51.000> doing<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.329> is

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
bench and the reason why I'm doing it is

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
because I feel like that is one of the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.549 
because I feel like that is one of the
major<00:00:52.949> components<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:54.210> why<00:00:54.480> my<00:00:54.780> lockouts<00:00:55.320> are

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
major components to why my lockouts are

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.340 
major components to why my lockouts are
weak<00:00:56.070> now<00:00:56.309> I've<00:00:57.149> been<00:00:57.449> neglecting<00:00:57.989> upper

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
weak now I've been neglecting upper

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.290 
weak now I've been neglecting upper
chest<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:58.739> when<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> bench<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.850> barbell

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
chest so when you bench the barbell

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.840 
chest so when you bench the barbell
starts<00:01:00.719> at<00:01:00.870> your<00:01:01.350> upper<00:01:01.680> rib<00:01:01.890> lower<00:01:02.370> nipple

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
starts at your upper rib lower nipple

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.210 
starts at your upper rib lower nipple
area<00:01:03.180> right<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.260> do<00:01:04.439> not<00:01:04.619> bench<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.129> a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
area right and you do not bench in a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.679 
area right and you do not bench in a
straight<00:01:05.460> line<00:01:05.489> when<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.939> complete<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
straight line when you complete the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.780 
straight line when you complete the
bench<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.619> barbell<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.130> actually<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.490> top<00:01:08.610> of

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
bench the barbell is actually on top of

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.920 
bench the barbell is actually on top of
your<00:01:08.909> shoulders<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.270> when<00:01:09.390> you're<00:01:09.510> benching

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
your shoulders so when you're benching

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.230 
your shoulders so when you're benching
that<00:01:10.080> actually<00:01:10.409> curves<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.790> lockout

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
that actually curves up so the lockout

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.330 
that actually curves up so the lockout
portion<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> bench<00:01:13.110> relies<00:01:13.619> heavily<00:01:13.650> on

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
portion of the bench relies heavily on

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.429 
portion of the bench relies heavily on
upper<00:01:14.850> chest<00:01:15.180> which<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.780> haven't<00:01:16.020> been<00:01:16.259> doing
