option<00:00:49.829> that's<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.309> best<00:00:50.520> way<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.700> go<00:00:51.140> also

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
option that's the best way to go also

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.020 
option that's the best way to go also
keep<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.500> mind<00:00:52.530> those<00:00:52.980> vitamins<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.670> minerals

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
keep in mind those vitamins and minerals

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.270 
keep in mind those vitamins and minerals
and<00:00:54.329> especially<00:00:54.719> carbohydrates<00:00:55.199> are<00:00:55.860> needed

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and especially carbohydrates are needed

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.099 
and especially carbohydrates are needed
and<00:00:56.430> very<00:00:56.730> important<00:00:57.300> anytime<00:00:57.930> we're

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
and very important anytime we're

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.810 
and very important anytime we're
starting<00:00:58.350> an<00:00:58.440> exercise<00:00:58.590> program<00:00:59.190> we're

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
starting an exercise program we're

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.760 
starting an exercise program we're
trying<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.359> lose<00:01:00.960> weight<00:01:01.020> or<00:01:01.260> even<00:01:01.620> just

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
trying to lose weight or even just

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.560 
trying to lose weight or even just
sustain<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.280> muscle<00:01:02.730> building<00:01:03.030> type<00:01:03.270> diet

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
sustain that muscle building type diet

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.719 
sustain that muscle building type diet
so<00:01:04.199> again<00:01:04.439> very<00:01:04.619> important<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.460> incorporate

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
so again very important to incorporate

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.170 
so again very important to incorporate
all<00:01:06.150> all<00:01:06.689> sections<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> food<00:01:07.770> groups<00:01:08.180> now

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
all all sections of the food groups now

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.420 
all all sections of the food groups now
keep<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.540> mind<00:01:09.570> any<00:01:10.470> type<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.799> muscle<00:01:11.100> building

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
keep in mind any type of muscle building

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.800 
keep in mind any type of muscle building
diet<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.420> be<00:01:12.540> also

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
diet is going to have to be also

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.710 
diet is going to have to be also
incorporation<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:13.830> an<00:01:13.979> exercise<00:01:14.490> program

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
incorporation with an exercise program

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.359 
incorporation with an exercise program
so<00:01:15.720> try<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.200> more<00:01:16.409> weight<00:01:16.650> resisting<00:01:17.220> and

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
so try to do more weight resisting and

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.850 
so try to do more weight resisting and
muscle<00:01:17.729> building<00:01:18.030> exercises<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:19.650> higher

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
muscle building exercises the higher

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.010 
muscle building exercises the higher
your<00:01:20.130> lean<00:01:20.280> body<00:01:20.310> muscle<00:01:21.090> mass<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.840> higher

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
your lean body muscle mass the higher

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.660 
your lean body muscle mass the higher
and<00:01:22.259> more<00:01:22.350> likely<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.770> are<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.950> replenish

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
and more likely you are to replenish

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.780 
and more likely you are to replenish
that<00:01:23.700> lean<00:01:24.090> body<00:01:24.390> mass<00:01:24.680> now<00:01:25.680> overall<00:01:26.130> when

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
that lean body mass now overall when

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.460 
that lean body mass now overall when
trying<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.180> lose<00:01:27.450> weight<00:01:27.509> or<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.200> again

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
trying to lose weight or just again

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.920 
trying to lose weight or just again
increase<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.280> lean<00:01:29.579> mass<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.540> want<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.840> be

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
increase that lean mass you want to be

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.140 
increase that lean mass you want to be
careful<00:01:31.140> because<00:01:31.380> any<00:01:31.770> excess<00:01:32.369> calories<00:01:32.670> can

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
careful because any excess calories can

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.230 
careful because any excess calories can
also<00:01:33.360> lead<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.780> excess<00:01:34.560> fat<00:01:35.030> regardless<00:01:36.030> if

also lead to excess fat regardless if

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.060 
also lead to excess fat regardless if
