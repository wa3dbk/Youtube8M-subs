other frames on our timeline song in a
right-click<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:25.320> frame<00:01:25.890> 40<00:01:26.369> I'm<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.479> to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
right-click on frame 40 I'm going to

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.499 
right-click on frame 40 I'm going to
click<00:01:27.810> insert<00:01:28.409> keyframe<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.210> will<00:01:30.360> do

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
click insert keyframe and that will do

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.170 
click insert keyframe and that will do
that<00:01:30.689> for<00:01:30.960> me<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.259> will<00:01:31.380> copy<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:32.180> takes

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
that for me that will copy that takes

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.740 
that for me that will copy that takes
into<00:01:33.509> those<00:01:34.049> at<00:01:34.259> 40<00:01:34.619> frames<00:01:35.180> so<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> last<00:01:36.479> step

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
into those at 40 frames so the last step

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.600 
into those at 40 frames so the last step
well<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.710> because<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.280> last<00:01:38.490> step

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
well this because this is the last step

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.830 
well this because this is the last step
it's<00:01:38.790> very<00:01:38.820> easy<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.299> do<00:01:39.420> now<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.409> just<00:01:41.840> make

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
it's very easy to do now is I just make

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.810 
it's very easy to do now is I just make
sure<00:01:42.869> I'm<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.530> final<00:01:44.189> frame<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.640> last

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
sure I'm in the final frame the last

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.569 
sure I'm in the final frame the last
frame<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.270> then<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.930> move<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.680> move<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.369> to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
frame and then I move it I move it to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.340 
frame and then I move it I move it to
the<00:01:47.670> place<00:01:47.909> where<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.149> want<00:01:48.329> my<00:01:48.390> text<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.170> move

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the place where I want my text to move

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.730 
the place where I want my text to move
to<00:01:50.210> so<00:01:51.210> I'm<00:01:51.540> gonna<00:01:51.720> move<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.049> off<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.500> screen

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
to so I'm gonna move it off the screen

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.399 
to so I'm gonna move it off the screen
and<00:01:53.040> then<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:54.060> as<00:01:54.180> if<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.420> was<00:01:54.570> moving<00:01:54.780> text<00:01:55.259> I

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
and then just as if I was moving text I

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.899 
and then just as if I was moving text I
will<00:01:55.680> put<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.869> motion<00:01:57.869> tween<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:59.399> if<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.640> run

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
will put in a motion tween and if I run

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.940 
will put in a motion tween and if I run
that<00:02:00.360> animation<00:02:01.049> no<00:02:03.140> done<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.530> that's<00:02:04.710> all

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
that animation no done and that's all

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.780 
that animation no done and that's all
there<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.490> it

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
there is to it

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.589 
there is to it
so<00:02:06.509> I've<00:02:06.840> created<00:02:07.879> moving<00:02:08.879> text<00:02:09.179> by<00:02:09.300> doing<00:02:09.509> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
so I've created moving text by doing the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.600 
so I've created moving text by doing the
same<00:02:09.840> things<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.259> would<00:02:10.379> do<00:02:10.470> if<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.830> was<00:02:10.979> moving<00:02:11.430> a

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
same things I would do if I was moving a

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.059 
same things I would do if I was moving a
shape<00:02:12.090> or<00:02:12.300> an<00:02:12.390> image

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
shape or an image

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.009 
shape or an image
putting<00:02:14.499> my<00:02:15.499> content<00:02:16.010> into<00:02:16.159> the<00:02:16.280> first<00:02:16.519> frame

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
putting my content into the first frame

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.209 
putting my content into the first frame
inserting<00:02:18.019> a<00:02:18.049> keyframe<00:02:18.409> later<00:02:18.769> on<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.129> the

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:19.219 
inserting a keyframe later on in the

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.069 
inserting a keyframe later on in the
timeline<00:02:19.609> to<00:02:19.790> copy<00:02:19.999> that<00:02:20.239> content<00:02:20.599> into<00:02:20.900> all

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
timeline to copy that content into all

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.800 
timeline to copy that content into all
the<00:02:21.290> frames<00:02:21.939> moving<00:02:22.939> it<00:02:23.090> in<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.480> last

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
the frames moving it in the last

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.140 
the frames moving it in the last
keyframe<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.769> then<00:02:25.219> putting<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.609> motion<00:02:25.969> tween

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
keyframe and then putting a motion tween

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.000 
keyframe and then putting a motion tween
him<00:02:26.409> so<00:02:27.430> that's<00:02:28.430> all<00:02:28.819> there<00:02:29.420> is<00:02:29.480> to<00:02:30.109> it<00:02:30.260> so<00:02:30.859> why

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
him so that's all there is to it so why

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.410 
him so that's all there is to it so why
don't<00:02:31.069> you<00:02:31.250> have<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.430> go<00:02:31.639> at<00:02:31.790> creating<00:02:32.239> some

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
don't you have a go at creating some

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.349 
don't you have a go at creating some
simple<00:02:32.840> moving<00:02:33.170> text<00:02:33.680> using<00:02:34.579> a<00:02:34.700> motion<00:02:35.209> tween

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
simple moving text using a motion tween

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.439 
simple moving text using a motion tween
good<00:02:36.260> luck
