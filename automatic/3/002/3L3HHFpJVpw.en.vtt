00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
to the next page you get to see what

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.090 
to the next page you get to see what
Franklin<00:01:41.880> looks<00:01:42.240> like<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.840> 60<00:01:43.590> years<00:01:43.619> or<00:01:43.950> what

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
Franklin looks like in 60 years or what

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.639 
Franklin looks like in 60 years or what
he<00:01:44.220> imagines<00:01:44.759> himself<00:01:45.540> looking<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.590> I

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
he imagines himself looking like and I

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.480 
he imagines himself looking like and I
think<00:01:46.710> Franklin<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:48.450> 25<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.110> GTA<00:01:49.890> 5<00:01:50.159> so

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
think Franklin is like 25 and GTA 5 so

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.859 
think Franklin is like 25 and GTA 5 so
he'd<00:01:50.640> probably<00:01:50.790> be<00:01:51.000> somewhere<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.390> his<00:01:51.450> 80s

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
he'd probably be somewhere in his 80s

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.780 
he'd probably be somewhere in his 80s
looking<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.759> really

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
looking like this and this is really

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.550 
looking like this and this is really
cool<00:01:54.149> if<00:01:54.360> some<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.689> guys<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:55.020> done<00:01:55.290> this

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
cool if some of you guys have done this

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.800

or been to this website before maybe you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.240 
or been to this website before maybe you
just<00:01:57.960> brushed<00:01:58.320> right<00:01:58.500> over<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.100> went

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
just brushed right over it but I went

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.620 
just brushed right over it but I went
free<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> went<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.790> this<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.149> first<00:02:00.180> time

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
free I went to this for the first time

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.560 
free I went to this for the first time
just<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.680> get<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.890> shirt<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.759> saw<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.210> and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
just to get the shirt and I saw this and

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.030 
just to get the shirt and I saw this and
I<00:02:03.719> thought<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.049> was<00:02:04.110> really<00:02:04.380> cool<00:02:04.530> seeing<00:02:04.590> what

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
I thought it was really cool seeing what

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.550 
I thought it was really cool seeing what
Franklin<00:02:05.490> would<00:02:05.780> kind<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.869> imagine<00:02:07.320> himself

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
Franklin would kind of imagine himself

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.740 
Franklin would kind of imagine himself
to<00:02:07.890> look<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.250> as<00:02:08.459> an<00:02:08.580> old<00:02:08.670> man<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.239> then

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
to look like as an old man and then

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.420 
to look like as an old man and then
seeing<00:02:09.959> him<00:02:10.110> once<00:02:10.259> again<00:02:10.410> what<00:02:10.979> he<00:02:11.039> looks<00:02:11.250> like

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
seeing him once again what he looks like

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.620
