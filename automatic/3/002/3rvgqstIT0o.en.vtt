00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:18.099 

there<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.450> go<00:01:10.040> ok

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:18.109 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:21.740 

it's<00:01:18.530> going<00:01:18.740> away<00:01:18.829> for<00:01:19.039> it<00:01:19.100> to<00:01:19.189> restart

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.510 

this<00:01:22.750> is<00:01:22.900> probably<00:01:23.260> a<00:01:23.350> simplest<00:01:23.830> route<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:26.520> go

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
this is probably a simplest route so go

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.240 
this is probably a simplest route so go
everything<00:01:28.000> is<00:01:28.090> done<00:01:28.240> for<00:01:28.480> you<00:01:28.690> pretty<00:01:29.680> much

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.560 

so<00:01:33.250> I<00:01:33.280> was<00:01:33.400> giving<00:01:33.610> them<00:01:33.670> -<00:01:33.940> just<00:01:34.060> get<00:01:34.300> a<00:01:34.330> minute

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
so I was giving them - just get a minute

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.340 
so I was giving them - just get a minute
to<00:01:34.600> reboot

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
to reboot

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.250
