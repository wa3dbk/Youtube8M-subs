honestly<00:02:59.069> guys<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.910> wish<00:03:00.329> I<00:03:00.420> woulda<00:03:00.569> used<00:03:00.599> him

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
honestly guys I wish I woulda used him

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.050 
honestly guys I wish I woulda used him
in<00:03:00.900> my<00:03:01.049> Dutch<00:03:01.260> squad<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.620> think<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.010> used

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
in my Dutch squad I think I used

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.030 
in my Dutch squad I think I used
Schneider<00:03:03.060> van<00:03:03.390> der<00:03:03.510> Vaart<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:03.870> fair<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.440> I

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
Schneider van der Vaart and fair and I

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.680 
Schneider van der Vaart and fair and I
think<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.579> could<00:03:05.760> have<00:03:05.880> easily<00:03:06.000> sucked<00:03:06.420> him<00:03:06.540> in

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
think I could have easily sucked him in

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.479 
think I could have easily sucked him in
for<00:03:06.930> possibly<00:03:07.590> Schneider<00:03:07.920> because<00:03:08.220> he<00:03:08.400> is

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
for possibly Schneider because he is

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.880 
for possibly Schneider because he is
very<00:03:08.760> good<00:03:08.849> center<00:03:09.180> mid<00:03:09.380> next<00:03:10.380> guy<00:03:10.650> is<00:03:10.709> at
