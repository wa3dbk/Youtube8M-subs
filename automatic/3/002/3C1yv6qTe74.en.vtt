00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 let's take a step back when 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:08.629
 arrived the proposal of the verona what you have 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.629
 thought but I was very happy 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.289
 I had a great emotion 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.480
 and then anyway always with like a father 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.850
 who told me about it all 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.769
 wait very well and then get in 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.720
 this company was was one 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.470
 great and a great satisfaction for me 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.740
 and now I will not look for everyone in all 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.660
 ways not to not cut off the water 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.030
 welcome leaves Verona 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.210
 what he told you aladino you are yours 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.050
 father of verona of the city ​​of verona ma 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.379
 ok thanks for the welcome and nothing e 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.010
 the things Dad told me are many 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.329
 here list her all 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.030
 lose too much time anyway 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.600
 said that a company that he in 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.670
 career really gave so much 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.300
 we say that it is one of which has been found 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.410
 best of all it has shot quite a few 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.990
 they only spoke to me very well 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.299
 from the company that it was anyway 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.700
 different to all the cheering that goes around 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.509
 in Verona he told me absolutely 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.750
 what a good you albinoleffe played 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.220
 as a trequartista and also at Milan 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.899
 Allegri saw you as a playmaker but 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.240
 you also played as a midfielder 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.490
 however it is always offensive and 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.539
 mandorlini has again deployed you as 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.670
 playmaker 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.200
 I asked you and he wanted you 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.500
 try in this role 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.119
 no yes i am the last years there 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.819
 career I made them more or less all from 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.869
 playmaker when I landed 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:44.270
 to Milan and with cheerful and immediately 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.130
 ready off he but seen as like a 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.860
 player who could play behind her 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.759
 is behind the tips and last year 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.619
 albinoleffe the same thing this year 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.840
 mister mandorlini and initially admitted 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.479
 like mezzala in the first training sessions and then 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.909
 from the last two to three workouts before 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.710
 of the match against san giorgio e 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.149
 mama deployed behind the tips so it is 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.549
 it was his choice 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.649
 match against san giorgio topped by 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.989
 a goal in short was a friendly but a 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.329
 player always important to score 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.450
 what do you expect from this Verona yes 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:19.609
 oh well I was happy with the goal 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.030
 even if in a game anyway 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:26.359
 friendly was an emotion anyway 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.400
 huge and play the first game with 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:31.640
 with this shirt 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.280
 nothing now i hope i can prove the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.079
 my value and in the next matches 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.970
 you played you have been a companion of 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.530
 team because you at Milan is aggregated 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.090
 practically all the last season 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.650
 to the first team 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.239
 if he was a friend of Filippo inzaghi 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.970
 what effect it makes you see now that 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.349
 Milan's coach the first year 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.450
 that I had arrived at Milan is really 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:54.409
 he was my teammate 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.700
 it played like it was it was a great one 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.920
 person who helped me too 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.230
 much in anemia in my project of 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.780
 growth was one that was already seen 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.290
 immediately that he loved football in everything and 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.730
 for all 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.659
 he was one who really passed the 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.040
 day in milanello and then liked it 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.040
 everything from series to series c 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.900
 he knew all the players and he is me 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.430
 served a lot because it gave me several 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.349
 advice and therefore does not surprise me 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.799
 see it now as trained the first 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.900
 team changes so much since 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.200
 spring league to a first team 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.109
 you are ending this perhaps 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.159
 process is such an important leap as 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:37.590
 as it seems yes yes without a doubt also 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:41.069
 only the withdrawal before a season 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.590
 totally totally another thing and me 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.590
 I was lucky enough to make two in one 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.720
 important company and therefore we say 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.379
 in this respect I was also a 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.650
 Vantaggiato 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.540
 however I still have much to improve ed 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.930
 increase on a physical level at the level 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.750
 character and I think this is the 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.370
 the best company to be able to do 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.169
 what do you expect from your season a 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.919
 verona that is what your intentions are 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:09.419
 play made to see us you will have gods 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.120
 object yes yes no doubt 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:15.000
 I arrived here we say between 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.620
 quotes from unknown to why 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.109
 however, I haven't shown anything yet 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.560
 so I have to absolutely must 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.020
 demonstrate to the coach of mine 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.599
 quality 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.639
 this is what I will need this year 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:32.000
 above all to that then it is here to say 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:35.090
 I want to play games is not is not the 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.220
 case, however, my wish for 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.659
 this season and to put on 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.940
 difficulty the coach 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:43.310
 the other day I saw mandorlini that a 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.500
 end of training explained to you right 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.940
 a technical gesture seems to me an advance 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.310
 he talks about having understood something like that 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.030
 he had anticipated someone how the 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.800
 relationship with the coach but the coach is me 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.380
 helped me helping me a lot e 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:02.690
 that is, he mimes with the councils even after later 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:05.599
 workouts during then for 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.909
 now I'm having a relationship 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:09.770
 well it is a coach that also with i 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:12.380
 young you see that he has to do with it 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.210
 nor has he had much to do here 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.440
 I believe the press conference of 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.909
 presentation of your father was 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.469
 exactly 20 years ago 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:20.599
 if I'm not mistaken, he gave you some 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:23.449
 advice also as communication in the 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:25.129
 sense in how to relate to the environment 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:29.569
 verona 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:34.520
 no that maybe twenty years ago 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:37.130
 no, however, 18 yes and 18 years ago was the 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.940
 his press conference as no below 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:43.940
 in the aspect of the relationship so I do not 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.650
 he said nothing just told me about it 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.580
 live this one hundred percent 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.770
 emotion as he has always done 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.150
 his memory is almost all the fans 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.729
 however of a person who gave 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.800
 all for this shirt and then 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:00.129
 I will also try to do the same 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.289
 who was the companion who has you 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:04.680
 amazed more when you arrived e 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:09.550
 maybe the one you tied more with 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:15.189
 but that surprised me the most 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:18.819
 player at technical level saying tones 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:19.960
 it is not too easy because in any case 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:21.789
 his age 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.469
 in any case 35 years to do what is 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:25.810
 doing with the desire that he is doing it 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:28.509
 also at the races we do in the morning 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:31.750
 that never gives up a meter he wants 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:32.409
 always doing them all is really to do with them 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.289
 the compliments 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:39.430
 and then all the others however group 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:43.150
 young group that wants to grow 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:45.460
 It is a group that helps you and therefore I am 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.159
 finding it really well, I think it culminates 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:51.219
 you had the 57 as a number you have a 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:55.629
 favorite number you want to wear but a 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:57.639
 I like the 27 I have no reason but me 

00:06:55.629 --> 00:07:00.340
 like this number 57 at milan me 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.889
 they had given it to them because the 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:06.339
 young people usually from 50 to 60 go 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:10.449
 so but given a 57 and I had kept 

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:11.680
 the one there and now here if you accept to 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:14.639
 layout 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.639
 I will take the 27th
