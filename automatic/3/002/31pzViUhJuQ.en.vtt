one<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.180> first<00:02:00.420> tools<00:02:00.690> I<00:02:00.900> would<00:02:00.960> recommend

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
one of the first tools I would recommend

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.650 
one of the first tools I would recommend
you<00:02:01.620> try<00:02:02.040> your<00:02:02.220> hand<00:02:02.400> at<00:02:02.580> sharpening<00:02:03.030> would<00:02:03.510> be

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
you try your hand at sharpening would be

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.450 
you try your hand at sharpening would be
a<00:02:03.690> scraper<00:02:04.110> like<00:02:04.410> you<00:02:04.500> just<00:02:04.680> saw<00:02:04.860> me<00:02:05.010> do<00:02:05.190> is

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
a scraper like you just saw me do is

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.790 
a scraper like you just saw me do is
actually<00:02:05.850> quite<00:02:06.360> simple<00:02:06.660> and<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.620> something

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
actually quite simple and it's something

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.530 
actually quite simple and it's something
that<00:02:07.980> you<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.369> practice<00:02:08.610> with<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.270> build<00:02:09.420> up

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
that you can practice with and build up

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.150 
that you can practice with and build up
your<00:02:09.660> confidence<00:02:09.920> particularly<00:02:10.920> if<00:02:11.010> you're

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
your confidence particularly if you're

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.490 
your confidence particularly if you're
new<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.310> dry<00:02:11.670> grinders<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.360> found<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.380> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
new to dry grinders I found that the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.080 
new to dry grinders I found that the

is put the tool handle in the pocket and
slide<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.850> jig<00:02:39.120> out<00:02:39.300> until<00:02:39.780> I<00:02:39.840> can<00:02:40.080> match<00:02:40.350> up

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
slide the jig out until I can match up

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.340 
slide the jig out until I can match up
the<00:02:40.860> existing<00:02:41.340> bevel<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.690> wheel<00:02:45.350> that

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
the existing bevel to the wheel that

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.840 
the existing bevel to the wheel that
looks<00:02:46.560> pretty<00:02:46.739> good<00:02:47.010> go<00:02:47.220> ahead<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.459> walk<00:02:47.610> that

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
looks pretty good go ahead and walk that

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.560 
looks pretty good go ahead and walk that
down<00:02:48.090> turn<00:02:48.810> on<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.020> grinder<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:50.420> then<00:02:51.420> with

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
down turn on the grinder and then with

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.990 
down turn on the grinder and then with
the<00:02:51.660> gentle<00:02:51.930> touch<00:02:52.170> just<00:02:53.130> go<00:02:53.310> about<00:02:53.610> grinding

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
the gentle touch just go about grinding

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.620 
the gentle touch just go about grinding
that<00:02:54.330> edge

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:16.500 

[Laughter]

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.490 

now<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.750> do<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:17.990> a<00:03:18.260> nice<00:03:18.470> clean<00:03:18.709> bevel<00:03:19.220> I<00:03:20.500> can

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
now to do it a nice clean bevel I can

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.260 
now to do it a nice clean bevel I can
use<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.739> same<00:03:21.950> technique<00:03:22.430> for<00:03:22.940> different

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
use the same technique for different

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.809 
use the same technique for different
types<00:03:23.480> of<00:03:23.630> spindle<00:03:24.380> geologists<00:03:24.860> I<00:03:25.010> simply<00:03:25.640> put

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
types of spindle geologists I simply put

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.960 
types of spindle geologists I simply put
the<00:03:26.140> end<00:03:27.140> of<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.380> tool<00:03:27.620> into<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.430> pocket<00:03:28.819> and

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
the end of the tool into the pocket and

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.170 
the end of the tool into the pocket and
then<00:03:29.390> slide<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:30.140> V<00:03:30.319> arm<00:03:30.560> up<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.370> then<00:03:31.970> match

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
then slide the V arm up and then match

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.920 
then slide the V arm up and then match
up<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.950> tool<00:03:33.950> bevel<00:03:34.610> angle<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.480> wheel<00:03:35.690> and

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
up the tool bevel angle to the wheel and

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.930 
up the tool bevel angle to the wheel and
I<00:03:36.380> go<00:03:36.530> about<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.860> process<00:03:36.890> of<00:03:37.459> grinding<00:03:37.640> it

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
I go about the process of grinding it

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.309 
I go about the process of grinding it
just<00:03:38.239> like<00:03:38.390> I<00:03:38.480> did<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.870> spindle<00:03:39.200> roughing

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
just like I did the spindle roughing

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.090 
just like I did the spindle roughing
gouge<00:03:40.780> one<00:03:41.780> of<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:41.989> more<00:03:42.170> challenging<00:03:42.500> tools

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
gouge one of the more challenging tools

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.570 
gouge one of the more challenging tools
to<00:03:43.400> sharpen<00:03:43.849> is<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:45.019> bowl<00:03:45.170> gouge<00:03:45.440> and<00:03:46.400> for

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
to sharpen is the bowl gouge and for

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.530 
to sharpen is the bowl gouge and for
that<00:03:46.700> reason<00:03:46.760> I<00:03:47.420> added<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:49.010> very<00:03:49.280> grind<00:03:49.610> jig

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
that reason I added the very grind jig

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.289 
that reason I added the very grind jig
to<00:03:50.959> my<00:03:51.110> setup<00:03:51.440> it's<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.489> device<00:03:52.819> that<00:03:53.209> the

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
to my setup it's the device that the

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.400 
to my setup it's the device that the
hole<00:03:53.660> to<00:03:53.930> hold<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.680> tool<00:03:55.569> in<00:03:56.569> the<00:03:56.750> fixture<00:03:57.080> and

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
hole to hold the tool in the fixture and

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.050 
hole to hold the tool in the fixture and
allow<00:03:58.130> you<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.700> consistently<00:03:59.569> sharpen<00:04:00.110> that

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
allow you to consistently sharpen that

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.509 
allow you to consistently sharpen that
tool<00:04:02.060> I<00:04:02.390> have<00:04:03.049> a<00:04:03.080> block<00:04:03.680> of<00:04:03.830> wood<00:04:03.860> with<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:04.250> hole

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
that this particular setting of arm

that this particular setting of arm
works<00:05:33.230> well<00:05:33.590> for<00:05:33.620> my<00:05:34.010> particular<00:05:34.340> gouges<00:05:35.180> and

works well for my particular gouges and

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.480 
works well for my particular gouges and
I<00:05:35.570> find<00:05:35.840> that<00:05:35.990> I<00:05:36.050> tend<00:05:36.440> not<00:05:36.500> to<00:05:36.650> change<00:05:37.100> the

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
I find that I tend not to change the

I find that I tend not to change the
setup<00:05:37.880> I<00:05:38.090> had<00:05:38.780> to<00:05:38.900> go<00:05:39.020> through<00:05:39.260> a<00:05:39.290> little<00:05:39.470> bit

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
rarely alter that setting in fact I've

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.310 
rarely alter that setting in fact I've
scribe<00:05:50.270> a<00:05:50.420> line<00:05:50.450> right<00:05:50.870> here<00:05:51.020> which<00:05:51.200> you

scribe a line right here which you

prefer to have the arm positioned and in

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
set in the middle of that notch so I

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.630 
set in the middle of that notch so I
would<00:06:02.930> encourage<00:06:03.140> you<00:06:03.470> to<00:06:03.830> once<00:06:04.040> you<00:06:04.190> find<00:06:04.460> a

it now if I want to grind away part of
the<00:06:10.940> heel<00:06:11.360> back<00:06:11.660> here<00:06:12.050> I<00:06:12.200> can<00:06:12.800> do<00:06:13.010> that<00:06:13.310> by

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
the heel back here I can do that by

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.730 
the heel back here I can do that by
altering<00:06:14.930> the<00:06:15.170> B<00:06:15.350> arm<00:06:15.590> and<00:06:15.890> I<00:06:16.340> can<00:06:17.500> slide<00:06:18.500> the

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
altering the B arm and I can slide the

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.070 
altering the B arm and I can slide the
the<00:06:19.010> jig<00:06:19.280> up<00:06:19.520> maybe<00:06:19.910> three-quarters<00:06:20.870> of<00:06:20.900> an

inch or so and lock it back down and
then<00:06:24.680> go<00:06:24.830> through<00:06:25.100> the<00:06:25.220> process<00:06:25.760> of<00:06:25.880> grinding

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
then go through the process of grinding

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.290 
then go through the process of grinding
to<00:06:26.750> remove<00:06:27.620> part<00:06:28.070> of<00:06:28.130> that<00:06:28.280> heel<00:06:28.580> which<00:06:28.940> I've

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
to remove part of that heel which I've

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.690 
to remove part of that heel which I've
done<00:06:29.660> right<00:06:29.870> here<00:06:30.170> maybe<00:06:30.410> you<00:06:30.590> can<00:06:30.770> see<00:06:30.980> that<00:06:31.010> I

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.590 

would<00:06:34.700> like<00:06:34.820> to<00:06:34.940> give<00:06:35.060> you<00:06:35.150> an<00:06:35.240> exact

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 
would like to give you an exact

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.240 
would like to give you an exact
recommendation<00:06:36.290> on<00:06:36.380> how<00:06:36.440> to<00:06:36.590> set<00:06:36.830> up<00:06:36.920> the<00:06:37.040> very

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
recommendation on how to set up the very

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.640 
recommendation on how to set up the very
grind<00:06:37.550> for<00:06:38.240> your<00:06:38.450> particular<00:06:38.750> grinder<00:06:39.410> but

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
grind for your particular grinder but

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.360 
grind for your particular grinder but
the<00:06:39.770> reality<00:06:40.310> is<00:06:40.460> that's<00:06:40.670> rather<00:06:40.910> difficult

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
the reality is that's rather difficult

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.820 
the reality is that's rather difficult
to<00:06:41.490> do<00:06:41.669> your<00:06:42.240> grinder<00:06:42.660> setup<00:06:43.050> maybe<00:06:43.260> different

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
to do your grinder setup maybe different

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.370 
to do your grinder setup maybe different
the<00:06:44.340> distance<00:06:44.729> of<00:06:44.910> the<00:06:45.030> base<00:06:45.240> to<00:06:45.600> your<00:06:46.110> wheel

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
the distance of the base to your wheel

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.409 
the distance of the base to your wheel
would<00:06:47.070> probably<00:06:47.580> be<00:06:47.729> different<00:06:48.060> than<00:06:48.210> mine

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 
would probably be different than mine

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:49.969 
would probably be different than mine
you<00:06:48.840> might<00:06:49.050> be<00:06:49.169> using<00:06:49.350> a<00:06:49.500> different<00:06:49.590> type

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 
you might be using a different type

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:52.879 
you might be using a different type
gouge<00:06:50.400> or<00:06:51.020> trying<00:06:52.020> to<00:06:52.139> achieve<00:06:52.410> a<00:06:52.440> different

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:52.889 
gouge or trying to achieve a different

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:55.670 
gouge or trying to achieve a different
type<00:06:53.130> grind<00:06:53.729> so<00:06:54.389> it's<00:06:54.780> just<00:06:54.870> a<00:06:54.990> process<00:06:55.470> that

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
type grind so it's just a process that

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.870 
type grind so it's just a process that
you'll<00:06:55.979> have<00:06:56.160> to<00:06:56.280> go<00:06:56.370> through<00:06:56.400> on<00:06:56.669> your<00:06:56.699> own

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 
you'll have to go through on your own

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.629 
you'll have to go through on your own
and<00:06:57.389> determine<00:06:58.260> what<00:06:58.380> setup<00:06:58.770> works<00:06:59.070> well<00:06:59.370> for

00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 
and determine what setup works well for

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:02.000 
and determine what setup works well for
you<00:06:59.820> but<00:07:00.660> once<00:07:00.960> you've<00:07:01.110> done<00:07:01.320> that<00:07:01.380> you'll<00:07:01.860> be

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
you but once you've done that you'll be

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.010 
you but once you've done that you'll be
very<00:07:02.040> happy<00:07:02.370> with<00:07:02.940> the<00:07:03.090> speed<00:07:03.270> in<00:07:03.630> which<00:07:03.660> you

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 
very happy with the speed in which you

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.010 
very happy with the speed in which you
can<00:07:04.260> resharpen<00:07:04.800> a<00:07:05.280> gouge<00:07:06.000> particularly<00:07:06.780> with

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 
can resharpen a gouge particularly with

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.409 
can resharpen a gouge particularly with
the<00:07:07.260> the<00:07:07.710> bowl<00:07:07.889> gouge<00:07:08.160> the<00:07:08.550> swept-back<00:07:08.850> wings

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:09.419 
the the bowl gouge the swept-back wings

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:11.750 
the the bowl gouge the swept-back wings
that<00:07:09.750> most<00:07:09.930> of<00:07:10.080> us<00:07:10.199> like<00:07:10.440> that's<00:07:11.010> kind<00:07:11.460> of<00:07:11.550> hard

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:11.760 
that most of us like that's kind of hard

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.400 
that most of us like that's kind of hard
to<00:07:11.850> do<00:07:12.030> freehand<00:07:12.690> in<00:07:12.810> a<00:07:12.870> very<00:07:13.050> consistent

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.410 
to do freehand in a very consistent

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.469 
to do freehand in a very consistent
manner<00:07:13.800> but<00:07:14.430> again<00:07:14.699> that's<00:07:14.910> one<00:07:15.060> of<00:07:15.090> the<00:07:15.240> big

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479 
manner but again that's one of the big

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:17.450 
manner but again that's one of the big
advantages<00:07:15.630> of<00:07:16.110> using<00:07:16.470> the<00:07:16.560> jig<00:07:16.800> based<00:07:17.039> system

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.460 
advantages of using the jig based system

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.250 
advantages of using the jig based system
I<00:07:17.610> think<00:07:18.120> you'll<00:07:18.240> be<00:07:18.360> happy<00:07:18.389> once<00:07:18.930> you<00:07:19.139> go

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.260 
I think you'll be happy once you go

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.029 
I think you'll be happy once you go
through<00:07:19.440> the<00:07:19.530> process<00:07:20.039> of<00:07:20.190> setting<00:07:20.430> it<00:07:20.669> up<00:07:22.039> in

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 
through the process of setting it up in

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:25.460 
through the process of setting it up in
the<00:07:23.190> next<00:07:23.310> video<00:07:23.570> we'll<00:07:24.570> cover<00:07:24.810> using<00:07:25.320> the

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:25.470 
the next video we'll cover using the

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.610 
the next video we'll cover using the
very<00:07:25.740> grind<00:07:26.070> to<00:07:26.370> the<00:07:26.870> skew<00:07:27.870> attachment<00:07:28.500> and

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:28.620 
very grind to the skew attachment and

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.770 
very grind to the skew attachment and
the<00:07:29.039> dressing<00:07:29.430> attachment<00:07:30.030> I<00:07:30.150> hope<00:07:30.449> this<00:07:30.630> has

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.780 
the dressing attachment I hope this has

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:37.810 
the dressing attachment I hope this has
been<00:07:30.810> helpful<00:07:31.310> thanks<00:07:32.310> for<00:07:32.460> watching

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:37.820 

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.220 

you

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:39.230
