this<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.740> many<00:01:55.829> cases<00:01:55.979> if<00:01:56.880> there's<00:01:57.570> a

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
this is that in many cases if there's a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.840 
this is that in many cases if there's a
generous<00:01:58.649> cutout<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.280> handle<00:01:59.700> that

generous cutout in the handle that

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.429 
generous cutout in the handle that
allows<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.299> release<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.899> lock<00:02:01.079> on<00:02:01.350> the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
allows you to release the lock on the

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.469 
allows you to release the lock on the
knife<00:02:01.590> under<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.729> pressure<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.210> either

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
knife under the pressure of either

knife under the pressure of either
ballistic<00:02:03.990> cutting<00:02:04.320> or<00:02:04.469> heavy<00:02:04.890> utilitarian

ballistic cutting or heavy utilitarian

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.490 
ballistic cutting or heavy utilitarian
cutting<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.509> possible<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.200> actually

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
cutting it's possible to actually

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.930 
cutting it's possible to actually
release<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.860> lock<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.340> knife<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.759> cause

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
release the lock of the knife and cause

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.960 
release the lock of the knife and cause
the<00:02:09.119> blade<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.420> close<00:02:09.629> on<00:02:09.810> your<00:02:09.899> fingers<00:02:10.289> there

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
the blade to close on your fingers there

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.690 
the blade to close on your fingers there
good<00:02:11.180> idea<00:02:11.480> in<00:02:12.170> this<00:02:12.350> case<00:02:12.590> it's<00:02:13.040> ground<00:02:13.340> flush

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
good idea in this case it's ground flush

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.060 
good idea in this case it's ground flush
so<00:02:14.300> closing<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.810> knife<00:02:14.960> is<00:02:15.230> a<00:02:15.260> deliberate<00:02:15.830> but

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
so closing the knife is a deliberate but

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.100 
so closing the knife is a deliberate but
not<00:02:16.220> difficult<00:02:16.730> effort<00:02:17.120> what<00:02:17.600> that<00:02:17.750> means<00:02:17.960> is

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
not difficult effort what that means is

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.420 
not difficult effort what that means is
the<00:02:18.200> knife<00:02:18.350> will<00:02:18.530> stay<00:02:18.680> open<00:02:18.860> when<00:02:19.130> you<00:02:19.220> want

the knife will stay open when you want

the knife will stay open when you want
it<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:19.970> will<00:02:20.330> only<00:02:20.480> close<00:02:20.840> when<00:02:21.260> you

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
it to and it will only close when you

it to and it will only close when you
