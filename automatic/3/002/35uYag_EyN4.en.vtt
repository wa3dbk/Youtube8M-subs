00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
in bloom you should use just a little

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.320 
in bloom you should use just a little
bit<00:02:22.940> of<00:02:23.120> fertilizer<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.590> water<00:02:25.330> teeny

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.360 
basically it they just fill the water to
the<00:02:43.160> base<00:02:43.690> of<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:45.049> plant<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.829> you<00:02:46.010> want<00:02:46.280> to

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
the base of the plant and you want to

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.979 
the base of the plant and you want to
make<00:02:46.519> sure<00:02:46.959> that<00:02:49.420> your<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:53.630> want<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.810> make

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
make sure that your you want to make

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.190 
make sure that your you want to make
sure<00:02:54.170> that<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:55.670> water<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.540> top<00:02:56.750> of<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.989> water

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
sure that the water the top of the water

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.809 
sure that the water the top of the water
isn't<00:02:57.470> touching<00:03:00.160> otherwise<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.400> bottom<00:03:01.670> they

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
isn't touching otherwise the bottom they

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.020 
isn't touching otherwise the bottom they
will<00:03:02.750> roll<00:03:02.989> yellow<00:03:03.319> and<00:03:03.799> fall<00:03:04.280> off<00:03:04.489> I<00:03:04.670> had<00:03:04.850> that

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
will roll yellow and fall off I had that

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.259 
will roll yellow and fall off I had that
happen<00:03:05.389> a<00:03:05.450> couple<00:03:05.480> times<00:03:06.670> again<00:03:07.670> I'm<00:03:07.970> still

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
happen a couple times again I'm still

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.800 
happen a couple times again I'm still
learning<00:03:08.480> this<00:03:08.810> message<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:10.000> I'm<00:03:11.000> see<00:03:11.359> where

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
learning this message so I'm see where

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.410 
learning this message so I'm see where
it<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.769> there<00:03:13.959> so<00:03:14.959> it's<00:03:15.109> at<00:03:15.319> the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
it is there so it's at the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.130 
it is there so it's at the
base<00:03:16.900> of<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.710> plant<00:03:18.070> right<00:03:18.370> there<00:03:18.430> actually<00:03:19.360> I

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
base of the plant right there actually I

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.070 
base of the plant right there actually I
probably<00:03:20.950> just<00:03:21.250> dump<00:03:22.240> out<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.450> little<00:03:22.720> bit<00:03:22.900> more

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
probably just dump out a little bit more

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:32.730 
probably just dump out a little bit more
water<00:03:30.570> because<00:03:31.570> the<00:03:31.750> roots<00:03:31.990> there<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:32.590> go

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
water because the roots there you go

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.530 
water because the roots there you go
that's<00:03:32.980> about<00:03:33.220> it<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.430> example<00:03:34.000> right<00:03:34.120> there

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.300 

yeah<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.410> roots<00:03:38.650> will<00:03:38.830> suck<00:03:39.130> all<00:03:39.250> the

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
yeah so the roots will suck all the

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.690 
yeah so the roots will suck all the
water<00:03:39.460> up<00:03:39.910> so<00:03:40.720> again<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:41.020> soak<00:03:41.980> this<00:03:42.190> in<00:03:42.459> two

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
water up so again I soak this in two

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.160 
water up so again I soak this in two
days<00:03:42.910> straight<00:03:43.560> it's<00:03:44.560> 28<00:03:44.980> hours<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.780> Saturday

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
days straight it's 28 hours so Saturday

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.199 
days straight it's 28 hours so Saturday
morning<00:03:47.650> which<00:03:48.190> means<00:03:48.220> Monday<00:03:48.850> morning<00:03:49.150> I'm

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
morning which means Monday morning I'm

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.660 
morning which means Monday morning I'm
going<00:03:49.330> to<00:03:49.450> dump<00:03:49.600> out<00:03:49.780> all<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.170> water<00:03:50.520> so<00:03:51.520> there

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
going to dump out all the water so there

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.960 
going to dump out all the water so there
you<00:03:51.790> go<00:03:51.940> that's<00:03:52.480> good<00:03:52.750> basically<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:54.250> like<00:03:54.850> I

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
mentioned since this is in bloom I do

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.100 
mentioned since this is in bloom I do
not<00:03:59.020> add<00:03:59.800> fertilizer
