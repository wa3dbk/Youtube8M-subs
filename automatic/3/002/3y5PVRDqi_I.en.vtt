I'm not mentioning any brand names of
screen<00:01:14.320> protectors<00:01:14.890> firstly<00:01:15.640> because<00:01:16.000> the

screen protectors firstly because the

secondly because this issue appears to

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.649 
secondly because this issue appears to
be<00:01:20.740> so<00:01:20.920> rare<00:01:21.189> that<00:01:21.340> it's<00:01:21.490> highly<00:01:21.969> unlikely<00:01:22.119> it

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
be so rare that it's highly unlikely it

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:31.530 
be so rare that it's highly unlikely it
will<00:01:22.780> affect<00:01:23.049> your<00:01:23.200> g2<00:01:23.469> anyway
