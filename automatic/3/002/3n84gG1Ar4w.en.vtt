00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.349
 monster massacre Manfred mutzel perk 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.719
 monster manfred munter mutzel slaughters 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.099
 what this tongue-twister should tell you 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.199
 except that the responsible editor 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.539
 an acute poverty of ideas in matters video 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.060
 It suffers time again 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.279
 monster to slaughter if you're awake 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.260
 side or not is up to you 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.400
 and if you 're manfred you can 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.400
 blame your parents 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.820
 Cars and story of the incredible 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.680
 adventures of van helsing 2 closes 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:49.020
 directly to the predecessor and it exactly 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:50.610
 like there just because the action role-playing game 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.500
 shortly after the editorial deadline 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.120
 current pc games appeared there 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.010
 Here is just a preview video based on the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.020
 preorder beta the test and the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.360
 rating is online on pc games 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.830
 and in the next booklet 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.180
 there we can also give you more about the 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.500
 six different classes and 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.720
 tell your differences 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.759
 the days of a class system from the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.100
 Predecessors are counted in any case 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.690
 nice players of the predecessor allowed 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.160
 their old heroes, including all 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.160
 Import skills and items 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.219
 well-known besides the hero is also the 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.140
 hit feedback opponents respond 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.299
 attacks with as much dynamism as one 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.560
 piece of wood that makes the fighting like in the 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.560
 predecessor tiring for a long time 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.660
 still has some ideas in luggage 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.970
 especially the tower defense aspect of the 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.600
 predecessor developer neopor has strong 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.670
 expanded 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.040
 so there is already one at the beginning of the game 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.630
 great battle in the pc in soldiers 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.670
 commands are in order 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.670
 To stop approaching ki enemies 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.770
 You also do several small ones 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.910
 tasks in between discussed here 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.220
 about an ally about that 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.630
 battlefield good idea and that leaves 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.660
 hopefully more varianz the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.500
 close tasks in the later game 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.690
 level rises and skill system 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.480
 work exactly like in the predecessor 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.670
 you distribute points on attributes 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.349
 magic tricks and eyes very motivating 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.489
 and thanks to the sophisticated control system 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.489
 most comfortable 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.410
 By the way, there are also special 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.030
 powerful perks that give you special bonuses 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.530
 how to lend a larger inventory 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.400
 you already know everything from the 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.959
 predecessor to do new part 2 after 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.130
 quests you can between right below 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.130
 choose three rewards 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.190
 genre-typical, there are lots of clutter 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.380
 to find with your your hero 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.750
 equips the number was compared 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.670
 to the predecessor greatly increased over 400 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.060
 Items should now be well over 1000 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.280
 give 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.840
 so far we have not enough time with the 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.730
 beta spent and a final 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.239
 judgment on the quality of the system too 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.500
 allow 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.500
 But makes a good impression 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.620
 spare equipment you invite yours 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.540
 Ghost companion Katharina on the lady 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.250
 collects on request even automatically invited 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.620
 manufactures the stuff in the next town 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.920
 buy herbal tinctures on her own and 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.239
 also fights with super practical 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.790
 she has her own attributes and skills 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:39.550
 moreover, too 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.890
 thomas friends privately brian borghorst 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.810
 Katharina and the rest of the Npcs wear 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.050
 also with their silly dialogues to 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:51.400
 winking humor of the game 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:53.290
 brian have nothing to laugh about 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.050
 Meanwhile, the opponents if you the combo 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.940
 system wisely use skills 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.860
 namely with up to three power ups 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.590
 at the same time, you reinforce your fight 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.750
 activates this one pressure on the 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.940
 Spacebar provided they have enough anger 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.680
 this third resource will be up 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.540
 the user interface as a yellow pillar 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.860
 represented and regenerated by 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.930
 to meet 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.370
 in his secret refuge can 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.140
 protagonist van helsing recently 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.329
 make strategic decisions 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.610
 so you npc captains on mission 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.170
 send the automatically expire and 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.940
 take a certain amount of time 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.520
 Similar to the Assassin's Guild in 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.960
 Assassin's creed the captains go up 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.940
 in the struggle and command before 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.350
 trained soldiers of successful 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.660
 Completed orders bring them 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.000
 magic items with one for the 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.500
 genre unusual mechanics on the we 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.690
 In the test, take a closer look 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.160
 be just like on the 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.020
 predecessor known tower defense 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.820
 In which we take refuge 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.320
 with self-placed fall against 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.650
 to defend hordes of things again 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.430
 have to 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.110
 but everything is completely optional so far 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.250
 Part 2 of the van Helsing adventure 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.260
 a good impression 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.390
 Who likes the predecessor 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.070
 most likely for just 15 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.910
 euro would slay replenishment on one 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.800
 similar high level 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.390
 the innovations, however, keep themselves in 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.100
 limits and weaknesses at the hit 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.820
 neo chorus still does not have feedback 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.510
 ironed out 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.590
 who does not mind that may access 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.970
 However, it is still questionable whether this time 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.440
 the multiplayer mode reasonable 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.440
 works if not exist
