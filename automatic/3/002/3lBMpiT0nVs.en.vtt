00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.930
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.520
 second tutorial today shows you 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:25.880
 reduced the installation of a hobby 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:27.440
 gears are this year tabea cc 0 1 there is 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.190
 Two big advantages for the installation of one 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.750
 reduced ibis first star of the engine 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.250
 now you have a lot more power you can do a lot 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.250
 master larger slopes 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.850
 secondly, you do not need bicycles with it 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.260
 integrated hand brake function more 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.160
 at vehicle is now alone by the 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.160
 gear on the mountain held 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.600
 but where there is light is also shadow here 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.600
 the two major disadvantages of the renovation 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.610
 in the cloud 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.230
 and the top speed of the car 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.230
 for the faces 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.290
 Sorry but if you guys 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.620
 Disadvantages do not disturb, I show you 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.610
 now how to install the ctc gearbox 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.860
 the following is needed for installation 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.230
 first, of course, the reduced of 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.390
 hpi included in the set are all 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.530
 needed screws and the required 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.530
 riddle with 15 10 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.659
 you also need a module 0.6 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.789
 Motors are 20 10 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.590
 and of course you need a tamiya cc 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.450
 01 chassis we have different 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.469
 must make modifications so 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.469
 the gear fits in 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.290
 Let's go 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.710
 opens the four screws of the gear 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.710
 cover it 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.840
 and remove the blanket 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.630
 Who now the motor out 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.040
 Now look at the engine from the engine 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.610
 plate and also removed that 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.610
 mother puzzle 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.480
 now install the puzzle from the hobby 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.480
 set to the engine 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.180
 yahoo 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.980
 open the three screws of the fce 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.280
 geared and carefully removed the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.280
 cover 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.930
 remove the two gears from the 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.930
 transmission 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.180
 and here now the shown gear 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.180
 bottom plate to the engine 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.580
 Now you can all the gears again 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.580
 use 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.010
 Pay attention to the small parking disc 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.370
 which at the top of the small hall 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.370
 coming 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.480
 Check again if the gears 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:27.680
 could mesh cleanly now 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.680
 that close the shoots again 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.049
 The next step is now the assembly 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.370
 is engine holder the engine can be in two 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.890
 installed in different positions 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.170
 be once for the use of a 16 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.049
 third the second position is for the 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.180
 installing a it 20.10 while our engine 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.590
 is with 20 10 must be used 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.590
 we use this position 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.670
 Now look at the engine to the engine 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.720
 holder that i have the hpi logo on the 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.720
 right side is located 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.100
 now assemble the 20 pay engine puzzle 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.590
 that's how it looks 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.229
 as you can see what the motor with the 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.669
 no longer drive into the chassis 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.669
 therefore we have to remove this part 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.760
 after we have this part in fair and 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.760
 have the motor fits now clean again 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.689
 please note you can the original 

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:52.100
 Battery bay no longer 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:53.690
 use 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.500
 So you have to find a new place for 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.500
 or find batteries 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.759
 The gear cover also fits 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.849
 not anymore and needs to be modified 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.849
 become 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.660
 Yes 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.690
 After processing, the gear should be 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.690
 blanket look something like this 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.040
 at this point also has to 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.040
 to be reworked 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.410
 Here you can look again 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.430
 which place the gear ceiling 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.430
 should be cut 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:52.330
 now you can change yours 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:53.650
 gear cover looks again 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.930
 only the four gear lids 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.570
 screw in again 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.900
 finished a lot of fun with your modified 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.900
 vehicle
