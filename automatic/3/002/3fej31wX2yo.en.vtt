00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:10.950
 Well, it was possible to pile up the chain tie 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:13.580
 between the bolts securing the right of the left 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.300
 front wing 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:22.380
 here it is the lanyard here the chain goes up 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:28.859
 the next one is talking like a chain is stretched like 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:32.460
 bowstring so from the goal fit very 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.570
 successfully literally in millimeters 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.440
 here you can see between the oil 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.010
 some kind of module neck 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:47.399
 literally cracks in millimeter well, I had to 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.379
 take some covers off 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.489
 battery similar to remove together 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.600
 air filter 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:59.070
 we are nonsense now muzzle tied 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:03.750
 not going anywhere is very important 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:09.060
 because I have to edit the front 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:14.939
 namely, set the distance between 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.040
 these two holes 1 and 2 on these 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.810
 the hole is attached to the radiator cover and 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.229
 fan must be a distance 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.490
 well about eighty three centimeters a 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:32.540
 we look 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.869
 Well, you can see that about 80 here I am 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.590
 need three centimeters 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:42.140
 distance to return the car 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.380
 when I will do it then I can 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.800
 can part and the gap will run away here 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:53.620
 lest he run away 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:59.290
 set aside this chain tie and see 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:02.230
 what will happen next 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.510
 little time hood is almost seated 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.630
 in order for it to occupy the right 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.630
 position in the doorway had to die 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.690
 loop it turned out pretty simple 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:18.190
 deed because every loop has here 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:22.240
 such is the rectangular cut of it 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:26.560
 the carob key was inserted 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:29.380
 well and then sleight of hand and no 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.680
 fraud on the right side of the loop 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:38.110
 arranged in the same way apparently 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.490
 from hitting the loop a little bit overclocked here 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.750
 and had to return them to the original 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:47.230
 state here it is done like this 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.490
 inserted and conveniently into any 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:55.150
 the side can be bent 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:58.080
 the key from being allowed on the brow 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.690
 will be put in place that is here 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:06.209
 this is the right eyebrow 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:10.690
 this is the left here actually 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:16.480
 the only control size is 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:19.750
 the distance between these right here 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.400
 this left to the hole between them should 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.790
 be between their centers 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.470
 there must be a distance of 8 3 centimeters and 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.470
 I draw a ruler here 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:40.100
 so a second and here it turns out 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:48.280
 approximately eighty three centimeters then 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:53.470
 there is everything here as they say ok 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:57.860
 editing was very simple 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.630
 laid lies ruler and sledgehammer of course 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.220
 These devices are not very in tune between 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:08.320
 myself, but life is not going anywhere 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:11.630
 I took a stick like this 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:16.070
 or let's say more academic cut 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:18.500
 wood rested here and then not 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:22.670
 hit him hard with a sledgehammer first 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.830
 on the right side now and then on the left, I 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.430
 can't draw this trick when u 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.340
 I have one hand busy with the camera, please 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:35.690
 believe my word for three not 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:39.980
 bounces right and left and size 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:43.490
 caught up with the base from being able to 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:47.690
 not parted protected kept here 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:52.060
 this here is a chain tie she nervously 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:54.320
 shuddered while I showered 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.760
 front of a hail of blows 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:02.390
 but nothing on their business done here 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.780
 because if you look after all 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.780
 these procedures 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.340
 the gap they parted rather face not 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.900
 parted 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.380
 Well, the gaps are more or less 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:21.970
 adequate here they are of course a little 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.690
 too big in my opinion of the tender 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.849
 a little bit 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:29.789
 but exactly the same here 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:33.959
 and the hood sits very well here 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:37.619
 here he was overwhelmed by what was 

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:39.959
 bent hinges on this side too 

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:42.409
 was slightly littered to a lesser extent 

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:48.020
 than on the right but still 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:51.740
 here it is not very good as it's hood 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:54.869
 here stands above the wing 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.509
 but it will have to earn some money here 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:06:00.599
 rubber director he is not regulated 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:04.019
 Well, you have to connect it maybe 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:08.610
 after i have already gathered all ahead 

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:09.259
 and the hood will lock the lock well 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.729
 now 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:16.860
 general fawn well cheered here 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:21.080
 the only procedure that I 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:26.569
 it remains to check what position 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:30.089
 there is a butt this is the cilia in front 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:33.300
 right and left the thing is that throughout 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:35.879
 visibility from the blow did not go back to me 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.149
 some degree will have to return them 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:44.629
 By the way here by the way I can show more 

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:47.009
 one control meter that I took 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:49.740
 these measurements had to be done 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:53.819
 almost any of us when they 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.629
 made for example the door to the dacha 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:58.050
 to the outhouse 

00:06:54.629 --> 00:07:00.499
 This diagonal measurements here abut 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.499
 ruler 

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:08.490
 one edge here 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:11.400
 measure the distance well, that's where it is 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:15.320
 it turned out nine hundred and forty five 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:20.450
 millimeters here here here 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:22.160
 but also remove the ruler another diagonal 

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:25.050
 look here 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:28.260
 Well, also about the same nine 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:32.100
 forty five millimeters it's like 

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:35.130
 indirect sign that you can 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:39.300
 especially not skewed since i'm very 

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:41.970
 I hope that the lower crossbar is on 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:46.380
 the place because it is from a blow 

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:47.720
 did not suffer the whole blow came all 

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:52.350
 top part 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:56.340
 directly hood itself about here 

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:59.270
 such is the case here already accurate 

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.270
 present day
