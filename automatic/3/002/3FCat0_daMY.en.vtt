those were covered words meant no that
would<00:01:17.440> be<00:01:17.470> equivalent<00:01:17.860> to<00:01:18.160> like<00:01:18.280> crossing

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
would be equivalent to like crossing

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.810 
would be equivalent to like crossing
this<00:01:19.090> out<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.570> it<00:01:22.720> would<00:01:22.810> be<00:01:22.960> really<00:01:23.470> really

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
this out and it would be really really

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.899 
this out and it would be really really
hard<00:01:24.820> to<00:01:25.600> answer<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.960> question<00:01:26.440> like<00:01:26.470> this

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
hard to answer a question like this

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.010 
hard to answer a question like this
because<00:01:27.909> without<00:01:28.060> all<00:01:28.210> that<00:01:28.510> vocabulary

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
because without all that vocabulary

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.200 
because without all that vocabulary
you'd<00:01:29.560> be<00:01:29.680> like<00:01:29.890> when<00:01:30.369> two<00:01:30.549> different<00:01:30.760> blank

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
you'd be like when two different blank

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.330 
you'd be like when two different blank
numbers<00:01:31.720> it's<00:01:32.350> blank<00:01:32.799> blank<00:01:33.220> blank

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
numbers it's blank blank blank

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.560 
numbers it's blank blank blank
blankety-blank

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
blankety-blank

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.160 
blankety-blank
and<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:36.040> what<00:01:37.030> this<00:01:37.180> problem<00:01:37.540> is<00:01:37.810> it's

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
and so what this problem is it's

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.300 
and so what this problem is it's
designed<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:39.070> do<00:01:39.340> is<00:01:40.409> teach<00:01:41.409> you<00:01:41.439> vocabulary

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
designed to do is teach you vocabulary

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.609 
designed to do is teach you vocabulary
force<00:01:43.119> you<00:01:43.360> to<00:01:43.479> know<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:43.810> vocabulary<00:01:43.960> in<00:01:44.500> or

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
force you to know the vocabulary in or

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.030 
force you to know the vocabulary in or
if<00:01:44.710> in<00:01:44.799> order<00:01:44.950> to<00:01:45.130> answer<00:01:45.310> correctly<00:01:46.830> so<00:01:47.830> let's

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
if in order to answer correctly so let's

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.340 
if in order to answer correctly so let's
see<00:01:48.220> first<00:01:48.850> thing<00:01:49.060> is<00:01:49.240> we<00:01:49.420> have<00:01:49.630> two<00:01:50.320> different

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
see first thing is we have two different

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.399 
see first thing is we have two different
prime<00:01:50.950> numbers<00:01:51.400> now<00:01:52.270> as<00:01:52.420> much<00:01:52.570> as<00:01:52.630> possible

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
prime numbers now as much as possible

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.219 
prime numbers now as much as possible
whenever<00:01:54.310> I<00:01:54.579> can<00:01:54.909> I'm<00:01:55.119> gonna<00:01:55.479> do<00:01:55.689> my<00:01:55.840> one<00:01:56.049> two

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
whenever I can I'm gonna do my one two

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.380 
whenever I can I'm gonna do my one two
three<00:01:56.470> strategy<00:01:56.979> here<00:01:57.220> one<00:01:57.909> two<00:01:58.060> three<00:01:58.270> is<00:01:58.360> a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
three strategy here one two three is a

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.499 
three strategy here one two three is a
great<00:01:58.720> way<00:01:59.110> to<00:01:59.340> if<00:02:00.340> I<00:02:00.430> only<00:02:00.610> ever<00:02:00.909> need<00:02:01.180> to<00:02:01.299> pick

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
great way to if I only ever need to pick

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.929 
great way to if I only ever need to pick
out<00:02:01.689> you<00:02:01.900> know<00:02:02.020> rational<00:02:02.530> numbers<00:02:02.920> or<00:02:03.189> natural

out you know rational numbers or natural

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.440 
out you know rational numbers or natural
numbers<00:02:04.299> or<00:02:04.600> integers<00:02:05.439> or<00:02:06.250> you<00:02:06.880> know<00:02:07.000> prime

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
numbers if one two three has it all

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.620 
numbers if one two three has it all
because<00:02:10.600> one<00:02:11.140> two<00:02:11.739> or<00:02:11.950> three<00:02:11.980> is<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:13.000> natural

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
because one two or three is a natural

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.930 
because one two or three is a natural
number<00:02:13.780> it's<00:02:14.560> an<00:02:14.739> integer<00:02:15.040> it's<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.790> whole

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
number it's an integer it's a whole

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.120 
number it's an integer it's a whole
number<00:02:16.209> now<00:02:17.079> if<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.290> just<00:02:17.500> want<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.829> different

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130

number now if I just want to different
prime<00:02:18.400> numbers<00:02:18.880> one<00:02:19.690> only<00:02:20.380> two<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.430> three<00:02:21.850> are

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
prime numbers one only two and three are

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.289 
prime numbers one only two and three are
prime<00:02:22.360> numbers<00:02:23.250> prime<00:02:24.250> numbers<00:02:24.730> are<00:02:25.000> numbers

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
prime numbers prime numbers are numbers

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.229 
prime numbers prime numbers are numbers
that<00:02:25.510> have<00:02:25.840> two<00:02:26.799> factors<00:02:27.100> one<00:02:27.610> in<00:02:27.790> themselves

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
that have two factors one in themselves

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.710 
that have two factors one in themselves
so<00:02:28.450> two<00:02:29.070> can<00:02:30.070> be<00:02:30.190> divided<00:02:30.519> by<00:02:30.610> one<00:02:30.849> and<00:02:31.060> two

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
so two can be divided by one and two

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.070 
so two can be divided by one and two
it's<00:02:32.379> the<00:02:32.440> only<00:02:32.650> even<00:02:33.040> prime<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.610> three<00:02:34.420> can

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
it's the only even prime and three can

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.400 
it's the only even prime and three can
be<00:02:35.110> divided<00:02:35.440> by<00:02:35.650> one<00:02:35.680> and

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
be divided by one and

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.790 
be divided by one and
has<00:02:36.830> two<00:02:37.250> factors<00:02:37.550> one<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.270> three<00:02:38.590> so<00:02:39.590> we<00:02:39.680> had

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
has two factors one and three so we had

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.200 
has two factors one and three so we had
these<00:02:39.920> two<00:02:40.220> different<00:02:40.250> prime<00:02:40.760> numbers<00:02:41.180> and

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
these two different prime numbers and

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.360 
these two different prime numbers and
I'm<00:02:41.390> going<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.540> start<00:02:41.870> with<00:02:42.020> use<00:02:42.830> that<00:02:43.070> as<00:02:43.220> an

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
I'm going to start with use that as an

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.120 
I'm going to start with use that as an
example<00:02:43.960> if<00:02:44.960> I'm<00:02:45.230> multiplying<00:02:45.470> two<00:02:45.860> prime

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
example if I'm multiplying two prime

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.190 
example if I'm multiplying two prime
numbers<00:02:46.520> that<00:02:46.640> would<00:02:46.730> be<00:02:46.850> like<00:02:47.060> two<00:02:47.390> times

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
numbers that would be like two times

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.580 
numbers that would be like two times
three<00:02:48.650> that<00:02:48.830> would<00:02:48.890> get<00:02:49.010> me<00:02:49.130> six<00:02:49.460> and<00:02:50.380> it<00:02:51.380> says

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
three that would get me six and it says

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.040 
three that would get me six and it says
here<00:02:51.830> it's<00:02:52.370> possible<00:02:52.790> so<00:02:53.630> I'm<00:02:53.720> just<00:02:53.870> looking

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
here it's possible so I'm just looking

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.990 
here it's possible so I'm just looking
for<00:02:54.380> an<00:02:54.440> example<00:02:54.800> that<00:02:55.070> could<00:02:55.520> theoretically

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
for an example that could theoretically

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.660 
for an example that could theoretically
work<00:02:56.690> so<00:02:57.650> is<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:57.890> possible<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.340> take<00:02:58.460> two

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
work so is it possible to take two

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.940 
work so is it possible to take two
different<00:02:59.120> prime<00:02:59.300> numbers<00:02:59.720> and<00:02:59.960> get<00:03:00.380> an<00:03:00.620> even

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
different prime numbers and get an even

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.480 
different prime numbers and get an even
number<00:03:01.370> well<00:03:02.150> our<00:03:02.480> example<00:03:03.110> here<00:03:03.140> works<00:03:03.590> well

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
number well our example here works well

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.020 
number well our example here works well
this<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.910> answer<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.980> can't<00:03:07.250> stop<00:03:07.640> there

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
this is the answer you can't stop there

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.930 
this is the answer you can't stop there
you<00:03:08.390> got<00:03:08.570> to<00:03:08.720> keep<00:03:08.870> going<00:03:09.370> because<00:03:10.370> it<00:03:10.670> wants

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
you got to keep going because it wants

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.120 
you got to keep going because it wants
you<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.090> understand<00:03:11.690> these<00:03:11.930> other<00:03:12.200> words<00:03:12.440> like

you<00:04:53.590> have<00:04:53.830> a<00:04:53.860> to<00:04:54.400> rational<00:04:54.970> numbers<00:04:55.360> that

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
you have a to rational numbers that

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.530 
you have a to rational numbers that
would<00:04:55.810> be<00:04:55.900> like<00:04:56.110> two<00:04:56.320> prime<00:04:56.650> numbers

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
would be like two prime numbers

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.300 
would be like two prime numbers
it<00:04:58.540> always<00:04:58.900> is<00:04:59.320> going<00:04:59.470> to<00:04:59.560> get<00:04:59.710> you<00:04:59.889> out<00:04:59.919> a

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
it always is going to get you out a

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.000 
it always is going to get you out a
rational<00:05:01.270> number<00:05:01.300> so<00:05:02.050> I<00:05:02.080> say<00:05:02.350> I<00:05:02.560> tell<00:05:02.800> teachers

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
rational number so I say I tell teachers

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.750 
rational number so I say I tell teachers
a<00:05:03.460> rat<00:05:03.910> times<00:05:04.240> a<00:05:04.389> rat<00:05:04.570> is<00:05:04.750> always<00:05:05.139> a<00:05:05.169> rat<00:05:05.760> so

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
a rat times a rat is always a rat so

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.310 
a rat times a rat is always a rat so
there<00:05:07.180> would<00:05:07.270> be<00:05:07.300> no<00:05:07.389> instance<00:05:08.080> where<00:05:08.290> you

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
there would be no instance where you

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.140 
there would be no instance where you
would<00:05:08.590> take<00:05:08.740> a<00:05:08.800> fraction<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:09.580> multiply<00:05:09.639> by<00:05:10.120> a

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
would take a fraction and multiply by a

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.720 
would take a fraction and multiply by a
fraction<00:05:10.360> and<00:05:10.930> get<00:05:11.440> another<00:05:11.800> irrational<00:05:12.520> and

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
fraction and get another irrational and

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.840 
fraction and get another irrational and
get<00:05:13.060> an<00:05:13.180> irrational<00:05:13.510> answer<00:05:14.139> all<00:05:14.620> right

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
get an irrational answer all right

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.000 
get an irrational answer all right

goes back to your core math and there's

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.620 
goes back to your core math and there's
tons<00:05:26.680> of<00:05:26.860> videos<00:05:27.160> who've<00:05:27.340> done<00:05:27.520> on<00:05:27.700> these<00:05:27.880> but

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
tons of videos who've done on these but

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.180 
tons of videos who've done on these but
an<00:05:28.720> integer<00:05:28.990> is<00:05:29.200> any<00:05:29.470> number<00:05:29.710> that<00:05:29.889> can<00:05:30.040> be

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
an integer is any number that can be

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.640 
an integer is any number that can be
divided<00:05:30.550> by<00:05:30.760> is<00:05:30.970> positive<00:05:31.510> or<00:05:31.630> negative<00:05:31.990> that

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
divided by is positive or negative that

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.350 
divided by is positive or negative that
can<00:05:32.830> be<00:05:32.919> divided<00:05:33.340> by<00:05:33.430> one<00:05:33.460> with<00:05:33.820> no<00:05:34.000> remainder

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
can be divided by one with no remainder

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.210 
can be divided by one with no remainder
we<00:05:35.050> think<00:05:35.260> about<00:05:35.380> it<00:05:35.590> on<00:05:35.710> our<00:05:35.740> number<00:05:36.190> line

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
we think about it on our number line

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.560 
we think about it on our number line
here<00:05:37.500> one<00:05:38.610> these<00:05:39.610> are<00:05:39.639> all<00:05:39.880> these<00:05:40.270> are<00:05:40.330> all

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
here one these are all these are all

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.960 
here one these are all these are all
positive<00:05:40.930> integers<00:05:41.710> zero<00:05:42.040> and<00:05:42.400> the<00:05:42.490> positive

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
positive integers zero and the positive

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.840 
positive integers zero and the positive
integers<00:05:44.130> and<00:05:45.130> everything<00:05:45.490> about<00:05:45.700> our

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
integers and everything about our

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.430 
integers and everything about our
negative<00:05:46.270> integers<00:05:46.660> remember<00:05:47.110> it<00:05:47.169> can<00:05:47.290> be

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
negative integers remember it can be

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.320 
negative integers remember it can be
negative<00:05:47.940> these<00:05:48.940> are<00:05:49.180> our<00:05:49.330> negative<00:05:49.870> integers

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
negative these are our negative integers

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.719 
negative these are our negative integers
sometimes<00:05:52.330> you<00:05:52.660> know<00:05:52.919> integers<00:05:53.919> we're

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
sometimes you know integers we're

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.659 
sometimes you know integers we're
dealing<00:05:55.060> with<00:05:55.090> the<00:05:55.300> negative<00:05:55.690> integers<00:05:56.169> here

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
dealing with the negative integers here

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.140 
dealing with the negative integers here
so<00:05:57.669> these<00:05:57.820> ones<00:05:58.090> here<00:05:59.520> all<00:06:00.520> right<00:06:00.669> I<00:06:00.880> think

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
so these ones here all right I think

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.140 
so these ones here all right I think
I'll<00:06:01.300> sleeve<00:06:01.810> integers<00:06:02.729> just<00:06:03.729> talk<00:06:04.000> about

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.150 
I'll sleeve integers just talk about

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.300 
I'll sleeve integers just talk about
what<00:06:04.570> integer<00:06:05.020> is<00:06:05.169> a<00:06:05.200> negative<00:06:05.710> integer<00:06:05.950> so<00:06:06.280> we

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
what integer is a negative integer so we

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.010 
what integer is a negative integer so we
could<00:06:06.520> go<00:06:06.669> a<00:06:06.700> lot<00:06:07.060> further<00:06:07.330> into<00:06:07.690> this<00:06:07.810> but

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
could go a lot further into this but

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.610 
could go a lot further into this but
we're<00:06:08.140> not<00:06:08.169> going<00:06:08.320> to<00:06:08.789> now<00:06:10.169> what's<00:06:11.169> unique

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
we're not going to now what's unique

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.830 
we're not going to now what's unique
about<00:06:11.979> prime<00:06:12.400> numbers<00:06:12.820> prime<00:06:13.180> numbers<00:06:13.630> are

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
about prime numbers prime numbers are

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.370 
about prime numbers prime numbers are
following<00:06:14.830> the<00:06:14.979> set<00:06:15.220> of<00:06:15.400> natural<00:06:15.760> numbers

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
following the set of natural numbers

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.140 
following the set of natural numbers
natural<00:06:17.380> numbers<00:06:17.710> are<00:06:18.039> you<00:06:18.370> know<00:06:18.520> we<00:06:18.700> were

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
natural numbers are you know we were

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.330 
natural numbers are you know we were
looking<00:06:19.419> at<00:06:19.479> the<00:06:19.600> numbers<00:06:19.930> that<00:06:20.169> are<00:06:20.229> in<00:06:20.620> our

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
looking at the numbers that are in our

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.659 
looking at the numbers that are in our
positive<00:06:22.330> integers<00:06:22.810> beginning<00:06:23.350> with<00:06:23.470> one<00:06:23.770> so

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
positive integers beginning with one so

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.159 
positive integers beginning with one so
we're<00:06:24.970> starting<00:06:25.210> our<00:06:25.510> prime<00:06:25.780> numbers<00:06:26.169> at<00:06:26.410> 2<00:06:26.770> 3

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
we're starting our prime numbers at 2 3

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:33.420 
we're starting our prime numbers at 2 3
5<00:06:29.910> so<00:06:30.910> the<00:06:31.030> key<00:06:31.270> here<00:06:31.810> is<00:06:31.930> that<00:06:32.590> they're<00:06:32.919> not

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 
5 so the key here is that they're not

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.250 
5 so the key here is that they're not
only<00:06:33.490> there<00:06:33.970> in<00:06:34.060> the<00:06:34.150> natural<00:06:34.539> set<00:06:34.780> but<00:06:35.050> prime

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.260 
only there in the natural set but prime

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.510 
only there in the natural set but prime
numbers<00:06:35.650> are<00:06:36.000> positive<00:06:37.380> so<00:06:38.380> so<00:06:39.039> any<00:06:39.220> prime

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
numbers are positive so so any prime

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.100 
numbers are positive so so any prime
numbers<00:06:39.970> that<00:06:40.419> you're<00:06:40.600> going<00:06:40.720> to<00:06:40.750> be<00:06:40.900> working

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
numbers that you're going to be working

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.980 
numbers that you're going to be working
with<00:06:41.289> you<00:06:41.710> can<00:06:41.860> be<00:06:41.950> working<00:06:42.220> with<00:06:42.340> a<00:06:42.370> positive

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
with you can be working with a positive

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.420 
with you can be working with a positive
times<00:06:43.990> a<00:06:44.169> positive<00:06:44.200> and<00:06:44.860> that's<00:06:44.919> always<00:06:45.160> gonna

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
times a positive and that's always gonna

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.600 
times a positive and that's always gonna
get<00:06:45.610> you<00:06:45.760> a<00:06:45.789> positive<00:06:47.010> okay<00:06:48.010> team<00:06:48.220> I<00:06:48.340> hope<00:06:48.460> you
