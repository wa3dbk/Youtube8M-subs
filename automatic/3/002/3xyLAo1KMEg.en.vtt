people together and ultimately get to a

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.899 
people together and ultimately get to a
point<00:01:03.719> where<00:01:03.960> we<00:01:04.140> have<00:01:04.350> forest<00:01:05.339> landscapes

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
point where we have forest landscapes

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.490 
point where we have forest landscapes
that<00:01:06.090> are<00:01:06.210> more<00:01:06.390> resilient<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.170> more

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
that are more resilient and more

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.499 
that are more resilient and more
resistant<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.310> they<00:01:08.460> are<00:01:08.610> resilient<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
resistant so they are resilient in the

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.780 
resistant so they are resilient in the
sense<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.960> they<00:01:10.469> can<00:01:10.500> withstand<00:01:10.829> wildfire

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
sense that they can withstand wildfire

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.580 
sense that they can withstand wildfire
without<00:01:12.180> allowing<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.990> fire<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.320> become

mountain pine beetle one of the issues

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.709 
mountain pine beetle one of the issues
that<00:01:20.399> we're<00:01:20.670> facing<00:01:20.700> with<00:01:21.180> West<00:01:21.390> Bend<00:01:21.570> in

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
that we're facing with West Bend in

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:23.420 
that we're facing with West Bend in
particular<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.380> we've<00:01:22.680> had<00:01:22.920> forests

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
particular is that we've had forests

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.999 
particular is that we've had forests
that<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.700> had<00:01:23.820> fire<00:01:24.090> excluded<00:01:24.689> for<00:01:25.009> decades

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
that have had fire excluded for decades

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.700 
that have had fire excluded for decades
and<00:01:26.250> that's<00:01:26.909> allowed<00:01:27.210> many<00:01:27.930> small<00:01:28.259> trees<00:01:28.530> to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
and that's allowed many small trees to

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.260 
and that's allowed many small trees to
grow<00:01:28.829> up<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.070> otherwise<00:01:29.399> would<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:29.939> burned

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
grow up that otherwise would have burned

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.990 
grow up that otherwise would have burned
in<00:01:30.539> low<00:01:30.750> intensity<00:01:31.259> burns<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
in low intensity burns and the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.660 
in low intensity burns and the
consequence<00:01:33.570> would<00:01:33.719> have<00:01:33.810> been<00:01:34.070> fewer<00:01:35.070> bigger

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
consequence would have been fewer bigger

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.099 
consequence would have been fewer bigger

were suing the Forest Service and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.830 
were suing the Forest Service and
fighting<00:02:13.140> with<00:02:13.260> logger

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
fighting with logger

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.199 
fighting with logger

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
in the forest products industry was

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.140 
in the forest products industry was
suing<00:02:16.900> environmentalists<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:17.980> everybody<00:02:18.910> it

suing environmentalists and everybody it

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.240 
suing environmentalists and everybody it
was<00:02:19.300> pretty<00:02:19.690> heightened<00:02:20.170> pretty<00:02:20.590> bitter<00:02:20.920> and

was pretty heightened pretty bitter and

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.300 
was pretty heightened pretty bitter and
went<00:02:21.459> on<00:02:21.580> for<00:02:21.819> a<00:02:21.879> very<00:02:21.910> long<00:02:22.180> time<00:02:22.890> but<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:24.069> think

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
went on for a very long time but I think

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.690 
went on for a very long time but I think
what<00:02:24.489> we<00:02:24.610> all<00:02:24.819> realized<00:02:25.330> is<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.830> was<00:02:27.160> maybe

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
what we all realized is that was maybe

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.640 
what we all realized is that was maybe
necessary<00:02:28.480> from<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.959> environmentalist

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
necessary from the environmentalist

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.000 
necessary from the environmentalist
standpoint<00:02:30.250> at<00:02:30.489> least<00:02:31.140> but<00:02:32.140> we<00:02:32.650> need<00:02:32.799> to<00:02:32.890> move

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
standpoint at least but we need to move

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.309 
standpoint at least but we need to move
past<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.519> we<00:02:33.910> need<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.180> figure<00:02:34.360> out<00:02:34.629> how<00:02:34.959> we<00:02:35.019> can

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
past it we need to figure out how we can

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.410 
past it we need to figure out how we can
get<00:02:35.500> things<00:02:35.739> done<00:02:35.799> in<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.160> forest<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:36.760> the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
get things done in the forest and the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.350 
get things done in the forest and the
cold<00:02:37.750> hard<00:02:37.989> truth<00:02:38.049> is<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:39.280> loggers<00:02:39.879> are<00:02:40.150> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
cold hard truth is that loggers are the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.059 
cold hard truth is that loggers are the
only<00:02:40.569> people<00:02:40.930> that<00:02:41.200> have<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.470> equipment<00:02:41.739> and

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
only people that have the equipment and

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.460 
only people that have the equipment and
the<00:02:42.340> knowledge<00:02:42.519> to<00:02:43.360> make<00:02:43.510> treatments<00:02:44.049> on<00:02:44.200> the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
the knowledge to make treatments on the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.059 
the knowledge to make treatments on the
ground

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
ground

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.809 
ground
that's<00:02:45.849> just<00:02:46.209> a<00:02:46.420> truth<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.160> if<00:02:48.160> we<00:02:48.340> want<00:02:48.579> to<00:02:48.670> do

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
that's just a truth and if we want to do

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.000 
that's just a truth and if we want to do
this<00:02:48.970> work<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.780> is<00:02:49.930> pretty<00:02:50.260> widely<00:02:50.769> agreed

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
this work and it is pretty widely agreed

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.190 
this work and it is pretty widely agreed
and<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.250> strongly<00:02:51.700> agree<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:52.569> it<00:02:52.750> needs<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.079> be

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
and I strongly agree that it needs to be

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.350 
and I strongly agree that it needs to be
done<00:02:53.349> then<00:02:53.980> we<00:02:54.130> need<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.370> work<00:02:54.519> together<00:02:54.670> we

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
done then we need to work together we

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.360 
done then we need to work together we
all<00:02:55.540> need<00:02:55.810> each<00:02:55.840> other<00:02:56.230> we<00:02:56.560> can<00:02:56.739> only<00:02:56.950> do<00:02:57.220> this

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
all need each other we can only do this

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.550 
all need each other we can only do this
together<00:02:57.549> none<00:02:58.390> of<00:02:58.510> us<00:02:58.569> can<00:02:58.780> do<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.049> alone<00:02:59.260> you

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
together none of us can do it alone you

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.259 
together none of us can do it alone you
know<00:03:00.160> if<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.430> can<00:03:00.610> if<00:03:00.879> you<00:03:00.970> can<00:03:01.090> come<00:03:01.239> to

know if you can if you can come to

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.420 
know if you can if you can come to
agreement<00:03:01.840> on<00:03:01.900> 85<00:03:02.290> 90<00:03:02.709> percent<00:03:03.069> of<00:03:03.129> the<00:03:03.220> things

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
agreement on 85 90 percent of the things

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.670 
agreement on 85 90 percent of the things
as<00:03:03.760> opposed<00:03:04.209> to<00:03:04.360> where<00:03:04.569> we<00:03:04.720> were<00:03:04.870> 10<00:03:05.200> or<00:03:05.319> 15

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680

as opposed to where we were 10 or 15
years<00:03:05.950> ago<00:03:06.010> I<00:03:06.280> think<00:03:06.489> we're<00:03:06.700> making<00:03:06.849> progress

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
years ago I think we're making progress

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.199 
years ago I think we're making progress
well<00:03:07.989> what<00:03:08.140> you<00:03:08.230> see<00:03:08.410> over<00:03:08.620> my<00:03:08.650> shoulder

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
well what you see over my shoulder

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.699 
well what you see over my shoulder
represents<00:03:10.209> an<00:03:10.329> untreated<00:03:11.019> portion<00:03:11.530> of<00:03:11.620> the

of what the forest looks like across

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.699 
of what the forest looks like across

treatments that take place include

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.780 
treatments that take place include

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
we implement a prescribed fire that

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.420 
we implement a prescribed fire that
helps<00:03:32.560> restore<00:03:32.709> some<00:03:33.130> of<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.280> other

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
helps restore some of the other

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.390 
helps restore some of the other
ecological<00:03:33.780> functions<00:03:34.780> of<00:03:34.989> a<00:03:35.079> dry<00:03:35.290> forest<00:03:35.620> so

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
ecological functions of a dry forest so

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.039 
ecological functions of a dry forest so

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
gonna go in and treat the forest with

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.229 
gonna go in and treat the forest with
fire<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:00.160> some<00:04:00.280> other<00:04:00.430> things<00:04:00.700> so<00:04:00.910> you<00:04:00.970> may

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
fire and some other things so you may

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.490 
fire and some other things so you may
not<00:04:01.450> be<00:04:01.510> able<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:01.870> get<00:04:02.049> to<00:04:02.230> some<00:04:02.349> of<00:04:02.410> your

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
not be able to get to some of your

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.740 
not be able to get to some of your
favorite<00:04:02.739> trails<00:04:03.280> exactly<00:04:04.090> when<00:04:04.239> you<00:04:04.359> want<00:04:04.569> to

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
favorite trails exactly when you want to

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.080 
favorite trails exactly when you want to
but<00:04:04.989> man<00:04:05.560> we've<00:04:05.799> got<00:04:05.980> a<00:04:06.010> great<00:04:06.220> trail<00:04:06.519> system

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
but man we've got a great trail system

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.240 
but man we've got a great trail system
and<00:04:07.299> so<00:04:07.540> everyone<00:04:07.989> should<00:04:08.019> just<00:04:08.290> stay<00:04:08.919> tuned

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
and so everyone should just stay tuned

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.539 
and so everyone should just stay tuned
and<00:04:09.609> and<00:04:09.970> sort<00:04:10.599> of<00:04:10.660> shift<00:04:11.019> your<00:04:11.440> your<00:04:11.980> plans<00:04:12.310> a

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
and and sort of shift your your plans a

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.309 
and and sort of shift your your plans a
little<00:04:12.700> bit<00:04:13.060> as<00:04:13.269> we're<00:04:13.599> making<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.930> forest

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
little bit as we're making the forest

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.409 
little bit as we're making the forest
better<00:04:14.530> and<00:04:14.859> guaranteeing<00:04:15.760> that<00:04:15.970> long<00:04:16.180> term

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
better and guaranteeing that long term

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.120 
better and guaranteeing that long term
you're<00:04:16.630> gonna<00:04:16.750> have<00:04:17.049> a<00:04:17.079> great<00:04:17.410> trail<00:04:17.650> system

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
you're gonna have a great trail system

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.279 
you're gonna have a great trail system
so<00:04:18.729> we're<00:04:18.880> trying<00:04:19.120> to<00:04:19.299> accelerate<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:20.079> pace

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
so we're trying to accelerate the pace

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.020 
so we're trying to accelerate the pace
and<00:04:20.470> scale<00:04:20.680> restoration<00:04:21.459> or<00:04:21.549> what<00:04:21.669> that<00:04:21.789> means

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
and scale restoration or what that means

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.520 
and scale restoration or what that means
is<00:04:22.150> we're<00:04:22.330> trying<00:04:22.479> to<00:04:22.599> reduce<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:23.110> stocking

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
is we're trying to reduce the stocking

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.379 
is we're trying to reduce the stocking
levels<00:04:23.860> and<00:04:24.070> we're

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
levels and we're

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.339 
levels and we're
trying<00:04:24.569> to<00:04:24.629> reduce<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:25.050> risk<00:04:25.229> of

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
trying to reduce the risk of

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.800 
trying to reduce the risk of
catastrophic<00:04:25.680> wildfire<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:27.120> I<00:04:27.449> think<00:04:27.689> with

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
catastrophic wildfire and I think with

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.300 
catastrophic wildfire and I think with
this<00:04:27.900> year's<00:04:28.139> fire<00:04:28.439> season<00:04:28.469> there's<00:04:29.099> pretty

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
this year's fire season there's pretty

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.040 
this year's fire season there's pretty
good<00:04:29.460> evidence<00:04:29.520> that<00:04:30.240> we<00:04:30.419> need<00:04:30.569> to<00:04:30.659> be<00:04:30.780> doing

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
good evidence that we need to be doing

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.929 
good evidence that we need to be doing
this<00:04:31.169> on<00:04:31.349> a<00:04:31.409> broader<00:04:31.740> landscape<00:04:32.370> so<00:04:32.819> the

00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:32.939 
this on a broader landscape so the

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.879 
this on a broader landscape so the
collaborative<00:04:33.360> is<00:04:33.599> all<00:04:33.779> about<00:04:34.110> taking<00:04:34.469> all<00:04:34.860> of

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
collaborative is all about taking all of

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.249 
collaborative is all about taking all of
that<00:04:35.069> those<00:04:35.819> different<00:04:36.270> perspectives<00:04:36.990> and

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
that those different perspectives and

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:40.010 
that those different perspectives and
coming<00:04:38.039> up<00:04:38.159> with<00:04:38.370> something<00:04:38.610> that's<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.539> good

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
coming up with something that's a good

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.779 
coming up with something that's a good
for<00:04:40.199> the<00:04:40.289> forest<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:40.830> does<00:04:41.009> what<00:04:41.249> the<00:04:41.400> Forest

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
for the forest and does what the Forest

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.929 
for the forest and does what the Forest
Service<00:04:42.150> intends<00:04:42.569> and<00:04:43.189> at<00:04:44.189> the<00:04:44.370> same<00:04:44.610> time

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:44.939 
Service intends and at the same time

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:46.939 
Service intends and at the same time
make<00:04:45.659> it<00:04:45.810> work<00:04:46.020> for<00:04:46.289> all<00:04:46.349> those<00:04:46.590> different

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
make it work for all those different

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.159 
make it work for all those different
groups<00:04:47.009> that's<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.520> tall<00:04:47.699> order<00:04:47.939> but<00:04:48.749> I<00:04:48.810> have<00:04:49.050> to

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
groups that's a tall order but I have to

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.959 
groups that's a tall order but I have to
say<00:04:49.349> we've<00:04:49.529> made<00:04:49.740> a<00:04:49.770> lot<00:04:50.009> of<00:04:50.039> progress<00:04:50.310> doing

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:50.969 
say we've made a lot of progress doing

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:53.119 
say we've made a lot of progress doing
exactly<00:04:51.479> that<00:04:51.599> we've<00:04:52.349> known<00:04:52.590> each<00:04:52.710> other<00:04:52.830> for

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:53.129 
exactly that we've known each other for

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:54.800 
exactly that we've known each other for
some<00:04:53.310> time<00:04:53.340> and<00:04:53.849> and<00:04:54.150> I<00:04:54.300> guess<00:04:54.509> you<00:04:54.629> could

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
some time and and I guess you could

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.360 
some time and and I guess you could
characterize<00:04:55.020> this<00:04:55.560> as<00:04:55.620> having<00:04:56.219> been

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
characterize this as having been

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.969 
characterize this as having been
adversaries<00:04:56.879> but<00:04:57.210> now<00:04:57.419> I<00:04:57.449> think<00:04:57.629> we're<00:04:58.020> you

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
adversaries but now I think we're you

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.260 
adversaries but now I think we're you
know<00:04:59.009> instead<00:04:59.400> of<00:04:59.520> fighting<00:04:59.759> with<00:04:59.939> each<00:05:00.000> other

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
know instead of fighting with each other

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.820 
know instead of fighting with each other
we're<00:05:00.599> working<00:05:00.990> together<00:05:01.110> we're<00:05:01.500> trying<00:05:01.740> to

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
we're working together we're trying to

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.980 
we're working together we're trying to
reach<00:05:01.979> some<00:05:02.219> common<00:05:02.580> solution<00:05:03.180> and<00:05:03.389> you<00:05:03.870> know

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
reach some common solution and you know

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.719 
reach some common solution and you know
if<00:05:04.199> we<00:05:04.349> disagree<00:05:04.800> on<00:05:04.830> things<00:05:05.129> we<00:05:05.370> do<00:05:05.520> so

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
if we disagree on things we do so
