hey guys welcome to another bucket

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.009 
hey guys welcome to another bucket
plug-in<00:00:08.429> tutorial<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.179> today<00:00:09.330> it's<00:00:09.780> on<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
plug-in tutorial and today it's on the

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.020 
plug-in tutorial and today it's on the
plug-in<00:00:10.320> salvage<00:00:10.830> so<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.610> plugin<00:00:11.849> allows

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
plug-in salvage so this plugin allows

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.049 
plug-in salvage so this plugin allows
you<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.540> uncraft<00:00:13.400> various<00:00:14.400> different<00:00:14.700> items

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
you to uncraft various different items

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.320 
you to uncraft various different items
there's<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.809> list<00:00:15.960> on<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.170> bucket<00:00:16.470> paid

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
there's a list on the bucket paid

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.779 
there's a list on the bucket paid
however<00:00:18.439> when<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.590> do<00:00:19.800> on<00:00:19.949> craft<00:00:20.279> an<00:00:20.430> item

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
however when you do on craft an item

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.460 
however when you do on craft an item
part<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.500> materials<00:00:23.010> used<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.490> lost<00:00:24.439> so<00:00:25.439> i

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
part of the materials used is lost so i

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.509 
part of the materials used is lost so i
will<00:00:25.859> show<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.160> using<00:00:26.760> sandstone<00:00:27.529> so<00:00:28.529> as<00:00:29.369> you

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
will show you using sandstone so as you

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.030 
will show you using sandstone so as you
know<00:00:29.550> sandstone<00:00:30.269> requires<00:00:30.750> force<00:00:31.740> and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
know sandstone requires force and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.240 
know sandstone requires force and
however<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.450> only<00:00:33.540> get<00:00:33.719> three<00:00:34.170> back<00:00:34.500> per

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
however and you only get three back per

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.240 
however and you only get three back per
block<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.760> sandstones<00:00:36.390> therefore<00:00:37.250> because

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
block of sandstones therefore because

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.830 
block of sandstones therefore because
some<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.610> lost<00:00:38.910> obviously<00:00:39.450> during<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
some is lost obviously during the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.760 
some is lost obviously during the
uncraft<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.440> process<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:41.910> can<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:42.120> seen

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
uncraft in process so this can be seen

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.029 
uncraft in process so this can be seen
with<00:00:44.000> some<00:00:45.000> tools<00:00:45.270> such<00:00:45.690> as<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:46.320> dime<00:00:46.710> salt

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
with some tools such as a dime salt

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.150 
with some tools such as a dime salt
which<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.370> two<00:00:47.670> diamond<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.930> stick<00:00:49.320> however

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
which is two diamond and a stick however
