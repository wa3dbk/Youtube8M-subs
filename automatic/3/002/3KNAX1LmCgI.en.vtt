00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.480
 hello everyone and welcome to an episode 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.879
 more than abracadabra the cheat section 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.070
 and foliated dotcom today we are going to 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.780
 show you something that is sure to 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.490
 being very useful here has not 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.620
 past that good because I was going to teach 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.660
 a photo to any family friend 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.539
 projects look at what photo of taken from the 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.330
 new house that I have, you do not want me 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.519
 the family only see this photo but 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.900
 friends the temptation is very great and the 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.630
 family or friend that you have left 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.599
 your iphone will end up sliding to pass 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.180
 to new photos and you can get to photos 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.219
 ye not then create good will 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.500
 let's teach a method to avoid 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.960
 that this happens to prevent anyone 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.449
 that takes your iphone to see more than 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.980
 the photo that you want to show the trick 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.949
 It is very simple and makes use of 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.440
 accessibility settings and access 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:55.489
 guided let's do it look let's go to 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.940
 adjustments we go down a little bit general let's 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.790
 to enable to look for accessibility 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.890
 here we have it and inside 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.120
 accessibility 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.450
 accessory 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.000
 well the first thing we have to do is 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.150
 put the accessory 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.130
 if you have an iphone 5 s up 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.650
 you can activate and deactivate the thickness 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.320
 He called with the touch and we are 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.240
 doing this tutorial with iphone 4s with 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.130
 which we have to adjust the code 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.870
 for dial access you can put that 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.130
 you want repaired to proof we go 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:34.500
 to put 1 2 3 4 we confirm it 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.620
 and we have access to the day 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.530
 to launch the access will no longer be enough 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.730
 personal three times the button or the button 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.700
 start as you are seeing in the 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.770
 screen well let's make the section of 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.990
 photos and you see that good for now 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.180
 we can continue to take pictures of a moon 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.130
 but you want them to only see this 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.500
 picture well once we are inside 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.119
 the photo application and that's good 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.369
 we want nobody to see another photo that the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.560
 that we are teaching you we launched the 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.600
 accessory remember that it is pressed 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.450
 three times the home button 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.580
 good has been started let's go back to 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.770
 press the home button three times 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.820
 and we will have to enter the code that 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.980
 we have put before well now we have in 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.050
 the lower left corner the 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.830
 Accessory options we do not give 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.990
 options and we remove the touch we are going to 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.200
 remove the touch although I feel that in the 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.360
 screen will not do anything with 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.890
 what are we going to achieve with this 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.710
 you are going to see now 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.570
 now let's resume and we see that 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.040
 we have started our care and what 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.540
 what we are going to do now is good, not what 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.550
 you can see why these are a catch 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.870
 screen but I'm explaining the 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.209
 landowner touch touch the function 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.240
 Touch touch of the iphone does not work with 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.620
 which you will not be able to or the person who 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.080
 have the iphone at hand will not be able to 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.000
 fix inside your reel 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.950
 photographs and get to those that do not 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.270
 you want me to see that sacrifice once 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.310
 that the person has seen the photo 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.750
 nothing returns the iphone I had the three 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.950
 detects the home button again 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.010
 you enter the code 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.670
 and you hit the left corner that puts 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.800
 finish and you're done 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.230
 now it has closed and everything returns to the 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.030
 normality and as you can see we can continue 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.770
 passing photographs 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.990
 Well this is the trick we wanted 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.569
 teach so that nobody can inquire 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.910
 within our privacy and look 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.100
 photographs that there should not be if it has 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.780
 useful result give a crime up 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.970
 that helps us very much to subscribe to 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.650

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.290
 I am hanging here and extract 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.290
