00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.600
 hello to the channel without wires and topic 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.710
 today's video tutorial 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.350
 how to change ah pi your address 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.680
 computer there are several ways i 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.230
 I will try to tell everyone a lot 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.520
 The first way is suitable for the user 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.770
 on whom 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.830
 provider provides dynamic 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.290
 ah-pi that is in your case enough 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:31.310
 just turn off the computer for half an hour and 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:34.690
 after half an hour, turn on again after that 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.880
 if your provider is regular 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.220
 shift 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.440
 ah pi address you need address change 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.310
 automatically anyway in order 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.170
 to check it out you can 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:52.900
 before you reboot your 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:56.010
 computer connect to the internet and in 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.980
 the internet then on the site of the 2nd pi and 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.320
 view your ip address remember it 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.600
 then restart computer shut down 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.770
 for half an hour let's say half an hour later 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.450
 turn it on again go to this site 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.130
 if your address has changed it means 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.130
 it was a change of address your 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:22.119
 provider and you can accordingly 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.710
 use another frame from but here 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.570
 need to take into account such a moment that some 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.300
 providers even if they provide 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.300
 you dynamic ah-pee nevertheless not 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.479
 for a long time can not change the ip address 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.520
 Even if you 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.310
 Perry connect to the internet ie 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.140
 you can spend a whole week and include and 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.190
 turn off the computer and for 3 weeks 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.990
 you had such a permanent address that 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.760
 then do or in that case 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.400
 can be used 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.870
 other ways the second way is 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:02:03.090
 use for example proxy server 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:09.580
 proxy server is such a function when 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.830
 you point your internet browser 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.070
 used for example google 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.750
 chrome or opera you want to do 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:21.130
 certain setting this way 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.830
 so that your browser will go to sites on 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.280
 which you are visiting not directly 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.640
 but through certain other 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.400
 servers and these other servers 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.130
 hidden they are called proxy servers 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.080
 but without a proxy server everything is so easy for me 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.390
 because many proxy server and 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.170
 paid that is to use them 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.610
 need to pay money and free 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.180
 provide a very very low level 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.000
 anonymity and accordingly they are bad 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.130
 hide your ip address but basically 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 you can change it and how to do it well 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:02.680
 for example, we introduce 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.750
 such a name of such a site as fox 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.340
 prince rub 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.650
 go to this site and on this site 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.160
 we have a section called 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.440
 proxy servers in this section we will see 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.070
 here is a large large number of large 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.410
 a list of 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.010
 even a few pages and there and where 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.080
 given free proxy server, and 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.060
 which country do not belong you choose 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.840
 that and, accordingly, the degree 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.630
 mobility and speed of these 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.550
 servers you choose which prices in 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.730
 need a server and then 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:44.380
 and then we go to our settings 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.720
 browser and here in the settings in the usual 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.730
 position here if you go to 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.230
 building the very bottom there is such a point 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.200
 shows additional setting 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.390
 push it go down further and 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.700
 find section 7 here to change 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.890
 proxy server settings go here 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.300
 we have a connection tab click 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.550
 network setting button 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.970
 we put a tick here and here we are 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.440
 specify proxy server the proxy sulfur 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.310
 which we have chosen so we insert here 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.350
 wheels here port we press ok and from ice drift 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.239
 close all windows and check the action 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.590
 the internet doesn't work i mean we don't 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.380
 I mean, if we can't go in 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.240
 one of the sites respectively this 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.820
 proxy server is not working you need 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.979
 will return to this page where we are 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.889
 watched where we watched the proxy list 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:36.740
 servers and choose another one here already 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:39.770
 the principle of scientific spear works then you 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.979
 will not be the way to pick yourself 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.320
 a suitable sulfur proxy is needed 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.690
 take into account such a moment that as I said 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.630
 that not everyone gives the highest anonymity and 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.300
 the second is that many proxy servers 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.639
 work in extremely slow and 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.639
 accordingly if you will 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:03.610
 use then surf the internet will 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:05.150
 much more difficult but because it 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.800
 will be noticeable 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.610
 slow down here used 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.700
 proxy here but these are 2 ways 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.340
 who told me to eat also 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.900
 plan like that way of protection when 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.639
 special application is used 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.260
 which can be downloaded and installed on 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.910
 your computer will automatically be on 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.260
 select proxy servers for you 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.380
 the application is also often 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.050
 not paid here in my opinion the most 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.760
 convenient and easy and free 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.510
 effective way is to use 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.430
 special 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.310
 browser particular one of these 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.230
 is a browser called by its 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.000
 can be downloaded for free and installed on 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.590
 your computer after downloading and 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.710
 installations 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:51.420
 you just can on the address bar 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:53.580
 understand any 1 address any request 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:58.800
 we are interested in the well, for example 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:03.090
 same index and you will visit all these 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.560
 websites all these pages are anonymous with 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.680
 changed ip address well i mean 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.950
 particular if we're pointing here now 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:17.200
 a site like two and pi and move on 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:21.820
 this site and accordingly here 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:24.250
 rapida then accordingly you are there site we 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:27.010
 on this site we will be able to look here 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:32.320
 That ip under which our browser came and 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:34.670
 we see that this api address is fake 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.980
 and thus 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.180
 we solve the problem how to change ah pi 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.180
 our computer address 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.860
 Basically these are the main ways how 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.900
 can this be done you had a channel without 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.280
 wiring dream such a fund to be directed 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.280
 you will be assigned to the decision
