00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:20.920
 I'm Next This time I'm Kamensenno Tennami's true ability and 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:21.940
 So if it is about the difference between the reaction of Kano super power 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.330
 ko 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.039
 High status is 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.609
 It looks like this 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:34.390
 Hit point is the power and want to eat better of Marcel 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:37.220
 Guards that are more expensive than radio are together 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:44.030
 If you have a special move 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:50.500
 The name is a little different, but the coefficients are exactly the same and it's powerful together 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.500
 Just here, here's ur 7 cents 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.410
 Not quite expensive 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:03.200
 If you want to use it for a one-kill, this Kamesento is better 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:09.960
 That v-jumped Kamensen in Choba's reaction 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:12.030
 It seems to follow, but it depends on the status. If you use it with that one kill 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.710
 Yup 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.670
 Well that status is this 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.780
 More than 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.820
 It is good is better here in the cell as long as take a little 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:29.090
 That one kill 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:34.940
 If you use it with something other than such a deck , for example, it will be worn in round 2 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:39.730
 If you don't have trunks adolescent superpower reaction or not 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.640
 It is when it is here that if status took 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.620
 It is a case of dancing 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.620
 And the ability is Doi 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:57.189
 Yes positive damage energy damage the recoil of the super power is given to the enemy during the Round 2 is doubled 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:04.479
 If there is power with two rounds of life, it is down 70% 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:07.659
 In return, Take Tenshi is extremely powerful, with twice as much damage to the enemy as a special move at the true point. 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:12.410
 It's about doing damage 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.190
 In other words, once in a while no matter what round 3 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.920
 I will 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.910
 Special attack even once 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.910
 Hamamatsu 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.590
 When the addicted and would 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:29.290
 From now on, this ability will not apply from the next round 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.569
 It is a thing 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:36.870
 If only the hand of the secretary is round 2 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:40.560
 It means that it will be continued 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.370
 It is here if you use 1 Kirudi since 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.530
 ur radio 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:54.180
 It is inferior to this because it comes with the reaction of the super power in v v jump 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:59.760
 If you like better to use a person here of cell 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:01.240
 Who it is is better to use the here in is better to use here that I thought Well there is hot water in the turtle Senki 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.490
 Is it 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.580
 Who I love reactionary hero type of ultra-par trunks adolescence campaign after 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.439
 Is it 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:16.230
 After double action also intelligence 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:17.750
 There is also the hard of Jeter super par There is also some- elite type of those of Urea 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.840
 of 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.310
 Super par hand organ 6 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.540
 Because there is 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:32.550
 Bae different and I think I myself doing by Kumudekki is only 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:36.750
 Here of Master Roshi at the time of the only mission enemy you do not write went to the fire 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:40.190
 Because you always use it as issue Author of one kill members 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.020
 You can use it like this 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.730
 I am 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.710
 More than this 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:53.880
 Here 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:57.470
 But now that or use Well hell of a formidable enemy to it 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:01.970
 You need these two people 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.050
 That at that jerk dragon mission earn Hiro Energy to round 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.219
 Say to + 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:13.139
 Even ability is no longer available ones 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:15.470
 Toka take away with you I'll Nemaa burst there is only compensated by the 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:21.829
 If who burst 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:26.150
 It's a little inconvenient because the version has to be triggered 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.240
 Because if you are an ability, you can trigger it already 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.650
 this 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.650
 A like contemporary of hell 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:39.099
 And a hellish enemy with the same ability 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.590
 The more you go the better the better the effect 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.520
 eh 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:48.729
 In the case of only these two people will increase 500 points Yes 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:54.700
 Been reservoir child a pick up in round one Rokko because 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:57.480
 When the strike in this Master Roshi and round one to deathblow path here trunks 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.480
 I mean 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:07.060
 Because 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:07.060
 It is better to use properly the reaction of the real top of the Take Tenshi and the super bar 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:15.690
 very well 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.680
 Well for those from the side, which is also the previous Well yellowtail jump gotten comments of Master Roshi ultra-par 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.350
 reaction 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.529
 Yup 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:24.830
 Yes, I will follow you 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:27.480
 After all it depends on the status 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.540
 As I said earlier 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.820
 I'll have the repercussions and money of this super par 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.840
 Gu 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:39.449
 If you have only the reaction of the bar of super bar 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.729
 It depends on the status of that Kamesento already 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:49.830
 Well now the price of this ur is falling too 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:56.210
 It has come down considerably, but the price depends on the store, though 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:56.210
 I think that it is cheaper than single purchase is accompanied by 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:05.370
 Its sold well the same as the sale amount 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.080
 Well there is Kumar 100 yen coin 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:13.030
 Well put and call continuously 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.670
 Well even if ur comes out , if it is not this ur but other urs, my parents shake 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.720
 It is better to buy 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:21.100
 Not sure 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:24.409
 So it is quicker to buy a single 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:30.439
 For example, within 5 times 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:33.630
 There is also a pattern that if you did the card mating but this is out, but it is 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:36.030
 Nde not a 100% 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:39.510
 I do not know if it will come out 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:42.860
 It's already ugly when it comes out in the first order 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:48.439
 I am lucky I am lucky 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:50.950
 Te chanted sushi still the same amount as the sales and select buy the card 

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:54.990
 If you get a wrong ur 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.990
 Single purchase is certain 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.180
 While door Well 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.860
 Dance party 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:10.849
 I talked about it 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:10.849
 It was the video that I distinguish the recoil of the true value and super power of TakeTakashi Roshi
