00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
placed and every village has library

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.319 
placed and every village has library
looking<00:01:29.579> placed<00:01:29.759> because<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.000> don't<00:01:30.150> know<00:01:30.210> what

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
looking placed because I don't know what

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.630 
looking placed because I don't know what
else<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.509> colonise<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.140> oh<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.070> heat<00:01:32.250> okay

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
else to colonise and oh we can heat okay

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.710 
else to colonise and oh we can heat okay
also<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.970> heard<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.360> can<00:01:33.479> hit<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
also I heard that you can hit the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.999 
also I heard that you can hit the
village<00:01:33.869> through<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.290> door<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.920> that's

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
village through the door so that's

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.190 
village through the door so that's
another<00:01:35.280> cool<00:01:36.000> thing<00:01:36.360> because<00:01:36.689> here<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.049> think

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
another cool thing because here I think

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.090 
another cool thing because here I think
it's<00:01:37.320> like<00:01:37.409> it'll<00:01:37.650> suppose<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.890> be<00:01:37.950> like<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
