00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
bit of a lure on so the wing doesn't fit

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.680 
bit of a lure on so the wing doesn't fit
and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.660 
and
that<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.500> way<00:00:43.739> number<00:00:43.949> one<00:00:44.100> way<00:00:44.399> number<00:00:44.579> two

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that was way number one way number two

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.790 
that was way number one way number two
is<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> crap<00:00:45.449> and<00:00:45.719> then<00:00:45.930> at<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.140> last<00:00:46.379> second

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
is a crap and then at the last second

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.439 
is a crap and then at the last second
kick<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.190> rudder<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.760> set<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.059> now<00:00:48.210> on

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
kick in that rudder and set it now on

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.180 
kick in that rudder and set it now on
all<00:00:48.600> three<00:00:50.059> this<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.329> crab<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.559> basically

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
all three this is the crab so basically

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.410 
all three this is the crab so basically
it's<00:00:53.339> gonna<00:00:53.399> be<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> same<00:00:53.789> idea<00:00:54.089> this<00:00:54.360> is

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
it's gonna be the same idea this is

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.029 
it's gonna be the same idea this is
everything<00:00:54.839> that<00:00:54.989> we're<00:00:55.409> doing<00:00:55.440> right<00:00:55.769> now<00:00:55.829> is

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
everything that we're doing right now is

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.840 
everything that we're doing right now is
applied<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.430> full-scale<00:00:58.430> so<00:00:59.430> I'm<00:00:59.549> going<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> be

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
applied to full-scale so I'm going to be

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.939 
applied to full-scale so I'm going to be
on<00:01:00.000> my<00:01:00.089> base<00:01:00.269> turn<00:01:00.540> here<00:01:00.780> notice<00:01:01.110> a<00:01:01.229> very<00:01:01.620> big

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
on my base turn here notice a very big

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.880 
on my base turn here notice a very big
head<00:01:02.159> wind<00:01:02.420> when<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.449> turn<00:01:03.719> comes<00:01:04.290> across<00:01:04.559> one

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
head wind when I turn comes across one

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.530 
head wind when I turn comes across one
I'm<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.399> to<00:01:05.460> continue<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.850> crab<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.390> nose

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
I'm going to continue that crab the nose

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.060 
I'm going to continue that crab the nose
is<00:01:06.690> going<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.840> be<00:01:06.930> pointed<00:01:07.259> at<00:01:07.350> us<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
is going to be pointed at us but the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.960 
is going to be pointed at us but the
plane<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.280> tracking<00:01:08.820> down<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.090> runway<00:01:10.970> and

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
plane is tracking down the runway and

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.969 
plane is tracking down the runway and
then<00:01:12.299> when<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.539> get<00:01:12.659> really<00:01:12.840> low<00:01:13.140> last<00:01:13.530> second

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
then when I get really low last second

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.450 
then when I get really low last second
kicking<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.399> left<00:01:14.610> rudder<00:01:15.200> set<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.460> so

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
kicking that left rudder set it so

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.760 
kicking that left rudder set it so
you're<00:01:17.610> going<00:01:17.759> straight<00:01:18.000> down<00:01:18.030> rather<00:01:18.360> than

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
you're going straight down rather than

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.570 
you're going straight down rather than
continuing<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.800> keep<00:01:20.039> the<00:01:20.159> plane<00:01:20.369> going

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
continuing to keep the plane going

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.460 
continuing to keep the plane going
sideways<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.690> eventually<00:01:22.229> hitting

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
sideways and eventually hitting

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.740 
sideways and eventually hitting
bystanders<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.580> killing<00:01:23.970> everything<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
bystanders and killing everything in the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:40.030 
bystanders and killing everything in the
field<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.200> close

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.400 

all<00:01:41.040> right<00:01:41.190> now<00:01:41.370> I<00:01:41.480> finally<00:01:42.480> win<00:01:42.870> some<00:01:43.050> big<00:01:43.200> top

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410

quite<00:01:43.650> a<00:01:43.680> bit<00:01:43.920> I'm<00:01:44.640> gonna<00:01:44.730> do<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.090> side<00:01:45.330> sit

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
quite a bit I'm gonna do the side sit

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.660 
quite a bit I'm gonna do the side sit
here<00:01:46.760> notice<00:01:47.760> I'm<00:01:47.910> crabbing<00:01:48.420> now<00:01:49.460> as<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.610> get

try and put in some of that site still
appear<00:02:35.490> full<00:02:35.790> left<00:02:35.970> rudder<00:02:36.090> when<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.630> get<00:02:36.810> that

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
appear full left rudder when I get that

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.050 
appear full left rudder when I get that
right

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.280
