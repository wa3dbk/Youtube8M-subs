to be our sole water supply all the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.550 
to be our sole water supply all the
water<00:00:26.880> our<00:00:27.000> country<00:00:27.300> can<00:00:27.449> use<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.840> right<00:00:28.349> here

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
water our country can use is right here

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.320 
water our country can use is right here
in<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.830> picture<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.490> we're<00:00:30.090> going<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.240> have

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
in this picture so we're going to have

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.179 
in this picture so we're going to have
to<00:00:30.449> decide<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.990> figure<00:00:31.199> out<00:00:31.380> how<00:00:31.949> we're<00:00:32.099> going

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
to decide and figure out how we're going

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.250 
to decide and figure out how we're going
to<00:00:32.250> distribute<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.150> one<00:00:33.480> supply<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.930> water

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
to distribute this one supply of water

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.770 
to distribute this one supply of water
between<00:00:34.890> our<00:00:35.010> few<00:00:35.220> different<00:00:35.610> demands<00:00:36.000> so

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
between our few different demands so

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.479 
between our few different demands so
demands<00:00:37.199> just<00:00:37.470> means<00:00:37.650> that<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.040> places<00:00:38.400> that

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
demands just means that the places that

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.939 
demands just means that the places that
people<00:00:38.940> need<00:00:39.299> water<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:40.440> different<00:00:40.680> types<00:00:40.830> of

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
people need water for different types of

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.229 
people need water for different types of
things<00:00:41.190> all<00:00:41.879> right

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
things all right

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.320 
things all right
so<00:00:42.510> one<00:00:42.750> big<00:00:42.989> demand<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.650> we<00:00:43.739> have<00:00:43.949> is

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
so one big demand that we have is

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.820 
so one big demand that we have is
agriculture<00:00:45.330> according<00:00:46.290> to<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.440> United

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
agriculture according to the United

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.649 
agriculture according to the United
Nations<00:00:46.979> two<00:00:47.519> thirds<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.269> water<00:00:48.540> that

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659 
Nations two thirds of the water that

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.229 
Nations two thirds of the water that
people<00:00:48.809> use<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.440> used<00:00:49.830> for<00:00:49.949> agriculture<00:00:50.699> going

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
people use is used for agriculture going

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.020 
people use is used for agriculture going
to<00:00:51.330> farms<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.900> for<00:00:52.110> food<00:00:52.290> production<00:00:53.030> so

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
to farms and for food production so

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.359 
to farms and for food production so
we'll<00:00:54.150> go<00:00:54.210> ahead<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.390> get<00:00:54.860> 2/3<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.979> our<00:00:56.129> water

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:56.369 
we'll go ahead and get 2/3 of our water

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:59.810 
we'll go ahead and get 2/3 of our water
is<00:00:56.580> going<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.030> our<00:00:57.239> agriculture<00:00:58.250> now<00:00:59.250> so

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
is going to our agriculture now so

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.820 
is going to our agriculture now so
that's<00:01:00.030> 2/3<00:01:00.449> does<00:01:00.869> that<00:01:01.019> leave<00:01:01.229> us<00:01:01.350> much<00:01:01.530> water

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
that's 2/3 does that leave us much water

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.640 
that's 2/3 does that leave us much water
for<00:01:02.070> anything<00:01:02.850> else<00:01:03.110> all<00:01:04.110> right<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.500> what<00:01:04.619> are

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
for anything else all right so what are

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.990 
for anything else all right so what are
some<00:01:04.739> things<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.519> think<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.850> people

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
some things that you think that people

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.050 
some things that you think that people
need<00:01:06.270> water<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:07.160> drinking<00:01:08.160> so<00:01:08.670> people<00:01:08.940> have

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
need water for drinking so people have

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.840 
need water for drinking so people have
to<00:01:09.150> drink<00:01:09.330> water

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.160 

all<00:01:14.850> right<00:01:15.620> washing<00:01:16.620> clothes<00:01:17.990> takes<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.080> little

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
all right washing clothes takes a little

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
all right washing clothes takes a little
bit<00:01:19.350> more<00:01:19.500> water<00:01:19.680> all<00:01:20.580> right<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:22.710> let's<00:01:23.100> think

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
bit more water all right so let's think

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.520 
bit more water all right so let's think
of<00:01:23.340> some<00:01:23.460> things<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.790> happen<00:01:24.320> in<00:01:25.320> our

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
of some things that happen in our

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.930 
of some things that happen in our
environment<00:01:26.100> or<00:01:26.160> things<00:01:26.370> that<00:01:26.490> people<00:01:26.670> do

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
environment or things that people do

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.930 
environment or things that people do
that<00:01:27.420> changes<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.290> demands<00:01:28.620> for<00:01:28.860> water<00:01:28.940> all

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
that changes the demands for water all

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.370 
that changes the demands for water all
right<00:01:30.150> Lily<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.630> say<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.780> Europe<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.320> you're

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
right Lily in say in Europe and you're

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.780 
right Lily in say in Europe and you're
part<00:01:31.620> of<00:01:31.650> our<00:01:31.740> country<00:01:32.070> over<00:01:32.220> here<00:01:32.400> what

say we have a drought over here in your
part<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.870> country<00:01:37.230> would<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.409> need<00:01:37.620> more

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
part of the country would you need more

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:46.160 
part of the country would you need more
water<00:01:38.220> or<00:01:38.490> less<00:01:39.030> water<00:01:39.800> you<00:01:40.800> need<00:01:41.010> more<00:01:45.170> all

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
supply now water supply based on rain

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.710 
supply now water supply based on rain
and<00:02:14.549> where<00:02:14.790> you're<00:02:14.940> getting<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.209> water<00:02:15.360> from

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
and where you're getting the water from

will replenish replenish itself but that

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.690 
will replenish replenish itself but that
usually<00:02:18.780> usually<00:02:19.019> happens<00:02:19.470> more<00:02:19.620> slowly<00:02:19.980> than

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
usually usually happens more slowly than

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.910 
usually usually happens more slowly than
the<00:02:21.569> demands<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.140> means<00:02:22.440> we're<00:02:22.620> using<00:02:22.769> up

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
the demands that means we're using up

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.830 
the demands that means we're using up
water<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.549> our<00:02:23.940> supplies<00:02:24.299> are<00:02:24.540> really<00:02:24.690> not

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
water and our supplies are really not

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.990 
water and our supplies are really not
getting<00:02:25.080> much<00:02:25.530> larger<00:02:25.799> all<00:02:26.640> right<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:26.879> this

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
getting much larger all right so this

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.789 
getting much larger all right so this
leaves<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.390> problem<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.780> called<00:02:27.989> scarcity

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
leaves the problem is called scarcity

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.039 
leaves the problem is called scarcity
and<00:02:29.060> according<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.239> United<00:02:30.660> Nations

about<00:02:31.440> 20-25<00:02:32.400> that's<00:02:32.849> only<00:02:33.030> 19<00:02:33.390> years<00:02:33.420> away

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
about 20-25 that's only 19 years away
