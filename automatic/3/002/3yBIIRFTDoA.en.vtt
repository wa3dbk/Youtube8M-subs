00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.310 

not<00:00:53.699> much<00:00:53.910> -<00:00:54.210> it's<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.940> Seeger<00:00:57.050> stamp<00:00:58.050> of

bike out like so and look at the bike

bike out like so and look at the bike
the<00:01:18.530> bike<00:01:18.710> very<00:01:19.670> thin<00:01:20.180> as<00:01:20.540> one<00:01:21.140> would<00:01:21.320> expect

the bike very thin as one would expect
for<00:01:21.920> pocket<00:01:22.369> power<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:23.420> back<00:01:24.229> wheel<00:01:24.470> is<00:01:25.180> a

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
for pocket power the back wheel is a

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.800 
for pocket power the back wheel is a
solid<00:01:26.899> chunk<00:01:27.320> of<00:01:27.500> diecast<00:01:28.040> middle<00:01:28.880> very<00:01:29.270> sexy

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
solid chunk of diecast middle very sexy

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.960 
solid chunk of diecast middle very sexy
and<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:32.690> bike<00:01:32.840> is<00:01:32.869> fairly<00:01:33.229> standard<00:01:33.850> not<00:01:34.850> all

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
and the bike is fairly standard not all

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.490 
and the bike is fairly standard not all
that<00:01:35.090> much<00:01:35.270> detail<00:01:35.720> on<00:01:36.110> it<00:01:36.140> I<00:01:37.899> do<00:01:38.899> like<00:01:39.259> the

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
that much detail on it I do like the

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.719 
that much detail on it I do like the
handlebars<00:01:39.830> here<00:01:40.390> actually<00:01:41.390> fold<00:01:41.690> out

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.640 

so<00:01:46.330> theoretically<00:01:46.630> you<00:01:47.080> could<00:01:47.320> put<00:01:47.500> a<00:01:47.530> little

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
so theoretically you could put a little

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.899 
so theoretically you could put a little
man<00:01:47.950> on<00:01:48.159> there

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.190 

all<00:01:52.359> right<00:01:52.509> so<00:01:53.020> popular<00:01:53.530> they're<00:01:54.630> quite<00:01:55.630> tough

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
all right so popular they're quite tough

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.349 
all right so popular they're quite tough
enough<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.469> stand<00:01:56.679> up<00:01:56.770> by<00:01:56.920> himself<00:01:57.359> ripcord

00:01:58.349 --> 00:01:58.359 
enough to stand up by himself ripcord

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:02.609 
enough to stand up by himself ripcord
lives<00:01:58.719> in<00:01:58.929> and<00:01:59.729> by<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:01.240> looks<00:02:01.659> of<00:02:01.780> things<00:02:02.020> does

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
lives in and by the looks of things does

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.260 
lives in and by the looks of things does
the<00:02:02.649> old<00:02:02.890> loop<00:02:03.399> around<00:02:03.579> the<00:02:03.789> outside<00:02:04.090> of<00:02:04.210> the

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
the old loop around the outside of the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.649 
the old loop around the outside of the
base<00:02:04.450> I<00:02:04.950> believe<00:02:05.950> this<00:02:06.189> bit<00:02:06.369> here<00:02:06.640> is<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:07.209> kind

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
base I believe this bit here is a kind

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:15.900 
base I believe this bit here is a kind
of<00:02:07.810> launcher<00:02:08.200> or<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.340> bike

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.840 

here<00:02:16.510> we<00:02:16.690> go<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.320> it<00:02:17.380> fits<00:02:17.650> in<00:02:17.860> snugly<00:02:18.430> into<00:02:18.610> the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
here we go so it fits in snugly into the

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.420 
here we go so it fits in snugly into the
bottom<00:02:19.240> there

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.869 

hmm<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.360> after<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.870> brief<00:02:26.140> investigation<00:02:26.879> all

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
hmm so after a brief investigation all

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.160 
hmm so after a brief investigation all
right<00:02:28.030> since<00:02:28.239> discovered<00:02:28.689> there<00:02:28.810> is<00:02:28.840> an<00:02:29.019> arrow

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
right since discovered there is an arrow

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.809 
right since discovered there is an arrow
pointing<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.739> where<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.129> ripcord<00:02:30.430> needs<00:02:30.700> to

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
pointing to where the ripcord needs to

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.429 
pointing to where the ripcord needs to
go<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.420> is<00:02:31.480> there<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:34.019> root<00:02:35.019> cord<00:02:35.260> goes

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
go and it is there a root cord goes

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.920 
go and it is there a root cord goes
straight<00:02:35.739> into<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.040> bike<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:37.180> don't

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
straight into the bike so you don't

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.449 
straight into the bike so you don't
really<00:02:38.110> need<00:02:38.349> to<00:02:38.500> use<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.709> launcher<00:02:39.250> if<00:02:39.370> you

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
really need to use the launcher if you

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:59.870 
really need to use the launcher if you
don't<00:02:39.640> want<00:02:39.819> joggers<00:02:40.530> there<00:02:41.530> sits<00:02:41.859> in<00:02:41.980> there

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.220 

so<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.990> very<00:03:01.470> fair<00:03:02.070> bit<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.490> puffing<00:03:03.480> around

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
so a very fair bit of puffing around

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.360 
so a very fair bit of puffing around
I<00:03:05.540> have<00:03:06.540> half<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.380> rip<00:03:07.560> cord<00:03:07.740> in<00:03:07.950> place<00:03:08.190> I

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
I have half the rip cord in place I

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.090 
I have half the rip cord in place I
would<00:03:11.370> suspect<00:03:11.880> that<00:03:12.680> it's<00:03:13.680> probably<00:03:13.950> bit

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
would suspect that it's probably bit

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.560 
would suspect that it's probably bit
easier<00:03:14.460> to<00:03:14.490> use<00:03:14.610> without<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.060> launcher

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
easier to use without the launcher

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.720 
easier to use without the launcher
because<00:03:15.930> every<00:03:16.200> time<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.410> put<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.070> little<00:03:17.460> bit<00:03:17.610> of

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
because every time I put a little bit of

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.430 
because every time I put a little bit of
pressure<00:03:17.970> on<00:03:18.090> here<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.540> bike<00:03:18.750> has<00:03:18.960> a<00:03:18.990> tendency

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
pressure on here the bike has a tendency

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.130 
pressure on here the bike has a tendency
to<00:03:19.530> pop<00:03:19.710> out<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.690> because<00:03:21.690> there<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.930> piece

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
to pop out and because there is a piece

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.510 
to pop out and because there is a piece
of<00:03:22.170> plastic<00:03:22.590> between<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:23.040> bike<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.460> my

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
of plastic between the bike and my

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.580 
of plastic between the bike and my
launcher<00:03:23.990> it<00:03:24.990> gets<00:03:25.530> in<00:03:25.710> the<00:03:25.830> way<00:03:26.390> so<00:03:27.390> I'll<00:03:28.020> be

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
launcher it gets in the way so I'll be

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.030 
launcher it gets in the way so I'll be
curious<00:03:28.770> to<00:03:28.950> see<00:03:29.040> if<00:03:29.220> this<00:03:29.310> actually<00:03:29.550> can<00:03:29.850> work

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
curious to see if this actually can work

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.830 
curious to see if this actually can work
without<00:03:32.060> making<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.150> bike<00:03:33.300> just<00:03:33.510> randomly

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
without making the bike just randomly

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.460 
without making the bike just randomly
fall<00:03:34.140> off<00:03:34.290> somewhere<00:03:35.600> so<00:03:36.600> these<00:03:36.810> are<00:03:37.050> just<00:03:37.170> is

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
fall off somewhere so these are just is

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:44.920 
fall off somewhere so these are just is
it<00:03:37.620> in<00:03:37.800> balance

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:04:05.320 

not<00:03:45.530> a<00:03:45.560> great

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.899 

so<00:04:06.330> after<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.200> fair<00:04:07.709> bit<00:04:07.890> of<00:04:07.920> failure<00:04:08.370> with<00:04:08.700> the

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
so after a fair bit of failure with the

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.740 
so after a fair bit of failure with the
launcher<00:04:09.390> which<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:10.349> suspect<00:04:10.620> was<00:04:10.980> probably<00:04:11.280> a

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
launcher which I suspect was probably a

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.629 
launcher which I suspect was probably a
good<00:04:12.750> idea<00:04:13.019> in<00:04:13.200> concept<00:04:14.060> but<00:04:15.060> somewhat<00:04:16.220> Lorden

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
good idea in concept but somewhat Lorden

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.560 
good idea in concept but somewhat Lorden
end<00:04:18.150> result<00:04:19.489> although<00:04:20.489> I<00:04:20.609> do<00:04:20.760> notice<00:04:21.150> if<00:04:21.479> you

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
end result although I do notice if you

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.740 
end result although I do notice if you
have<00:04:21.750> a<00:04:21.780> look<00:04:22.019> up<00:04:22.169> here<00:04:26.389> have<00:04:27.389> a<00:04:27.419> look<00:04:27.600> along

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
have a look up here have a look along

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.680 
have a look up here have a look along
here<00:04:27.930> you<00:04:28.320> can<00:04:28.440> see<00:04:28.620> there's<00:04:28.889> a<00:04:29.539> and<00:04:30.539> I

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
here you can see there's a and I

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.969 
here you can see there's a and I
understand<00:04:31.169> why<00:04:31.440> after<00:04:32.430> years<00:04:32.910> of<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.300> use<00:04:33.510> a

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
understand why after years of the use a

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.650 
understand why after years of the use a
the<00:04:34.979> piece<00:04:35.850> of<00:04:35.970> plastic<00:04:36.120> they<00:04:36.389> would<00:04:36.510> actually

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
the piece of plastic they would actually

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.080 
the piece of plastic they would actually
probably<00:04:36.930> get<00:04:37.229> bit<00:04:38.010> mangled<00:04:38.550> and<00:04:38.669> worn<00:04:38.910> out

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
probably get bit mangled and worn out

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.129 
probably get bit mangled and worn out
over<00:04:39.419> time<00:04:40.070> so<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:42.180> could<00:04:42.449> have<00:04:42.600> well<00:04:42.810> worked

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
over time so it could have well worked

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.379 
over time so it could have well worked
rather<00:04:43.560> well<00:04:43.770> back<00:04:44.460> in<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.729> day<00:04:44.910> when<00:04:45.180> it<00:04:45.270> was

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
rather well back in the day when it was

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.520 
rather well back in the day when it was
a<00:04:45.419> new<00:04:45.690> toy<00:04:46.199> but<00:04:46.620> now<00:04:47.190> it's<00:04:48.229> probably<00:04:49.229> a<00:04:49.410> bit

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
a new toy but now it's probably a bit

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.719 
a new toy but now it's probably a bit
too<00:04:49.650> loose<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:49.919> actually<00:04:50.280> hold<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.520> bike<00:04:50.699> in

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
too loose to actually hold the bike in

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.969 
too loose to actually hold the bike in
place<00:04:51.080> but<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:52.169> don't<00:04:52.350> really<00:04:52.440> need<00:04:52.650> it<00:04:52.710> for

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
place but you don't really need it for

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.129 
place but you don't really need it for
the<00:04:53.130> bike<00:04:53.310> because<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:54.330> rip<00:04:54.870> cord<00:04:55.050> just

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
the bike because the the rip cord just

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.469 
the bike because the the rip cord just
goes<00:04:55.410> straight<00:04:55.680> through<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:56.010> wheel<00:04:56.330> you<00:04:57.330> can

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
goes straight through the wheel you can

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.360 
goes straight through the wheel you can
see<00:04:57.630> there<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.139> little<00:05:00.740> geared<00:05:01.740> beat<00:05:02.010> the

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
see there the little geared beat the

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.219 
see there the little geared beat the
ripcord<00:05:02.669> pulls<00:05:02.970> on<00:05:03.150> and<00:05:03.389> just<00:05:03.570> with<00:05:03.900> that<00:05:03.930> baby

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
ripcord pulls on and just with that baby

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:10.100 
ripcord pulls on and just with that baby
out<00:05:04.440> and<00:05:04.710> spins<00:05:05.160> rather<00:05:05.400> well

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.469 

was<00:05:10.710> I<00:05:11.010> hmm

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.909 

cuz<00:05:13.870> I'm<00:05:13.960> like<00:05:13.990> going<00:05:14.289> any<00:05:14.439> further<00:05:14.680> than<00:05:14.889> that

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
cuz I'm like going any further than that

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:25.879 
cuz I'm like going any further than that
as<00:05:15.250> well<00:05:15.900> no<00:05:16.900> again<00:05:17.469> Oh

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.489 

I<00:05:27.409> was<00:05:28.409> pretty<00:05:28.560> cool

00:05:30.489 --> 00:05:30.499 
I was pretty cool

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:49.810 
I was pretty cool
one<00:05:31.009> more<00:05:31.189> try

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.870 

and<00:05:50.090> there<00:05:50.540> we<00:05:50.690> have<00:05:50.840> it<00:05:50.990> that<00:05:51.410> is<00:05:51.740> the

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.400 

motorbike<00:05:58.480> actually<00:05:59.480> afford<00:05:59.750> that<00:05:59.900> in<00:06:00.080> I

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
motorbike actually afford that in I

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.110 
motorbike actually afford that in I
think<00:06:00.920> quite<00:06:01.040> surprised<00:06:01.370> to<00:06:01.520> see<00:06:01.700> that<00:06:01.850> it<00:06:01.970> has

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
think quite surprised to see that it has

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.200 
think quite surprised to see that it has
a<00:06:02.150> kind<00:06:02.420> of<00:06:02.540> light<00:06:04.090> decal<00:06:05.090> on<00:06:05.300> the<00:06:05.420> front<00:06:05.660> there

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
a kind of light decal on the front there

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:15.930 
a kind of light decal on the front there
nifty<00:06:08.210> but<00:06:09.430> yeah<00:06:13.660> maybe<00:06:14.660> not<00:06:14.870> quite<00:06:15.080> as

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
nifty but yeah maybe not quite as

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.450 
nifty but yeah maybe not quite as
resilient<00:06:16.940> as<00:06:17.530> some<00:06:18.530> of<00:06:18.650> the<00:06:18.770> other<00:06:18.890> Hawker

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
resilient as some of the other Hawker

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.890 
resilient as some of the other Hawker
power<00:06:19.760> items<00:06:22.120> well<00:06:23.120> I<00:06:23.240> could<00:06:23.450> have<00:06:23.540> just<00:06:23.750> mean

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
power items well I could have just mean

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.150 
power items well I could have just mean
that<00:06:24.110> this<00:06:24.230> one<00:06:24.470> in<00:06:24.590> particular<00:06:24.710> has<00:06:25.070> been

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
that this one in particular has been

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.710 
that this one in particular has been
through<00:06:25.490> a<00:06:25.520> bit<00:06:25.640> more<00:06:25.880> abuse

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:36.040 

but<00:06:30.670> not<00:06:31.670> a<00:06:31.700> bad<00:06:31.910> concept<00:06:32.480> a<00:06:32.780> bad<00:06:33.200> idea

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.560 

so<00:06:36.590> if<00:06:36.650> that<00:06:36.950> is<00:06:37.130> the<00:06:37.160> motorbike

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.900 

and<00:06:40.660> I'll<00:06:41.620> have<00:06:41.980> some<00:06:42.190> more<00:06:42.220> pocket<00:06:42.730> power

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
and I'll have some more pocket power

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.240 
and I'll have some more pocket power
soon
