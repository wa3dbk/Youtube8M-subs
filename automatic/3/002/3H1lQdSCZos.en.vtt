00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hello dear friends on the sofa 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.420
 Dolina President of the International Bureau 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.990
 on human rights in the field of spiritual 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.210
 health 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.490
 I received such a letter comment 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.369
 why don't you find a video about insulin 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.529
 shock and therapy and danger can not 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.840
 overestimate 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.050
 it used to be the main one 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.789
 voucher for disability 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.760
 people just sometimes forced 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.279
 recognize that he has voices and then 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.790
 prescribed a course of insulin therapy 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.030
 if a person and u preparations could no longer 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.879
 work then this situation is not accepted 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.430
 psychiatrists at best 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.879
 the case was given to sign a paper that 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.430
 the patient takes responsibility 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:54.090
 full and most often they do not 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.480
 warned not what I have today 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.160
 I'll talk about the same thing 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.969
 insulin therapy is behind this 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.240
 seemingly fluffy name at the very 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.470
 actually this is another cudgel this is another 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.640
 scary tool that is used 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.229
 psychiatrists to kill a man 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.259
 let's see what is all 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.570
 insulin man well here he has 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.460
 that our stomach is somehow not his 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.100
 very naturally draws he has 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.850
 pancreas there is 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.890
 special cells which 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.520
 produce insulin and it goes into 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:41.220
 blood there and so on here and this insulin 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:47.369
 helps glucose absorb glucose can 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:50.540
 get into the cell of a person only if 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.979
 to her like this 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.979
 stuck so let's say insulin 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.190
 when a cell arrives when glucose comes from 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.380
 insulin enters the cells there 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.530
 formed the energy exchange of bodies can 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.560
 energy the body can work if 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.729
 smoke goats more than this, you must first 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.390
 biological form 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:19.660
 deposited in the muscles and if even more 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:24.380
 then fat is produced is very simple on 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:28.370
 actually blood glucose 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:32.900
 human is very important because it is 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:35.920
 energy level depends on glucose level 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.420
 human depends on his performance 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.540
 performance of all organisms if 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.530
 insulin rises in the bloodstream 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.840
 along with glucose naturally all glucose 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.730
 begins to connect with insulin an example 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.910
 acquires a biologically active form 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.540
 begins to be consumed by the body but 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.780
 This if we artificially will raise 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:05.110
 the insulin level from the bloodstream goes all over 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:09.530
 glucose and a very terrible thing comes 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.630
 the death of man comes that is what 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.750
 happens 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:17.060
 man in the bloodstream psychiatrists specifically 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.400
 droppers just injects up to insulin and 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.170
 begin to add to human blood 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:27.950
 insulin while glucose naturally 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:33.940
 destroyed man does not eat and gradually 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:37.940
 he begins to die actual straight and 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.550
 overtly that is the same 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.820
 if a person does not know pumped out 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.940
 blood or someone would have stabbed him the same 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:51.110
 the very person starts literally 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:54.200
 die and when a person is a person 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.810
 reaches the death state here 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.590
 just a little bit a bit and already all in 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.019
 the group is there 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.220
 psychiatrists measure these parameters 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.540
 human body for a while 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.950
 left in this deathbed state 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:14.590
 and then start another drip 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.139
 add him blood glucose and so 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.750
 man 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:25.870
 Auger organism comes to life and here such 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.180
 death conditions by medical 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:33.370
 recommends a person to pass standards 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:35.560
 up to 10 times what happens when 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.690
 the man is in death 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.000
 able to naturally have him 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.580
 hunger begins of all organs and systems 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.850
 start to die off cells naturally 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.729
 the brain suffers 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.639
 in some unthinkable way 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:53.680
 endocrine system suffers 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:56.530
 cardiovascular almost everything 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.020
 organ systems of the body tissues 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.340
 the body and the brain including 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:07.289
 here and become from even from one such 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:10.000
 sessions come out with huge lesions 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:14.139
 here are such sessions man 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.560
 recommended up to 10 times as I understand it for 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:22.680
 a course of treatment can be even 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.889
 2-3 times a year so my friends are not 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.789
 insulin therapy 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:30.010
 this intentional kill is slow 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:34.139
 killing a man is another 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:37.870
 a tool that psychiatrists invented 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:40.510
 psychiatrists sprinkled him beautiful 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:44.560
 medical terms psychiatrists have called 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:49.720
 this is a cure for my friends this is another 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.490
 killing a man just because 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.020
 psychiatrists never know what 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.660
 man has problems with them 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.099
 like and just because some 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.060
 of them really like 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:03.440
 fly people that was all i thank 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.720
 you for your attention 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.550
 please ask your questions i 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.159
 urge you to participate in anti 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.889
 make a psychiatric movement 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:13.340
 please donate and be in 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.440
 course 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.440
 be free all the best
