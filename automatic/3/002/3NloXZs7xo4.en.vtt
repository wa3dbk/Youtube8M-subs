the game into giving you could players
I'm<00:03:07.040> not<00:03:07.310> really<00:03:07.459> too<00:03:07.700> sure<00:03:07.730> if<00:03:08.060> that's

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:08.419 
I'm not really too sure if that's

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.050 
I'm not really too sure if that's
plausible<00:03:08.689> Eva<00:03:09.109> but<00:03:09.349> as<00:03:09.469> I<00:03:09.620> said<00:03:09.819> you<00:03:10.819> know<00:03:10.909> I

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
plausible Eva but as I said you know I

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.580 
plausible Eva but as I said you know I
don't<00:03:11.269> believe<00:03:11.419> any<00:03:11.599> of<00:03:11.659> them<00:03:11.900> personally<00:03:12.469> and

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.379 
don't believe any of them personally and
I<00:03:12.950> think<00:03:13.189> that<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:13.519> know<00:03:13.639> it's<00:03:13.819> just<00:03:13.879> the<00:03:14.090> same

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
I think that you know it's just the same

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.020 
I think that you know it's just the same
look<00:03:14.569> as<00:03:14.689> open<00:03:14.930> up<00:03:15.049> a<00:03:15.169> bank<00:03:15.349> normally<00:03:15.859> so<00:03:16.489> the
