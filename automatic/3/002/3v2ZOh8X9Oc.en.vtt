00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.340
 Hello everyone 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.940
 owen rage aka hergé in hand the crd 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.910
 cnit in the cold 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.680
 duo 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.750
 because dual sim for the market 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.930
 French it will be available 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.000
 and the month of April and 299 euros ttc 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.050
 now let's take a quick tour of 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.939
 microphone 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.239
 the liquid e 3 is equipped with a screen 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.210
 touch of 5 inches of HD resolution and 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.970
 of technology y ps I had a very 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.250
 good vision whatever the angle 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.800
 tilt the phone is a 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.120
 excellent brightness also in terms of 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.120
 platform one is on a body weight 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.940
 by quad core media library a budget of 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.860
 giguère with a 42 megabit radio 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.710
 so even if we did not clear you 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.590
 go very fast for a charge in term 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.719
 of design we have a level of there is so 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.320
 a curved design grip that is 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.040
 very good 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.550
 also a rescue on the back of the 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:15.140
 of the liquid 3 which is quite pleasant to 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:18.710
 conclude a good grip game so the final 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.290
 TV near 8 9 9 mm on the back of the 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.610
 audience of 3 we find the camera 2 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.740
 megapixels with an opening 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.690
 objective 1.8 which means we have 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.880
 enormously with brightness that 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.030
 come within the objective in very few 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.800
 time 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.370
 so we always had very 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.750
 light 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.640
 we also have the button fast enough 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.550
 we introduce at the beginning of the year 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.480
 at crs on the likoud z5 which is a 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:50.790
 feature a multifunction button 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:54.560
 contextual and settings and the part 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.860
 obviously noticeable of the liquid 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.710
 you this is his front camera 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.740
 with a flash led to take 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.360
 excellent pictures of oneself in 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.770
 all environments including in 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.289
 low light 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:14.390
 here we have the two body sim card of 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:16.630
 the other side the key micro and we'll have 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.700
 an internal memory 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.410
 four men frames and 1 giga gives 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.480
 so a good fluidity 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.950
 all accompanied by a half battery 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.980
 million losses which gives a very 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.090
 good autonomy also and now 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.769
 go back a little bit in 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.510
 features we look at a announcement 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.310
 senate a new interface acer she 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.010
 does not distort the android experience 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.170
 which has just improved notably on 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:44.420
 small intuitive features like 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.980
 the possibility of blocking 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.510
 notifications of an application during 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.760
 a certain time we have pre defined a 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.380
 hour 24 hours we can always if we 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.930
 is bothered by eagle shelter issues 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.670
 which are interesting to you here my 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.329
 screen will not reappear their 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.489
 next hours also we will see 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.430
 transitions that are customizable 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:07.160
 in terms of screen change of 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.750
 color themes and the integration of 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.480
 cloud apps that will end up 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.980
 now relatively so in 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.530
 the android interface 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.230
 with multitasking also with the 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.610
 preview preview photos i 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.159
 you spoke a little earlier about 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.989
 the 3 megapixel camera 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:26.510
 here we have two pictures taken with acer 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.280
 liquid world believes one has a mode 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.530
 specific for low light that 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.390
 is called past with match and we can 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.620
 report from here we have a lot more 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.150
 of light entering 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.890
 a lot less brio a noise 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.489
 also the two poles they are 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.799
 superimposed here are taken without flash 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.060
 a shield is to make disappear 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.459
 the sound of giving pictures of a 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.030
 extremely good quality in bass 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.129
 brightness 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.879
 thank you to show you rise also the 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.879
 frontal flash 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.370
 no 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.730
 here 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.469
 and finally a little word on a quick ca 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.329
 which allows to control his 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:07.280
 phone with naturally are at a 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.459
 down that comes to position itself on the 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.459
 touch 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:16.220
 an action not warts the phone 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.220
 and we end up 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.630
 it's on the home screen another 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.070
 action we will see its application 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.680
 favorite which for me is the gallery 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.919
 but also from any screen 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.120
 we will be able to do a long press 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.070
 that she took long that will bring 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.530
 the camera and I told you 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.780
 also contextual since when 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.740
 press again we take a picture 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.569
 here 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.220
 so here's a liquid of 3 available in 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:46.060
 France from the beginning of April at the price 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.060
 from 199 euros
