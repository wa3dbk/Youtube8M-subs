00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:03.520
 pavatex fibreboard manufactured from by-products 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.490
 siri in the form of chips the guide to pieces of wood always have in 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.540
 litigation mainly softwood preferably from the seraglio on his part 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.190
 the platelets are first studied relative by supply of water vapor under 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.619
 pressure of 3 goals to 1 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.650
 we prepare for six crew members 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.169
 mixed with water up to 90% water 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.949
 are then placed in tanks to allow optimal agglomeration 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.810
 on the machines that go to them but then transforms it 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.789
 it is not necessary and it is important 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.390
 to add glue 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.200
 for some specific products 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.240
 however, it is possible to add ligaments based on resin and 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.800
 bitumen 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.360
 but not more than 2% of the mass 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.550
 after mechanical pressing 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.860
 which will prevent accumulating much of the water 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.100
 wood fiber boards 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.820
 are dried at temperatures anywhere from 160 to 200 degrees 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.940
 quite produce people around 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.900
 8 to 30 millimeters 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.080
 so doing the billboards beauty paying in juxtaposing Iran is in 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.120
 anger 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.540
 different panels 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.230
 with some traces of white glue 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.550
 they are then cut to size 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.830
 the insulation need neither reduce and crest 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.700
 in order to facilitate their 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.860
 assembly 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.700
 they are tired 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.810
 packed up 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.640
 the steps of his brother on delivery 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.960
 what is necessary to understand 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.860
 it is that the wood 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.390
 by this process 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.880
 pavatex the wood 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.750
 break up 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.590
 only by a process 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.770
 thermomechanical 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.450
 we obtain a fiber paste 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.890
 and then subjected to a source of heat 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.310
 which makes it possible to obtain the fiber broadband link 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.800
 which means that those who the kind of processes 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.790
 the requires the perpetuation of China 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.750
 so we can see it in this factory 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.490
 guarantee a product 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.870
 almost 100% 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.420
 formed of wood 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.880
 extremely bloody 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.759
 the perfectly ecological
