00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
wheel and zip the edges and they popped

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.590 
wheel and zip the edges and they popped
right<00:00:37.800> out<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.579> spring<00:00:38.879> perch<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.390> I

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
right out the spring perch and I

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.479 
right out the spring perch and I
measured<00:00:40.020> from<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.500> center<00:00:40.530> bolt<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
measured from the center bolt in the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.709 
measured from the center bolt in the

v6<00:01:13.369> I'm<00:01:14.369> not<00:01:14.549> v6<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.090> mean<00:01:15.270> disc<00:01:15.479> brakes<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.020> think

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
v6 I'm not v6 I mean disc brakes I think

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.990 
v6 I'm not v6 I mean disc brakes I think
the<00:01:16.439> same<00:01:16.619> as<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> v6<00:01:17.250> or<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.430> Cobra<00:01:17.880> or
