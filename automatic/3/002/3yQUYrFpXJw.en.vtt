00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.029
 yes 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.669
 since the beginning, cinema and rock were very close to the golden decade 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.249
 of cinema and the rubbing of the 80s with movies like bikes with richard 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:28.039
 lester 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.880
 frictions and the Argentine has a little more story continued 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.589
 nevertheless the Argentine cinema portrait transcendental moments of our rock 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:40.779
 there are a number of Argentine films that try to capture 

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:42.120
 rock recitals 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.839
 mud 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:44.440
 rock that the sun sets 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.280
 there the official 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.680
 came to the big screen to the most important figures in its history 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.339
 I never find a formidable movie because it deals 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:58.620
 to luca prodan as a human being was a revelation movie in that sense I 

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:01.879
 it seems the manager the movie tells the barbasadas they had done 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.730
 and also transforms 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.500
 they do not choose strangers tango feroz is a movie trying to have the 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.030
 the spirit of the age 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.970
 but it is not a biographical story of so many a controversy regarding the 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.770
 movie first because it was a success 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.620
 by case in the press 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.070
 the rock lent him his music the cinema 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.830
 and also some actors 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.770
 it was like a writing to be made him garrido 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.500
 the end of eta cerati there are some musician very cold to nico 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.649
 very easy 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.670
 make them current the kind that they can not act 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.220
 we should make a judgment for malpractice 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.000
 about what happens between cinema and rock there are very different opinions 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.520
 I definitely think that 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.049
 the rock and the cinema are linked gámez is an official that they do not have to see 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.689
 not the soundtrack of the movie is 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.859
 50% of the movie there are different dynamics when approaching zero a 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:57.990
 music for a movie in my case 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.929
 What I like the most is working from the month of January 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.220
 but beyond what can be said 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.840
 what is clear this rock and cinema are like family 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.940
 they are brothers when the cinema 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.759
 I think they are like relatives as if they were cousins ​​that does not feel very well 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.209
 it's a marriage 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.509
 I follow it 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:21.599
 But I think the relationship will work especially when rock and film 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.649
 merge 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:26.659
 while the judges pointed against Cuba that does not always happen 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:31.709
 all I wanted to know more about what happened between the movies and rock 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:36.139
 the complex 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.200
 in the mid-1950s a new musical genre was 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:08.349
 revolutionizing the whole world and would soon reach the big screen 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.119
 it's about rock and the cinema 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:12.770
 It has a very close relationship 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:13.520
 the beginning 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.360
 they are mostly because when he himself saw the pelvis and another that exploded 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:22.900
 olive tree try 'as soon as possible' take advantage of this year Bogota 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.950
 I thought right away youth went through 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.009
 confusing a bit when expressing rock with the pop singer is the time in the 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:33.409
 what lotteries a lot of 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.529
 and above the price of 22 years 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:37.879
 I know whistle 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.719
 that are not rocanrol but that were sold in joint square meter 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:44.829
 15 Andean 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:45.779
 Without a doubt 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:47.219
 it was 60 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.659
 the golden years of rock in Mexico 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:55.120
 those of the hospital were transformed into classics immediately and bring their 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.229
 music with the whole planet 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:01.050
 the bytes can not be everywhere at the same time they can not be 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.760
 in japan in sweden in thailand n brazil 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.049
 a producer and all boy we will make a couple of images and send to all 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.979
 world so that doing it biological material of the planet I was had 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.169
 five years has decided nothing yet 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.019
 that investigates jumps militating on the big screen in Geneva according to him 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.559
 I had a lot to desire 

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:25.139
 somehow it struck me musicians also very 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:31.529
 agencies 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.800
 and the other moment for me fundamental in the 60s to bs the movie 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.440
 how many more when is a colander what is the recording the filming of your 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.219
 life of the recording of the situation situation we have neither a slow descent 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.460
 Meanwhile 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.060
 in our country the films for the young public had still sandro 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.800
 has become a romantic singer and the innocent guys of the club declared 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:08.159
 rodero rock was still a countercultural phenomenon 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:11.159
 and it would take a few more years to earn it 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.539
 the Argentine cinema begins to realize a little bit of the presence of rock 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.879
 in movies of what was a kind in huelva torre for a movie like 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:26.809
 shot of grace for example neuquén a new and very good mood olivier metzner 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:31.919
 -a copy that had Javier Martínez as one of its main actors 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:32.830
 weekly 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.589
 grace the role of a drummer justly 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:38.589
 and also the movie with music from Manabi 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:44.899
 in 1970 litho nebia debuted in acting as a boy 

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:47.550
 melancholic who wanted to triumph in music 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.599
 with the stranger of long hair the rock became massive you apt for everything 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:53.249
 public 

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:55.099
 if you do not want it 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:58.999
 the data are very good kid types are not like a little more version with 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:01.159
 with a little longer with córdoba 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.610
 When we spend two or more hours of sun we hear the things we love because 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.370
 let's go on a picnic to prepare this person who truly believes that 

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:09.610
 requires 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.939
 and what does each one mean street life varela 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:17.629
 the seminar was reserved for Javier Azagra and relieving the pressure is great 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.210
 that was the first experience the red in the cinema according to the model the 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.600
 ministry in a meeting
