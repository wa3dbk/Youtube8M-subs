00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.919
 tires of this in taraz least strength 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.919
 leaving here for this rubber here 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.729
 Dmitry of the winter seasons 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:17.499
 there were no problems 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:19.999
 but please why spikes fly to 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:22.749
 Senate on the spot year 1 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:25.219
 in the second hell of a lot in the nest 

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:25.900
 left 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.390
 So 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.300
 football is on fixed but 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.809
 you can have taken away from me 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.570
 check on will come pilot before 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.350
 buy 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.780
 I praised her 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.310
 rowing 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.960
 what if in the winter you feel like in the summer 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.180
 we are 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.720
 lowering time 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.180
 so they put themselves on 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.600
 front wheel drive 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.280
 but they said they said 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.610
 that only the one in the turn something wrong 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.320
 but it is their least 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.590
 and acceleration at high speed about what they 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.780
 what did they not like 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.800
 Okay, so I decided to buy on 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.350
 front wheel drive 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.860
 on this viburnum 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.850
 I decided not to take the same one, but I wanted to 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.970
 leave because there were no problems and noise 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.740
 did not have 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.740
 and here it was tires but dropped too 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.690
 on one 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.130
 the car drove on the setting later 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.020
 on one night at the rear wheel drive 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.900
 in the car was 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.460
 there were no problems either 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.970
 rows in full but 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.380
 the only thing I want to say 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.490
 if the wave is buried 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.210
 But this of course she power all the same but 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.530
 problems, what is all this here is not dripped with 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.260
 him a contract 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.810
 and when the pits st 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.250
 this is the third rub 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.440
 fired on the current of the same name like this 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.720
 way 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.890
 went with ozzy sergey did not leave 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.540
 she went about this water 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.900
 and here and there it is 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.620
 and since it turns out that she 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.620
 as if rowing 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.230
 and falls down and it comes out 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.249
 at the same time it has three links better 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:09.959
 by 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.959
 the snow goes on than this 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:16.639
 the board had no problems 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:18.669
 answered a lot 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:21.669

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.019
