actually the easiest way to talk about

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.470 
actually the easiest way to talk about
them<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.450> how<00:00:49.350> do<00:00:49.410> they<00:00:49.590> compare<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.670> M<00:00:50.879> 50s

them is how do they compare to the M 50s

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.389

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
time for being some of the most

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.090 
time for being some of the most
incredible<00:00:54.660> sounding<00:00:55.289> headphones<00:00:55.739> for<00:00:56.070> a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
incredible sounding headphones for a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.639 
incredible sounding headphones for a
very<00:00:56.520> low<00:00:56.820> price<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.719> now<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> M<00:00:58.109> 70s

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
very low price so now that the M 70s

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.319 
very low price so now that the M 70s
come<00:00:58.829> along<00:00:59.070> for<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.430> much<00:00:59.670> higher<00:00:59.910> price

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
come along for a much higher price

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.660 
come along for a much higher price
naturally<00:01:01.230> we're<00:01:01.379> all<00:01:01.440> curious<00:01:01.859> about<00:01:02.520> if

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
naturally we're all curious about if

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.009 
naturally we're all curious about if
they're<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.239> much<00:01:03.570> better

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
they're that much better

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.080 
they're that much better
so<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:04.739> headphones<00:01:05.100> my<00:01:05.309> comparisons<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:06.030> be

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
so if headphones my comparisons can be

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.640 
so if headphones my comparisons can be
very<00:01:06.479> simple<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.049> don't<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.350> worry<00:01:07.470> about

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
very simple I don't have to worry about

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.380 
very simple I don't have to worry about
battery<00:01:08.010> life<00:01:08.040> or<00:01:08.369> display<00:01:08.729> tech<00:01:09.030> or<00:01:09.240> anything

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
battery life or display tech or anything

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.100 
battery life or display tech or anything
crazy<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:09.750> that

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
crazy like that

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.950 
crazy like that
it's<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.950> how<00:01:11.220> they're<00:01:11.460> built<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.030> how<00:01:12.750> they

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
it's just how they're built and how they

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.080 
it's just how they're built and how they
sound<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.650> with<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> build<00:01:14.040> quality<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.580> m70x

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
sound so with the build quality the m70x

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.999 
sound so with the build quality the m70x
are<00:01:15.420> very<00:01:15.780> simple<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.350> pretty<00:01:16.680> similar<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
are very simple and pretty similar to

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.010 
are very simple and pretty similar to
the<00:01:17.189> M<00:01:17.280> 50s<00:01:17.640> I'll<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.240> honest<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.600> was<00:01:18.630> looking

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the M 50s I'll be honest I was looking

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.200 
the M 50s I'll be honest I was looking
for<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> bunch<00:01:19.650> more<00:01:19.710> metal<00:01:20.310> or<00:01:20.580> other<00:01:20.610> premium

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
for a bunch more metal or other premium

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.760 
for a bunch more metal or other premium
materials<00:01:21.840> because<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> honestly<00:01:22.560> expected

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
materials because I honestly expected

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.160 
materials because I honestly expected
that<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.460> such<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> price<00:01:24.000> increase<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:25.020> nope

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that with such a price increase but nope

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.840 
that with such a price increase but nope
it's<00:01:25.409> all<00:01:25.530> steel<00:01:25.799> hardened<00:01:26.189> plastic<00:01:26.400> again

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
it's all steel hardened plastic again

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.999 
it's all steel hardened plastic again
this<00:01:27.330> time<00:01:27.540> with<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> matte<00:01:28.170> coat<00:01:28.470> instead<00:01:28.890> of

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
this time with a matte coat instead of

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.130 
this time with a matte coat instead of
glossy<00:01:29.460> plastic<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.479> soft<00:01:30.720> touch<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
glossy plastic so it's a soft touch and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.770 
glossy plastic so it's a soft touch and
they<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> pretty<00:01:32.759> traditional<00:01:33.030> styling<00:01:33.689> a

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
they have a pretty traditional styling a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.870 
they have a pretty traditional styling a
pretty<00:01:34.020> sharp<00:01:34.229> tuxedo<00:01:34.770> look<00:01:35.009> here<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.369> black<00:01:35.610> I

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
pretty sharp tuxedo look here in black I

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.310 
pretty sharp tuxedo look here in black I
think<00:01:36.210> they'd<00:01:36.329> be<00:01:36.360> much<00:01:36.630> more<00:01:36.840> interesting<00:01:37.259> if

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
think they'd be much more interesting if

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.719 
think they'd be much more interesting if
they<00:01:37.439> offered<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:37.979> some<00:01:38.280> other<00:01:38.430> colors

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
they offered it in some other colors

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.819 
they offered it in some other colors
like<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.030> M<00:01:39.119> 50s<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.229> might<00:01:40.439> come<00:01:40.619> later

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
like the M 50s but that might come later

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.639 
like the M 50s but that might come later
so<00:01:41.070> they<00:01:41.579> ditched<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.030> big<00:01:42.270> bold<00:01:42.649> Technica

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
so they ditched the big bold Technica

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.130 
so they ditched the big bold Technica
branding<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.640> top<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> M<00:01:45.329> 50s<00:01:45.750> for<00:01:46.110> a

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
branding on the top of the M 50s for a

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.010 
branding on the top of the M 50s for a
much<00:01:46.560> simpler<00:01:47.340> subdued<00:01:47.850> look<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> M<00:01:48.450> 70s

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
much simpler subdued look on the M 70s

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.200 
much simpler subdued look on the M 70s
but<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.070> band<00:01:50.310> here<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.790> still<00:01:51.030> very

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
but this band here is still very

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.359 
but this band here is still very
flexible<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.140> will<00:01:52.290> suit<00:01:52.530> all<00:01:52.740> sorts<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.189> head

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
flexible it will suit all sorts of head

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.490 
flexible it will suit all sorts of head
sizes<00:01:53.790> although<00:01:54.240> now<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:54.960> actually<00:01:55.470> only

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
sizes although now it is actually only

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
padded in the middle where it actually

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.660 
padded in the middle where it actually

headphones<00:02:00.000> are<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.479> actually<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.840> lot

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
headphones are just actually a lot

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.810 
headphones are just actually a lot
lighter<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:02.189> makes<00:02:02.399> them<00:02:02.520> more<00:02:02.640> comfortable

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
lighter this makes them more comfortable

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.550 
lighter this makes them more comfortable
to<00:02:03.270> wear<00:02:03.450> for<00:02:03.509> longer<00:02:04.110> periods<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.500> time

to wear for longer periods of time
actually<00:02:05.009> no<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.280> was<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.820> pretty<00:02:06.329> big

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
actually no that was a pretty big

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.180 
actually no that was a pretty big
complaint<00:02:06.899> about<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.259> M<00:02:07.380> 50s<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.039> there

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
complaint about the M 50s that there

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.249 
complaint about the M 50s that there
were<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> little<00:02:08.520> bit<00:02:08.640> too<00:02:08.879> tight<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.720> M<00:02:09.810> 70s

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
were a little bit too tight the M 70s

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.290 
were a little bit too tight the M 70s
still<00:02:10.560> have<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.770> fantastic<00:02:11.310> seal<00:02:11.790> with<00:02:12.030> even

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
still have a fantastic seal with even

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.940 
still have a fantastic seal with even
softer<00:02:12.690> ear<00:02:12.900> cups<00:02:13.200> and

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
softer ear cups and

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.040 
softer ear cups and
all<00:02:14.250> around<00:02:14.490> them<00:02:14.760> but<00:02:15.060> they<00:02:15.510> sit<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.810> little

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
all around them but they sit a little

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.020 
all around them but they sit a little
bit<00:02:16.170> lighter<00:02:16.410> on<00:02:16.500> your<00:02:16.770> head<00:02:16.950> now<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.910> only

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
bit lighter on your head now the only

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.449 
bit lighter on your head now the only
one<00:02:18.480> notable<00:02:19.290> difference<00:02:19.739> here<00:02:20.010> with<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.340> EM

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
one notable difference here with the EM

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.510 
one notable difference here with the EM
70s<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.690> they<00:02:21.840> don't<00:02:22.110> fold<00:02:22.620> anymore<00:02:23.190> so

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
70s is that they don't fold anymore so

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.160 
70s is that they don't fold anymore so
if<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.760> remember<00:02:24.030> them<00:02:24.150> 50s<00:02:24.540> those<00:02:24.900> could

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
if you remember them 50s those could

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.410 
if you remember them 50s those could
fold<00:02:25.410> up<00:02:25.650> right<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.370> just<00:02:26.700> fit<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.209> like<00:02:27.390> a

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
fold up right on and just fit in like a

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.420 
fold up right on and just fit in like a
little<00:02:27.660> travel<00:02:28.080> bag<00:02:28.290> with<00:02:28.920> about<00:02:29.160> half<00:02:29.400> the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
little travel bag with about half the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.630 
little travel bag with about half the
footprint<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.209> being<00:02:30.510> fully<00:02:30.810> expanded<00:02:31.410> and

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
footprint of being fully expanded and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.030 
footprint of being fully expanded and
the<00:02:32.640> EM<00:02:32.790> 70s<00:02:33.390> are<00:02:33.630> lacking<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.410> hinge<00:02:34.770> that

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
the EM 70s are lacking that hinge that

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.470 
the EM 70s are lacking that hinge that
it<00:02:35.130> needs<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.430> do<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.060> can<00:02:36.239> still

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
it needs to do that so you can still

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.600 
it needs to do that so you can still
swivel<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.959> ear-cups<00:02:37.319> 90<00:02:37.680> degrees<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.430> lie

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
swivel the ear-cups 90 degrees to lie

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.550 
swivel the ear-cups 90 degrees to lie
flat<00:02:38.819> but<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.480> means<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:39.720> need<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> larger

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
flat but that means you need a larger

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.770 
flat but that means you need a larger
case<00:02:40.860> here<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.400> actually<00:02:41.970> comes<00:02:42.239> with<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.569> to

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
case here that actually comes with it to

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.990 
case here that actually comes with it to
store<00:02:43.140> them<00:02:43.349> and<00:02:43.500> travel<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.489> I<00:02:44.700> guess<00:02:44.819> that's

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
store them and travel and I guess that's

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.940 
store them and travel and I guess that's
a<00:02:45.090> pro<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.630> con<00:02:45.660> it's<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.170> con<00:02:46.380> because<00:02:46.680> they

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
a pro and a con it's a con because they

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.199 
a pro and a con it's a con because they
are<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.069> bit<00:02:47.250> bigger<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.790> requires<00:02:48.090> more

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
are a bit bigger and it requires more

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.270 
are a bit bigger and it requires more
space<00:02:48.510> they<00:02:49.260> don't<00:02:49.410> fit<00:02:49.590> into<00:02:49.709> quite<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:49.980> small

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
space they don't fit into quite a small

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.550 
space they don't fit into quite a small
of<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.400> bag<00:02:50.640> but<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.569> really<00:02:52.110> nice<00:02:52.260> case

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
of a bag but it is a really nice case

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.479 
of a bag but it is a really nice case
that<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.799> comes<00:02:52.950> with<00:02:53.100> it's<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.310> high-quality

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
that it comes with it's a high-quality

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.059 
that it comes with it's a high-quality
hardshell<00:02:54.330> with<00:02:54.870> padding<00:02:55.230> on<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.350> inside<00:02:55.769> and

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
hardshell with padding on the inside and

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.920 
hardshell with padding on the inside and
this<00:02:56.280> soft<00:02:56.549> matte<00:02:56.910> finish<00:02:57.330> on<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.569> outside

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
this soft matte finish on the outside

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.870 
this soft matte finish on the outside
that's<00:02:58.170> pretty<00:02:58.470> pleasant<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:58.950> hold<00:02:59.130> so<00:02:59.430> it's

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
that's pretty pleasant to hold so it's

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.789 
that's pretty pleasant to hold so it's
free<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.510> comes<00:03:00.540> with<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.930> everything<00:03:01.319> so

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
free and it comes with in everything so

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:02.270 
free and it comes with in everything so
that's<00:03:01.950> great

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
that's great

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.979 
that's great
now<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.489> also<00:03:02.640> get<00:03:02.880> an<00:03:03.000> additional<00:03:03.120> cable<00:03:03.810> bag

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
now you also get an additional cable bag

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.870 
now you also get an additional cable bag
on<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.290> inside<00:03:04.590> too<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:05.130> didn't<00:03:05.580> use<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.700> that

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
on the inside too I didn't use it that

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.520 
on the inside too I didn't use it that
much<00:03:06.060> since<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.390> really<00:03:06.630> only<00:03:06.780> used<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.319> one

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
much since I really only used the one

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.220 
much since I really only used the one
coiled<00:03:07.980> cable<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.880> EM<00:03:08.970> 70s<00:03:09.480> do<00:03:09.690> come<00:03:10.019> with

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
coiled cable but the EM 70s do come with

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.220 
coiled cable but the EM 70s do come with
three<00:03:10.830> cables<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.390> has<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.810> two<00:03:13.019> meter

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
three cables so it has the two meter

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.740 
three cables so it has the two meter
long<00:03:13.470> short<00:03:14.010> straight<00:03:14.340> cable<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.880> three<00:03:15.569> meter

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
long short straight cable a three meter

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.140 
long short straight cable a three meter
long<00:03:15.989> long<00:03:16.530> straight<00:03:16.920> cable<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.940> three

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
long long straight cable and a three

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.300 
long long straight cable and a three
meter<00:03:18.299> long<00:03:18.570> coiled<00:03:19.109> cable<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.100> use<00:03:20.280> a

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
meter long coiled cable so I use a

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.039 
meter long coiled cable so I use a
coiled<00:03:20.670> one<00:03:20.760> most<00:03:20.940> often<00:03:21.120> like<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.510> said<00:03:21.780> and

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
coiled one most often like I said and

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.960 
coiled one most often like I said and
they<00:03:22.320> all<00:03:22.440> connect<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:22.980> headphones<00:03:23.340> via

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
they all connect to the headphones via

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.360 
they all connect to the headphones via
that<00:03:24.209> same<00:03:24.540> new<00:03:24.900> twist<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.620> lock<00:03:25.769> mechanism

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
that same new twist and lock mechanism

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.090 
that same new twist and lock mechanism
that<00:03:26.640> we<00:03:26.730> saw<00:03:26.940> on<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.540> m50x<00:03:28.049> so<00:03:28.530> again<00:03:28.799> it<00:03:28.920> does

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
that we saw on the m50x so again it does

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.979 
that we saw on the m50x so again it does
mean<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.880> can't<00:03:30.209> really<00:03:30.450> use<00:03:30.750> any

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
mean you can't really use any

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.479 
mean you can't really use any
third-party<00:03:31.410> cables<00:03:32.070> if<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.280> wanted

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
third-party cables if you wanted

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.460 
third-party cables if you wanted
something<00:03:32.730> colorful<00:03:33.480> or<00:03:33.690> something<00:03:34.019> braided

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
something colorful or something braided

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.259 
something colorful or something braided
or<00:03:34.560> something<00:03:34.829> like<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:35.130> but<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.880> twist<00:03:36.120> and

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
or something like that but the twist and

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.940 
or something like that but the twist and
lock<00:03:36.359> is<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.600> pretty<00:03:36.870> secure<00:03:37.140> fit<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.829> high

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
lock is a pretty secure fit and a high

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.680 
lock is a pretty secure fit and a high
quality<00:03:38.010> way<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.519> connect<00:03:38.910> your<00:03:38.970> cable<00:03:39.150> so

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
quality way to connect your cable so

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.300 
quality way to connect your cable so
overall<00:03:40.170> yeah<00:03:40.350> these<00:03:40.530> things<00:03:40.739> are<00:03:40.890> built

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
overall yeah these things are built

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.710 
overall yeah these things are built
pretty<00:03:41.519> well<00:03:41.820> but<00:03:42.299> there's<00:03:42.570> obviously

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
pretty well but there's obviously

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.890 
pretty well but there's obviously
nothing<00:03:43.560> spectacular<00:03:43.859> about<00:03:44.430> them<00:03:44.910> which<00:03:45.660> I

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
nothing spectacular about them which I

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.180 
nothing spectacular about them which I
guess<00:03:46.049> it<00:03:46.170> isn't<00:03:46.350> really<00:03:46.470> meant<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.890> be<00:03:47.010> you'll

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
guess it isn't really meant to be you'll

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.979 
guess it isn't really meant to be you'll
see<00:03:47.370> why<00:03:47.549> in<00:03:47.609> a<00:03:47.760> second<00:03:48.120> but<00:03:48.600> of<00:03:48.690> course<00:03:48.840> the

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
see why in a second but of course the

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.470 
see why in a second but of course the
most<00:03:49.140> interesting<00:03:49.590> part<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:50.160> how<00:03:50.790> they<00:03:51.000> sound

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
most interesting part is how they sound

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.099 
most interesting part is how they sound
so<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.620> did<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.340> lot<00:03:53.880> of<00:03:54.120> listening<00:03:54.690> I<00:03:54.870> don't<00:03:55.049> know

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
so I did a lot of listening I don't know

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.660 
so I did a lot of listening I don't know
if<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.350> believe<00:03:55.769> in<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.950> whole<00:03:56.100> burning<00:03:56.549> in

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
if I believe in the whole burning in

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.190 
if I believe in the whole burning in
headphones<00:03:56.970> or<00:03:57.180> anything<00:03:57.359> but<00:03:57.989> I've<00:03:58.079> had

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
headphones or anything but I've had

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.690 
headphones or anything but I've had
these<00:03:58.319> for<00:03:58.500> about<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.709> week<00:03:58.920> now<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.459> I've<00:03:59.670> been

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
these for about a week now and I've been

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.180 
these for about a week now and I've been
doing<00:04:00.239> plenty<00:04:00.690> of<00:04:00.989> listening<00:04:01.440> mostly<00:04:02.040> to

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
doing plenty of listening mostly to

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.460 
doing plenty of listening mostly to
music<00:04:02.549> lots<00:04:02.850> of<00:04:03.030> it<00:04:03.150> on<00:04:03.329> Spotify<00:04:03.720> on<00:04:03.989> my<00:04:04.230> phone

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
music lots of it on Spotify on my phone

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.440 
music lots of it on Spotify on my phone
but<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.069> also<00:04:05.280> plugged<00:04:05.609> into<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:05.940> deck<00:04:06.180> on

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
but that also plugged into the deck on

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.660 
but that also plugged into the deck on
Mike<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:06.810> Peter<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.290> how<00:04:07.890> to<00:04:07.950> listen<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.489> some

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
Mike and Peter and how to listen to some

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.250 
Mike and Peter and how to listen to some
higher<00:04:08.850> quality<00:04:09.299> audio<00:04:09.450> files<00:04:09.870> there

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
higher quality audio files there

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.800 
higher quality audio files there
including<00:04:10.829> actually<00:04:11.400> mixing<00:04:11.850> the<00:04:12.209> last<00:04:12.510> video

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
including actually mixing the last video

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.509 
including actually mixing the last video
I<00:04:12.870> did<00:04:12.989> which<00:04:13.290> was<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.560> Dell<00:04:13.739> tablet<00:04:14.190> review

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
I did which was the Dell tablet review

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.879 
I did which was the Dell tablet review
and<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:15.180> bottom<00:04:15.510> line<00:04:15.660> about<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:16.289> sound<00:04:16.620> is

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
and the bottom line about the sound is

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.460 
and the bottom line about the sound is
this<00:04:17.190> these<00:04:17.880> are<00:04:18.060> studio<00:04:18.570> monitors<00:04:19.019> like<00:04:19.260> for

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
this these are studio monitors like for

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.319 
this these are studio monitors like for
real<00:04:19.590> so<00:04:20.190> that<00:04:20.220> means<00:04:20.519> they<00:04:20.639> have<00:04:20.669> a<00:04:20.820> very

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
real so that means they have a very

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.839 
real so that means they have a very
neutral<00:04:22.229> sound<00:04:22.620> signature<00:04:23.010> which<00:04:23.370> is<00:04:23.400> what

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
neutral sound signature which is what

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.850 
neutral sound signature which is what
you<00:04:23.940> want<00:04:24.180> if<00:04:24.390> you're<00:04:24.570> monitoring<00:04:25.020> or<00:04:25.470> mixing

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
you want if you're monitoring or mixing

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.680 
you want if you're monitoring or mixing
audio<00:04:26.010> to<00:04:26.789> the<00:04:26.820> untrained

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
audio to the untrained

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.500 
audio to the untrained
that<00:04:28.080> may<00:04:28.260> sound<00:04:28.620> like<00:04:28.800> it's<00:04:29.220> lacking<00:04:29.730> base<00:04:30.180> or

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
that may sound like it's lacking base or

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.600 
that may sound like it's lacking base or
even<00:04:30.540> might<00:04:31.170> be<00:04:31.320> a<00:04:31.350> little<00:04:31.530> bit<00:04:31.650> tinny<00:04:31.890> but<00:04:32.550> you

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
even might be a little bit tinny but you

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.800 
even might be a little bit tinny but you
got<00:04:32.700> to<00:04:32.790> understand<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.270> this<00:04:33.450> flat

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
got to understand that this flat

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.780 
got to understand that this flat
frequency<00:04:34.140> response<00:04:34.440> is<00:04:34.920> exactly<00:04:35.490> what<00:04:35.670> you

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
frequency response is exactly what you

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.480 
frequency response is exactly what you
want<00:04:36.060> when<00:04:36.690> editing<00:04:37.170> so<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.830> EM<00:04:37.890> 50s<00:04:38.280> will

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
want when editing so the EM 50s will

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.730 
want when editing so the EM 50s will
sound<00:04:38.790> very<00:04:39.150> rich<00:04:39.510> because<00:04:40.170> they<00:04:40.200> do<00:04:40.410> have

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
sound very rich because they do have

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.500 
sound very rich because they do have
more<00:04:40.950> bass<00:04:41.190> in<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.490> EM<00:04:41.580> 70s<00:04:42.060> they'll<00:04:42.270> sound

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
more bass in the EM 70s they'll sound

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.930 
more bass in the EM 70s they'll sound
way<00:04:43.080> more<00:04:43.320> colored<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:43.980> they<00:04:44.430> will<00:04:44.610> continue

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
way more colored and they will continue

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.120 
way more colored and they will continue
to<00:04:45.120> sound<00:04:45.480> better<00:04:45.900> for<00:04:46.290> everyday<00:04:46.590> listening

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
to sound better for everyday listening

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.910 
to sound better for everyday listening
and<00:04:47.310> music<00:04:47.820> and<00:04:48.000> movies<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:49.080> gaming<00:04:49.650> and<00:04:49.800> all

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.860 
and music and movies and gaming and all
sorts<00:04:50.220> of<00:04:50.280> stuff<00:04:50.370> like<00:04:50.610> that<00:04:50.790> but<00:04:51.630> for

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
sorts of stuff like that but for

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.530 
sorts of stuff like that but for
monitoring<00:04:52.380> and<00:04:52.590> mixing<00:04:53.220> and<00:04:53.400> producing<00:04:53.580> the

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
even more flat sound and lightweight

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.450 
even more flat sound and lightweight
comfort<00:04:57.330> of<00:04:57.480> the<00:04:57.900> EM<00:04:57.990> 70s<00:04:58.530> is<00:04:58.770> really<00:04:59.250> what<00:04:59.370> you

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
comfort of the EM 70s is really what you

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.580 
comfort of the EM 70s is really what you
