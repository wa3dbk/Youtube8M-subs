00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
to do that again just prepare yourself

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.310 
to do that again just prepare yourself
so<00:04:40.260> you<00:04:40.350> cotton<00:04:40.830> with<00:04:41.160> a<00:04:41.190> knot<00:04:41.490> at<00:04:41.670> the<00:04:41.700> end<00:04:41.850> and

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
so you cotton with a knot at the end and

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.810 
so you cotton with a knot at the end and
because<00:04:43.320> it's<00:04:43.500> fleece<00:04:43.830> you<00:04:44.160> can<00:04:44.190> be<00:04:44.490> really

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
because it's fleece you can be really

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.770 
because it's fleece you can be really
rough<00:04:45.180> with<00:04:45.420> it

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
rough with it

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.570 
rough with it
fleece<00:04:46.290> is<00:04:46.470> a<00:04:46.500> great<00:04:46.770> material<00:04:47.280> because<00:04:47.430> it

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
fleece is a great material because it

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.720 
fleece is a great material because it
doesn't<00:04:47.880> show<00:04:48.090> up<00:04:48.270> your<00:04:48.480> stitch<00:04:49.190> you<00:04:50.190> just<00:04:50.490> go

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
doesn't show up your stitch you just go

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.790 
doesn't show up your stitch you just go
along<00:04:51.000> and<00:04:51.300> connect<00:04:51.780> them<00:04:51.960> together<00:04:52.200> with<00:04:52.770> a

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
along and connect them together with a

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.670 
along and connect them together with a
loop<00:04:53.070> it's<00:04:53.970> really<00:04:54.450> not<00:04:54.570> very<00:04:54.630> difficult<00:04:55.050> and

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
loop it's really not very difficult and

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.390 
loop it's really not very difficult and
you<00:04:55.920> can<00:04:56.130> be<00:04:56.250> as<00:04:56.400> rough<00:04:56.580> as<00:04:56.910> you<00:04:56.940> like<00:04:58.220> so<00:04:59.220> the

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
you can be as rough as you like so the

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.460 
you can be as rough as you like so the
next<00:04:59.610> step<00:04:59.880> to<00:05:00.060> make<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.390> monkey<00:05:00.720> hand<00:05:00.960> is
