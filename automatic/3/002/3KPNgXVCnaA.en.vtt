00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.720 
when I'm putting a new video up so we'll
just<00:04:04.680> say<00:04:04.829> when<00:04:05.129> it<00:04:05.250> hits<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.430> thousand<00:04:05.819> I<00:04:07.730> think

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
just say when it hits a thousand I think

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.349
