00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.080
 many had hoped for it porsche 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.360
 returns with a break after 16 years 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.210
 Factory team back to the 24 hour race 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.769
 from le mans a whole series of 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.839
 could porsche on the record 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.300
 fetch legendary course at the set so far 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.230
 and is thus the most successful 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.340
 car brand at the most famous 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.340
 long distance races in the world 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.439
 In 2014, Porsche will be completely new 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.510
 developed vehicle for the top class 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.640
 lmp1 in le mans and the 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.290
 long-distance world championship WC at the 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.239
 start and want to the big tradition 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.739
 are already running the run 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.739
 Preparations at full speed 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.430
 we started in june and me 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.710
 We think we are making good progress 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.430
 test twice a month and give 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.920
 properly gas 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.690
 the team is super motivated and that is 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:58.010
 crucial if you keep a project on 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:01:00.230
 we go to the regulation we know that too 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.820
 all porsche in houston worldwide exactly 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.980
 we will look at it in june 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.830
 2014 is so enormous 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.869
 challenge also a certain pressure 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.729
 around the country longed for event 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.009
 Porsche has to agree with the motto 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.020
 meets the heroes of le mans known 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.250
 driver and the seven most successful 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.890
 racing cars to the hockenheimring 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.770
 hans hermann is also there 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.229
 the 1970 at the so-called fight of the 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.270
 titans along with richard adwords on 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.250
 a Porsche 917 drove to the podium 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.619
 at the beginning was the 9 17 clock 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.810
 incredibly difficult to drive 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.200
 So we had a crazy car 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.020
 Problems of the vehicle on the street too 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.740
 Keep it was with us we do not 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.590
 in the car 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.470
 and then we have a dynamic with 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.569
 spoiler and the like then worked 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.420
 and then have this 917 to one 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:56.149
 incredibly still safe so so 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.140
 quickly was enough to win 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.810
 brought vehicle 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.360
 Hans Herrmann and get richard attwood 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.520
 the first of a total of 16 overall victories 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.099
 for the factory team to join yet 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.539
 100 two Porsche class wins is in le 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.220
 mans a success story 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.480
 the expectations are correspondingly large 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.050
 for the return 2014 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.610
 that is very important 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.080
 that one does not only look nice once now 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.270
 it's fast but that's up 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.750
 Long distances to over long years 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:28.440
 and I hope so now 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.370
 gives the 2014 connection as a reserve 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.370
 goes on again
