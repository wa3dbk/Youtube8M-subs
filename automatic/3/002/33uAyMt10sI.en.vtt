when<00:00:04.260> you<00:00:04.350> first<00:00:04.590> put<00:00:04.800> a<00:00:04.830> sample<00:00:05.130> into<00:00:05.550> the

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
when you first put a sample into the

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.330 
when you first put a sample into the
spds<00:00:06.420> it<00:00:06.660> will<00:00:07.019> be<00:00:07.170> assigned<00:00:07.439> to<00:00:07.620> polyphonic

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
spds it will be assigned to polyphonic

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.030 
spds it will be assigned to polyphonic
mode<00:00:08.809> that<00:00:09.809> means<00:00:09.990> if<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.290> play<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.650> sample

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
mode that means if you play the sample

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.400 
mode that means if you play the sample
then<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:11.670> play<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.849> sample<00:00:12.299> again<00:00:12.629> the

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
then you play the sample again the

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.409 
then you play the sample again the
second<00:00:13.889> playing<00:00:14.099> will<00:00:14.459> play<00:00:14.669> over<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.120> first

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:15.419 
second playing will play over the first

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:17.270 
second playing will play over the first
plane<00:00:15.749> and<00:00:16.020> you'll<00:00:16.139> have<00:00:16.320> both<00:00:16.530> together<00:00:16.890> like

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.280 
plane and you'll have both together like

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.830 
plane and you'll have both together like
this<00:00:17.520> no<00:00:18.300> TV<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.380> no<00:00:19.440> beer<00:00:20.040> maybe<00:00:20.490> no<00:00:21.360> beer

because obviously if you have a

because obviously if you have a
repeating<00:01:17.429> phrase<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.999> on<00:01:18.149> you<00:01:18.509> don't<00:01:18.659> want

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
repeating phrase going on you don't want

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:20.300 
repeating phrase going on you don't want
that<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.229> drop<00:01:19.409> out<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> doesn't<00:01:20.159> make<00:01:20.280> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
that to drop out but it doesn't make a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.889 
that to drop out but it doesn't make a
difference<00:01:20.399> if<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.819> short<00:01:21.060> percussive<00:01:21.329> sound

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
difference if a short percussive sound

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.169 
difference if a short percussive sound
drop<00:01:22.170> side<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.280> we'll<00:01:23.459> have<00:01:23.579> this<00:01:23.729> set<00:01:23.999> to

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
drop side so we'll have this set to

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:27.849 
drop side so we'll have this set to
single<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.350> we<00:01:25.439> use<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:26.090> minus<00:01:27.090> button<00:01:27.240> there

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
single so we use the minus button there

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.429 
single so we use the minus button there
press<00:01:28.859> the<00:01:29.009> right<00:01:29.219> arrow<00:01:29.459> and<00:01:30.329> now<00:01:30.359> you<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
press the right arrow and now you have a

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.169 
press the right arrow and now you have a
choice<00:01:31.649> to<00:01:31.859> assign<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.310> paly<00:01:32.729> which<00:01:33.060> is

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
choice to assign it to paly which is

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:34.730 
choice to assign it to paly which is
polyphonic<00:01:33.749> which<00:01:33.929> is<00:01:34.079> what<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.380> had<00:01:34.529> before

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
polyphonic which is what we had before

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.980 
polyphonic which is what we had before
where<00:01:35.429> one<00:01:35.670> sample<00:01:35.969> plays<00:01:36.299> over<00:01:36.539> the<00:01:36.630> top<00:01:36.810> of

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
the first sample that keeps going we're

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.179 
the first sample that keeps going we're
going<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.240> change<00:01:39.539> that<00:01:39.779> from<00:01:39.959> polyphonic<00:01:40.740> use

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
going to change that from polyphonic use

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.910 
going to change that from polyphonic use
the<00:01:41.340> minus<00:01:41.700> key<00:01:41.880> here<00:01:42.179> and<00:01:42.779> we'll<00:01:42.990> choose<00:01:43.319> mono

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
the minus key here and we'll choose mono

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.459 
the minus key here and we'll choose mono
instead<00:01:44.459> we<00:01:45.450> can<00:01:45.569> test<00:01:45.779> that<00:01:45.869> works<00:01:46.170> by

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
instead we can test that works by

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.139 
instead we can test that works by
playing<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.920> sample<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.490> then<00:01:47.819> playing<00:01:48.029> it

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
playing the sample and then playing it

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.669 
playing the sample and then playing it
again<00:01:48.240> quickly<00:01:48.719> and<00:01:48.810> you'll<00:01:48.929> hear<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.560> the

letters to lowercase letters if we use
the<00:03:34.200> shift<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:35.790> plus<00:03:36.030> button<00:03:36.260> we'll<00:03:37.260> go

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
the shift and the plus button we'll go

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.199 
the shift and the plus button we'll go
to<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.620> next<00:03:37.739> bank<00:03:38.069> of<00:03:38.250> types<00:03:38.549> of<00:03:38.760> character

so in this case we've gone from

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:45.710 
so in this case we've gone from
lowercase<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:41.280> numerals<00:03:42.859> and<00:03:44.389> then<00:03:45.389> do<00:03:45.599> the

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
lowercase to numerals and then do the

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.930 
lowercase to numerals and then do the
shift<00:03:45.930> plus<00:03:46.109> again<00:03:46.380> we've<00:03:46.560> got<00:03:46.590> into<00:03:46.940> symbols

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
shift plus again we've got into symbols

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.949 
shift plus again we've got into symbols
so<00:03:48.359> exclamation<00:03:49.079> marks<00:03:49.440> hash<00:03:50.040> signs<00:03:50.370> etc<00:03:50.959> and

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
so exclamation marks hash signs etc and

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.770 
so exclamation marks hash signs etc and
if<00:03:52.079> we<00:03:52.169> use<00:03:52.349> the<00:03:52.680> shift<00:03:52.889> plus<00:03:53.190> again<00:03:53.660> right<00:03:54.660> to

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
if we use the shift plus again right to

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.220 
if we use the shift plus again right to
the<00:03:54.870> end<00:03:54.989> we<00:03:55.230> get<00:03:55.349> a<00:03:55.410> space<00:03:56.510> so<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.540> recap<00:03:57.959> that

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
the end we get a space so to recap that

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.800 
the end we get a space so to recap that
plus<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.400> minus<00:03:59.730> to<00:04:00.000> change<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.329> characters

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
plus and minus to change the characters

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.629 
plus and minus to change the characters
up<00:04:01.049> and<00:04:01.319> down<00:04:03.380> left<00:04:04.380> and<00:04:04.590> right<00:04:04.709> arrow<00:04:05.250> keys<00:04:05.400> to

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
up and down left and right arrow keys to

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.159 
up and down left and right arrow keys to
change<00:04:06.090> which<00:04:06.239> letter<00:04:06.450> you're<00:04:06.889> altering<00:04:07.889> and

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.169 
change which letter you're altering and

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:13.220 
change which letter you're altering and
shift<00:04:10.169> +<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.859> shift<00:04:11.280> -<00:04:11.579> to<00:04:11.849> go<00:04:12.000> up<00:04:12.230> different

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
shift + and shift - to go up different

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.199 
shift + and shift - to go up different
types<00:04:13.650> of<00:04:13.889> letter<00:04:14.099> to<00:04:14.250> write<00:04:14.849> the<00:04:15.000> way<00:04:15.090> the

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
types of letter to write the way the

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.129 
types of letter to write the way the
beginning<00:04:15.630> as<00:04:15.959> capital<00:04:16.680> a<00:04:16.859> we<00:04:17.820> do<00:04:17.970> shift<00:04:18.479> plus

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
beginning as capital a we do shift plus

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.180 
beginning as capital a we do shift plus
we've<00:04:19.500> got<00:04:19.530> lowercase<00:04:20.039> a<00:04:21.500> then<00:04:22.500> 0<00:04:22.860> so<00:04:23.010> we<00:04:23.099> can

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
we've got lowercase a then 0 so we can

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.100 
we've got lowercase a then 0 so we can
go<00:04:23.280> through<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.550> numeric<00:04:23.910> characters<00:04:24.389> then

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
go through the numeric characters then

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.459 
go through the numeric characters then
symbols<00:04:25.650> in<00:04:26.400> space<00:04:26.930> put<00:04:27.930> this<00:04:28.020> back<00:04:28.229> to<00:04:28.349> where

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:28.469 
symbols in space put this back to where

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:30.100 
symbols in space put this back to where
we<00:04:28.560> started<00:04:28.590> from<00:04:28.919> so

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
we started from so

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.460 
we started from so
just<00:04:31.110> change<00:04:31.350> these<00:04:31.500> characters<00:04:31.920> back<00:04:33.470> always

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
just change these characters back always

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.590 
just change these characters back always

huh no in it you see I take this really

huh no in it you see I take this really
really<00:05:47.960> seriously<00:05:49.000> the<00:05:50.000> way<00:05:50.150> you<00:05:50.210> set<00:05:50.660> up<00:05:50.870> that

really seriously the way you set up that

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.040 
really seriously the way you set up that
wave<00:05:51.800> to<00:05:51.830> behave<00:05:52.400> will<00:05:53.180> affect<00:05:53.540> the<00:05:53.720> way<00:05:53.750> it

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
wave to behave will affect the way it

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.530 
wave to behave will affect the way it
behaves<00:05:54.229> in<00:05:54.650> each<00:05:54.919> of<00:05:55.160> the<00:05:55.280> patches<00:05:55.550> to<00:05:56.390> which

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
behaves in each of the patches to which

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.420 
behaves in each of the patches to which
you<00:05:56.660> have<00:05:56.810> it<00:05:56.930> assigned<00:05:57.260> so<00:05:57.860> it's<00:05:58.010> a<00:05:58.100> bit<00:05:58.250> of<00:05:58.340> a

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
you have it assigned so it's a bit of a

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.610 
you have it assigned so it's a bit of a
global<00:05:58.790> setting<00:05:59.240> if<00:05:59.930> you<00:06:00.080> want<00:06:00.260> to<00:06:00.350> have<00:06:00.500> the

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
global setting if you want to have the

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.080 
global setting if you want to have the
sample<00:06:00.979> behave<00:06:01.220> differently<00:06:01.729> in<00:06:02.030> different

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
sample behave differently in different

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.450 
sample behave differently in different
patches<00:06:02.840> you'll<00:06:03.560> need<00:06:03.710> to<00:06:03.830> make<00:06:03.919> a<00:06:03.979> copy<00:06:04.310> of

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
patches you'll need to make a copy of

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.159 
patches you'll need to make a copy of
the<00:06:04.610> sample<00:06:05.030> and<00:06:05.210> then<00:06:05.660> set<00:06:05.960> them<00:06:06.050> up

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
the sample and then set them up

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.650 
the sample and then set them up
differently
