00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.920

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.810

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.019

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.120

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.920

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.829

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.120
 What else are you going to say there is no sauce 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.580
 I do not 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.800
 but they do not sting when I compete 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.110
 it stings one that itches us and one is more or 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.730
 minus seven is where I told you one then 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.860
 then what are you going to make a dent 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.480
 they could put us to do everything not the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.880
 name of more and I'm going to started 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.500
 embrace the meat since that is what you 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.020

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.720
 eating before time leaves you 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.250
 they can do everything and also piece more or 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.100
 less basic to take out the meat is 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.620
 advancing some pincers an onion
