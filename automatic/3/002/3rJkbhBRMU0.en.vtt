00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.510
 there are three types of lunar eclipse 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.910
 you are partial or total penumbral 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.310
 when you have the total necessarily 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.740
 you will have the full brown and the partial 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.210
 when you have a partial only by 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.099
 own partial when you have at 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.039
 Brazil is only the pedro bial 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:31.050
 the configuration is very simple is when 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:34.590
 you have the same plan the sun to the ground and the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.530
 moon then when the moon is still on umbra nÃ© 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.690
 in the work well in the shadow of the land you have 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.670
 there the total lunar eclipse 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.070
 we have figure 1 that the full moon 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.500
 Normal classic cute one 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.320
 strong silver that makes shadow even 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.750
 for those outside the big cities 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.940
 there we have a moment 2 when the moon 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.320
 enters the penumbra of the earth 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.430
 at this moment two is almost imperceptible 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.409
 moment of eclipse 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.720
 only who is there in the same interior 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.659
 outside the big cities will realize 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.330
 that the moon lost that silver glow 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.640
 strong of her and you got a little 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.549
 accident and mainly the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.030
 lunar eclipse look penumbral not pro 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.399
 sky but for shade because there the moon 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.140
 full of self to cast your shadow on the 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.880
 ground and already has a notion that is 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.030
 starting today we are in the eclipse 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.450
 penumbral there we have a moment three 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.390
 the moon as it was to center on the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.280
 earth is a transition is a moment 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.070
 so an hour for as soon as it happens 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.329
 immediately does not mean you have there 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.100
 a transition from 2 to 3 and there 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.570
 that magical moment that the staff 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.240
 loves that moment when she 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.179
 starts to get cut, this is the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.719
 partial eclipse is very beautiful to be 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:56.429
 seen even a differentiated moment and there 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.560
 privileged are those who are in a 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.049
 place of the planet Earth of the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.020
 the moon enters the umbra in the cone of 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.630
 shadow of the earth that is moment four 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.840
 that it then begins until that aspect 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.180
 reddish the moon will never stay 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.430
 It's going to be good to say so. 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.459
 What happens is that it can 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.189
 look very strong brown 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.170
 that brick color well darkened right? 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:24.319
 this is the most beautiful moment of the eclipse 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.200
 even very much as we have and then 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.049
 after back common cacela vote back 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.239
 we have a moment 5 which is the partial 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.849
 then moments and heats up in turkey brown 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.170
 and life goes on with the 71st moment again 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.319
 stay full game 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:44.180
 the eclipse will happen on the 4th of 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:46.430
 April 2015 is having the moment 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.139

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.970
 minute and worse with us being boring in 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.700
 June 27 seconds 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.060
 Then you have moment 1 that 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.669
