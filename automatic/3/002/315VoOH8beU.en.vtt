00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.589
 hello that such welcome to new droid 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.240
 today I bring you a very application 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.639
 interesting with which to keep our 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.320
 device always optimized if we 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.300
 let's go to the main screen of this 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.769
 application that is called clean air we 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.960
 find that the top 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.029
 marks us the amount of memory to rne 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.439
 who has our device and how much 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.890
 is being used in this case is 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.289
 using 886 will also mark us the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.670
 amount of internal memory that the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.750
 device is using right now in 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:39.210
 this case 4.49 of 16 gb as we can see 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.250
 it also marks us as a percentage 64% 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.280
 would be the percentage of free space that 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.020
 I have the drive and the amount 52% 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.730
 of ram memory that I have free now 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.500
 same as I have available in the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.000
 section of the options that we have in 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.580
 the lower part we can for example 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.260
 increase the memory in this case the 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.580
 system already manages quite well the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.320
 memory so I do not recommend 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.030
 use it because it eliminates us 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.400
 applications that sooner or later leave 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.350
 to reopen because the system 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.820
 pocket you need them you use them for 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.840
 that all the software works of a 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.000
 way 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.619
 positive if we go to the section of 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.479
 clean garbage here yes we are going to 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.399
 find us how good in this case I 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.590
 not because I've already done the cleaning 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.119
 little but probably if you have the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.770
 phone and on time and you have not made a 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.140
 cleaning we will never find a 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.200
 number of files can even 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.969
 than a giga or 2 gb of memory that is not 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.549
 is using and that would be interesting 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.899
 eliminate it in this case would be so simple 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.310
 how to give the cleaning section 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.709
 who will find us in the part of 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.509
 below and the files will be deleted 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:38.399
 files that are usually not used 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.140
 and they are there just occupying 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.239
 memory as it may happen to us in 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.399
 a computer and in the end we turn 

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:46.200
 always to the formatting in this case what 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.050
 we will do in this way that is a 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.060
 pretty interesting feature 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.710
 in this section we can eliminate the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.360
 browser history and history 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.250
 from google play also the archives 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.960
 downloaded that we normally never 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.000
 we remember them we spent our lives 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.770
 downloading files that we're going 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.450
 using daily and we are always 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.100
 forget that all that is stored and 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.310
 occupying memory in this case also 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.300
 we can select it and delete it myself 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.920
 right now I do not have files 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.210
 downloaded but for example the story 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.830
 of the browser and google stories 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.960
 place and I can clean it if we 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.910
 we go to the section of cleaning lime and sms 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.520
 we can eliminate then practically 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.530
 all the call records both 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.870
 incoming as outgoing we can 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.630
 eliminate everything from one by hitting a tick 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.060
 green in this part of here or open and go 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.370
 eliminating one by one the truth that is 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.080
 very interesting and that for a long time 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.020
 time we might forget that 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.580
 all this is stored but the 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.050
 phone really in terms of 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.120
 performance yes that does not give us at the time 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.070
 to open recent recent calls 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.810
 what we have done we will realize 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.090
 times that 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.069
 a scroll up or down we 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.810
 they produce some kind of the and it's because of 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.630
 number of calls we have there 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.340
 saved and that the system costs 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.750
 process also on the bottom 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.819
 we can see that we can eliminate 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.040
 in case there are message errors one 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.560
 sent draft draft receipt 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.630
 sent messages and clicked board if we 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.160
 let's go to the app manager section 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.319
 we will find something pretty 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.140
 interesting we can uninstall several 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.480
 applications at the same time 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.580
 and in the preinstalled section 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.620
 we can disable the applications 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.390
 that are pre-installed by the system 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.890
 operative and the truth that is very 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.020
 interesting because we will see the 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.730
 that are disabled and enabled and 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.520
 in a very comfortable way we can go back 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.860
 to enable those in enable the this is 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.530
 Well, let's say another option that brings us 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.459
 this application so that from this 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.770
 application we can manage 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.380
 practically everything related to the 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.820
 device optimization in the 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.380
 game improvement section we can 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.660
 add any game we have 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.250
 installed and the application manage to the 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.720
 ram memory in such a way that the 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.000
 applications in the background the 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.340
 will eliminate so that it focuses only on 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.870
 move the game the truth that another 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.700
 quite interesting option to take into 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.980
 account if we go to the section of 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.260
 configuration we can choose that we 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.880
 let us know the day we want the 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.830
 time we want to make a 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.140
 cleaning and even to let us know when 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.090
 we have more than 50 megabytes of files 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.830
 trash we will also have the option of 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.170
 change the language that you see there 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.989
 enough languages and in the bottom part 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.120
 will make us a link to add in the 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.019
 Home screen as an access 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.090
 direct 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.769
 as you see an all-in-one application in 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.349
 which we will have all the options of 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.300
 optimization in the same application 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:28.159
 nothing if you liked to like 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.909
 and without more see you in the next video 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:30.909
 see you soon
