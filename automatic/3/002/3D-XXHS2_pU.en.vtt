00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:07.569
 hi cybernaut are you in the course of 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:10.600
 animatu web with eddgar animated created 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:14.280
 by videotutoriales point is your 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.280
 videotutoriales in Spanish 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.860
 in this video tutorial we will see how 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.990
 create the video point tutorial logo 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.080
 we have it here and the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.080
 page 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.140
 notice that it was rotating in relation to 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.140
 center of our lighthouse 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.840
 very well later do not worry 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.360
 you'll see how to make this be 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.829
 cyclical we came to the project we had a 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.990
 project, let's create a document 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.110
 new 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.530
 and we are going to import the two images are 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.100
 two 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.100
 to import 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.600
 around here I have the images look at is the 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:01:00.379
 logo 1 jpg has the whole background without the 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.910
 text and then the logo 2 png because png 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.159
 so that all this background 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.870
 transparent as you select these two 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.000
 images and open 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.280
 very well we already have them in elements the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.710
 we have in the library and as we have 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.170
 done by the file menu we have it 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.120
 also in the perfect timeline 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.960
 now I select any of them 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.850
 we look is 730 by 170 we are going to do 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.800
 that the project was on stage 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.970
 it is also 170 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.970
 by 170 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.440
 very well we already have it 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.909
 now let's make it rotate we look at 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.070
 select the text png logos perfect 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.770
 first we are going to make it in the 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.259
 left part we take the tool 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.400
 top left to the right of the 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.200
 selection tool we have the 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.170
 free transform tool would be 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.060
 we come here and we will rotate it if 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.909
 you keep the uppercase keys pressed 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.119
 you'll see that it rotates you with a little more 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.070
 perfect precision we leave it that way and 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.500
 let's go now how are we going to like this is the 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.860
 beginning of the animation we are going to create 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.630
 a keyframe of rotation in the 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.670
 transformation section here you have 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.970
 rotation then we click on this icon 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.440
 to add a keyframe in the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.590
 state in which you are now 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.640
 we click very well now we go for 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.980
 example to the second 2 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.980
 2 perfect and we make it rotate 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.220
 with the capital letters to be with 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.840
 perfect angles 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.320
 until minus 90 degrees already we have it 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.240
 rotating from one side to the other something that 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.100
 we are left for example would be to go to 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.100
 second 4 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.730
 around here very well and we put it back 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.600
 here to 90 very well if we 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.890
 we visualize this 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:09.190
 intro control 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.190
 we have an animation that comes and goes 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.530
 very well but if we leave it that way there is a 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.990
 little sauce and it's hard to read the text 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.800
 see what interests us this is 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.840
 original 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.340
 but as we have published it as 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.740
 we have published and it makes me a prize 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.180
 look and I'm making a prize what 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.770
 you have lost now you will see it 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.720
 and here you have it, let's make it a 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.150
 little more interesting a little more 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.400
 attractive 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.260
 we move away from the animation to see 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.930
 all the complete animation we move 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.200
 in time I'm interested in seeing the two 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.670
 moments of the animation is this part 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.890
 of the animation left schemes 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.080
 counter-clockwise and then felt 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.580
 schedule very well since we're going to like 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.530
 always when you want to give a little 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.420
 vidilla I would say to your animation 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.580
 modify the accelerations and 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.739
 decelerations clico in the first 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.709
 part of the animation is here and 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.020
 we come to here and we say acceleration and 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:11.230
 deceleration I want it to be seen in the 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.050
 two states very well then so that 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:18.700
 read well is that is much 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:20.739
 while accelerating and the 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.389
 moment of deceleration is to say that 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.730
 this step from here intermediates be very 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.220
 fast let's exaggerate what 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.350
 for example almost almost the quadratic 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.960
 it could be quite interesting we are going to 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.880
 see it we have to put the same in the other 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.760
 side of the animation when the 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.160
 animation then we will say that acceleration 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.660
 we have put the perfect quadratic 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.660
 let's see now the difference 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:50.180
 perfect for that would serve the difference 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.810
 between one another the quadratic etcetera 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:57.000
 etcetera to see when you're around 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.430
 the difference between these here 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.400
 all accelerate and descend but each 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.200
 one exaggerates more is less exaggerated than 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.240
 you have all the curves and each one 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.920
 exaggerate more I've put this the block 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.960
 tico to be a long time to 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.520
 beginning the animation and at the end of the 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.010
 animation keep in mind that it is the piece 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.010
 this one of the animation and so you can see 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.170
 perfectly our text we go back to 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.890
 Intro control and notice that it is here 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.720
 is a while is a perfect time 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.610
 I insist that we will see how to make 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.130
 be cyclical but we have already seen how 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.620
 we can insert two images one 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.870
 transparent and the other not transparent and 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.810
 apply them an effect in this case of 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.640
 rotation come keep cheering in the 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.640
 next video tutorial so far
