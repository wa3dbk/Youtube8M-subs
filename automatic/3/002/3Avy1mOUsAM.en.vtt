00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.960 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
show<00:00:05.850> you<00:00:05.910> how<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:07.280> line<00:00:08.280> up<00:00:08.460> your<00:00:08.490> timing

to the top dead center teach you how to

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.650 
to the top dead center teach you how to
mark<00:00:13.260> this<00:00:13.560> so<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.490> can<00:00:14.640> transfer<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.390> or

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
mark this so that you can transfer it or

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.630 
mark this so that you can transfer it or
pull<00:00:15.930> it<00:00:16.109> out<00:00:16.260> for<00:00:16.529> service<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.279> you're<00:00:17.430> doing

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
pull it out for service so you're doing

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.079 
pull it out for service so you're doing
a<00:00:17.730> timing<00:00:18.119> cover<00:00:18.300> on<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.599> force<00:00:19.159> 4.2<00:00:20.159> liter<00:00:20.429> on<00:00:21.029> a

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:21.089 
a timing cover on a force 4.2 liter on a

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.529 
a timing cover on a force 4.2 liter on a
Ford<00:00:21.509> and<00:00:22.189> be<00:00:23.189> able<00:00:23.339> to<00:00:23.460> put<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.820> back<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.300> and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
Ford and be able to put it back in and

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.960 
Ford and be able to put it back in and
stive<00:00:24.839> your<00:00:25.019> timing<00:00:25.349> intact<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.460> here<00:00:26.759> we<00:00:26.849> go

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
stive your timing intact so here we go

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.509 
stive your timing intact so here we go
here's<00:00:27.239> how<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.419> do<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:28.220> so<00:00:29.220> if<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.399> got<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
here's how you do it so if you got the

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.279 
here's how you do it so if you got the
timing<00:00:29.909> set<00:00:30.329> up<00:00:30.509> to<00:00:30.659> where<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.929> teeth<00:00:31.109> are

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
timing set up to where the teeth are

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.410 
timing set up to where the teeth are
facing<00:00:31.529> each<00:00:31.829> other<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.399> I've<00:00:32.850> done<00:00:33.060> this<00:00:33.239> on

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
facing each other and I've done this on

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.049 
facing each other and I've done this on
both<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> motors<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:35.430> then<00:00:35.609> the<00:00:35.760> next

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
both of the motors and so then the next

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.910 
both of the motors and so then the next
thing<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.539> is<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.260> line<00:00:37.469> up<00:00:37.710> what<00:00:37.890> I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
thing to do is to line up what I

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.400 
thing to do is to line up what I
affectionately<00:00:38.670> call<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.410> abomination

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
affectionately call the abomination

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.430 
affectionately call the abomination
sensor<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.730> camshaft<00:00:42.030> position<00:00:42.870> sensor

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
sensor it's a camshaft position sensor

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.919 
sensor it's a camshaft position sensor
but<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.519> based<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:45.030> an<00:00:45.300> old<00:00:45.449> distributor

00:00:45.919 --> 00:00:45.929 
but it's based on an old distributor

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.160 
but it's based on an old distributor
design<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:47.489> kind<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.879> shortcut<00:00:48.449> method<00:00:48.989> of

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
design it's kind of a shortcut method of

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
to the timing on the engine so what

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.910 
to the timing on the engine so what
we'll<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.690> we'll<00:01:10.230> rotate<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.770> motor

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
we'll do is we'll rotate the motor

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.130 
we'll do is we'll rotate the motor
around<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.640> camshaft<00:01:12.180> position<00:01:12.360> sensor

and<00:01:21.030> engineering<00:01:21.570> design<00:01:22.280> but<00:01:23.280> what<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.580> do

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
and engineering design but what you do

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.850 
and engineering design but what you do
is<00:01:23.760> you<00:01:24.030> take<00:01:24.180> off<00:01:24.450> these<00:01:24.840> two<00:01:25.110> bolts<00:01:25.500> at<00:01:25.680> least

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
is you take off these two bolts at least

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.130 
is you take off these two bolts at least
it's<00:01:26.070> serviceable<00:01:26.640> right<00:01:26.960> instead<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.080> a

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
it's serviceable right instead of a

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.600 
it's serviceable right instead of a
distributor<00:01:28.680> they<00:01:28.860> made<00:01:29.010> a<00:01:29.040> camshaft

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
distributor they made a camshaft

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.250 
distributor they made a camshaft
position<00:01:29.760> sensor<00:01:30.390> based<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> distributor

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
position sensor based on the distributor

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.860 
position sensor based on the distributor
design<00:01:31.800> so<00:01:32.580> you<00:01:32.640> set<00:01:32.940> that<00:01:33.120> aside<00:01:33.300> and<00:01:33.810> then

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
design so you set that aside and then

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.240 
design so you set that aside and then
the<00:01:34.590> next<00:01:34.860> thing<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.550> is<00:01:37.010> Mark<00:01:38.010> where

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the next thing that you do is Mark where

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.180 
the next thing that you do is Mark where
the<00:01:38.490> very<00:01:38.850> front<00:01:39.300> of<00:01:39.480> this<00:01:39.660> is<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.500> body<00:01:41.010> of

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
the very front of this is to the body of

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.790 
the very front of this is to the body of
the<00:01:41.280> sensor<00:01:41.910> and<00:01:42.150> then<00:01:42.750> also<00:01:42.990> as<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.440> can<00:01:43.590> see

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
the sensor and then also as you can see

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.820 
the sensor and then also as you can see
I've<00:01:44.010> got<00:01:44.190> a<00:01:44.250> little<00:01:44.580> red<00:01:44.790> mark<00:01:45.500> where<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
I've got a little red mark where the

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.170 
I've got a little red mark where the
sensor<00:01:47.820> part<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.380> or<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.880> what<00:01:50.880> do<00:01:50.940> you<00:01:51.000> call

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
sensor part is or the what do you call

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.230 
sensor part is or the what do you call
you<00:01:51.660> call<00:01:51.870> it<00:01:52.050> the<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.670> an<00:01:53.850> exciter

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
you call it the it's like an exciter

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.650 
you call it the it's like an exciter
ring<00:01:54.600> or<00:01:55.670> pulse<00:01:56.670> ring<00:01:56.970> or<00:01:57.180> something<00:01:57.540> like

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
ring or pulse ring or something like

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.330 
ring or pulse ring or something like
that<00:01:57.720> but<00:01:58.050> it's<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.470> half<00:01:58.650> circle<00:01:58.890> ring

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
that but it's just a half circle ring

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.810 
that but it's just a half circle ring
and<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.600> inside<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.290> actual<00:02:01.920> camshaft

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
and on the inside of the actual camshaft

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.670 
and on the inside of the actual camshaft
position<00:02:02.970> sensor<00:02:03.660> it's<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:04.020> got<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> magnet

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
position sensor it's just got a magnet

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.560 
position sensor it's just got a magnet
that<00:02:04.710> detects<00:02:05.250> when<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.640> passes<00:02:05.850> through<00:02:06.090> here

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
that detects when it passes through here

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.779 
that detects when it passes through here
so<00:02:07.350> we'll<00:02:07.590> set<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.009> actual<00:02:08.519> camshaft

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
so we'll set the actual camshaft

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.690 
so we'll set the actual camshaft
position<00:02:09.509> sensor<00:02:09.959> side<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.619> as<00:02:11.190> we<00:02:11.340> pull<00:02:11.550> this

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
position sensor side and as we pull this

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.670 
position sensor side and as we pull this
up<00:02:12.470> you'll<00:02:13.470> notice<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.130> moved

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
up you'll notice that it moved

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.130 
up you'll notice that it moved
you<00:02:15.640> see<00:02:15.849> how<00:02:16.030> it's<00:02:16.269> going<00:02:16.510> counterclockwise

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
you see how it's going counterclockwise

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.940 
you see how it's going counterclockwise
as<00:02:18.040> I<00:02:18.280> pull<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:18.609> up<00:02:18.930> now<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:19.989> position<00:02:20.319> of<00:02:20.799> it

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
as I pull it up now the position of it

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.720 
as I pull it up now the position of it
has<00:02:21.099> changed<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:22.060> used<00:02:22.359> to<00:02:22.540> be<00:02:22.750> in<00:02:23.609> Menna

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
has changed it used to be in Menna

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.589 
has changed it used to be in Menna
mark<00:02:25.239> wits<00:02:25.510> perfect<00:02:26.140> it<00:02:27.010> used<00:02:27.219> to<00:02:27.400> be<00:02:27.640> here<00:02:28.359> and

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
mark wits perfect it used to be here and

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.709 
mark wits perfect it used to be here and
now<00:02:29.109> it's<00:02:29.290> rotated<00:02:29.920> here<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:31.000> if<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:31.359> put<00:02:31.599> it

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:31.719 
now it's rotated here so if I put it

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.440 
now it's rotated here so if I put it
into<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.139> new<00:02:32.290> motor<00:02:32.590> in<00:02:32.889> this<00:02:33.099> position<00:02:33.730> when

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
into the new motor in this position when

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.470 
into the new motor in this position when
it's<00:02:34.689> timing<00:02:35.139> gear<00:02:35.379> is<00:02:35.739> lined<00:02:36.670> up<00:02:36.909> it<00:02:37.269> should

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
it's timing gear is lined up it should

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.390 
it's timing gear is lined up it should
drop<00:02:37.750> into<00:02:38.109> the<00:02:38.230> same<00:02:38.439> thing<00:02:38.739> let's<00:02:38.920> see<00:02:39.099> if<00:02:39.189> my

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
drop into the same thing let's see if my

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.479 
drop into the same thing let's see if my
theory<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:39.790> correct<00:02:40.260> with<00:02:41.260> no<00:02:41.500> editing<00:02:41.859> this

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
theory is correct with no editing this

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.959 
theory is correct with no editing this
is<00:02:42.639> complete<00:02:43.209> brutal<00:02:43.840> honesty<00:02:44.639> you<00:02:45.639> can<00:02:45.760> see

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:45.969 
is complete brutal honesty you can see

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:47.550 
is complete brutal honesty you can see
I've<00:02:46.090> got<00:02:46.299> my<00:02:46.480> timing<00:02:46.720> marks<00:02:47.109> on<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.409> new

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
I've got my timing marks on the new

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.460 
I've got my timing marks on the new
engine<00:02:48.040> lined<00:02:48.310> up<00:02:48.519> in<00:02:48.669> the<00:02:48.819> similar<00:02:49.150> fashion

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
engine lined up in the similar fashion

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.979 
engine lined up in the similar fashion
so<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.530> come<00:02:50.859> over<00:02:50.889> to<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.430> hole<00:02:51.780> where<00:02:52.780> the

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
so I come over to the hole where the

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.220 
so I come over to the hole where the
abomination<00:02:54.209> camshaft<00:02:55.209> position<00:02:55.389> sensor

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
abomination camshaft position sensor

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.830 
abomination camshaft position sensor
goes<00:02:56.909> and<00:02:59.669> we'll<00:03:00.669> put<00:03:00.969> it<00:03:01.060> in<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.419> see<00:03:01.450> what<00:03:01.719> it

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
goes and we'll put it in and see what it

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.809 
goes and we'll put it in and see what it
does<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:02.379> don't<00:03:02.980> know<00:03:03.129> how<00:03:03.340> I'm<00:03:03.430> gonna<00:03:03.579> work

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
does I don't know how I'm gonna work

this tripod for this bear with me crank
that<00:03:08.650> up<00:03:08.859> there<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:11.049> should<00:03:11.439> get<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:12.060> right

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
that up there and I should get it right

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.280 
that up there and I should get it right
like<00:03:13.239> that<00:03:15.030> I'm<00:03:16.030> not<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.359> best<00:03:16.599> key<00:03:16.810> grip<00:03:17.109> in

like that I'm not the best key grip in

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.050 
like that I'm not the best key grip in

you that and I'm not a huge fan of
editing<00:03:21.579> see<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.239> way<00:03:22.359> that<00:03:22.540> these<00:03:22.690> are<00:03:22.750> all

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
editing see the way that these are all

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.670 
editing see the way that these are all
spiraled<00:03:23.379> so<00:03:24.340> as<00:03:24.729> this<00:03:25.299> drops<00:03:25.720> in<00:03:26.019> there<00:03:26.319> it's

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
spiraled so as this drops in there it's

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.680 
spiraled so as this drops in there it's
going<00:03:26.889> to<00:03:26.949> slide<00:03:27.250> through<00:03:27.669> the<00:03:27.879> teeth<00:03:28.299> that

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
going to slide through the teeth that

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.589 
going to slide through the teeth that
are<00:03:28.810> on<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.109> camshaft<00:03:29.349> and<00:03:30.099> the<00:03:30.549> camshaft<00:03:30.819> is

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
are on the camshaft and the camshaft is

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.740 
are on the camshaft and the camshaft is
on<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.900> end<00:03:32.049> of<00:03:32.199> this<00:03:32.409> here<00:03:33.310> great<00:03:34.209> chefs<00:03:34.540> the

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
on the end of this here great chefs the

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.710 
on the end of this here great chefs the
little<00:03:35.019> gear<00:03:35.400> big<00:03:36.400> gears<00:03:36.699> the<00:03:36.909> camshaft<00:03:37.449> so

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
little gear big gears the camshaft so

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.559 
little gear big gears the camshaft so
the<00:03:37.870> camshaft<00:03:38.560> should<00:03:38.799> turn<00:03:39.069> one<00:03:39.760> revolution

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
the camshaft should turn one revolution

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.539 
the camshaft should turn one revolution
for<00:03:40.840> every<00:03:41.109> two<00:03:41.349> revolutions<00:03:42.129> that<00:03:42.400> the

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
for every two revolutions that the

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.909 
for every two revolutions that the
crankshaft<00:03:42.909> does<00:03:43.419> that's<00:03:44.349> how<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.650> get<00:03:44.799> your

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
crankshaft does that's how you get your

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.539 
crankshaft does that's how you get your
dead<00:03:45.159> cylinder<00:03:45.699> stroke<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:47.919> then<00:03:48.280> this

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
dead cylinder stroke so and then this

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.189 
dead cylinder stroke so and then this
keys<00:03:49.329> into<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:51.220> oil<00:03:51.549> pump<00:03:51.909> this<00:03:52.569> is<00:03:52.629> actually

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
keys into the oil pump this is actually

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.490 
keys into the oil pump this is actually
that<00:03:53.379> whale<00:03:53.650> pump<00:03:53.979> drive<00:03:54.250> gear<00:03:54.840> so<00:03:55.840> maybe<00:03:56.409> I

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
that whale pump drive gear so maybe I

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.170 
that whale pump drive gear so maybe I
should<00:03:56.739> mount<00:03:56.919> the<00:03:57.069> oil<00:03:57.280> pump<00:03:57.489> before<00:03:57.729> doing

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
should mount the oil pump before doing

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.460 
should mount the oil pump before doing
this<00:03:58.379> but<00:03:59.379> for<00:03:59.680> sake<00:03:59.859> of<00:03:59.889> the<00:04:00.040> video<00:04:00.189> and<00:04:01.470> there

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
this but for sake of the video and there

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.890 
this but for sake of the video and there
no<00:04:02.620> editing<00:04:03.129> get<00:04:03.669> er<00:04:03.699> done<00:04:03.939> but<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.720> other

no editing get er done but the other

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.469 
no editing get er done but the other
thing<00:04:05.229> was<00:04:05.919> just<00:04:05.949> so<00:04:06.489> that<00:04:06.639> was<00:04:06.790> my<00:04:06.909> mark<00:04:07.209> to

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:07.479 
thing was just so that was my mark to

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.210 
thing was just so that was my mark to
the<00:04:07.599> outside<00:04:08.139> I've<00:04:08.439> already<00:04:08.680> marked<00:04:08.979> this

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
the outside I've already marked this

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.640 
the outside I've already marked this
block<00:04:09.579> with<00:04:09.790> a<00:04:09.819> little<00:04:10.150> red<00:04:10.299> paint<00:04:10.599> so<00:04:11.560> I'll

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
block with a little red paint so I'll

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.069 
block with a little red paint so I'll
drop<00:04:11.919> this<00:04:12.159> into<00:04:12.489> place<00:04:12.729> and<00:04:14.220> remember<00:04:15.220> this

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
drop this into place and remember this

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.479 
drop this into place and remember this
will<00:04:17.079> be<00:04:18.030> like<00:04:19.030> that<00:04:19.419> so<00:04:20.169> that<00:04:20.409> when<00:04:20.949> I<00:04:20.979> drop<00:04:21.310> it

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
will be like that so that when I drop it

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.520 
will be like that so that when I drop it
in<00:04:21.609> it<00:04:21.789> should<00:04:21.820> fall<00:04:22.270> into<00:04:22.509> place

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
in it should fall into place

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.380 
in it should fall into place
and<00:04:25.530> this<00:04:25.980> way<00:04:26.160> I<00:04:26.190> can<00:04:26.550> make<00:04:26.580> multiple

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
and this way I can make multiple

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.230 
and this way I can make multiple
attempts<00:04:27.900> as<00:04:28.080> much<00:04:28.440> as<00:04:28.590> I<00:04:28.710> need<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:28.980> in<00:04:29.970> order

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
attempts as much as I need to in order

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.480 
attempts as much as I need to in order
to<00:04:30.390> make<00:04:30.690> that<00:04:30.900> happen<00:04:31.170> so<00:04:31.590> it<00:04:31.980> drops<00:04:32.250> into

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
to make that happen so it drops into

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.400 
to make that happen so it drops into
place<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:33.120> timing<00:04:33.540> is<00:04:33.690> correct

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
place the timing is correct

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.530 
place the timing is correct
I've<00:04:34.830> got<00:04:35.810> body<00:04:36.810> of<00:04:37.140> it<00:04:37.400> lined<00:04:38.400> up<00:04:38.670> with<00:04:39.420> the

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
I've got body of it lined up with the

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.250 
I've got body of it lined up with the
base<00:04:39.750> there<00:04:40.640> so<00:04:41.640> I<00:04:42.030> should<00:04:42.540> be<00:04:42.690> able<00:04:42.930> to<00:04:43.050> take

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
base there so I should be able to take

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.320 
base there so I should be able to take
my<00:04:44.270> securing<00:04:45.740> tab<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:47.340> bolt<00:04:47.610> and<00:04:47.970> just<00:04:48.060> put

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
my securing tab and bolt and just put

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.850 
my securing tab and bolt and just put
them<00:04:48.450> in<00:04:48.570> there<00:04:48.810> and<00:04:49.260> be<00:04:49.410> good<00:04:49.590> to<00:04:49.740> go<00:04:49.890> for<00:04:51.860> it

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
them in there and be good to go for it

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.440 
them in there and be good to go for it
goes<00:04:53.040> where<00:04:53.250> a<00:04:53.280> distributor<00:04:53.910> would<00:04:54.060> normally

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
goes where a distributor would normally

go on a 4 liter motor Ford uses these on

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.960 
go on a 4 liter motor Ford uses these on
their<00:04:57.930> 4.2<00:04:58.560> liter<00:04:58.830> motors<00:04:59.310> they<00:04:59.550> use<00:04:59.700> them<00:04:59.850> on

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
their 4.2 liter motors they use them on

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.530 
their 4.2 liter motors they use them on
the<00:05:00.090> 5/4<00:05:00.750> and<00:05:01.050> on<00:05:01.290> the<00:05:01.410> 4<00:05:01.650> 6<00:05:02.300> depending<00:05:03.300> on<00:05:03.420> the

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.440 
the 5/4 and on the 4 6 depending on the
year<00:05:03.810> but<00:05:04.310> it's<00:05:05.310> basically<00:05:05.700> just<00:05:05.820> like<00:05:06.090> a

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
year but it's basically just like a

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.080 
year but it's basically just like a
distributor<00:05:07.260> but<00:05:07.440> it's<00:05:07.650> used<00:05:08.490> as<00:05:08.700> a<00:05:08.730> camshaft

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
distributor but it's used as a camshaft

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.120 
distributor but it's used as a camshaft
position<00:05:09.570> sensor<00:05:10.350> instead<00:05:10.620> of<00:05:10.770> having<00:05:11.040> a

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
position sensor instead of having a

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.850 
position sensor instead of having a
distributor<00:05:11.640> type<00:05:11.880> ignition<00:05:12.450> this<00:05:13.110> employs

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
distributor type ignition this employs

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.250 
distributor type ignition this employs
an<00:05:14.100> ignition<00:05:14.550> coil<00:05:15.060> that<00:05:15.420> goes<00:05:15.630> across<00:05:15.780> all

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
an ignition coil that goes across all

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.530 
an ignition coil that goes across all
you<00:05:17.220> know<00:05:17.310> all<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:17.580> way<00:05:17.670> across<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.300> motor

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
you know all the way across the motor

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.790 
you know all the way across the motor
with<00:05:19.260> all<00:05:19.380> the<00:05:19.590> plugs<00:05:21.200> these<00:05:22.200> where<00:05:22.440> the<00:05:22.530> spark

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
with all the plugs these where the spark

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.040 
with all the plugs these where the spark
plug<00:05:23.010> holes<00:05:23.250> are<00:05:23.490> there's<00:05:24.150> a<00:05:24.270> coil<00:05:24.510> pack<00:05:24.840> that

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
plug holes are there's a coil pack that

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
plug holes are there's a coil pack that
goes<00:05:25.200> all<00:05:25.350> over<00:05:25.380> that

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
goes all over that

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.280 
goes all over that
so<00:05:26.760> the<00:05:28.370> crankshaft<00:05:29.370> position<00:05:29.790> sensor<00:05:30.290> is

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
so the crankshaft position sensor is

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.780 
so the crankshaft position sensor is
actually<00:05:32.240> on<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:33.990> transmission<00:05:34.620> and<00:05:35.100> it<00:05:35.580> goes

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
actually on the transmission and it goes

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.630 
actually on the transmission and it goes
down<00:05:36.000> into<00:05:36.300> a<00:05:36.480> hole<00:05:36.810> back<00:05:37.530> behind<00:05:37.860> here<00:05:38.460> and

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
down into a hole back behind here and

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.940 
down into a hole back behind here and
that's<00:05:38.790> the<00:05:38.910> crank<00:05:39.240> sensor<00:05:39.540> and<00:05:40.290> then<00:05:40.560> the<00:05:40.740> cam

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
that's the crank sensor and then the cam

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.210 
that's the crank sensor and then the cam
sensor<00:05:41.340> is<00:05:42.270> just<00:05:42.660> this<00:05:42.870> top<00:05:43.170> portion<00:05:43.440> here<00:05:43.950> the

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
sensor is just this top portion here the

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.300 
sensor is just this top portion here the
cam<00:05:44.460> sensor<00:05:44.820> is<00:05:45.470> basically<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:46.740> cap<00:05:46.980> that

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
cam sensor is basically the cap that

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.280 
cam sensor is basically the cap that
goes<00:05:47.370> on<00:05:47.670> this<00:05:47.880> mock-up<00:05:48.450> the<00:05:48.570> distributor<00:05:51.290> it

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
goes on this mock-up the distributor it

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.050 
goes on this mock-up the distributor it
just<00:05:52.500> has<00:05:52.680> that<00:05:52.710> little<00:05:53.100> half<00:05:53.400> circle<00:05:53.910> that

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
just has that little half circle that

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.140 
just has that little half circle that
you<00:05:54.150> see<00:05:54.330> here<00:05:54.660> pass<00:05:55.290> through<00:05:55.710> here<00:05:56.100> for<00:05:56.940> the

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
you see here pass through here for the

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.570 
you see here pass through here for the
camshaft<00:05:57.660> position<00:05:59.630> there<00:06:00.630> as<00:06:00.750> I
