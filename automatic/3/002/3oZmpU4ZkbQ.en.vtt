Overton Heidi and a Berks session Heidi
so<00:00:31.019> just<00:00:31.650> for<00:00:31.800> starters<00:00:32.009> here's<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.669> case<00:00:33.440> for

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
so just for starters here's the case for

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.510 
so just for starters here's the case for
the<00:00:34.500> Overtoun<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.280> felt<00:00:35.610> case<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:37.520> no

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the Overtoun it's a felt case and no

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.270 
the Overtoun it's a felt case and no
real<00:00:38.730> padding<00:00:39.149> there<00:00:39.329> but<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:40.739> Overtoun<00:00:41.100> is

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
real padding there but the Overtoun is

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.459 
real padding there but the Overtoun is
fairly<00:00:41.730> indestructible<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:43.110> think<00:00:43.350> it's

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
fairly indestructible so I think it's

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.350 
fairly indestructible so I think it's
more<00:00:43.620> than<00:00:43.770> adequate<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.520> protective

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
more than adequate for the protective

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.660 
more than adequate for the protective
needs<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.870> instrument<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:47.129> Berk<00:00:47.309> also

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
needs of the instrument the Berk also

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.430 
needs of the instrument the Berk also
comes<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.090> case<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> heavy<00:00:48.930> heavily

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
comes in a case this is a heavy heavily

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.860 
comes in a case this is a heavy heavily
padded<00:00:50.780> denim<00:00:51.780> canvas<00:00:52.289> kind<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.739> case<00:00:53.870> so

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
padded denim canvas kind of a case so

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.319 
padded denim canvas kind of a case so
that's<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.199> that's<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.559> good<00:00:55.680> case<00:00:56.270> for<00:00:57.270> that

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
that's a that's a good case for that

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.430 
that's a that's a good case for that

problems<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.500> just<00:02:28.830> got<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.010> warm<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.310> up

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.150 

blow<00:02:34.790> some<00:02:35.000> air<00:02:35.090> through<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.360> wind<00:02:35.630> way<00:02:36.160> and

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
blow some air through that wind way and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:03:10.000 
blow some air through that wind way and
just<00:02:37.880> get<00:02:38.180> it<00:02:38.300> nice<00:02:38.990> and<00:02:39.050> warm<00:03:08.800> let<00:03:09.800> me<00:03:09.860> just

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
just get it nice and warm let me just

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:33.920 
just get it nice and warm let me just
run<00:03:10.160> a<00:03:10.190> scale<00:03:10.460> for<00:03:10.640> you

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.770 

so<00:03:34.930> that's<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.230> Overtoun<00:03:35.590> it's<00:03:35.890> a<00:03:36.780> great

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
so that's the Overtoun it's a great

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.300 
so that's the Overtoun it's a great
instrument<00:03:38.080> good<00:03:38.710> response<00:03:39.100> good<00:03:40.000> volume<00:03:40.240> and

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
instrument good response good volume and

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.990 
instrument good response good volume and
a<00:03:42.960> fair<00:03:43.960> bit<00:03:44.110> of<00:03:44.140> chip<00:03:44.500> kind<00:03:45.430> of<00:03:45.490> a<00:03:45.580> traditional

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000

made of what he calls his composite

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.440 
made of what he calls his composite
material<00:03:59.580> get<00:04:00.580> it<00:04:00.670> on<00:04:00.790> this<00:04:00.910> side<00:04:01.090> you<00:04:01.300> can<00:04:01.330> see

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
material get it on this side you can see

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.290 
material get it on this side you can see
it<00:04:01.660> better

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300

Michael<00:04:04.300> also<00:04:04.480> works<00:04:04.930> in<00:04:05.170> brass<00:04:10.680> one<00:04:11.680> of<00:04:11.740> these

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
Michael also works in brass one of these

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.320 
Michael also works in brass one of these
days<00:04:12.070> I'm<00:04:12.250> gonna<00:04:12.400> figure<00:04:12.580> out<00:04:12.790> which<00:04:12.910> side<00:04:13.180> is

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
days I'm gonna figure out which side is

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.810 
days I'm gonna figure out which side is
which

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.570 

there's<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.900> brass<00:04:17.109> Burke<00:04:17.440> and<00:04:17.890> he<00:04:18.220> works<00:04:18.430> in

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
there's the brass Burke and he works in

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.360 
there's the brass Burke and he works in
aluminum<00:04:19.769> so<00:04:20.769> these<00:04:20.920> are<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.160> three

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
aluminum so these are the three

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.790 
aluminum so these are the three
materials<00:04:21.910> that<00:04:23.730> Michael<00:04:24.730> Burke<00:04:24.880> works<00:04:25.180> in

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
materials that Michael Burke works in

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.380 
materials that Michael Burke works in
most<00:04:26.800> of<00:04:27.040> his<00:04:27.160> models<00:04:27.550> are<00:04:27.669> available<00:04:27.760> in<00:04:28.210> most

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
most of his models are available in most

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.290 
most of his models are available in most
of<00:04:28.600> those<00:04:28.660> materials<00:04:29.260> the<00:04:29.590> lowest<00:04:30.120> models<00:04:31.120> are

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
of those materials the lowest models are

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.650 
of those materials the lowest models are
not<00:04:31.419> always<00:04:31.840> available<00:04:31.960> in<00:04:32.320> brass<00:04:33.030> anyway<00:04:34.030> we

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
not always available in brass anyway we

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.300 
not always available in brass anyway we
will<00:04:34.750> compare<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:35.169> to<00:04:35.380> the<00:04:35.470> composite<00:04:35.830> because

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
will compare it to the composite because

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.190 
will compare it to the composite because
that's<00:04:36.460> what<00:04:36.640> was<00:04:36.760> requested<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.480> have<00:04:38.020> another
