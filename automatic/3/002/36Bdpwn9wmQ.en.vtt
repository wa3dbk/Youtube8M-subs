00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:22.590
 of all the water in the world just the 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.590
 0 3% is available for humans 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.870
 the rest is frozen in the glaciers 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.620
 or deep in the earth beyond 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.620
 of our reach 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.330
 According to the United Nations Organization 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.750
 almost 900 million people live without 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.750
 drinking water 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.489
 think about generating water and being like a 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.489
 step forward 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.290
 this water generator is a team 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.150
 designed to take advantage of the capture 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.340
 efficient air humidity and 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.360
 convert it into water suitable for consumption 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.600
 human 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:17.260
 the result transparent clean water and 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.260
 drinking with 99 7% purity 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.829
 how does it work 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.200
 Its main phases are the capture 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.680
 purification filtered purification 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.680
 Storage and distribution 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.170
 the capture the air is optional through 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.540
 of the solid particulate filter 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.510
 equipment then the steam is condensed into 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.330
 the collecting tray in the process of 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.280
 filtering eliminates 93% of the 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.650
 pollutants and particles 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.450
 transported by air eliminates the 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.240
 organic odors and impurities 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.090
 dissolved 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.500
 and 99 9% of the pollutants 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.500
 transported by water
