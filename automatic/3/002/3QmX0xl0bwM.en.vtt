and<00:00:00.380> here<00:00:01.380> are<00:00:01.500> some<00:00:01.709> practice<00:00:02.159> problems

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
and here are some practice problems

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.910 
and here are some practice problems
dealing<00:00:03.179> with<00:00:03.300> pressure<00:00:03.600> and<00:00:03.929> in<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.710> first

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
dealing with pressure and in the first

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.889 
dealing with pressure and in the first
one<00:00:05.130> here<00:00:05.370> we're<00:00:05.549> told<00:00:05.730> that<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:05.970> concrete<00:00:06.569> a

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
one here we're told that a concrete a

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.879 
one here we're told that a concrete a
concrete<00:00:07.620> pillar<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.280> rectangular<00:00:09.210> in<00:00:09.389> shape

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
concrete pillar is rectangular in shape

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.249 
concrete pillar is rectangular in shape
two<00:00:10.889> feet<00:00:11.190> wide<00:00:11.429> two<00:00:11.910> feet<00:00:12.179> deep<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.780> twenty

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
two feet wide two feet deep and twenty

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.289 
two feet wide two feet deep and twenty
feet<00:00:13.469> tall<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:14.190> I'll<00:00:14.429> draw<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.639> picture<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.210> you

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
feet tall so I'll draw a picture and you

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.050 
feet tall so I'll draw a picture and you
can<00:00:15.450> just<00:00:15.599> make<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.780> rough<00:00:16.139> sketch<00:00:16.350> here<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.699> so

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
can just make a rough sketch here and so

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.029 
can just make a rough sketch here and so
this<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.750> two<00:00:19.140> feet<00:00:19.439> down<00:00:19.770> at<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
this is this is two feet down at the

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.259 
this is this is two feet down at the
bottom<00:00:21.020> two<00:00:22.020> feet<00:00:22.260> wide<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:23.070> two<00:00:23.640> feet<00:00:23.910> deep

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
bottom two feet wide and two feet deep

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.230 
bottom two feet wide and two feet deep
so<00:00:24.300> I'll<00:00:24.720> make<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.900> 3d<00:00:25.710> sketch<00:00:26.099> like<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:29.240> okay

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
so I'll make a 3d sketch like this okay

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.810 
so I'll make a 3d sketch like this okay
so<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.990> length<00:00:31.260> there<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.859> -<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.610> that

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
so that that length there is - and that

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.900 
so that that length there is - and that
is<00:00:33.000> -<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.450> it's<00:00:33.510> 20<00:00:34.110> feet<00:00:34.350> tall<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.190> those

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
is - and it's 20 feet tall and those

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.170 
is - and it's 20 feet tall and those
measurements<00:00:36.750> are<00:00:36.809> all<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.110> feet<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
measurements are all in feet and the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.350 
measurements are all in feet and the
column<00:00:39.450> weighs<00:00:39.629> six<00:00:40.079> tons<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:41.100> one<00:00:41.579> ton<00:00:41.969> is

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
column weighs six tons and one ton is

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.170 
column weighs six tons and one ton is
2,000<00:00:43.320> pounds<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.520> tells<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.879> how<00:00:45.000> much

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
2,000 pounds so that tells you how much

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.979 
2,000 pounds so that tells you how much
force<00:00:46.190> from<00:00:47.190> gravity<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:48.090> pushing<00:00:48.510> down<00:00:48.960> on

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
force from gravity is pushing down on

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.020 
force from gravity is pushing down on
the<00:00:49.410> ground<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.039> let's<00:00:50.070> somethin<00:00:50.489> let's<00:00:50.700> draw

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the ground so let's somethin let's draw

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.529 
the ground so let's somethin let's draw
this<00:00:52.280> draw<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.340> hidden<00:00:53.640> lines<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.180> here<00:00:54.390> and

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
this draw the hidden lines in here and

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.319 
this draw the hidden lines in here and
you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.840> get<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> visual<00:00:56.129> image<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.850> bottom

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
you can get a visual image of the bottom

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.750 
you can get a visual image of the bottom
here<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.379> bottom<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.219> column

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
here this is the bottom of the column

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.270 
here this is the bottom of the column
and<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.570> weight<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> column<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.620> spread

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and the weight of the column is spread

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.050 
and the weight of the column is spread
out<00:01:02.309> over<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.449> area<00:01:04.309> so<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:05.489> resting<00:01:05.880> on

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
out over that area so it's resting on

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.630 
out over that area so it's resting on
the<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.720> ground<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> certain

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
the on the ground here and so a certain

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.789 
the on the ground here and so a certain
force<00:01:08.970> spread<00:01:09.600> out<00:01:09.750> over<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.170> certain<00:01:10.409> area

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
force spread out over a certain area

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.429 
force spread out over a certain area
gives<00:01:11.250> us<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.549> pressure<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.299> here's<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
gives us a pressure and here's the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.530 
gives us a pressure and here's the
calculation<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:17.159> force<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.850> downward<00:01:18.270> force

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
calculation the force the downward force

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.280 
calculation the force the downward force
is<00:01:18.840> six<00:01:19.320> tons<00:01:20.509> that's<00:01:22.790> 12,000<00:01:23.990> pounds<00:01:24.990> so

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
is six tons that's 12,000 pounds so

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.230 
is six tons that's 12,000 pounds so
we're<00:01:25.439> using<00:01:25.619> pounds<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.640> measure<00:01:26.790> force

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
we're using pounds here to measure force

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.530 
we're using pounds here to measure force
and<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.080> area<00:01:28.470> here<00:01:28.860> now<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.430> area<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.909> two

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
and the area here now the area is two

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.700 
and the area here now the area is two
feet<00:01:30.900> by<00:01:31.770> two<00:01:32.460> feet<00:01:32.900> but<00:01:33.900> we're<00:01:34.049> told<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.560> give

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
feet by two feet but we're told to give

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.609 
feet by two feet but we're told to give
the<00:01:34.829> answer<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.130> pounds<00:01:35.759> per<00:01:35.820> square<00:01:36.060> inch<00:01:36.750> so

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
the answer in pounds per square inch so

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.210 
the answer in pounds per square inch so
we<00:01:37.650> need<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.130> convert<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:39.390> feet<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:40.220> 24

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
we need to convert that to feet is 24

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.460 
we need to convert that to feet is 24
inches<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.630> 24<00:01:43.320> inches<00:01:43.860> by<00:01:45.079> 24<00:01:46.079> inches

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
inches so this is 24 inches by 24 inches

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.670 
inches so this is 24 inches by 24 inches
and<00:01:47.040> when<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.369> multiply<00:01:47.600> 24<00:01:48.600> by<00:01:48.659> 24<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.500> get<00:01:49.649> a

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
and when you multiply 24 by 24 you get a

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.270 
and when you multiply 24 by 24 you get a
big<00:01:49.920> number

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
big number

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.139 
big number
it's<00:01:51.200> 576<00:01:52.610> inches<00:01:53.610> squared<00:01:54.680> or<00:01:55.680> square<00:01:56.520> inches

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
it's 576 inches squared or square inches

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.910 
it's 576 inches squared or square inches
and<00:01:57.299> then<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> pressure<00:01:59.149> is<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.509> force

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
and then the pressure is the force

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.830 
and then the pressure is the force
divided<00:02:01.920> by<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.040> area<00:02:02.210> so<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.420> will<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:03.659> this

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
divided by the area so it will be this

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.200 
divided by the area so it will be this
many<00:02:04.049> pounds<00:02:04.710> divided<00:02:05.100> by<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.369> many<00:02:05.790> square

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
many pounds divided by this many square

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.170 
many pounds divided by this many square
inches<00:02:06.740> so<00:02:07.740> that's<00:02:08.599> 12,000<00:02:09.979> pounds<00:02:11.180> divided

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
inches so that's 12,000 pounds divided

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.809 
inches so that's 12,000 pounds divided
by

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
by

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.440 
by
576<00:02:14.959> square<00:02:15.959> inches<00:02:16.409> and<00:02:16.970> 12,000<00:02:17.970> divided<00:02:18.360> by

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
576 square inches and 12,000 divided by

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.880 
576 square inches and 12,000 divided by
576<00:02:18.989> comes<00:02:19.680> out<00:02:19.829> to<00:02:20.150> 20.8<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:22.409> units<00:02:22.709> of

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
576 comes out to 20.8 and the units of

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.270 
576 comes out to 20.8 and the units of
course<00:02:23.360> pounds<00:02:24.360> per<00:02:25.049> square<00:02:25.079> inch<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.760> 20.8

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
course pounds per square inch so 20.8

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.599 
course pounds per square inch so 20.8

we're told that the contact the contact

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.179 
we're told that the contact the contact
patch<00:02:38.519> of<00:02:38.909> a<00:02:39.480> car<00:02:39.689> tire<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.319> part<00:02:40.769> of<00:02:41.010> the

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
patch of a car tire is the part of the

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.420 
patch of a car tire is the part of the
tire<00:02:41.459> that<00:02:42.299> contacts<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.959> pavement<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.769> a

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
tire that contacts the pavement and a

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.629 
tire that contacts the pavement and a
certain<00:02:44.760> car<00:02:45.120> tire<00:02:45.389> has<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:46.250> certain<00:02:47.250> car<00:02:47.430> has

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
tires that have a contact patch that is

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.869 
tires that have a contact patch that is
7<00:02:50.700> inches<00:02:51.120> by<00:02:51.840> 4<00:02:52.200> inches<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:53.519> think<00:02:53.760> about

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
7 inches by 4 inches so so think about

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.660 
7 inches by 4 inches so so think about
this<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.150> tire<00:02:54.510> basically<00:02:55.290> is<00:02:55.409> round<00:02:55.739> right<00:02:56.129> but

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
this a tire basically is round right but

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.520 
this a tire basically is round right but
it<00:02:56.760> sits<00:02:56.970> on<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.269> road<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.930> there's<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.260> lot<00:02:58.409> of

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
it sits on the road and there's a lot of

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.470 
it sits on the road and there's a lot of
weight<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.040> squashes<00:02:59.730> flat<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.329> it's

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
weight and it squashes flat so it's

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.199 
weight and it squashes flat so it's
actually<00:03:00.920> flat<00:03:01.920> along<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.489> bottom<00:03:02.639> just<00:03:03.000> for

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
actually flat along the bottom just for

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.780 
actually flat along the bottom just for
a<00:03:03.239> small<00:03:03.480> area<00:03:04.139> right<00:03:04.409> there<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:05.430> doesn't

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
a small area right there it doesn't

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.940 
a small area right there it doesn't
contact<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.510> road<00:03:06.720> at<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:06.989> single<00:03:07.590> point

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
contact the road at a single point

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.390 
contact the road at a single point
there's<00:03:08.730> an<00:03:08.939> area<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.950> contact<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.220> that's

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
there's an area of contact and that's

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.640 
there's an area of contact and that's
what<00:03:11.549> we<00:03:11.639> call<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.909> contact<00:03:12.359> contact<00:03:13.260> patch

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
what we call the contact contact patch

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.160 
what we call the contact contact patch
and<00:03:14.159> in<00:03:14.549> this<00:03:14.639> case<00:03:14.909> we're<00:03:15.150> told<00:03:15.329> that<00:03:15.510> it's<00:03:15.689> 7

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
and in this case we're told that it's 7

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.170 
and in this case we're told that it's 7
inches<00:03:16.349> by<00:03:16.739> 4<00:03:17.069> inches<00:03:17.099> and<00:03:17.519> that's<00:03:17.910> for<00:03:18.150> one

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
inches by 4 inches and that's for one

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.039 
inches by 4 inches and that's for one
tire<00:03:18.629> there<00:03:19.590> are<00:03:19.739> four<00:03:20.040> tires<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:21.060> then<00:03:21.930> we're

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
tire there are four tires and then we're

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.080 
tire there are four tires and then we're
given<00:03:22.319> some<00:03:22.500> numbers<00:03:22.829> here<00:03:22.859> the<00:03:23.370> car<00:03:23.639> weighs

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.050 

3584<00:03:27.090> pounds<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.519> then<00:03:29.519> we're<00:03:29.609> told<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.879> find

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
3584 pounds and then we're told to find

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.000 
3584 pounds and then we're told to find
the<00:03:30.150> pressure<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.870> pounds<00:03:31.470> per<00:03:31.680> square<00:03:31.709> inch

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
the pressure and pounds per square inch

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.000 
the pressure and pounds per square inch
given<00:03:32.849> these<00:03:33.150> measurements<00:03:33.870> in<00:03:33.989> inches<00:03:34.109> 7

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
given these measurements in inches 7

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.099 
given these measurements in inches 7
inches<00:03:35.280> by<00:03:35.459> 4<00:03:35.730> inches<00:03:35.760> find<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.840> pressure

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
inches by 4 inches find the pressure

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.159 
inches by 4 inches find the pressure
that<00:03:37.409> the<00:03:37.530> car<00:03:37.739> exerts<00:03:38.099> on<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.340> road<00:03:38.669> so<00:03:39.629> again

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
that the car exerts on the road so again

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:41.930 
that the car exerts on the road so again
the<00:03:40.319> calculation<00:03:41.129> will<00:03:41.340> be<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.579> standard

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
the calculation will be the standard

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.849 
the calculation will be the standard
calculation<00:03:42.629> for<00:03:42.900> pressure<00:03:43.139> pressure<00:03:43.590> as<00:03:43.829> a

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
calculation for pressure pressure as a

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.009 
calculation for pressure pressure as a
force<00:03:44.220> over<00:03:44.430> area<00:03:44.609> so<00:03:45.389> we<00:03:45.510> need<00:03:45.659> to<00:03:45.750> know<00:03:45.900> the

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
force over area so we need to know the

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.170 
force over area so we need to know the
force<00:03:46.319> which<00:03:46.919> is<00:03:47.099> given<00:03:47.340> right<00:03:47.549> there<00:03:50.180> 3584

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
force which is given right there 3584

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.849 
force which is given right there 3584
pounds<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.470> we<00:03:52.680> need<00:03:52.859> to<00:03:52.979> know<00:03:53.069> the<00:03:53.250> area<00:03:53.430> well

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
pounds and we need to know the area well

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.949 
pounds and we need to know the area well
the<00:03:55.859> area<00:03:56.069> is<00:03:56.489> just<00:03:56.699> going<00:03:56.819> to<00:03:57.030> be<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.389> area<00:03:57.750> of

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
the area is just going to be the area of

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.449 
the area is just going to be the area of
the<00:03:58.079> contact<00:03:58.260> patch<00:03:59.000> times<00:04:00.000> 4<00:04:00.569> so<00:04:01.409> this<00:04:01.590> is<00:04:01.650> 7

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
the contact patch times 4 so this is 7

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.149 
the contact patch times 4 so this is 7
inches<00:04:03.680> by<00:04:04.680> 4<00:04:05.069> inches<00:04:05.099> and<00:04:05.699> that's<00:04:06.359> obviously

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
inches by 4 inches and that's obviously

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.780 
inches by 4 inches and that's obviously
28<00:04:08.239> square<00:04:09.239> inches<00:04:09.750> that's<00:04:10.349> for<00:04:10.590> one<00:04:10.799> tire<00:04:11.040> we

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
28 square inches that's for one tire we

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.449 
28 square inches that's for one tire we
need<00:04:11.940> to<00:04:12.060> multiply<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.720> by<00:04:12.989> four<00:04:13.620> because

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
need to multiply that by four because

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.259 
need to multiply that by four because
there<00:04:14.639> are<00:04:14.699> four<00:04:14.790> tires<00:04:15.239> so<00:04:15.959> 8<00:04:16.199> times<00:04:16.409> 4<00:04:16.769> is<00:04:16.829> 32

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
there are four tires so 8 times 4 is 32

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.159 
there are four tires so 8 times 4 is 32
4<00:04:18.269> times<00:04:18.510> 2<00:04:18.690> is<00:04:18.840> 8<00:04:19.139> plus<00:04:19.409> 3<00:04:20.130> is<00:04:20.340> 11<00:04:21.019> 112

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
4 times 2 is 8 plus 3 is 11 112

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.300 
4 times 2 is 8 plus 3 is 11 112
so<00:04:22.680> it's<00:04:22.860> 112<00:04:23.580> square<00:04:24.330> inches<00:04:24.750> for<00:04:25.469> the<00:04:25.529> area

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
so it's 112 square inches for the area

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.590 
so it's 112 square inches for the area
so<00:04:26.460> then<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.730> pressure<00:04:27.800> will<00:04:28.800> be<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:29.070> force

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
so then the pressure will be the force

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.970 
so then the pressure will be the force
divided<00:04:30.600> by<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.900> area<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:31.590> that's<00:04:31.770> what

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
divided by the area and that's what

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.040 
divided by the area and that's what
we're<00:04:32.100> trying<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.490> find<00:04:32.760> find<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.780> pressure

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
we're trying to find find the pressure

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.980 
we're trying to find find the pressure
so<00:04:34.980> three<00:04:35.370> thousand<00:04:35.970> five<00:04:36.210> hundred<00:04:36.510> eighty

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
so three thousand five hundred eighty

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.570 
so three thousand five hundred eighty
four<00:04:37.470> pounds<00:04:39.380> divided<00:04:40.380> by<00:04:40.710> a<00:04:41.040> hundred<00:04:41.280> and

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
four pounds divided by a hundred and
