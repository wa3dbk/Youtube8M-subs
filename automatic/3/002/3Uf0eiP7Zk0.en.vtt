00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.790 

when<00:02:46.240> that's<00:02:46.390> done<00:02:46.690> it'll<00:02:46.960> be<00:02:47.050> heat<00:02:47.380> treated

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
when that's done it'll be heat treated

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.010 
when that's done it'll be heat treated
at<00:02:47.980> about<00:02:48.330> 1550<00:02:49.330> degrees

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
shot eight-foot flames to the ceiling so

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.260 
shot eight-foot flames to the ceiling so
this<00:03:01.690> time<00:03:01.900> we<00:03:02.020> were<00:03:02.110> prepared<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:03.150> since<00:03:04.150> we

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
this time we were prepared and since we

we'll<00:03:22.470> be<00:03:22.620> making<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.250> brass<00:03:23.760> hibachi<00:03:24.330> which<00:03:25.019> is

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
we'll be making a brass hibachi which is

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.110 
we'll be making a brass hibachi which is
not<00:03:25.409> a<00:03:25.439> barbecue<00:03:25.860> like<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.430> sounds<00:03:26.879> but

front<00:03:29.519> of<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.450> tsuba<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.230> everything<00:03:31.590> goes

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
front of the tsuba so everything goes

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.680 
front of the tsuba so everything goes
together<00:03:31.950> there

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.750
