blender<00:03:22.910> so<00:03:23.780> you're<00:03:23.959> going<00:03:24.079> to<00:03:24.139> take<00:03:24.350> the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
blender so you're going to take the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.680 
blender so you're going to take the
mixture<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:25.370> you<00:03:26.000> want<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.269> get<00:03:26.329> make<00:03:26.510> sure

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
mixture and you want to get make sure

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.470 
mixture and you want to get make sure
you've<00:03:26.840> got<00:03:26.870> some<00:03:27.109> water<00:03:27.590> in<00:03:28.060> there<00:03:29.060> so<00:03:29.120> that

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
you've got some water in there so that

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.410 
you've got some water in there so that
you<00:03:29.870> don't<00:03:30.459> wreck<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.730> blades<00:03:32.030> on<00:03:32.389> your

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
you don't wreck the blades on your

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.220 
you don't wreck the blades on your
blender

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230

[Music]

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.020 

for<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.560> few<00:03:40.680> seconds

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.580 

so<00:03:47.030> you<00:03:47.090> can<00:03:47.180> see<00:03:47.300> it<00:03:47.360> basically<00:03:47.540> turns<00:03:47.990> all<00:03:48.380> to

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
so you can see it basically turns all to

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.830 
so you can see it basically turns all to
a<00:03:48.620> gray<00:03:48.920> mushy<00:03:49.400> consistency<00:03:49.730> you've<00:03:50.600> got<00:03:50.810> a

a gray mushy consistency you've got a

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.550 
a gray mushy consistency you've got a
few<00:03:51.230> chunks<00:03:51.710> but<00:03:51.980> that's<00:03:52.190> okay<00:03:52.550> for<00:03:52.580> the<00:03:53.120> e/m

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
paper making process and it just sort of

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.610 
paper making process and it just sort of
looks<00:03:56.540> like<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:57.700> really<00:03:58.700> soft<00:03:59.290> with<00:04:00.290> a<00:04:00.350> soft

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
looks like a really soft with a soft

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.920 
looks like a really soft with a soft
fluffy<00:04:01.250> mixture<00:04:01.610> and<00:04:02.980> you<00:04:03.980> can<00:04:04.190> now<00:04:04.790> do<00:04:04.930> the

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
fluffy mixture and you can now do the

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.660 
fluffy mixture and you can now do the
second<00:04:06.260> process<00:04:06.440> by<00:04:06.710> putting<00:04:06.890> your<00:04:07.130> pulp<00:04:07.370> in

second process by putting your pulp in
the<00:04:08.180> other<00:04:08.300> side<00:04:08.540> of<00:04:08.630> your<00:04:08.690> sink<00:04:09.050> or<00:04:09.260> you<00:04:09.290> can

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
the other side of your sink or you can

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.640 
the other side of your sink or you can
just<00:04:09.680> use<00:04:09.850> another<00:04:10.850> tub<00:04:11.300> or<00:04:11.630> Bowl<00:04:12.050> where<00:04:12.500> your

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
just use another tub or Bowl where your

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.880 
just use another tub or Bowl where your
frame<00:04:12.920> will<00:04:13.070> fit<00:04:13.250> into<00:04:13.400> so<00:04:14.270> now<00:04:14.420> that<00:04:14.480> we've

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
frame will fit into so now that we've

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.340 
frame will fit into so now that we've
blended<00:04:15.890> our<00:04:16.250> paper<00:04:16.760> bits<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.989> rule<00:04:18.170> is

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
blended our paper bits and the rule is

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.229 
blended our paper bits and the rule is
about<00:04:18.500> three<00:04:18.980> blender<00:04:19.400> Falls<00:04:19.609> of<00:04:19.760> paper<00:04:20.000> but

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
about three blender Falls of paper but

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.810 
about three blender Falls of paper but
it's<00:04:20.390> really<00:04:20.570> going<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:20.870> be<00:04:20.959> dependent<00:04:21.109> on

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
it's really going to be dependent on

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.040 
it's really going to be dependent on
your<00:04:22.820> reservoir<00:04:23.360> that<00:04:23.690> you're<00:04:23.780> going<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:23.960> be

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
your reservoir that you're going to be

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.230 
your reservoir that you're going to be
filtering<00:04:24.470> through<00:04:24.710> so<00:04:25.040> Katherine<00:04:25.880> you<00:04:26.000> use<00:04:26.210> a

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
filtering through so Katherine you use a

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.660 
filtering through so Katherine you use a
tub<00:04:26.900> here<00:04:27.230> I<00:04:27.410> use<00:04:27.560> it<00:04:27.710> tough<00:04:27.920> and<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.430> depth

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
tub here I use it tough and the depth

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.460 
tub here I use it tough and the depth
you<00:04:28.820> want<00:04:29.030> once<00:04:29.600> we'll<00:04:29.780> talk<00:04:29.930> about<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.200> frame

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
you want once we'll talk about the frame

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.350 
you want once we'll talk about the frame
but<00:04:30.620> once<00:04:30.770> you<00:04:31.010> basically<00:04:31.220> want<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.490> depth

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
but once you basically want the depth

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.150 
but once you basically want the depth
sufficient<00:04:33.080> so<00:04:33.230> the<00:04:33.350> frame<00:04:33.560> will<00:04:33.740> disappear

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
sufficient so the frame will disappear

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.490 
sufficient so the frame will disappear
it<00:04:34.280> will<00:04:34.400> sink<00:04:34.640> inside<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:35.330> yakhni<00:04:35.720> so<00:04:36.230> and

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
it will sink inside and yakhni so and

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.400 
it will sink inside and yakhni so and
onto<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.190> frame<00:04:37.580> so<00:04:38.240> I<00:04:38.270> use<00:04:38.630> mine<00:04:38.840> in<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:39.110> sink

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
onto the frame so I use mine in the sink

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.140 
onto the frame so I use mine in the sink
so<00:04:39.500> I<00:04:39.620> just<00:04:39.830> measured<00:04:40.070> it<00:04:40.400> so<00:04:40.610> that<00:04:40.760> it<00:04:40.880> fits

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
so I just measured it so that it fits

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.150 
so I just measured it so that it fits
the<00:04:41.390> other<00:04:41.570> side<00:04:41.900> of<00:04:42.050> my<00:04:42.200> sink<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.770> frame<00:04:43.040> is

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
the other side of my sink the frame is

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.430 
the other side of my sink the frame is
pretty<00:04:43.280> simple<00:04:43.880> you've<00:04:44.450> got<00:04:44.720> an<00:04:44.960> old<00:04:45.170> it<00:04:45.410> looks

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
pretty simple you've got an old it looks

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.900 
pretty simple you've got an old it looks
like<00:04:45.680> picture<00:04:45.980> frame<00:04:46.190> right<00:04:46.400> an<00:04:46.550> old<00:04:46.700> picture

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
like picture frame right an old picture

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.340 
like picture frame right an old picture
frame<00:04:47.240> as<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:48.200> can<00:04:48.350> see<00:04:48.500> here<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:49.910> need<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.360> go

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
frame as you can see here you need to go

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.890 
frame as you can see here you need to go
and<00:04:51.410> buy<00:04:51.650> some<00:04:52.010> mesh<00:04:52.550> this<00:04:53.210> is<00:04:53.390> from<00:04:53.540> the<00:04:53.630> local

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
and buy some mesh this is from the local

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.350 
and buy some mesh this is from the local
hardware<00:04:54.140> store<00:04:54.530> it's<00:04:55.190> like<00:04:55.340> it's<00:04:55.550> a<00:04:55.760> fabric

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
hardware store it's like it's a fabric

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.770 
hardware store it's like it's a fabric
mesh<00:04:56.740> but<00:04:57.740> I<00:04:57.950> probably<00:04:58.790> recommend<00:04:59.090> if<00:04:59.510> you

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
mesh but I probably recommend if you

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.080 
mesh but I probably recommend if you
can't<00:05:00.050> find<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:00.620> wire<00:05:00.860> mesh<00:05:01.220> the<00:05:01.760> window

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
can't find the wire mesh the window

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.080 
can't find the wire mesh the window
screen<00:05:02.419> mesh<00:05:03.130> it'll<00:05:04.130> mean<00:05:04.370> that<00:05:04.400> when<00:05:04.730> once

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
screen mesh it'll mean that when once

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.850 
screen mesh it'll mean that when once
you<00:05:05.419> actually<00:05:05.780> put<00:05:06.110> on<00:05:06.140> the<00:05:06.380> frame<00:05:06.560> it<00:05:06.680> won't

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
you actually put on the frame it won't

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.920 
you actually put on the frame it won't
stretch<00:05:07.220> and<00:05:07.610> sag<00:05:07.910> and<00:05:08.270> this<00:05:08.450> stage<00:05:08.660> as<00:05:08.780> well

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
stretch and sag and this stage as well

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.720 
stretch and sag and this stage as well
this<00:05:09.110> when<00:05:09.260> you<00:05:09.320> want<00:05:09.440> to<00:05:09.470> add<00:05:09.590> the<00:05:09.710> seeds<00:05:10.010> the

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
this when you want to add the seeds the

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:11.830 
this when you want to add the seeds the
others<00:05:10.940> it's<00:05:11.060> blended<00:05:11.480> you've<00:05:11.630> done<00:05:11.750> the

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
others it's blended you've done the

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.320 
others it's blended you've done the
blending<00:05:12.230> and<00:05:12.380> now<00:05:12.830> you<00:05:12.890> have<00:05:13.280> had<00:05:13.940> the<00:05:14.090> seeds

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
blending and now you have had the seeds

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.909 
blending and now you have had the seeds
ready<00:05:14.570> for<00:05:14.750> this<00:05:14.840> you<00:05:15.290> want<00:05:15.440> the<00:05:15.530> seats<00:05:15.710> to<00:05:15.830> be

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
ready for this you want the seats to be

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.290 
ready for this you want the seats to be
quite<00:05:16.100> flat<00:05:16.430> right<00:05:16.790> you<00:05:16.940> don't<00:05:17.060> want

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
quite flat right you don't want

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.360 
quite flat right you don't want

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
paper and you use any rule of thumb as

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.030 
paper and you use any rule of thumb as
far<00:05:22.340> as<00:05:22.520> measuring<00:05:23.169> how<00:05:24.169> much<00:05:24.320> you<00:05:24.530> put<00:05:24.710> in<00:05:24.830> I

far as measuring how much you put in I

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.430 
far as measuring how much you put in I
don't<00:05:25.940> know<00:05:26.300> I<00:05:26.330> don't<00:05:26.660> think<00:05:26.750> so<00:05:27.020> me<00:05:27.080> you<00:05:27.290> can

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
don't know I don't think so me you can

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.610 
do it use your eye and judge it yeah a
couple<00:05:29.419> packets<00:05:29.780> was<00:05:29.930> it<00:05:30.020> sufficient<00:05:30.470> with

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
couple packets was it sufficient with

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.640 
couple packets was it sufficient with
that<00:05:30.740> depth<00:05:31.040> a<00:05:31.330> better<00:05:32.330> spoon<00:05:32.900> yep<00:05:33.230> that's

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
that depth a better spoon yep that's

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
put it this way around they're going to

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.239 
put it this way around they're going to
be<00:05:37.760> collecting<00:05:38.210> it<00:05:38.330> on<00:05:38.540> the<00:05:39.380> surface

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:41.249 
be collecting it on the surface

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:43.959 
be collecting it on the surface
is<00:05:41.459> here<00:05:41.909> you<00:05:42.119> want<00:05:42.299> to<00:05:42.389> put<00:05:42.509> it<00:05:42.599> right<00:05:42.629> inside

the screen we'll get it to lift if it

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.369 
the screen we'll get it to lift if it
doesn't<00:06:21.029> lift<00:06:21.209> off<00:06:21.419> really<00:06:21.809> easily<00:06:22.049> it<00:06:22.349> just

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:22.379 
doesn't lift off really easily it just
