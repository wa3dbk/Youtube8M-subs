how to fly with these little micro quads

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.740 
how to fly with these little micro quads
you<00:04:20.519> can<00:04:20.669> crash<00:04:20.940> them<00:04:21.209> tear<00:04:21.419> them<00:04:21.539> I'm<00:04:21.599> pretty

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
you can crash them tear them I'm pretty

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.600 
you can crash them tear them I'm pretty
bad<00:04:22.019> they<00:04:22.409> take<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.860> licking<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.430> they<00:04:23.490> keep

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
coming back so this would be my

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.620 
coming back so this would be my
recommendation<00:04:26.400> there's<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.330> lot<00:04:27.419> of<00:04:27.509> other
