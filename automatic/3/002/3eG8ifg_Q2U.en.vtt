friends and let's get digging on this is
really<00:00:23.180> interesting<00:00:23.419> changes<00:00:24.259> to<00:00:24.410> the

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
really interesting changes to the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.220 
really interesting changes to the
existing<00:00:24.650> ruins<00:00:25.460> a<00:00:25.550> bit<00:00:25.730> and<00:00:25.939> I'm<00:00:26.930> really

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
existing ruins a bit and I'm really

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.900 
existing ruins a bit and I'm really
looking<00:00:27.529> forward<00:00:27.560> to<00:00:27.950> these<00:00:28.099> changes<00:00:28.369> because

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
looking forward to these changes because

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.819 
looking forward to these changes because
some<00:00:29.119> of<00:00:29.149> the<00:00:29.329> sets<00:00:29.599> are<00:00:29.810> going<00:00:30.230> to<00:00:30.380> become

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
some of the sets are going to become

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.409 
some of the sets are going to become
more<00:00:30.860> balanced<00:00:31.550> than<00:00:31.640> some<00:00:31.939> of<00:00:32.059> these<00:00:32.149> changes

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
more balanced than some of these changes

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.299 
more balanced than some of these changes
are<00:00:32.720> going<00:00:33.440> to<00:00:33.500> make<00:00:33.620> us<00:00:33.860> some<00:00:34.130> of<00:00:34.160> the

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
are going to make us some of the

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.120 
are going to make us some of the
existing<00:00:34.610> ones<00:00:34.910> weaker<00:00:35.239> okay<00:00:35.630> and<00:00:35.890> right<00:00:36.890> it's

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
existing ones weaker okay and right it's

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.069 
existing ones weaker okay and right it's
going<00:00:37.309> to<00:00:37.370> do<00:00:37.520> a<00:00:37.790> thirty<00:00:38.090> percent<00:00:38.420> off<00:00:38.629> rune<00:00:38.929> I

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
going to do a thirty percent off rune I

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.529 
going to do a thirty percent off rune I
people<00:00:39.559> sale<00:00:39.859> that<00:00:40.129> will<00:00:40.280> last<00:00:40.460> from<00:00:40.699> this

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:41.539

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
you know let's get started digging on

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.130 
you know let's get started digging on
the<00:00:49.429> changes<00:00:49.910> actually<00:00:50.089> of<00:00:50.480> what<00:00:50.690> this<00:00:50.899> patch

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
the changes actually of what this patch

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.720 
the changes actually of what this patch
will<00:00:51.379> bring<00:00:51.589> and<00:00:51.800> starting<00:00:52.160> with<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.429> seals

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
will bring and starting with the seals

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.549 
will bring and starting with the seals
on<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:54.320> flat<00:00:54.559> armors<00:00:55.039> have<00:00:55.280> been<00:00:55.519> reduced<00:00:55.940> on

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
on the flat armors have been reduced on

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.759 
on the flat armors have been reduced on
quite<00:00:57.559> a<00:00:57.589> lot<00:00:57.829> so<00:00:58.429> from<00:00:58.969> around<00:00:59.929> 13<00:01:00.409> armor

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
quite a lot so from around 13 armor

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.720 
quite a lot so from around 13 armor
rounded<00:01:01.219> up<00:01:01.370> um<00:01:01.749> 49<00:01:02.749> seals<00:01:03.109> you<00:01:03.440> get<00:01:03.649> now<00:01:04.400> nine

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
rounded up um 49 seals you get now nine

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.810 
rounded up um 49 seals you get now nine
armor<00:01:05.059> instead<00:01:05.540> of<00:01:05.570> 13<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:06.400> so<00:01:07.400> with<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:07.670> one

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
armor instead of 13 and so with the one

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.440 
armor instead of 13 and so with the one
armor<00:01:08.210> /<00:01:08.840> rune<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:09.620> this<00:01:10.520> will<00:01:10.759> automatically

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
armor / rune and this will automatically

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.550 
armor / rune and this will automatically
mean<00:01:11.780> that<00:01:11.829> armor<00:01:12.829> flats<00:01:13.220> are<00:01:13.640> no<00:01:14.420> longer<00:01:14.689> the

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
mean that armor flats are no longer the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.109 
mean that armor flats are no longer the
initial<00:01:16.100> choice<00:01:16.340> anymore<00:01:17.060> I<00:01:17.470> feel<00:01:18.700> it's<00:01:19.700> it's

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
initial choice anymore I feel it's it's

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.810 
initial choice anymore I feel it's it's
actually<00:01:20.630> not<00:01:20.780> anymore<00:01:21.200> so<00:01:21.469> good<00:01:21.710> because<00:01:22.250> all

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
actually not anymore so good because all

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.240 
actually not anymore so good because all
champions<00:01:23.210> will<00:01:23.659> gain<00:01:23.930> for<00:01:24.380> base<00:01:24.710> armory

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
champions will gain for base armory

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.020 
champions will gain for base armory
compensation<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:27.140> it's<00:01:28.100> not<00:01:28.340> that<00:01:28.610> much<00:01:28.640> you

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
compensation so it's not that much you

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.240 
compensation so it's not that much you
benefit<00:01:29.450> from<00:01:29.479> it<00:01:29.840> anymore<00:01:30.259> as<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:31.100> did

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
benefit from it anymore as you did

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.030 
benefit from it anymore as you did
before<00:01:31.930> this<00:01:32.930> is<00:01:33.020> really<00:01:33.140> good<00:01:33.380> for<00:01:33.530> junglers

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
before this is really good for junglers

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.279 
before this is really good for junglers
who<00:01:34.579> want<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:35.060> really<00:01:35.270> big<00:01:35.539> something<00:01:35.780> else<00:01:36.110> on

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
who want to really big something else on

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.980 
who want to really big something else on
the<00:01:36.380> jungle<00:01:36.829> maybe<00:01:37.520> health<00:01:37.880> or<00:01:38.149> health<00:01:38.689> region

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
the jungle maybe health or health region

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.399 
the jungle maybe health or health region
and<00:01:40.000> here<00:01:41.000> we<00:01:41.149> come<00:01:41.329> the<00:01:41.479> scaling<00:01:41.899> armor<00:01:42.229> I

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
and here we come the scaling armor I

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.800 
and here we come the scaling armor I
talked<00:01:43.100> about<00:01:43.219> this<00:01:43.549> before<00:01:43.759> but<00:01:44.240> I<00:01:44.299> like

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
talked about this before but I like

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.389 
talked about this before but I like
these<00:01:45.020> runes<00:01:45.289> i'm<00:01:45.500> glad<00:01:45.740> i<00:01:45.770> bought<00:01:46.159> them

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
these runes i'm glad i bought them

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.760 
these runes i'm glad i bought them
because<00:01:46.579> they're<00:01:46.939> now<00:01:47.119> bust<00:01:47.450> um<00:01:47.750> i<00:01:48.710> really

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
because they're now bust um i really

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.709 
because they're now bust um i really
feel<00:01:49.399> the<00:01:49.609> scaling<00:01:50.000> armor<00:01:50.299> is<00:01:50.359> going<00:01:50.539> to<00:01:50.630> be

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:50.719 
feel the scaling armor is going to be

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.090 
feel the scaling armor is going to be
really<00:01:51.020> good<00:01:51.049> on<00:01:51.289> the<00:01:51.409> jungle<00:01:51.770> right<00:01:51.890> now

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
really good on the jungle right now

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.980 
really good on the jungle right now
because<00:01:52.759> you<00:01:52.880> get<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.119> four<00:01:53.359> base<00:01:53.570> audrey

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
because you get the four base audrey

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.459 
because you get the four base audrey
bonus<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:54.759> you<00:01:55.759> get<00:01:55.969> a<00:01:56.000> higher<00:01:56.329> armor<00:01:56.930> from

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
bonus and you get a higher armor from

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.800 
bonus and you get a higher armor from
the<00:01:57.590> scaling<00:01:58.100> arm<00:01:58.250> around<00:01:58.520> three<00:01:59.240> points<00:01:59.659> is

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
the scaling arm around three points is

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.349 
the scaling arm around three points is
actually<00:02:00.289> quite<00:02:00.439> a<00:02:00.530> lot<00:02:00.799> and<00:02:01.039> this<00:02:02.000> could<00:02:02.149> mean

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
actually quite a lot and this could mean

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.270 
actually quite a lot and this could mean
that<00:02:02.659> scaling<00:02:03.020> armor<00:02:03.469> is<00:02:03.560> going<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.859> be<00:02:03.979> very

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
that scaling armor is going to be very

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.300 
that scaling armor is going to be very
likely<00:02:04.579> to<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:05.030> scene<00:02:05.240> on<00:02:05.270> meta<00:02:05.630> kompis

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
likely to the scene on meta kompis

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.550 
likely to the scene on meta kompis
composites<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.579> i<00:02:07.670> expect<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.810> see<00:02:08.929> an<00:02:09.020> LCS

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
composites and i expect to see an LCS

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.530 
composites and i expect to see an LCS
and<00:02:09.890> expect<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.280> see<00:02:10.490> in<00:02:10.580> many<00:02:10.729> bills<00:02:11.030> i<00:02:11.300> feel

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
and expect to see in many bills i feel

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.080 
and expect to see in many bills i feel
scaling<00:02:11.990> armor<00:02:12.380> is<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:13.250> thing<00:02:13.460> right<00:02:13.670> now<00:02:13.730> I

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
scaling armor is the thing right now I

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.810 
scaling armor is the thing right now I
would<00:02:14.330> probably<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:15.410> have<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.040> do<00:02:16.160> some<00:02:16.370> testing

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
would probably I have to do some testing

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.230 
would probably I have to do some testing
but<00:02:17.030> I<00:02:17.090> feel<00:02:17.420> scaling<00:02:17.840> armor

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
but I feel scaling armor

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.030 
but I feel scaling armor
going<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.510> be<00:02:18.630> eighty<00:02:19.260> percent<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.920> cases

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
going to be eighty percent of the cases

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.700 
going to be eighty percent of the cases
better<00:02:20.430> than<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.730> fly<00:02:20.910> armor<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.560> then<00:02:22.560> we

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
better than the fly armor and then we

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.000 
better than the fly armor and then we
got<00:02:22.860> changes<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.640> flat<00:02:24.060> health<00:02:24.770> of<00:02:25.770> this

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
got changes to the flat health of this

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.370 
got changes to the flat health of this
is<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.160> huge<00:02:26.490> boost<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:27.120> guess<00:02:27.660> like<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.930> champion

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
is a huge boost I guess like a champion

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.320 
is a huge boost I guess like a champion
like<00:02:28.590> Sona<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:29.220> really<00:02:29.490> benefit<00:02:29.880> from<00:02:29.940> having

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
like Sona can really benefit from having

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.520 
like Sona can really benefit from having
flat<00:02:30.720> nine<00:02:30.930> steals<00:02:31.350> I'm<00:02:32.030> 72<00:02:33.030> from<00:02:33.480> 48<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.290> a

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
flat nine steals I'm 72 from 48 is a

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.790 
flat nine steals I'm 72 from 48 is a
huge<00:02:34.890> difference<00:02:35.160> I<00:02:35.640> feel<00:02:36.540> honestly<00:02:37.080> that

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
huge difference I feel honestly that

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.500 
huge difference I feel honestly that
this<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.190> going<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.430> make<00:02:38.550> a<00:02:38.610> huge<00:02:38.880> impact<00:02:39.000> for

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
this is going to make a huge impact for

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.350 
this is going to make a huge impact for
those<00:02:39.720> squishy<00:02:40.050> champions<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:41.000> still<00:02:42.000> not<00:02:42.180> sure

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
those squishy champions I still not sure

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.150 
those squishy champions I still not sure
that<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.540> want<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.870> choose<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.230> from<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.980> side

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
that I want to choose it from the side

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.010 
that I want to choose it from the side
of<00:02:44.190> armor<00:02:44.730> but<00:02:45.180> those<00:02:45.360> who<00:02:45.510> don't<00:02:45.720> want<00:02:45.840> to

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
of armor but those who don't want to

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.810 
of armor but those who don't want to
choose<00:02:46.230> scaling<00:02:46.710> armor<00:02:47.070> can't<00:02:47.520> just<00:02:47.700> take

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
choose scaling armor can't just take

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.050 
choose scaling armor can't just take
health<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:48.810> great<00:02:49.050> for<00:02:49.080> it<00:02:49.910> then<00:02:50.910> we

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
health and this is great for it then we

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.180 
health and this is great for it then we
are<00:02:51.150> scaling<00:02:51.630> health<00:02:51.840> which<00:02:52.530> pretty<00:02:52.830> pretty

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
are scaling health which pretty pretty

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.790 
are scaling health which pretty pretty
much<00:02:53.400> means<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.970> well<00:02:54.690> it's<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.290> same<00:02:55.320> thing

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
much means that well it's the same thing

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.060 
much means that well it's the same thing
everything<00:02:56.430> about<00:02:56.670> but<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.780> feel<00:02:58.200> scheming

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
everything about but I feel scheming

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.610 
everything about but I feel scheming
health<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.370> also<00:02:59.760> good<00:02:59.970> bye<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:00.870> roll<00:03:01.350> it's

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
health is also good bye you roll it's

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.770 
health is also good bye you roll it's
really<00:03:01.980> need<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.310> look<00:03:02.550> at<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:03.150> early<00:03:03.630> numbers

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
really need to look at the early numbers

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.800 
really need to look at the early numbers
can<00:03:04.740> you<00:03:04.890> really<00:03:05.070> you<00:03:06.060> know<00:03:06.180> in<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:06.420> specific

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
can you really you know in a specific

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.170 
can you really you know in a specific
jungle<00:03:07.470> can<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.130> really<00:03:08.310> sustain<00:03:08.880> with

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
jungle can you really sustain with

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.120 
jungle can you really sustain with
scaling<00:03:09.570> help<00:03:09.780> at<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.140> moment<00:03:10.500> I<00:03:10.620> don't<00:03:10.680> think

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
scaling help at the moment I don't think

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.810 
scaling help at the moment I don't think
so<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.660> Hills<00:03:12.660> region<00:03:13.050> is<00:03:13.500> buffed<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:14.790> a

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
so and Hills region is buffed this is a

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.030 
so and Hills region is buffed this is a
great<00:03:15.030> thing<00:03:15.270> I<00:03:16.080> don't<00:03:16.500> think<00:03:16.680> it's<00:03:16.830> still

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
great thing I don't think it's still

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.820 
great thing I don't think it's still
that<00:03:17.640> very<00:03:17.940> strong<00:03:18.330> though<00:03:18.570> I<00:03:18.840> still<00:03:19.590> prefer

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
that very strong though I still prefer

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.310 
that very strong though I still prefer
the<00:03:20.400> other<00:03:20.580> four<00:03:20.970> maybe<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.630> armor<00:03:21.930> one<00:03:22.110> is

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
the other four maybe the armor one is

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.530 
the other four maybe the armor one is
kind<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.770> falling<00:03:23.100> off<00:03:23.250> but<00:03:23.550> every<00:03:24.210> chain<00:03:24.420> is

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
kind of falling off but every chain is

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.690 
kind of falling off but every chain is
extremely<00:03:25.050> like<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.230> situational<00:03:26.160> maybe<00:03:26.430> for

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
extremely like a situational maybe for

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.120 
extremely like a situational maybe for
support<00:03:27.210> I<00:03:27.330> would<00:03:27.480> choose<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.380> that's<00:03:28.920> for

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
support I would choose it and that's for

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.040 
support I would choose it and that's for
scared<00:03:29.400> us<00:03:29.610> were<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.880> seagulls<00:03:30.270> and<00:03:30.420> overall

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
scared us were the seagulls and overall

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.570 
scared us were the seagulls and overall
I'm<00:03:31.230> really<00:03:31.470> pleased<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:32.220> these<00:03:32.370> changes

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
I'm really pleased that these changes

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.630 
I'm really pleased that these changes
are<00:03:32.850> happening<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.800> we<00:03:34.800> will<00:03:34.980> see<00:03:35.190> what<00:03:35.370> will

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
are happening and we will see what will

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.760 
are happening and we will see what will
happen<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.120> middle<00:03:36.450> game<00:03:36.600> then<00:03:37.530> we<00:03:37.620> go<00:03:37.740> to

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
happen to the middle game then we go to

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.610 
happen to the middle game then we go to
cliffs<00:03:38.130> pretty<00:03:38.790> much<00:03:39.000> all<00:03:39.300> CDR<00:03:40.170> wounds<00:03:40.380> are

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
cliffs pretty much all CDR wounds are

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.910 
cliffs pretty much all CDR wounds are
buffed<00:03:41.310> um<00:03:41.580> I<00:03:42.360> felt<00:03:42.720> really<00:03:43.200> strongly<00:03:43.650> that

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
buffed um I felt really strongly that

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.520 
buffed um I felt really strongly that
they<00:03:44.190> weren't<00:03:44.430> like<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.780> most<00:03:46.080> best

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
they weren't like the most best

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.710 
they weren't like the most best
situation<00:03:47.340> on<00:03:48.320> at<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:50.040> moment<00:03:50.330> this<00:03:51.330> is<00:03:51.510> like

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
situation on at the moment this is like

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.050 
situation on at the moment this is like
fifteen<00:03:52.230> percent<00:03:52.590> at<00:03:52.770> level<00:03:53.070> 18<00:03:53.460> is<00:03:53.670> really

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
fifteen percent at level 18 is really

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.270 
fifteen percent at level 18 is really
strong<00:03:54.300> there's<00:03:55.260> certain<00:03:55.650> job<00:03:55.830> is<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.100> really

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
strong there's certain job is to really

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.880 
strong there's certain job is to really
benefit<00:03:56.730> from<00:03:56.790> this<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.420> you<00:03:57.930> can<00:03:57.960> skip<00:03:58.410> out<00:03:58.590> a

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
benefit from this and you can skip out a

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.700 
benefit from this and you can skip out a
whole<00:03:59.460> new<00:03:59.820> item<00:04:00.210> do<00:04:00.780> need<00:04:01.050> to<00:04:01.230> build<00:04:01.500> like<00:04:01.680> a

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
whole new item do need to build like a

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.950

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
region's it's not too huge then we have

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
scaling mana regen gun the same thing

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.900 
scaling mana regen gun the same thing
the<00:04:55.560> numbers<00:04:55.860> up<00:04:55.980> with<00:04:56.100> better<00:04:56.310> scaling<00:04:56.790> I

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
the numbers up with better scaling I

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.970 
the numbers up with better scaling I
guess<00:04:57.090> from<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.540> scalp<00:04:58.139> to<00:04:58.410> go<00:04:58.680> back<00:04:58.860> to<00:04:58.950> the

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
guess from the scalp to go back to the

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.750 
guess from the scalp to go back to the
flats<00:04:59.280> but<00:05:00.030> I<00:05:00.090> still<00:05:00.450> strongly<00:05:00.990> feel<00:05:01.410> that<00:05:01.760> um

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
flats but I still strongly feel that um

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.420 
flats but I still strongly feel that um
it's<00:05:03.690> it's<00:05:04.440> not<00:05:04.710> going<00:05:04.889> to<00:05:04.979> be<00:05:05.100> better<00:05:05.310> than

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
it's it's not going to be better than

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.550 
it's it's not going to be better than
the<00:05:05.669> scale<00:05:05.880> in<00:05:06.030> magic<00:05:06.300> wisdom<00:05:06.600> so<00:05:06.720> CDR<00:05:07.229> at<00:05:07.410> the

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
the scale in magic wisdom so CDR at the

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.409 
the scale in magic wisdom so CDR at the
moment<00:05:07.950> I<00:05:08.070> think<00:05:08.310> the<00:05:08.580> CDR<00:05:08.970> is<00:05:09.030> going<00:05:09.240> to<00:05:09.300> be<00:05:09.389> a

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
moment I think the CDR is going to be a

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.250 
moment I think the CDR is going to be a
huge<00:05:09.660> thing<00:05:10.020> for<00:05:10.080> supports<00:05:10.770> at<00:05:10.919> the<00:05:11.070> moment

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
huge thing for supports at the moment

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.650 
huge thing for supports at the moment
then<00:05:13.260> we<00:05:13.380> go<00:05:13.470> to<00:05:13.500> Clinton<00:05:14.190> says<00:05:14.460> I'm<00:05:14.880> same

then we go to Clinton says I'm same

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.140

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
something for the scaling cooldown

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.810 
something for the scaling cooldown
reduction<00:05:40.220> kind<00:05:41.220> of<00:05:41.280> have<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.400> play<00:05:41.669> around

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
reduction kind of have to play around

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.000

but<00:05:42.630> these<00:05:42.780> are<00:05:42.930> really<00:05:43.110> big<00:05:43.289> numbers<00:05:43.740> like

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
but these are really big numbers like

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.550

three<00:05:44.340> cuentas<00:05:44.880> is<00:05:45.030> fifty<00:05:45.390> percent<00:05:45.720> level<00:05:46.080> 18

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
three cuentas is fifty percent level 18

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.800 
three cuentas is fifty percent level 18
you<00:05:47.130> get<00:05:47.280> thirty<00:05:47.520> percent<00:05:47.940> from<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.270> clips

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
you get thirty percent from the clips
