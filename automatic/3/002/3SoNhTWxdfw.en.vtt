00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
generator we're going to spawn some

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.789 
generator we're going to spawn some
enemies<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.030> then<00:00:09.150> fight<00:00:09.450> them<00:00:09.690> so<00:00:10.349> basically

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:10.799

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
we'll add a trigger or a button will go

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.519 
we'll add a trigger or a button will go
with<00:00:26.400> basically<00:00:26.759> trigger<00:00:27.000> because<00:00:27.330> easy<00:00:27.660> easy

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
with basically trigger because easy easy

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.980

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
when we step on this button as linked up

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.020 
when we step on this button as linked up
pistol<00:01:29.159> man<00:01:29.310> will<00:01:29.430> appear<00:01:29.490> everytime<00:01:29.820> we

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
let's get rid of them now so that's

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.139 
let's get rid of them now so that's
basically<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.409> that's<00:01:34.979> how<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.250> spawn<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.000> me

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
basically it that's how you spawn and me

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.240 
basically it that's how you spawn and me
very<00:01:36.780> simple<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:37.710> hook<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.860> up<00:01:38.040> to

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
very simple so you can hook that up to

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.819 
very simple so you can hook that up to
anything<00:01:38.579> really<00:01:39.030> any<00:01:39.329> kind<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.200> action<00:01:40.619> that

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
anything really any kind of action that

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.399 
anything really any kind of action that
is<00:01:41.130> associated<00:01:41.579> with<00:01:42.149> our<00:01:42.810> doing<00:01:43.079> something

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
is associated with our doing something

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.319 
is associated with our doing something
so<00:01:43.590> easy<00:01:43.979> now<00:01:44.579> we're<00:01:44.909> going<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.090> get<00:01:45.149> rid<00:01:45.299> of

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
so easy now we're going to get rid of

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.330 
so easy now we're going to get rid of
we're<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.630> make<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.960> button<00:01:46.340> remove

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
we're going to make this button remove

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.370

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
also remove all was always at the bottom

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.350 
also remove all was always at the bottom
to<00:01:50.070> cycle<00:01:50.460> through<00:01:50.490> everything<00:01:50.850> that

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
to cycle through everything that

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.740 
to cycle through everything that
literally<00:01:51.689> die<00:01:52.020> there<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.530> BAM<00:01:53.479> so<00:01:54.479> we<00:01:54.630> have

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
literally die there it is BAM so we have

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.959 
literally die there it is BAM so we have
one<00:01:54.930> button<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.229> was<00:01:55.439> spawning<00:01:55.799> me<00:01:56.100> another

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
one button that was spawning me another

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.789 
one button that was spawning me another
button<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.420> will<00:01:57.450> remove<00:01:57.930> them<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.680> these

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
button that will remove them so these

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.760 
button that will remove them so these
three<00:01:59.009> guys<00:01:59.250> running<00:01:59.670> around<00:02:00.259> if<00:02:01.259> we<00:02:01.409> step<00:02:01.619> on
