00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.030
 Hi everyone, I'm back at last e 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.210
 I wanted to tell you the fact that we have 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.300
 decided that from now on we will do only 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.760
 video on expansion reviews 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.210
 stan speck and scenarios that will come from 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.980
 now on then you can finally 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.740
 see me again I solved all the problems 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.320
 that I had with the camera 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.510
 I had the exams then this video 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.170
 theoretically he had to leave the week 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.719
 therefore, the idea of today does nothing 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.079
 speaks from there with dances than a scenario 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.870
 released about a week or two ago in 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.840
 our official website you can 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.309
 find them and nothing will leave you to the video 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.890
 well first of all let's create ours 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.890
 sim very very fast 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.729
 then I'll show you the clothes 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.710
 that we find in this scenario is for 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.070
 gifts that men do not pay attention to 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.070
 photo 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.820
 at this point we can then start 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:25.390
 to play in our scenario we can 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:32.590
 quickly see the center and the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:33.870
 periphery in my opinion is taken care of in 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.840
 minimum details 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:45.810
 I really like the setting now the 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:56.160
 center more closely with this river 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:56.160
 next and then we move on to the pool 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.180
 then we have the library where inside 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.240
 found some movies also were not 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:08.950
 dressed in medieval style but okay 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.370
 center with this huge fountain 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.990
 this is a very nice beauty center 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.060
 I really like the cured school 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:21.850
 very much that you find a little bit in 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:24.190
 suburbs and then some very nice things 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:29.910
 this is a villa the largest villa 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.910
 that I saw the cemetery 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.530
 the den of criminals that is found 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.320
 on the other side of the mountain and then 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.500
 some interiors of the premises we have gods 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.750
 snack bar pubs inside only 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.010
 all own medieval style with all 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:51.300
 these chairs the tables the counters all the 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.300
 very beautiful wood 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.080
 then we can admire 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.920
 very dark night with these street lights 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.170
 that do not illuminate much 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.000
 now let's go see the dragons instead 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.150
 first of all we have to buy eggs 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.640
 and then we have to talk to these eggs 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.340
 since when from the moment we start a 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.140
 talk must pass five hours earlier 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.880
 they hatch depending 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.700
 of the interaction then of what 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.190
 we talk to that place 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.900
 a different colored dragon will succeed 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.340
 after five hours the cloud will arrive 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.280
 with written what place you are going to 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.390
 then it opens and then opens up 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.030
 our rago with this dragon we can 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.060
 talk we can feed him 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.739
 make it fly or other important fact 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.989
 that we have to put a food if 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.670
 we neighbors can steal it and now you 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.769
 I show the three types of lake and the 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.209
 differences the purple dragon that can 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.040
 summon a friend to summon another 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.040
 symbol cast an enchantment the only one 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.670
 the red dragon they throw 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.860
 between fire to a person or throw a 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.900
 fiery torment and the green dragon that 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.470
 instead it evokes a treasure or collects 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.470
 plants 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.550
 but the entrance to do it of mine 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.650
 opinions 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.669
 when this scenario there are two things 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.159
 that I didn't like 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.440
 the first is the fact that dragons do not 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:32.780
 they are considered as animals 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.659
 I understand this because we have the 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.180
 handle and there are only between dogs and 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:40.940
 horses however the thing is that if we 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.960
 we buy new then we also turn off the 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.400
 money this man opens up and the dragon 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.229
 we do not put the inventory me 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.610
 let's say to wave for home then 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.960
 a neighbor comes that I am putting 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.629
 become us that stretch we don't see 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.419
 more and therefore it is a strange thing 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:58.849
 you could make the dragon 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.129
 even if he stayed around the house 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:03.560
 You did n't steal me from the neighbors in this one 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:06.889
 so this is the first thing then the 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.909
 depending on the fact that they make a neighborhood 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:13.270
 all in medieval style then houses in 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:19.190
 medieval style medieval style shops 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:21.139
 sim model medieval clothes and then the 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:25.039
 movie comes out with the smartphone 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:28.009
 or the TV or we go to the library 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.719
 all in medieval style is the computer 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.699
 I also understand this could not 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:35.539
 make a medieval style scenario 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:38.120
 Getting things accomplished all machines 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.020
 electronic, however, at this point 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.610
 what does it do 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.910
 a medieval style neighborhood if then 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.620
 there is this mixture of things I am 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.050
 I imagine a person who bought himself 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.909
 staff katy perry and then from around 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.550
 for the dragon district evil a 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:55.680
 put the trees with candies who 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.560
 has all the print expansion has not 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.930
 something harmonious because they are there 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.030
 of the pec stocks that must be 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.220
 used alone and very good to 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.810
 others and it's a bad thing 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.960
 so at this point why do this 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:13.409
 neighborhood is ok is taken care of very much in the 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:16.229
 least details this 0 still environment 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:18.710
 option but there is this mixture of 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.550
 things that I obviously don't like 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.210
 this is my opinion 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.759
 then, if a person wants it, great re yes 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.800
 everyone does as he wishes with this he concludes 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:30.539
 you can find it as I said in the 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.969
 the sims 3 official website in the store 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:34.800
 and nothing 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:37.289
 the next video will hopefully come out in 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.509
 far as possible so maybe 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:42.590
 next week the first will see each other again 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:42.590
 hello soon
