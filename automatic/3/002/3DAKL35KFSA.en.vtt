00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
 we have 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.279
 and 450 that does not turn on 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.760
 it does not turn on it heats up some areas 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:16.990
 of water and when we connect it to the 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.440
 power supply to the source 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.440
 regular 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.810
 only with 1.58 then look at the consumption 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.480
 that has have milliamps to only 1.6 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.340
 volts then there is a short enough 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.790
 serious and we're going to analyze what we find 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.650
 and here we see that there is a behavior 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.510
 normal in many capacitors without 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.510
 continuity from side to side to ground 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.590
 two 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.260
 on both sides and in continuous earth what 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.399
 which indigent imported 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.399
 quite serious 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.480
 heymann 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.260
 and by other sectors what I see what 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.769
 I see here analyzing the water is that where 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.769
 it sank 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:12.130
 I'm not saying a diode 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.040
 voltage regulator then it is 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.400
 started, the most probable thing is that 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.080
 burst or that at one stroke 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.230
 ripped and that short because it 's 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.630
 period that we see here protective is in 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.120
 Court also has continuity to both 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.340
 sides and this is a positive line one 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.990
 voltage line what what it will do 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.070
 all circuits and will not stop 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.140
 function 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.350
 I'm going to remove this piece of me there 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.240
 here and let's see if we have a solution if 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.120
 we have solutions because it started and 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.950
 it became internally and this will cut 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.050
 serves as a reference to know that a 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.450
 diode when they fall short of both 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.760
 sides would also block many 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.360
 circuits that there are and components that in 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.210
 At the same hour 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.340
 here has applied applied fruit plus and 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.350
 let's try to remove those pieces 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.640
 of 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.780
 Y 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.780
 let's warm up 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.400
 and there remove the piece 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.400
 and let's see if I understand 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.940
 and the problem is because the line 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.740
 true the positive line of the battery 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.600
 is short this earth is the 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.390
 positive is the second negative what 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.460
 shows the battery and after that 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.320
 remove the diode remove the other diode 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.150
 protector has removed several circuits 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.880
 that have been short on the line 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.650
 true and can not give solution even 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.959
 here I have some I disconnect them from the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.410
 positive line the wii the balances and not 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.810
 I was wearing several even some already 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.240
 I disconnected them and the fault was was in 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.550
 this capacitor that we see here is the one 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.730
 it has me in short the entire line have 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.160
 short as 20 or 25 circuits and only 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.230
 disconnecting and changing we are going to 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.300
 get solution 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.000
 a phone that served us that did not 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.709
 lit for nothing after you 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.909
 we remove the condenser that is in 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.909
 short in the line habitat 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.740
 comes back to life and works again 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.020
 to charge the customer 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.510
 I just wanted to get the 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.180
 capacitor again good 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.829
 even here it works without him but 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.870
 remember that one's capacitors 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.659
 they are supporting the circuit 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.940
 some are filtering some 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.370
 signals 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.280
 and help in some circuits to the 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.140
 discharge of some voltages and then 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.970
 lighting announcing perfectly is 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.160
 well that heated after only 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.010
 let it have a consumption of 1.6 in the 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.450
 arauca helpful food source
