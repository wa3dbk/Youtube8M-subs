00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
tree like so basically what you do is

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.920 
tree like so basically what you do is
you<00:01:35.070> right<00:01:35.310> click<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.540> can<00:01:36.720> set<00:01:36.900> a

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
frequency so i'm up at this Frank would

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.649 
frequency so i'm up at this Frank would
see<00:01:39.869> as<00:01:40.020> 10<00:01:40.500> ok<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.369> then<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.299> come<00:01:42.420> over<00:01:42.509> to

see as 10 ok and then I come over to
this<00:01:42.810> one<00:01:42.990> over<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:44.600> i'm<00:01:45.600> going<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.780> set

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
this one over here and i'm going to set

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.450 
this one over here and i'm going to set
a<00:01:45.960> different<00:01:46.170> frequency<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.159> i'm<00:01:47.250> gonna<00:01:47.340> put

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
a different frequency so i'm gonna put

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.960 
a different frequency so i'm gonna put
it<00:01:47.579> at<00:01:47.670> one<00:01:48.079> now<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.140> use<00:01:49.500> your<00:01:49.619> detonator

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
it at one now you use your detonator

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.380 
it at one now you use your detonator
which<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.299> new<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.110> mod<00:01:52.350> also<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.390> you

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
which is new to this mod also and you

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.090 
which is new to this mod also and you
type<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.750> frequency<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.560> i<00:01:55.799> want<00:01:56.070> to

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
type in the frequency so i want to

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.380 
type in the frequency so i want to
detonate<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.670> wild<00:01:56.909> left<00:01:57.149> which<00:01:57.360> was

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
detonate the wild left which was

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.899 
detonate the wild left which was
frequency<00:01:57.990> 10<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:59.070> i<00:01:59.100> type<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.670> hit

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
frequency 10 so i type it in hit

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.860 
frequency 10 so i type it in hit
detonate

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
detonate

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.560 
detonate
and<00:02:00.990> boom<00:02:01.940> doesn't<00:02:02.940> blow<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.210> other<00:02:03.330> one<00:02:03.480> up

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
and boom doesn't blow the other one up

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.690 
and boom doesn't blow the other one up
because<00:02:03.690> this<00:02:03.930> one's<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> frequency<00:02:04.800> one<00:02:05.130> so

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
because this one's on a frequency one so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.109 
because this one's on a frequency one so
again<00:02:05.940> I<00:02:06.060> type<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.450> one<00:02:07.460> there<00:02:08.460> goes<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.700> tree

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
again I type in one there goes the tree

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.820 
again I type in one there goes the tree
so<00:02:09.690> really<00:02:10.170> cool<00:02:10.380> how<00:02:11.040> you<00:02:11.070> can<00:02:11.430> set<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.790> up

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
so really cool how you can set it up

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.670 
so really cool how you can set it up
next<00:02:13.830> moving<00:02:14.100> on<00:02:14.250> we<00:02:14.460> have<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:15.110> new<00:02:16.110> instruction

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
next moving on we have a new instruction

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.560 
next moving on we have a new instruction
book<00:02:16.860> which<00:02:17.190> tells<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.730> exactly<00:02:17.910> how<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.450> make

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
book which tells you exactly how to make

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.470 
book which tells you exactly how to make
everything<00:02:19.010> so<00:02:20.010> no<00:02:20.430> explanation<00:02:21.360> needed

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
one is a lava rocket yeah oh by the way

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.530 
one is a lava rocket yeah oh by the way
there's<00:03:55.590> radar<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.220> don't<00:03:56.910> know<00:03:56.970> if<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.120> told<00:03:57.420> you

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
there's radar I don't know if I told you

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.000 
there's radar I don't know if I told you
that<00:03:57.570> but<00:03:57.990> that's<00:03:58.170> what<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.410> does<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.920> know

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
that but that's what it does you know

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.490 
that but that's what it does you know
pretty<00:03:59.220> basic<00:03:59.460> all<00:04:00.300> right<00:04:00.420> lava<00:04:03.440> where<00:04:04.440> the

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
pretty basic all right lava where the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.380 
pretty basic all right lava where the
koriians<00:04:04.860> I<00:04:04.950> said<00:04:05.160> I<00:04:05.510> already<00:04:06.510> forgot<00:04:07.040> one

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
koriians I said I already forgot one

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.100 
koriians I said I already forgot one
4190<00:04:09.390> think<00:04:09.750> is<00:04:09.810> what<00:04:09.930> we<00:04:10.020> said<00:04:10.230> all<00:04:10.680> right<00:04:10.940> 140

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
4190 think is what we said all right 140

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.150 
4190 think is what we said all right 140
190<00:04:13.250> launch<00:04:14.480> and<00:04:15.480> do<00:04:15.630> that<00:04:15.870> one<00:04:16.080> and<00:04:16.380> as<00:04:16.860> it's

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
190 launch and do that one and as it's

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.030 
190 launch and do that one and as it's
going<00:04:17.340> this<00:04:17.640> is<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:18.000> new<00:04:18.300> cute<00:04:18.570> nucla<00:04:19.560> data

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
going this is the new cute nucla data

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.330 
going this is the new cute nucla data
nuclear<00:04:20.910> missile<00:04:21.330> so<00:04:21.870> once<00:04:22.770> it<00:04:22.920> comes<00:04:23.100> back

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
nuclear missile so once it comes back

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.180 
nuclear missile so once it comes back
down<00:04:23.400> actually<00:04:24.060> I<00:04:24.210> don't<00:04:24.330> know<00:04:24.450> I<00:04:24.920> guess<00:04:25.920> it's

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
down actually I don't know I guess it's

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.750 
down actually I don't know I guess it's
too<00:04:26.280> late<00:04:26.330> um<00:04:27.830> absolute<00:04:28.830> devastation<00:04:29.010> on<00:04:29.550> top

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
too late um absolute devastation on top

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.670 
too late um absolute devastation on top
of<00:04:29.910> a<00:04:29.970> missile<00:04:30.390> you<00:04:30.840> guys<00:04:31.020> have<00:04:31.230> seen<00:04:31.350> my<00:04:31.530> last

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
of a missile you guys have seen my last

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.220 
of a missile you guys have seen my last
video<00:04:32.040> or<00:04:32.280> if<00:04:32.400> you<00:04:32.550> have<00:04:32.730> you<00:04:33.150> know<00:04:33.330> how<00:04:33.990> big

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
video or if you have you know how big

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.850 
video or if you have you know how big
the<00:04:34.410> nuclear<00:04:34.830> bomb<00:04:35.430> is<00:04:36.110> so<00:04:37.110> you're<00:04:37.710> pretty

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
the nuclear bomb is so you're pretty

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.260 
the nuclear bomb is so you're pretty
prepared<00:04:38.220> for<00:04:38.430> what's<00:04:38.580> going<00:04:38.640> to<00:04:38.760> happen<00:04:39.090> so

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
prepared for what's going to happen so

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.200 
prepared for what's going to happen so
there's<00:04:39.480> a<00:04:39.570> lava<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:40.490> last<00:04:41.490> we're<00:04:41.880> going<00:04:42.090> to

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
there's a lava and last we're going to

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:49.550 
there's a lava and last we're going to
do<00:04:42.360> the<00:04:42.510> nuke<00:04:43.190> 140<00:04:44.930> 190<00:04:46.010> launch<00:04:47.010> oh<00:04:48.110> I<00:04:49.110> guess<00:04:49.440> I

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
do the nuke 140 190 launch oh I guess I

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.090 
do the nuke 140 190 launch oh I guess I
put<00:04:49.740> two<00:04:49.890> down<00:04:50.100> oh<00:04:50.310> well<00:04:51.680> now<00:04:52.680> it's<00:04:52.890> going<00:04:53.010> to

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
put two down oh well now it's going to

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.920 
put two down oh well now it's going to
lag<00:04:53.310> just<00:04:53.550> a<00:04:53.610> little<00:04:53.820> bit<00:04:53.970> but<00:04:54.540> it<00:04:54.630> shouldn't

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
lag just a little bit but it shouldn't

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.360 
lag just a little bit but it shouldn't
be<00:04:54.960> too<00:04:55.200> bad<00:04:55.230> because<00:04:55.530> I<00:04:55.680> do<00:04:55.740> have<00:04:55.980> more<00:04:56.190> memory

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
be too bad because I do have more memory

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.320 
be too bad because I do have more memory
on<00:04:56.580> this<00:04:56.670> computer<00:04:58.370> let's<00:04:59.370> get<00:04:59.520> back<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.060> little

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
on this computer let's get back a little

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.180 
on this computer let's get back a little
further<00:05:00.540> so<00:05:00.750> you<00:05:00.810> can<00:05:00.870> get<00:05:01.050> a<00:05:01.260> good<00:05:01.740> view<00:05:02.010> of

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
further so you can get a good view of

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.790 
further so you can get a good view of
what's<00:05:02.340> gonna<00:05:02.460> happen<00:05:03.590> hopefully<00:05:04.590> you<00:05:04.650> just

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
what's gonna happen hopefully you just

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.080 
what's gonna happen hopefully you just
didn't<00:05:05.040> catch<00:05:05.220> out<00:05:05.430> of<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.610> right<00:05:05.790> corn

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
didn't catch out of the right corn

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.890 
didn't catch out of the right corn
screen<00:05:06.590> far<00:05:07.590> experimented<00:05:08.720> alright<00:05:09.720> we're

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
screen far experimented alright we're

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.460 
screen far experimented alright we're
going<00:05:09.960> to<00:05:10.080> lag<00:05:10.380> just<00:05:10.860> a<00:05:10.980> tad<00:05:11.250> bit<00:05:11.280> here<00:05:15.320> and<00:05:16.320> it

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
going to lag just a tad bit here and it

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.020 
going to lag just a tad bit here and it
does<00:05:16.590> a<00:05:16.620> really<00:05:16.740> cool<00:05:17.310> effect<00:05:17.430> once<00:05:17.910> it

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
does a really cool effect once it

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.500 
does a really cool effect once it
explodes<00:05:19.040> so<00:05:20.040> as<00:05:20.160> you<00:05:20.220> can<00:05:20.460> see<00:05:20.640> I'm<00:05:20.850> engulfed
