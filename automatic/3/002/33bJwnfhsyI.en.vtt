00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
detailed I think is what I said the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
detailed I think is what I said the
other<00:02:12.810> ones<00:02:14.030> here<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:16.680> German<00:02:17.069> one<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:19.620> you

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
other ones here is the German one so you

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.800 
other ones here is the German one so you

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
scale so you can see the difference in

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.530 
scale so you can see the difference in
the<00:02:33.900> line<00:02:34.500> quality<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.310> German<00:02:35.640> one<00:02:35.790> um<00:02:36.060> I

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
the line quality the German one um I

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.240 
the line quality the German one um I
guess<00:02:37.230> it's<00:02:37.260> on<00:02:37.440> your<00:02:37.590> right<00:02:37.709> hand<00:02:37.860> side<00:02:38.069> is

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
guess it's on your right hand side is

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.460 
guess it's on your right hand side is
thicker<00:02:38.959> finer<00:02:39.959> on<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:41.150> Japanese<00:02:42.150> side<00:02:42.470> in

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
thicker finer on the Japanese side in

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.199 
thicker finer on the Japanese side in
terms<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.860> size<00:02:44.069> they're<00:02:44.489> like<00:02:44.640> identically

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
terms of size they're like identically

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.660 
terms of size they're like identically
sized<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:46.019> on<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.680> back<00:02:46.860> they<00:02:47.220> both<00:02:47.430> have

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
sized and on the back they both have

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.210 
sized and on the back they both have
little<00:02:47.850> holes<00:02:48.209> where<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.600> think<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.220> chocolate

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
little holes where I think the chocolate

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.940 
little holes where I think the chocolate
is<00:02:50.459> injected<00:02:50.970> one<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:53.069> koala<00:02:53.459> cacao<00:02:54.950> Japanese

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
to find the match because I could have

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.449 
to find the match because I could have
just<00:03:51.060> eaten<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.389> match<00:03:51.600> oh<00:03:54.950> that<00:03:55.950> was<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.160> koala

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
the match first before you eat them

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.670 
the match first before you eat them
because<00:04:03.389> if<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.660> eat<00:04:03.900> them<00:04:04.139> then<00:04:04.380> you<00:04:04.500> might

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680
