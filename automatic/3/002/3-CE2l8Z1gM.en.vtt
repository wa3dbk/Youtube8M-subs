00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
not too many uh what do you call it

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.550 
not too many uh what do you call it
areas<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.970> are<00:01:09.090> wide<00:01:09.360> open<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> lot<00:01:10.530> of

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
areas that are wide open so a lot of

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.880 
areas that are wide open so a lot of
tight<00:01:10.880> corners<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.150> then<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.229> next<00:01:13.560> map<00:01:13.680> is

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
tight corners and then this next map is

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.520 
tight corners and then this next map is
a<00:01:13.920> Gulch<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:15.060> looks<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.420> maybe<00:01:16.380> in

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
a Gulch and it looks like it's maybe in

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.840 
a Gulch and it looks like it's maybe in
the<00:01:16.619> brand<00:01:16.830> canyon<00:01:17.280> sand<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.670> I'm

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
the brand canyon sand like that I'm

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.850 
the brand canyon sand like that I'm
pretty<00:01:18.180> sure<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.320> looks<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.740> could

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
pretty sure and it looks like it could

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.800 
pretty sure and it looks like it could
either<00:01:20.040> be<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.340> big<00:01:20.640> wide<00:01:20.909> open<00:01:21.240> map<00:01:21.420> or<00:01:21.630> else

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
either be a big wide open map or else

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.450 
either be a big wide open map or else
you<00:01:22.200> know<00:01:22.290> pretty<00:01:22.500> small<00:01:22.890> map<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.250> hard<00:01:23.400> to

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
you know pretty small map it's hard to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.460 
you know pretty small map it's hard to
tell<00:01:23.640> what<00:01:23.820> these<00:01:24.000> are<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.720> know<00:01:24.840> map<00:01:25.080> makers

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
tell what these are you know map makers

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.469 
tell what these are you know map makers
and<00:01:25.619> call<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.890> duty<00:01:26.159> but<00:01:26.340> uh<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:27.060> does<00:01:27.299> look

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
and call of duty but uh it does look

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.590 
and call of duty but uh it does look
like<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.659> pretty<00:01:27.900> decent<00:01:28.229> map<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.479> that's<00:01:30.479> all

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
like a pretty decent map and that's all

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.789 
like a pretty decent map and that's all

last one is parish and there is some

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.830 
last one is parish and there is some
survival<00:01:34.680> mode<00:01:34.970> footage<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.329> game<00:01:36.600> if

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
survival mode footage of this game if

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.840 
survival mode footage of this game if
you<00:01:36.930> guys<00:01:37.110> want<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.380> see<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.770> Charlie<00:01:38.490> Intel

you guys want to see it on Charlie Intel
and<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.150> looked<00:01:39.329> pretty<00:01:39.450> cool<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.619> one

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
and it looked pretty cool and this one

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.330 
and it looked pretty cool and this one
is<00:01:40.950> actually<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:42.119> think<00:01:42.420> one<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> maps<00:01:43.979> from

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
is actually I think one of the maps from

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.310 
is actually I think one of the maps from
the<00:01:44.729> campaign<00:01:45.149> mode<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.659> don't<00:01:45.960> know<00:01:46.020> if<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.229> was

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
the campaign mode I don't know if it was

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.380 
the campaign mode I don't know if it was
in<00:01:46.439> Russia<00:01:46.680> if<00:01:46.979> i'm<00:01:47.159> not<00:01:47.250> mistaken<00:01:47.520> or<00:01:48.060> France

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
in Russia if i'm not mistaken or France

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.719 
in Russia if i'm not mistaken or France

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.480 
missions but um what do you call it this
map<00:01:54.509> looks<00:01:54.840> like<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.200> could<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.890> medium<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
map looks like it could be a medium the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.170 
map looks like it could be a medium the
small<00:01:56.790> size<00:01:57.060> map<00:01:57.420> may<00:01:57.659> be<00:01:57.719> large<00:01:58.189> but<00:01:59.189> uh<00:01:59.250> yeah

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
small size map may be large but uh yeah

there's a lot of openings there's a bar

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.350 
there's a lot of openings there's a bar
in<00:02:02.009> one<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.250> these<00:02:02.369> pictures<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.000> guys<00:02:03.149> could

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
in one of these pictures you guys could

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.469 
in one of these pictures you guys could
see<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.630> could<00:02:03.689> go<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.229> there's<00:02:05.040> also<00:02:05.420> what<00:02:06.420> do
