00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.610
 I said look it's worth a welcome to 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.559
 Another dance video, my God, why? 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.720

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.430
 I do not know what we were coming for. 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.680
 a very popular thing among 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.510
 teens called modinha monde 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.490
 basically you wear clothes listen 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.590
 certain songs is an entire style of 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.150
 life that was constituted by someone is 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.740
 you simply follow something 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.390
 that someone invented for no reason 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.219
 You just think that's good. 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.930
 And why is everyone using you? 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.910

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.559
 Yes, I believe modinha because I think 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.719
 that the day a very complex thing does not 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.360
 I believe in modinha in general I think 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.190
 the modinha encompasses all styles each 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.660
 one has his own coin obviously exists 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.640
 but it is more popular than the modinha do 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.420
 pop world you listen to what you said 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.640
 jay ze justin biber one direction is already 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.649
 It's from Sherman this tape and use that 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.989
 pants all shit so the cap back 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.550
 a tank top of vacancies is already 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.080
 being able to identify is not however 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.240
 I believe in modinha in others. 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.130
 styles for example in rock what is 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.530
 routine in the rock world you listened to 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.380
 People know bike fire or bright of a 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.659
 down these stops brigade of precaution 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.130
 pierced piercing 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.650
 Simple things that I say do not help 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.479
 You swear he had to talk modinha because 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.040
 one hour you will be enclosed in it 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.500
 whatever your style, but if you have a 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.720
 orgy that imitates in this world is the modinha 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.150
 who goes against the modinha the modinha 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.040
 of the site modinha you simply theater 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.170
 which is fashionable because it is in the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.450
 fashion our face I do not like to write 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.740
 here because it's a little angel and then you're 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.119
 say that something is not good just because it is 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.740
 fashion makes no sense because 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.030
 You do not know what you do not know. 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.159
 the material you do not have that kind of 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.659
 music you do not feel is not a 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.610
 valid argument if you are the type of 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.920
 person who hates modinha just because he is 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.200
 trendy dear're so ugly to 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.270
 moody s ante modinha is also a 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.710
 chubby on you when you say 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.509
 You do not like something because you're 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.130
 in fashion you are also being fashionable 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.689
 because there's a lot of people on the other side 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.579
 who does not like the things that are in the 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.229
 fashion just because it is fashionable that is you 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:09.569
 It's in the fashion that you do not like the ones that 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:13.039
 are fashionable right finally have a coffee and 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.039
 even a business that are 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.590
 the modinha during the day one thing that me 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.750
 very angry because the person does not 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.909
 has its own personality looks you are 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.530
 Speaking of modinha no hatred has 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.180
 Your own personality is fine 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.829
 I agree but I think when you 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.610
 take something away just because it's in the 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.019
 fashion 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.370
 you do not have much to say that that 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.409
 It's bad for example, you know me. 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.700
 know the kind of band error I listen to 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.500
 the kind of clothes I wear 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.940
 but I like something different in 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.769
 for example this glasses here is 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.689
 Totally modinha has many people who 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.670
 Wear this here because of the fashion I call 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.620
 because in addition to being fashionable it is a 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.329
 thing that I like I feel good about this 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.250
 glasses is a lens has a cool lens 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.359
 my face does not look good to the club in 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.129
 August end in total 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.690
 so it's something I like what I 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.670
 I mean not all that is 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.349
 fashion is bad, no problem 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.549
 Do you like things that are fashionable? 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.620
 of things that other people are 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.790
 using if you have a mother for this 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.440
 because it's no good if you use a 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.060
 kind of clothing there was a kind of music if 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.010
 You do not know what's not good? 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.319
 connected if you feel good listening to 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.849
 shell and wearing shit pants using 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.680
 that outfit looks pajamas she 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.180
 become sweatshirt you go out on the street if you 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.650
 feel comfortable with it this does well 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.760
 No problem, my friend. 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.769
 Congratulations, you're creating your 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.449
 own personality now do not let yourself 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.430
 influence for people to speak 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:24.919
 use of the experimental type see if it's legal 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.840
 Do you like to feel comfortable? Do not you? 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.639
 because it just has it's simply trendy 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.199
 You're on, you have to feel good about yourself. 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.120
 because otherwise you will not only have 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:33.650
 an ordinary person without personality and 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.780
 creativity without anything is connected will have 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.549
 so a gray person in the middle gray 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.370

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.560
