you have the needle in here you see that

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.200 
you have the needle in here you see that
the<00:02:02.860> needle<00:02:03.159> will<00:02:03.189> stick<00:02:03.490> out<00:02:03.670> up<00:02:03.880> here

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
the needle will stick out up here

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.859

and so if you had the needle the nozzle
Walker<00:02:08.050> there<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.489> want<00:02:09.670> to<00:02:09.759> be<00:02:09.880> safe

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
Walker there and you want to be safe

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.420 
Walker there and you want to be safe
would<00:02:10.720> at<00:02:10.869> least<00:02:11.019> have<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.769> needle<00:02:12.040> withdrawn

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
would at least have the needle withdrawn

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.259 
would at least have the needle withdrawn
even<00:02:12.760> further<00:02:13.030> so<00:02:13.750> it's<00:02:13.900> down<00:02:14.140> in<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:15.060> case<00:02:16.060> in

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
even further so it's down in the case in

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.449 
even further so it's down in the case in
sheriff<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.910> airbrush<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:21.340> other

thing you want to know is this if you

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.500 
thing you want to know is this if you

out like we do to clean it what can

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.620 
out like we do to clean it what can
happen<00:02:28.450> will<00:02:29.380> happen<00:02:29.410> if<00:02:29.830> you<00:02:29.920> want<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.220> to

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
couple things here's this Chuck will

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.720 
couple things here's this Chuck will
easily<00:02:34.569> come<00:02:35.049> off<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.440> here<00:02:35.470> fall<00:02:36.069> off<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.610> get

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
easily come off of here fall off and get

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.880 
easily come off of here fall off and get
law<00:02:37.000> so<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.599> might<00:02:37.930> want<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.230> make<00:02:38.620> sure<00:02:38.769> it's

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
law so you might want to make sure it's

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.100 
law so you might want to make sure it's
tight<00:02:38.980> or<00:02:39.790> make<00:02:40.030> sure<00:02:40.209> you<00:02:40.360> remove<00:02:40.630> it<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:40.930> put

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
tight or make sure you remove it and put

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.559 
tight or make sure you remove it and put
it<00:02:41.260> somewhere<00:02:41.500> where<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:42.519> can't<00:02:42.760> lose<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.269> the

it somewhere where you can't lose it the

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.960 
it somewhere where you can't lose it the
other<00:02:43.720> thing<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:43.989> happens<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.790> only

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
other thing that happens is it the only

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.210 
other thing that happens is it the only
thing<00:02:46.150> holding<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:46.810> trigger<00:02:47.110> in<00:02:47.349> is<00:02:47.799> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
thing holding this trigger in is the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.759 
thing holding this trigger in is the
needle<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:49.180> needle<00:02:49.209> goes<00:02:49.630> through<00:02:49.769> this

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
needle the needle goes through this

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.830 
needle the needle goes through this
shaft<00:02:51.040> through<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:51.970> hole<00:02:52.390> in<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.630> base<00:02:52.810> of

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
shaft through the hole in the base of

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.319 
shaft through the hole in the base of
this<00:02:53.079> trigger<00:02:53.410> which<00:02:54.100> will<00:02:54.280> show<00:02:54.459> you<00:02:54.519> now<00:02:54.820> and

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
this trigger which will show you now and

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.240 
this trigger which will show you now and
you<00:02:55.930> might<00:02:56.109> remove<00:02:56.380> it<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.650> clean<00:02:56.890> it<00:02:57.010> or<00:02:57.190> it

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
you might remove it to clean it or it

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.800 
you might remove it to clean it or it
might<00:02:57.400> fall<00:02:57.640> out<00:02:57.670> on<00:02:57.970> accident<00:02:58.480> when<00:02:58.660> you're

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
might fall out on accident when you're

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.319 
might fall out on accident when you're
cleaning<00:02:59.049> and<00:02:59.769> here's<00:03:00.130> what<00:03:00.340> happen<00:03:00.760> there's

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
cleaning and here's what happen there's

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.460 
cleaning and here's what happen there's
the<00:03:01.660> trigger<00:03:03.299> take<00:03:04.299> a<00:03:04.329> good<00:03:04.569> look<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.260> what

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
the trigger take a good look and what

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.229 
the trigger take a good look and what
you're<00:03:05.590> going<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:05.739> see<00:03:05.950> is<00:03:06.160> there's<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:07.060> hole

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
you're going to see is there's a hole

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.750 
you're going to see is there's a hole
there<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:08.170> goes<00:03:08.380> through<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.829> trigger<00:03:09.069> and

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
there that goes through the trigger and

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.490 
there that goes through the trigger and
that's<00:03:10.390> where<00:03:10.569> the<00:03:10.630> needle<00:03:10.900> passes<00:03:11.140> through

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
that's where the needle passes through

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.130 
that's where the needle passes through
so<00:03:11.769> when<00:03:11.950> you<00:03:12.040> put<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.370> trigger<00:03:12.850> back<00:03:13.120> in<00:03:13.390> you

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
so when you put the trigger back in you

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.690 
so when you put the trigger back in you
have<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.319> make<00:03:14.530> sure<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:14.829> orient<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:15.489> hole

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
have to make sure you orient that hole

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.720 
have to make sure you orient that hole
that<00:03:15.940> way<00:03:16.380> rather<00:03:17.380> than<00:03:17.680> have<00:03:17.889> the<00:03:18.130> trigger

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
that way rather than have the trigger

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.030 
that way rather than have the trigger
sideways<00:03:19.359> so<00:03:20.200> if<00:03:20.319> you<00:03:20.440> look<00:03:20.620> at<00:03:20.650> from<00:03:20.889> the<00:03:20.980> side

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
sideways so if you look at from the side

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.770 
sideways so if you look at from the side
if<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:21.430> got<00:03:21.609> that<00:03:21.760> hole<00:03:21.940> there<00:03:22.150> it's<00:03:22.480> wrong

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
if you got that hole there it's wrong

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.650 
if you got that hole there it's wrong
you<00:03:23.049> got<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.350> have<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:23.530> like<00:03:23.829> this

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
you got to have it like this

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.210 
you got to have it like this
the<00:03:25.660> trigger<00:03:25.930> hole<00:03:26.200> it's<00:03:27.190> going

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
the trigger hole it's going

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.599 
the trigger hole it's going
front-to-back<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:29.410> get<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:29.889> trigger<00:03:30.100> back<00:03:30.340> in

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
front-to-back to get the trigger back in

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.990 
front-to-back to get the trigger back in
there<00:03:30.790> then<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.560> can<00:03:32.560> do<00:03:32.889> that<00:03:33.160> two<00:03:33.760> ways

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
there then you can do that two ways

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.900 
there then you can do that two ways
either<00:03:34.329> with<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.620> core<00:03:36.010> recoil<00:03:36.730> mechanism

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
either with the core recoil mechanism

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.740 
either with the core recoil mechanism
here<00:03:37.720> by<00:03:38.410> pulling<00:03:39.340> back<00:03:39.519> and<00:03:40.030> holding<00:03:40.569> that

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
here by pulling back and holding that

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:47.640 
here by pulling back and holding that
with<00:03:40.959> one<00:03:41.709> finger<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.310> then<00:03:42.459> curiously<00:03:46.650> this

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
with one finger and then curiously this

00:03:47.650 --> 00:04:08.280 
with one finger and then curiously this
way<00:04:03.870> just<00:04:04.870> unscrews<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:06.580> be<00:04:06.849> careful<00:04:07.269> it's<00:04:08.080> an

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
way just unscrews and be careful it's an

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:25.140 
way just unscrews and be careful it's an
easy<00:04:08.500> time<00:04:08.799> for<00:04:08.980> that<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.830> there's<00:04:24.729> a<00:04:24.849> spring

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
easy time for that and there's a spring

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:32.130 
easy time for that and there's a spring
in<00:04:25.270> there<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:25.599> so<00:04:25.750> forth<00:04:26.760> if<00:04:27.760> you<00:04:27.970> have<00:04:31.140> and

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
in there and so forth if you have and

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.680 
in there and so forth if you have and
that's<00:04:32.260> okay<00:04:32.680> there's<00:04:33.010> nothing<00:04:33.690> difficult

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
that's okay there's nothing difficult

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.969 
that's okay there's nothing difficult
here<00:04:34.900> there's<00:04:35.110> a<00:04:35.200> spring<00:04:40.560> go<00:04:41.560> ahead<00:04:41.740> and<00:04:41.830> put

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
here there's a spring go ahead and put

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.920 
here there's a spring go ahead and put
that<00:04:42.010> back<00:04:42.460> together<00:04:42.669> so<00:04:43.240> we<00:04:43.270> can<00:04:43.570> see<00:04:43.750> this

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
that back together so we can see this

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.060 
that back together so we can see this
the<00:04:46.930> other<00:04:46.960> thing<00:04:47.110> you<00:04:47.349> want<00:04:47.469> to<00:04:47.560> notice<00:04:47.740> is

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
the other thing you want to notice is

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.850 
the other thing you want to notice is
that<00:04:50.219> this<00:04:51.219> is<00:04:51.280> how<00:04:52.120> does<00:04:52.270> tab<00:04:52.510> goes<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:53.650> tab

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
that this is how does tab goes the tab

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.459 
that this is how does tab goes the tab
goes<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.310> top<00:04:54.520> and<00:04:54.849> it<00:04:54.940> comes<00:04:55.150> through<00:04:55.469> there

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:56.469 
goes the top and it comes through there

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:57.990 
goes the top and it comes through there
like<00:04:56.740> that<00:04:56.979> so<00:04:57.039> when<00:04:57.460> you're<00:04:57.550> putting<00:04:57.789> this

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
like that so when you're putting this

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.240 
like that so when you're putting this
back<00:04:58.240> in<00:04:58.539> here<00:04:58.780> a<00:04:59.020> lot<00:04:59.469> of<00:04:59.530> times<00:04:59.740> you're<00:05:00.130> going

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
back in here a lot of times you're going

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.040 
back in here a lot of times you're going
to<00:05:00.340> just<00:05:00.520> be<00:05:00.729> too<00:05:00.849> careful<00:05:01.060> I'll<00:05:01.450> just<00:05:01.900> hold

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
to just be too careful I'll just hold

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.040 
to just be too careful I'll just hold
the<00:05:02.260> base<00:05:02.469> of<00:05:02.710> it<00:05:02.800> in<00:05:03.390> like<00:05:04.390> that<00:05:04.659> and<00:05:06.870> fish<00:05:07.870> it

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
the base of it in like that and fish it

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.100 
the base of it in like that and fish it
in<00:05:08.289> there<00:05:08.560> and<00:05:09.159> then<00:05:10.120> it<00:05:10.240> comes<00:05:10.450> up<00:05:10.599> just<00:05:10.960> where

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
in there and then it comes up just where

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.600 
in there and then it comes up just where
it<00:05:11.169> needs<00:05:11.349> to<00:05:11.409> that's<00:05:11.919> where<00:05:12.130> you<00:05:12.219> want<00:05:12.430> it<00:05:12.490> to

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
it needs to that's where you want it to

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.880 
it needs to that's where you want it to
be<00:05:12.729> where<00:05:13.090> you<00:05:13.180> need<00:05:13.360> to<00:05:13.539> be<00:05:13.570> now<00:05:14.440> June<00:05:14.680> as<00:05:14.800> you

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
be where you need to be now June as you

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.260 
be where you need to be now June as you
look<00:05:15.070> in<00:05:15.219> there<00:05:15.370> we<00:05:15.460> might<00:05:15.640> not<00:05:15.760> see<00:05:15.969> the<00:05:16.090> hole

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
look in there we might not see the hole

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.100 
look in there we might not see the hole
where<00:05:16.630> the<00:05:16.770> trigger<00:05:17.770> goes<00:05:18.039> I'll<00:05:18.820> show<00:05:19.000> you<00:05:19.110> and

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
where the trigger goes I'll show you and

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.320 
where the trigger goes I'll show you and
it's<00:05:20.289> very<00:05:20.349> difficult<00:05:20.800> to<00:05:21.099> see<00:05:21.370> there<00:05:22.360> it<00:05:22.479> is

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
it's very difficult to see there it is

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.969 
it's very difficult to see there it is
and<00:05:25.330> you<00:05:25.510> have<00:05:25.570> to<00:05:25.719> get<00:05:25.960> white<00:05:26.260> going<00:05:26.650> directly

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
and you have to get white going directly

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.320 
and you have to get white going directly
down<00:05:27.039> in<00:05:27.370> there<00:05:27.520> to<00:05:27.550> see<00:05:27.789> it<00:05:27.849> it's<00:05:28.060> a<00:05:28.120> very

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
down in there to see it it's a very

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.300 
down in there to see it it's a very
difficult<00:05:28.570> alignment<00:05:29.289> process<00:05:29.500> but<00:05:30.039> you<00:05:30.159> just

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
difficult alignment process but you just

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.580 
difficult alignment process but you just
line<00:05:31.090> up<00:05:31.120> your<00:05:31.419> trigger<00:05:31.690> and<00:05:31.930> get<00:05:32.020> it<00:05:32.169> down<00:05:32.349> in

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
line up your trigger and get it down in

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.209 
line up your trigger and get it down in
there<00:05:32.800> I'll<00:05:33.640> try<00:05:33.849> to<00:05:33.909> do<00:05:34.090> that<00:05:34.800> without<00:05:35.800> having

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:36.219 
there I'll try to do that without having

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:39.630 
there I'll try to do that without having
the<00:05:36.490> proper<00:05:36.669> light<00:05:37.740> and<00:05:38.740> again<00:05:39.010> make<00:05:39.280> sure<00:05:39.310> you

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
the proper light and again make sure you

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.670 
the proper light and again make sure you
have<00:05:39.849> the<00:05:40.150> trigger<00:05:40.450> aligned<00:05:40.750> properly<00:05:41.050> with

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
have the trigger aligned properly with

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.540 
have the trigger aligned properly with
the

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
the

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.019 
the
direction<00:05:44.550> of<00:05:44.879> the<00:05:44.939> airbrush<00:05:45.749> and<00:05:46.580> again<00:05:47.580> very

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029 
direction of the airbrush and again very

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:52.850 
direction of the airbrush and again very
difficult<00:05:48.209> to<00:05:48.569> do<00:05:48.719> without<00:05:48.989> the<00:05:51.860> without

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
difficult to do without the without

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.159 
difficult to do without the without
being<00:05:53.219> able<00:05:53.339> to<00:05:53.459> see<00:05:53.519> down<00:05:53.669> in<00:05:53.849> there<00:05:53.969> but<00:05:54.169> you

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
being able to see down in there but you

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:56.540 
being able to see down in there but you
get<00:05:55.259> a<00:05:55.319> feel<00:05:55.589> for<00:05:55.619> it<00:05:55.860> after<00:05:56.159> a<00:05:56.189> while<00:05:56.309> and<00:05:56.489> you

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
get a feel for it after a while and you

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.369 
get a feel for it after a while and you
can<00:05:56.699> do<00:05:56.819> it<00:05:56.909> without<00:05:57.059> seeing<00:05:57.599> which<00:05:57.989> I've<00:05:58.169> done

00:05:58.369 --> 00:05:58.379 
can do it without seeing which I've done

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:00.999 
can do it without seeing which I've done
here<00:05:58.699> and<00:05:59.699> then<00:05:59.849> again<00:05:59.939> to<00:06:00.209> reassemble<00:06:00.839> it

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:01.009 
here and then again to reassemble it

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:03.469 
here and then again to reassemble it
make<00:06:02.009> sure<00:06:02.039> you<00:06:02.249> have<00:06:02.399> this<00:06:02.550> tab<00:06:02.819> pointed<00:06:03.269> up

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
make sure you have this tab pointed up

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.839 
make sure you have this tab pointed up
and<00:06:03.809> hold<00:06:04.739> it<00:06:04.889> in<00:06:05.009> there<00:06:05.189> like<00:06:05.279> that<00:06:05.519> you

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:05.849 
and hold it in there like that you

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:08.719 
and hold it in there like that you
doesn't<00:06:06.449> catch<00:06:07.129> they<00:06:08.129> have<00:06:08.279> very<00:06:08.610> little

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
doesn't catch they have very little

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.709 
doesn't catch they have very little
clearance<00:06:08.999> in<00:06:09.300> there<00:06:09.589> and<00:06:11.330> screw<00:06:12.330> your<00:06:12.449> cord

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:12.719 
clearance in there and screw your cord

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:20.209 
clearance in there and screw your cord
back<00:06:12.929> in<00:06:13.199> there<00:06:14.449> and<00:06:15.449> get<00:06:15.899> that<00:06:16.169> tight<00:06:19.219> and

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219 
back in there and get that tight and

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:28.100 
back in there and get that tight and
then<00:06:20.489> replace<00:06:20.879> the<00:06:24.050> and<00:06:25.050> the<00:06:25.439> nozzle<00:06:25.829> cap<00:06:27.110> and

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
then replace the and the nozzle cap and

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.759 
then replace the and the nozzle cap and
screw<00:06:28.979> that<00:06:29.099> on<00:06:29.159> you're<00:06:29.429> real<00:06:29.610> good<00:06:30.499> and<00:06:31.499> tight

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:31.769 
screw that on you're real good and tight

00:06:31.769 --> 00:06:35.860 
screw that on you're real good and tight
before

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.920 

saying<00:06:36.650> you<00:06:36.770> need<00:06:36.949> a<00:06:37.010> wing<00:06:37.660> and<00:06:38.660> you're<00:06:38.810> doing

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
saying you need a wing and you're doing

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.570 
saying you need a wing and you're doing
that<00:06:39.169> trigger<00:06:39.530> can<00:06:39.710> still<00:06:39.980> come<00:06:40.160> out<00:06:40.340> of<00:06:40.460> there

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
that trigger can still come out of there

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.159 
that trigger can still come out of there
even<00:06:40.610> right<00:06:41.030> now<00:06:41.060> until<00:06:41.540> that<00:06:41.690> needle<00:06:42.020> goes

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.169 
even right now until that needle goes

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:42.820 
even right now until that needle goes
through<00:06:42.199> there

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
through there

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.550 
through there
let's<00:06:43.639> rate<00:06:43.850> it<00:06:43.970> can<00:06:44.090> just<00:06:44.300> fall<00:06:44.510> out<00:06:44.540> so<00:06:45.410> then

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 
let's rate it can just fall out so then

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.350 
let's rate it can just fall out so then
you<00:06:45.650> have<00:06:45.830> to<00:06:46.720> loosen<00:06:47.720> your<00:06:48.110> needle<00:06:48.710> Chuck<00:06:49.360> get

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
you have to loosen your needle Chuck get

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.990 
you have to loosen your needle Chuck get
the<00:06:50.600> needle<00:06:50.870> in<00:06:50.960> here<00:06:51.550> again<00:06:52.550> make<00:06:52.820> sure

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
the needle in here again make sure

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.360 
the needle in here again make sure
that's<00:06:53.150> tight

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 
that's tight

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.110 
that's tight
then<00:06:55.370> set<00:06:56.090> the<00:06:56.120> needle<00:06:57.370> seat<00:06:58.370> it<00:06:58.520> and<00:06:58.699> Chuck<00:06:58.940> it

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
then set the needle seat it and Chuck it

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.310 
then set the needle seat it and Chuck it
tight<00:06:59.800> and<00:07:00.800> you're<00:07:00.979> good<00:07:01.130> to<00:07:01.280> go
