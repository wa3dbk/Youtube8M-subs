very sharp miyako calm okay okay okay so
and<00:00:53.219> I've<00:00:53.340> got<00:00:53.670> different<00:00:54.149> sizes<00:00:55.340> let's<00:00:56.340> get

really sort of expensive I know what to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.120 
really sort of expensive I know what to
do<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.510> boxes<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.140> think<00:01:10.350> I'm<00:01:10.470> throwing<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.010> no

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130
