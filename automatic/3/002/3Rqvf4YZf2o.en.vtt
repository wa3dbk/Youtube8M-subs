Oh

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:04.480 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.999 

now<00:00:05.480> along<00:00:05.689> with<00:00:05.840> a<00:00:05.870> simple<00:00:06.290> bench<00:00:06.470> test<00:00:06.830> you

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:07.009 
now along with a simple bench test you

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.459 
now along with a simple bench test you
can<00:00:07.160> also<00:00:07.370> test<00:00:07.850> your<00:00:07.939> o2<00:00:08.149> sensor<00:00:08.360> right<00:00:09.290> on

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:09.469 
can also test your o2 sensor right on

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:10.869 
can also test your o2 sensor right on
the<00:00:09.620> vehicle<00:00:10.010> we're<00:00:10.129> gonna<00:00:10.219> demonstrate<00:00:10.490> that

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:10.879 
the vehicle we're gonna demonstrate that

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:12.580 
the vehicle we're gonna demonstrate that
right<00:00:11.090> now<00:00:11.299> all<00:00:11.450> right<00:00:11.539> Jim<00:00:11.719> that's<00:00:12.019> right<00:00:12.349> now

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
right now all right Jim that's right now

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.350 
right now all right Jim that's right now
basically<00:00:13.160> what<00:00:13.490> we're<00:00:13.639> going<00:00:13.790> to<00:00:13.940> need<00:00:14.059> sky

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
basically what we're going to need sky

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.480 
basically what we're going to need sky
there's<00:00:14.570> a<00:00:14.630> voltmeter<00:00:14.929> set<00:00:15.799> on<00:00:15.950> the<00:00:16.070> two<00:00:16.219> volt

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
there's a voltmeter set on the two volt

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.179 
there's a voltmeter set on the two volt
scale<00:00:16.849> because<00:00:17.660> the<00:00:17.689> o2<00:00:18.140> sensor<00:00:18.680> produces<00:00:18.860> a

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
scale because the o2 sensor produces a

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.400 
scale because the o2 sensor produces a
very<00:00:19.460> small<00:00:19.759> voltage<00:00:20.270> and<00:00:20.480> I'm<00:00:20.989> going<00:00:21.259> to

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
very small voltage and I'm going to

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.010 
very small voltage and I'm going to
connect<00:00:21.770> the<00:00:21.919> voltmeter<00:00:22.220> first<00:00:23.090> to<00:00:23.689> a<00:00:23.720> good

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.020 
connect the voltmeter first to a good

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.600 
connect the voltmeter first to a good
ground<00:00:24.320> the<00:00:24.559> negative<00:00:24.890> lead<00:00:25.070> gets<00:00:25.369> connected

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
ground the negative lead gets connected

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.909 
ground the negative lead gets connected
to<00:00:25.910> a<00:00:25.939> good<00:00:26.210> engine<00:00:26.720> ground<00:00:27.050> sure<00:00:27.500> and<00:00:27.770> then

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:27.919 
to a good engine ground sure and then

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.339 
to a good engine ground sure and then
I'm<00:00:28.040> going<00:00:28.189> to<00:00:28.279> reach<00:00:28.430> over<00:00:28.849> and<00:00:29.000> unplug<00:00:29.719> the

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
I'm going to reach over and unplug the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.560 
I'm going to reach over and unplug the
o2<00:00:30.800> sensor<00:00:31.250> lead<00:00:31.460> and<00:00:31.730> connect<00:00:32.149> the<00:00:32.300> positive

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
o2 sensor lead and connect the positive

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.250 
o2 sensor lead and connect the positive
lead<00:00:33.140> of<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:33.500> voltmeter<00:00:34.300> to<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:35.510> o2<00:00:35.629> sensors

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
lead of the voltmeter to the o2 sensors

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.329 
lead of the voltmeter to the o2 sensors
lead<00:00:37.750> now<00:00:38.750> we'll<00:00:39.350> be<00:00:39.469> able<00:00:39.710> to<00:00:39.859> measure<00:00:40.070> the

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
lead now we'll be able to measure the

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.040 
lead now we'll be able to measure the
voltage<00:00:40.489> while<00:00:41.179> that's<00:00:41.390> right<00:00:41.570> in<00:00:41.749> the<00:00:41.870> engine

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
voltage while that's right in the engine

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.959 
voltage while that's right in the engine
now<00:00:43.039> we're<00:00:43.219> going<00:00:43.339> to<00:00:43.399> have<00:00:43.519> to<00:00:43.609> run<00:00:43.820> the

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
now we're going to have to run the

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:45.639 
now we're going to have to run the
vehicle<00:00:44.149> and<00:00:44.539> change<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.199> air<00:00:45.320> fuel<00:00:45.620> mixture

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
vehicle and change the air fuel mixture

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.310 
vehicle and change the air fuel mixture
ratio<00:00:46.489> a<00:00:46.730> simple<00:00:47.329> way<00:00:47.420> to<00:00:47.449> do<00:00:47.690> that<00:00:47.899> would<00:00:48.109> just

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
ratio a simple way to do that would just

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.410 
ratio a simple way to do that would just
be<00:00:48.440> to<00:00:48.589> create<00:00:48.800> a<00:00:48.890> vacuum<00:00:49.159> leak<00:00:49.489> sure<00:00:50.120> there's

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
be to create a vacuum leak sure there's

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.209 
be to create a vacuum leak sure there's
a<00:00:50.510> vacuum<00:00:50.690> port<00:00:51.140> right<00:00:51.379> here<00:00:51.409> on<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:51.890> top<00:00:52.070> of

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
a vacuum port right here on the top of

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.220 
a vacuum port right here on the top of
this<00:00:52.339> engine<00:00:52.789> with<00:00:53.089> a<00:00:53.120> little<00:00:53.420> rubber<00:00:53.570> cap<00:00:53.929> on

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
this engine with a little rubber cap on

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.399 
this engine with a little rubber cap on
so<00:00:54.920> if<00:00:55.039> you<00:00:55.129> have<00:00:55.159> one<00:00:55.429> of<00:00:55.519> these<00:00:55.609> on<00:00:55.850> your<00:00:56.059> car

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
so if you have one of these on your car

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.599 
so if you have one of these on your car
there's<00:00:57.409> a<00:00:57.469> little<00:00:57.710> clip<00:00:57.980> that<00:00:58.039> you<00:00:58.309> can<00:00:58.460> use<00:00:58.579> a

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
there's a little clip that you can use a

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.209 
there's a little clip that you can use a
pair<00:00:58.909> of<00:00:58.940> pliers<00:00:59.030> to<00:00:59.480> remove<00:01:00.019> and<00:01:00.350> get<00:01:01.069> that

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
pair of pliers to remove and get that

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.060 
pair of pliers to remove and get that
out<00:01:01.280> of<00:01:01.429> the<00:01:01.640> way<00:01:01.819> and<00:01:02.719> then<00:01:02.870> simply<00:01:03.229> pull<00:01:03.559> the

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
out of the way and then simply pull the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.160 
out of the way and then simply pull the
little<00:01:04.309> boot<00:01:04.550> off<00:01:04.729> and<00:01:05.000> that<00:01:05.630> will<00:01:05.810> create<00:01:06.020> the

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
little boot off and that will create the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.930 
little boot off and that will create the
vacuum<00:01:06.440> leak<00:01:06.860> that<00:01:07.010> you<00:01:07.070> need<00:01:07.340> to<00:01:07.490> change<00:01:07.700> the

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
vacuum leak that you need to change the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.090 
vacuum leak that you need to change the
mixture<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:08.540> I'll<00:01:08.720> start<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.080> car<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:09.650> we'll

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
mixture so I'll start the car and we'll

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.750 
mixture so I'll start the car and we'll
do<00:01:10.250> that<00:01:10.520> all<00:01:11.000> right<00:01:12.250> now<00:01:13.250> we've<00:01:13.460> previously

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
do that all right now we've previously

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.730 
do that all right now we've previously
run<00:01:14.180> this<00:01:14.360> engine<00:01:14.780> for<00:01:15.020> a<00:01:15.080> little<00:01:15.320> bit<00:01:15.440> of<00:01:15.560> time

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
run this engine for a little bit of time

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:29.260 
run this engine for a little bit of time
to<00:01:15.980> warm<00:01:16.160> it<00:01:16.280> up<00:01:16.370> to

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.070 

for<00:01:29.810> a<00:01:29.840> little<00:01:30.079> additional

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
for a little additional

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.010 
for a little additional
our<00:01:32.200> meters<00:01:32.500> starting<00:01:32.860> to<00:01:32.950> come<00:01:33.130> up<00:01:33.280> now<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.990> I

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
our meters starting to come up now so I

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.430 
our meters starting to come up now so I
think<00:01:35.230> our<00:01:35.440> go-to<00:01:35.770> sensor<00:01:36.220> is<00:01:36.430> warming<00:01:36.970> up<00:01:37.440> and

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
think our go-to sensor is warming up and

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.260 
think our go-to sensor is warming up and
it<00:01:38.560> does<00:01:38.740> have<00:01:38.980> to<00:01:39.010> be<00:01:39.160> at<00:01:39.460> at<00:01:39.550> least<00:01:39.760> 600

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
it does have to be at at least 600

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.320 
it does have to be at at least 600
degrees<00:01:40.510> Fahrenheit<00:01:40.540> for<00:01:41.260> this<00:01:41.380> test<00:01:41.680> to<00:01:41.770> work

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
degrees Fahrenheit for this test to work

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.580 
degrees Fahrenheit for this test to work
I'm<00:01:43.330> gonna<00:01:43.510> go<00:01:43.690> ahead<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:44.110> open<00:01:44.170> up<00:01:44.410> the

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
I'm gonna go ahead and open up the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.800 
I'm gonna go ahead and open up the
vacuum<00:01:44.800> port<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:45.700> we<00:01:45.820> see<00:01:46.030> what<00:01:46.240> numbers

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
vacuum port and we see what numbers

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.310 
vacuum port and we see what numbers
dropped<00:01:47.170> as<00:01:47.410> we<00:01:47.590> wean<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.920> mixture

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.190 

yep<00:01:51.800> way<00:01:52.640> down

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
yep way down

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.320 
yep way down
put<00:01:54.740> your<00:01:54.890> finger<00:01:55.189> over<00:01:55.220> plug<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:55.909> vacuum

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
put your finger over plug the vacuum

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.050 
put your finger over plug the vacuum
leak<00:01:56.509> numbers<00:01:57.409> go<00:01:57.560> back<00:01:57.740> up<00:01:58.869> way<00:01:59.869> down

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
leak numbers go back up way down

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.410 
leak numbers go back up way down
and<00:02:03.159> now<00:02:04.159> as<00:02:04.310> you<00:02:04.340> can<00:02:04.460> see<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.939> engine<00:02:05.270> almost

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
and now as you can see the engine almost

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.780 
and now as you can see the engine almost
stalled<00:02:05.960> on<00:02:06.200> this<00:02:06.439> testing<00:02:06.860> on<00:02:07.009> some<00:02:07.280> vehicles

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
stalled on this testing on some vehicles

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.359 
stalled on this testing on some vehicles
that<00:02:07.880> actually<00:02:08.270> would<00:02:08.479> stall<00:02:08.780> so<00:02:09.770> on<00:02:10.099> those

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
that actually would stall so on those

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.920 
that actually would stall so on those
vehicles<00:02:10.729> we'll<00:02:11.209> have<00:02:11.330> to<00:02:11.480> do<00:02:11.660> something

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
vehicles we'll have to do something

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.380 
vehicles we'll have to do something
called<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.380> propane<00:02:12.890> enrichment<00:02:13.520> test<00:02:13.760> sir

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
called the propane enrichment test sir

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.089 
called the propane enrichment test sir
and<00:02:14.630> so<00:02:14.959> I'm<00:02:15.080> going<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.319> take<00:02:15.530> this<00:02:15.739> valve

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
and so I'm going to take this valve

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.280 
and so I'm going to take this valve
which<00:02:16.430> we<00:02:16.580> have<00:02:16.760> screwed<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.780> propane

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
which we have screwed to a propane

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.559 
which we have screwed to a propane
bottle<00:02:18.680> it's<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.890> regular<00:02:19.250> propane<00:02:19.760> model<00:02:19.970> with

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
bottle it's a regular propane model with

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.270 
bottle it's a regular propane model with
a<00:02:20.660> special<00:02:21.110> valve<00:02:21.349> on<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.620> for<00:02:21.890> doing<00:02:22.099> this

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
a special valve on it for doing this

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:30.370 
a special valve on it for doing this
test<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:22.940> connect<00:02:23.599> it<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:24.590> vacuum<00:02:24.980> port

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.800 

you<00:02:30.890> know<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.070> slight<00:02:31.640> vacuum<00:02:31.880> leak<00:02:32.300> introduced

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
you know a slight vacuum leak introduced

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.260 
you know a slight vacuum leak introduced
so<00:02:33.530> we're<00:02:33.680> seeing<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:34.010> real<00:02:34.190> low<00:02:34.490> voltage<00:02:35.090> on

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
so we're seeing a real low voltage on

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.450 
so we're seeing a real low voltage on
