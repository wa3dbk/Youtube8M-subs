 bags decoration jewelry and seventh 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.770
 day is shoes as you see every day 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.030
 we will pay attention to certain 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.760
 clothing categories 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.000
 I beg you to follow this plan 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.450
 and don't try to eat the whole elephant 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.350
 wholly or rather scrub everything out of the closet a 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:10.209
 then torment all day looking over a bunch 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.209
 blouses you babe summer hats 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.550
 gradualness is our main 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.470
 principle here by the way we smoothly switched to 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.470
 principles that we will 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.190
 be guided when establishing order 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.569
 cabinet and so the first principle is 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.319
 gradual about him already said yet 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:33.050
 tell only small steps only 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.989
 adequate assessment of their strength and 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.269
 time stocks 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.849
 second principle is an objective view or 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.230
 view from the outside 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.580
 try to parse your stuff 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.040
 introduce yourself 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.660
 Well, for example, leading programs, remove 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.010
 this immediately or some other 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.739
 like you do not understand your own but someone's 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.130
 you have no other clothes 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.349
 attachments to these things with such 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.019
 positions are much easier to part with 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.810
 beloved old stretched with 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:09.319
 veterans or torn so hot 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.799
 I adore them slippers try me 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.260
 I'm sure you will succeed 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:18.200
 the next principle is a good mood 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.380
 if you proceed with the analysis of the cabinet in 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.989
 bad temper it will bring 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.579
 you only negative emotions before 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:30.590
 how to get started turn on good music 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:34.130
 You can invite a girlfriend or your 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.150
 children to measure and dance get from 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:41.180
 the process of pleasure if you make out 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.310
 socks can spend a couple developing 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.280
 activities with a child for example find there 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.750
 couple or more less or puppet 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.049
 theater of socks 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.959
 if these are your evening dresses 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:56.030
 arrange catwalk in front of her husband get 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.380
 pleasure from the process itself and 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.940
 the result will surely please you 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.769
 following principle 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.910
 non-standard solutions before 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:10.400
 start melting rewrite all places 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.549
 where are stored where are your clothes 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.030
 think how you can place it by 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:19.880
 different what surface the shelf boxes 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.580
 It can be used to store possible 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.650
 even draw a scheme 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.890
 see if you have hung enough 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.130
 maybe it's worth taking a walk in everybody's favorite 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.740
 kei or another similar store and buy 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.600
 special drawers for storing socks 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.310
 or beautiful laundry baskets 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:47.310
 following principle 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:50.460
 I called him five boxes sorting out my 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:55.050
 things pack them a few boxes 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.780
 or packages as you wish, I offer 5 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.240
 you can reduce or add them 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.990
 the number of the main thing that we started 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.900
 sort the contents of our cabinets like 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:10.050
 just one of the bags or boxes 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.330
 fill try that day from 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.250
 him get rid of carry in the garage not 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.190
 I know to church 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.380
 charitable organization 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.290
 take a picture and put up for sale 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.780
 sew up agree with someone experiencing 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.390
 In general, to do everything as soon as possible from 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.710
 this box get rid of and so what 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:35.460
 this is five boxes the first is back to 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:38.460
 closet second give away third sell 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.190
 fourth throw out and 5 alter or 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.560
 repair again I repeat that 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.660
 boxes you may have more or 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.410
 less but very cool if you still 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:53.370
 spread out the contents of some containers 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:58.910
 its cabinets and the next and last 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:02.280
 principle is questions ask yourself a question and 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.920
 when considering things and definitions in 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.050

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:37.979
 inscriptions give sell or even 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:40.650
 throw out and the last question i have 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:43.289
