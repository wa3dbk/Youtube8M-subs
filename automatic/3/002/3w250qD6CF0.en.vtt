00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
you got your zoom unit it's like that

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.580 
you got your zoom unit it's like that
turco<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:43.960> mean<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.350> orange<00:02:45.300> color<00:02:46.300> and<00:02:46.630> then

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
part is just plastic it's just a

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.979 
part is just plastic it's just a
malleable<00:04:12.670> plastic<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.630> on<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.810> back<00:04:13.959> you

so<00:04:17.180> really<00:04:17.450> lightweight<00:04:19.090> was<00:04:20.090> surprising<00:04:20.630> how

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
so really lightweight was surprising how

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.960 
so really lightweight was surprising how
light<00:04:21.050> they<00:04:21.260> are<00:04:21.290> which<00:04:21.830> is<00:04:21.860> which<00:04:22.310> is<00:04:22.340> good<00:04:22.700> I

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
light they are which is which is good I

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.330 
light they are which is which is good I
know<00:04:23.420> that<00:04:23.540> the<00:04:23.990> whole<00:04:24.200> line<00:04:24.500> is<00:04:24.740> going<00:04:24.980> to

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
know that the whole line is going to

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.760 
know that the whole line is going to
that<00:04:26.180> even<00:04:26.450> though<00:04:26.660> it's<00:04:26.810> a<00:04:26.900> it<00:04:27.260> looks<00:04:27.560> like<00:04:27.740> a

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
that even though it's a it looks like a

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.030 
that even though it's a it looks like a
bulky<00:04:28.190> shoe<00:04:28.430> going<00:04:28.880> to<00:04:29.710> lighter<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:30.920> lighter

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
bulky shoe going to lighter and lighter

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.950 
bulky shoe going to lighter and lighter
materials<00:04:31.700> lighter<00:04:32.150> execution<00:04:32.840> on

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
materials lighter execution on

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.460 
materials lighter execution on
everything<00:04:33.380> so<00:04:34.220> lots<00:04:35.210> of<00:04:35.360> flywire<00:04:35.870> lots<00:04:36.320> of

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
everything so lots of flywire lots of

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.060 
everything so lots of flywire lots of
