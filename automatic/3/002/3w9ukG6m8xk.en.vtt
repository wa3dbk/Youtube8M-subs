we're back with Mark Nelson and today

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.950 
we're back with Mark Nelson and today
we're<00:00:07.770> talking<00:00:07.919> about<00:00:08.189> DIY<00:00:08.730> beads<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.570> Mark

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
we're talking about DIY beads and Mark

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.360 
we're talking about DIY beads and Mark
as<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.170> metal<00:00:10.469> Smith<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:10.889> you're<00:00:11.040> going<00:00:11.250> to

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
as a metal Smith and you're going to

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.680 
as a metal Smith and you're going to
show<00:00:11.550> us<00:00:11.700> how<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.880> make<00:00:12.030> some<00:00:12.360> beads<00:00:12.570> from

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
show us how to make some beads from

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.339 
show us how to make some beads from
scratch

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
scratch

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.530 
scratch
I<00:00:13.380> will<00:00:13.650> alright<00:00:14.130> so<00:00:14.670> these<00:00:14.759> are<00:00:14.940> some<00:00:15.120> samples

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
I will alright so these are some samples

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.660 
I will alright so these are some samples
and<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.839> looks<00:00:15.990> like<00:00:16.139> silver<00:00:16.440> it's<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.310> silver

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
and it looks like silver it's a silver

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.609 
and it looks like silver it's a silver
to<00:00:17.880> type<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.150> source<00:00:18.449> called<00:00:18.600> argenteum<00:00:19.170> okay

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
to type a source called argenteum okay

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.260 
to type a source called argenteum okay
so<00:00:19.680> that's<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.100> special<00:00:20.220> type<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.670> silver<00:00:21.240> that

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
so that's a special type of silver that

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.120 
so that's a special type of silver that
has<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.289> different<00:00:22.590> alloy<00:00:22.830> that's

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
has a it's a different alloy that's

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.550 
has a it's a different alloy that's
right<00:00:23.369> exactly<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> process<00:00:25.170> has<00:00:25.320> taught

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
right exactly and the process has taught

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.170 
right exactly and the process has taught
to<00:00:25.680> me<00:00:25.769> by<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.920> friend<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.189> mine<00:00:26.250> rhonda<00:00:26.910> Coryell

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
to me by a friend of mine rhonda Coryell

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.000 
to me by a friend of mine rhonda Coryell
mm-hmm<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.900> it's<00:00:28.109> all<00:00:28.260> fusing<00:00:28.710> there's<00:00:28.859> no

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
mm-hmm and it's all fusing there's no

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.339 
mm-hmm and it's all fusing there's no
solder<00:00:29.310> mm-hmm<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.390> all<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.630> these<00:00:30.840> beads<00:00:31.140> are

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
solder mm-hmm so all of these beads are

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.319 
solder mm-hmm so all of these beads are
fused<00:00:31.619> together<00:00:31.740> I'll<00:00:32.309> fuse<00:00:32.520> beautiful

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
fused together I'll fuse beautiful

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.090 
fused together I'll fuse beautiful
beautiful<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.110> how<00:00:34.230> do<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.350> get<00:00:34.559> started<00:00:34.800> what

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
beautiful so how do we get started what

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.470 
beautiful so how do we get started what
does<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.399> look<00:00:35.550> like<00:00:35.610> before<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.180> begin

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
does this look like before you begin

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.790 
does this look like before you begin
well<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.960> very<00:00:37.079> beginning<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.469> gonna<00:00:37.559> start

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
well the very beginning you gonna start

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.819 
well the very beginning you gonna start
with<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> disc<00:00:38.190> mm-hmm<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.210> could<00:00:39.390> be<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
with a disc mm-hmm and this could be a

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.709 
with a disc mm-hmm and this could be a
bot<00:00:40.829> disc<00:00:41.160> cut<00:00:41.910> or<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.149> can<00:00:42.239> use<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.510> disc

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
bot disc cut or you can use a disc

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.660 
bot disc cut or you can use a disc
cutter<00:00:42.930> mm-hmm<00:00:43.590> if<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.890> cut<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.160> by<00:00:44.219> hand<00:00:44.460> you

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
cutter mm-hmm if you cut it by hand you

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.279 
cutter mm-hmm if you cut it by hand you
want<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> try<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.390> as<00:00:45.480> precise<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.079> can

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
want to try and be as precise as you can

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.930 
want to try and be as precise as you can
because<00:00:46.890> these<00:00:47.070> are<00:00:47.219> two<00:00:47.399> halves<00:00:47.640> are<00:00:47.760> gonna

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
because these are two halves are gonna

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.740 
because these are two halves are gonna
have<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.300> match

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
have to match

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.750 
have to match
okay<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.100> consistency<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.219> key<00:00:50.460> here

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
okay so consistency is the key here

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.970 
okay so consistency is the key here
right<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> first<00:00:51.989> step<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.590> course<00:00:52.620> is

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
right and the first step is of course is

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.369 
right and the first step is of course is
to<00:00:53.070> make<00:00:53.190> kind<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.489> half<00:00:53.670> dome<00:00:53.940> okay<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.199> so

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
to make kind of a half dome okay and so

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.319 
to make kind of a half dome okay and so
we'll<00:00:55.500> take<00:00:55.590> our<00:00:55.649> dapping<00:00:56.129> block<00:00:56.160> mm-hmm<00:00:57.239> and

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
we'll take our dapping block mm-hmm and

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.939 
we'll take our dapping block mm-hmm and
I<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.739> tame<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.890> hair<00:00:59.100> over<00:00:59.250> there<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.800> we're

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
I can tame the hair over there and we're

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.709 
I can tame the hair over there and we're
just<00:01:02.010> gonna<00:01:02.160> snip<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.570> know<00:01:03.660> it

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
just gonna snip I have to you know it

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.710 
just gonna snip I have to you know it
could<00:01:03.809> be<00:01:03.840> half<00:01:04.080> dome<00:01:04.409> or<00:01:04.710> too<00:01:05.159> slight<00:01:05.430> little

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
could be half dome or too slight little

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.550 
could be half dome or too slight little
spheres<00:01:06.720> however<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.140> want<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.350> make<00:01:07.439> your

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
spheres however you want to make your

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.640 
spheres however you want to make your
bead<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:09.020> you're<00:01:10.020> gonna<00:01:10.110> make<00:01:10.320> go<00:01:10.439> through

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
bead and you're gonna make go through

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.910 
bead and you're gonna make go through
all<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> steps<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:12.650> once<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.770> get

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
all the steps to do that once you get

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.120 
all the steps to do that once you get
all<00:01:14.070> these<00:01:14.220> done<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:16.409> next<00:01:16.590> step<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.920> gonna<00:01:17.009> be

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
all these done the next step is gonna be

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.780 
all these done the next step is gonna be
to<00:01:17.369> create<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:19.009> okay<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:20.460> people<00:01:20.580> who

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
to create a okay so for people who

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.950 
to create a okay so for people who
haven't<00:01:20.970> seen<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.299> before<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.930> a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
haven't seen this before this is a

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.080 
haven't seen this before this is a
dapping<00:01:22.350> block<00:01:22.380> did<00:01:22.920> dapping<00:01:23.580> block<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.970> a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
dapping block did dapping block is a

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.270 
dapping block did dapping block is a
dapping<00:01:24.420> punch<00:01:24.659> okay<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.680> there<00:01:26.250> are

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.410 
little bit of a gap okay miss of your
metal<00:01:37.170> okay<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:39.030> too<00:01:40.280> too<00:01:41.280> big<00:01:41.579> you'll

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
metal okay if it's too too big you'll

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.499 
metal okay if it's too too big you'll
damage<00:01:42.630> both<00:01:43.049> oh<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.350> see<00:01:43.829> okay

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
damage both oh I see okay

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.760 
damage both oh I see okay
so<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:45.899> keep<00:01:46.170> going<00:01:46.350> through<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
so and you just keep going through the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.190 
so and you just keep going through the
different<00:01:46.890> sizes<00:01:47.689> you'll<00:01:48.689> start<00:01:48.960> at<00:01:49.079> one

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
different sizes you'll start at one

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.440 
different sizes you'll start at one
point<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.710> go<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.829> another<00:01:50.159> until<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.210> get<00:01:51.360> to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
point and go to another until you get to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.719 
point and go to another until you get to
the<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:52.079> sphere<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.590> like<00:01:52.799> okay<00:01:53.070> so

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the the sphere that you like okay so

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.480 
the the sphere that you like okay so
these<00:01:53.970> are<00:01:54.270> actually<00:01:54.659> graduated<00:01:55.590> right<00:01:55.890> okay

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
these are actually graduated right okay

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.639 
these are actually graduated right okay
exactly<00:01:56.579> mm-hmm<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.869> when<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.409> get<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.590> a

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
exactly mm-hmm and when you get to a

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.560 
exactly mm-hmm and when you get to a
point<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.969> profile<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.479> you

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
point that you have the profile that you

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.810 
point that you have the profile that you
like<00:02:00.750> mm-hmm<00:02:01.500> here<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.430> go<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.610> drill<00:02:02.790> your

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
like mm-hmm here you go and drill your

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.480 
like mm-hmm here you go and drill your
hole<00:02:03.140> because<00:02:04.140> we<00:02:04.290> are<00:02:04.439> going<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.770> put<00:02:04.920> heat<00:02:05.250> on

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
hole because we are going to put heat on

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.650 
hole because we are going to put heat on
a<00:02:05.600> closed<00:02:07.129> space<00:02:08.129> mm-hmm<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.060> heat<00:02:09.300> will<00:02:09.390> can

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
a closed space mm-hmm the heat will can

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.360 
a closed space mm-hmm the heat will can
expand<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.349> can<00:02:10.440> cause<00:02:10.619> problems<00:02:11.099> okay<00:02:11.340> so

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
expand and can cause problems okay so

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.130 
expand and can cause problems okay so
you<00:02:11.550> do<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.879> hole<00:02:12.060> first<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.720> that

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
you do the hole first and that

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.720 
you do the hole first and that
looks<00:02:13.380> like<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.530> bead<00:02:13.770> cap<00:02:13.800> could<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:14.550> use<00:02:14.670> it

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
looks like a bead cap could you use it

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.940 
looks like a bead cap could you use it
as<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:14.970> bead<00:02:15.180> cap<00:02:15.290> okay<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.350> just<00:02:16.470> stop<00:02:16.770> right

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
as a bead cap okay you just stop right

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.440 
as a bead cap okay you just stop right
here<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.100> use<00:02:17.250> it<00:02:17.370> as<00:02:17.459> B<00:02:17.640> cap<00:02:17.880> or<00:02:18.150> keep<00:02:18.330> on

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
here and use it as B cap or keep on

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.080 
here and use it as B cap or keep on
going<00:02:18.780> okay<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:19.410> what's<00:02:20.069> next<00:02:20.160> next<00:02:20.640> thing<00:02:20.880> is

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
going okay so what's next next thing is

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.420 
going okay so what's next next thing is
we<00:02:21.330> got<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.540> make<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.690> flat<00:02:21.959> edge<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:23.190> we<00:02:23.310> have

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
we got to make a flat edge so we have

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.660 
we got to make a flat edge so we have
two<00:02:23.610> flat<00:02:23.880> edges<00:02:24.060> at<00:02:24.360> Miam<00:02:24.720> together<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:26.340> you

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
two flat edges at Miam together and you

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.840 
two flat edges at Miam together and you
just<00:02:26.760> take<00:02:26.910> some<00:02:27.030> sandpaper<00:02:31.730> it's<00:02:32.730> gonna

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
just take some sandpaper it's gonna

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.650 
just take some sandpaper it's gonna
stand<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.300> even<00:02:34.020> just<00:02:35.000> going<00:02:36.000> back<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.209> forth

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
stand it even just going back and forth

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
stand it even just going back and forth
you're<00:02:36.840> going<00:02:36.990> to<00:02:37.050> actually<00:02:37.140> end<00:02:37.320> up<00:02:37.560> with

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
you're going to actually end up with

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.080 
you're going to actually end up with
that<00:02:37.770> oh<00:02:37.920> because<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.580> might<00:02:38.730> be<00:02:38.760> putting

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
that oh because you might be putting

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.250 
that oh because you might be putting
more<00:02:39.209> pressure<00:02:39.360> on<00:02:39.600> one<00:02:39.810> side<00:02:40.020> or<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.230> other

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
more pressure on one side or the other

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.180 
more pressure on one side or the other
exactly<00:02:40.920> okay<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:41.870> how<00:02:42.870> do<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.110> how<00:02:44.040> do<00:02:44.100> you

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
exactly okay so how do you how do you

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.070 
exactly okay so how do you how do you
make<00:02:44.250> sure<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.700> both<00:02:44.880> of<00:02:44.940> your<00:02:45.209> halves<00:02:45.600> are

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
make sure that both of your halves are

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.780 
make sure that both of your halves are
the<00:02:46.230> same<00:02:46.470> do<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.310> know<00:02:47.400> what<00:02:47.489> I<00:02:47.520> mean<00:02:47.610> that

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
the same do you know what I mean that

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.370 
the same do you know what I mean that
they're<00:02:47.910> gonna<00:02:48.000> fit<00:02:48.239> together<00:02:48.540> well<00:02:49.050> when<00:02:49.290> you

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
they're gonna fit together well when you

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.660 
they're gonna fit together well when you
start<00:02:49.620> working<00:02:49.770> you'll<00:02:50.010> have<00:02:50.160> one<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.550> can

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
start working you'll have one you can

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.360 
start working you'll have one you can
have<00:02:50.820> another<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:51.720> just<00:02:51.900> kind<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.370> just

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
have another and you just kind of just

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.340 
have another and you just kind of just
sort<00:02:53.820> of<00:02:53.880> match<00:02:54.090> them<00:02:54.360> as<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.600> go<00:02:54.720> along<00:02:54.840> and

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
sort of match them as you go along and

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.500 
sort of match them as you go along and
then<00:02:55.590> if<00:02:55.890> one<00:02:56.220> needs<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.610> be<00:02:56.760> adaptable<00:02:57.239> you

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
then if one needs to be adaptable you

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.670 
then if one needs to be adaptable you
would<00:02:57.660> just<00:02:57.810> continue<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.350> hammer<00:02:58.530> it

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
would just continue to hammer it

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.250 
would just continue to hammer it
continue<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.190> hammer<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.640> or<00:03:00.000> sand<00:03:00.300> more<00:03:00.540> okay

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
continue to hammer it or sand more okay

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.110 
continue to hammer it or sand more okay
because<00:03:01.950> that'll<00:03:02.280> bring<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.820> edges

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
because that'll bring that the edges

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.120 
because that'll bring that the edges
into<00:03:03.360> alignment<00:03:03.600> mm-hmm<00:03:04.380> even<00:03:04.680> better<00:03:04.890> then

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
into alignment mm-hmm even better then

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.820 
into alignment mm-hmm even better then
mm-hmm<00:03:05.850> but<00:03:06.269> you<00:03:06.360> definitely<00:03:06.570> need<00:03:06.830> some

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
mm-hmm but you definitely need some

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.860 
mm-hmm but you definitely need some
holes<00:03:08.040> for<00:03:08.190> at<00:03:08.340> least<00:03:08.400> one<00:03:08.640> hole<00:03:08.820> mm<00:03:09.330> about<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
holes for at least one hole mm about the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.479 
holes for at least one hole mm about the
size<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.320> cord<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.010> you're<00:03:11.130> gonna<00:03:11.250> put

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
size of the cord that you're gonna put

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.820 
size of the cord that you're gonna put
through<00:03:11.670> there<00:03:11.820> okay<00:03:12.390> okay<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:13.470> you're<00:03:13.650> just

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
through there okay okay and you're just

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.890 
through there okay okay and you're just
using<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.190> drill<00:03:14.400> just<00:03:15.030> using<00:03:15.300> a<00:03:15.390> drill<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.630> could

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
using a drill just using a drill I could

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.770 
using a drill just using a drill I could
normally<00:03:16.140> would<00:03:16.320> okay<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.570> so<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.690> next

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
normally would okay and so the next

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.259 
normally would okay and so the next
thing<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:18.989> need<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.230> do<00:03:19.380> is<00:03:19.590> solder<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.269> actually

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
thing I need to do is solder it actually

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.270 
thing I need to do is solder it actually
I<00:03:21.299> didn't<00:03:21.630> say<00:03:21.720> solder<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:22.170> fusing<00:03:22.470> fusing<00:03:23.130> it

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
I didn't say solder is fusing fusing it

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.180 
I didn't say solder is fusing fusing it
and<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.120> have<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.329> do<00:03:24.480> this<00:03:24.660> on<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.190> charcoal

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
and you have to do this on a charcoal

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.759 
and you have to do this on a charcoal
block<00:03:26.340> okay<00:03:27.000> oh<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.420> won't<00:03:27.510> work<00:03:27.720> I'm<00:03:28.650> gonna

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
block okay oh it won't work I'm gonna

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.360 
block okay oh it won't work I'm gonna
use<00:03:28.920> our<00:03:29.070> safety<00:03:29.700> glasses<00:03:29.880> here<00:03:30.390> okay<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:32.190> the

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
use our safety glasses here okay and the

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.490 
use our safety glasses here okay and the
charcoal<00:03:32.700> block<00:03:32.970> works<00:03:33.269> with<00:03:33.780> argenteum

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
charcoal block works with argenteum

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.620 
charcoal block works with argenteum
because<00:03:35.280> of<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.730> chemical<00:03:36.209> there's<00:03:36.540> a

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
because of the chemical there's a

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.180 
because of the chemical there's a
chemical<00:03:37.110> process<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.530> happens<00:03:38.040> there

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
chemical process that happens there

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.569 
chemical process that happens there
right

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
right

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.910 
right
it's<00:03:38.730> amazing<00:03:39.180> mm-hmm<00:03:39.930> okay<00:03:40.620> that's<00:03:40.799> what

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
it's amazing mm-hmm okay that's what

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.229 
it's amazing mm-hmm okay that's what
I've<00:03:41.040> done<00:03:41.160> is<00:03:41.310> I've<00:03:41.400> taken<00:03:41.430> these<00:03:41.820> two<00:03:42.030> pieces

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
I've done is I've taken these two pieces

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.199 
I've done is I've taken these two pieces
mm-hmm<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.739> applied<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.459> little<00:03:44.760> bit<00:03:44.850> of<00:03:44.940> flux

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
mm-hmm and applied a little bit of flux

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.220 
mm-hmm and applied a little bit of flux
mm-hmm

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
mm-hmm

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.170 
mm-hmm
right<00:03:46.920> here<00:03:47.070> on<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.220> edge<00:03:48.590> yeah<00:03:50.030> and<00:03:51.030> you're

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
right here on the edge yeah and you're

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.970 
right here on the edge yeah and you're
just<00:03:51.269> gonna<00:03:51.420> put<00:03:51.780> that<00:03:51.810> on<00:03:52.049> there<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.470> this

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
just gonna put that on there and this

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.560 
just gonna put that on there and this
flux<00:03:53.190> kind<00:03:53.610> of<00:03:53.730> would<00:03:53.970> you<00:03:54.000> consider<00:03:54.329> it<00:03:54.510> a

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
flux kind of would you consider it a

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.770 
flux kind of would you consider it a
binder<00:03:54.959> or<00:03:55.470> that's<00:03:55.739> how<00:03:56.700> what<00:03:57.150> is<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.390> exactly

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
binder or that's how what is it exactly

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.460 
binder or that's how what is it exactly
what<00:03:58.320> is<00:03:58.440> this<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.650> wetting<00:03:58.950> agent<00:03:59.160> it<00:04:00.000> also

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
what is this a wetting agent it also

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.600 
what is this a wetting agent it also
allows<00:04:01.470> when<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.739> metal<00:04:01.950> flows<00:04:02.160> it<00:04:02.400> allows

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
allows when the metal flows it allows

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.030 
allows when the metal flows it allows
the<00:04:02.790> metal<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.120> flow<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.769> keeps<00:04:04.950> the

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
the metal to flow and it keeps the

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.340 
the metal to flow and it keeps the
oxygen<00:04:05.519> away<00:04:05.660> okay<00:04:06.690> because<00:04:07.019> when<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.230> have

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
oxygen away okay because when you have

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.580 
oxygen away okay because when you have
dirt<00:04:07.620> or<00:04:08.030> oxidation<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.900> metal<00:04:10.200> won't<00:04:10.380> flow

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
dirt or oxidation the metal won't flow

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.080 
dirt or oxidation the metal won't flow
it<00:04:10.769> would<00:04:10.890> prevent<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.310> from<00:04:11.340> fusing<00:04:11.850> in<00:04:11.940> that

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
it would prevent it from fusing in that

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.060 
it would prevent it from fusing in that
spot<00:04:12.450> exactly<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:13.440> really<00:04:13.709> you're<00:04:13.859> joining

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
spot exactly so really you're joining

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.729 
spot exactly so really you're joining
these<00:04:14.400> they<00:04:15.120> become<00:04:15.450> one<00:04:15.720> piece<00:04:15.989> it'll<00:04:16.350> be<00:04:16.500> one

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
these they become one piece it'll be one

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.920 
these they become one piece it'll be one
entire<00:04:17.039> piece<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.310> no<00:04:17.579> solder<00:04:17.910> there<00:04:18.750> won't

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
entire piece and no solder there won't

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.050 
entire piece and no solder there won't
be<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.079> solder<00:04:19.410> seam<00:04:19.680> later<00:04:19.950> on<00:04:20.190> mm-hmm<00:04:20.880> cuz

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
be a solder seam later on mm-hmm cuz

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.580 
be a solder seam later on mm-hmm cuz
it'll<00:04:21.180> never<00:04:21.450> be<00:04:21.690> there<00:04:21.870> mm-hmm

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
it'll never be there mm-hmm

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.110 
it'll never be there mm-hmm
because<00:04:23.160> there's<00:04:23.340> no<00:04:23.490> solder<00:04:23.729> you<00:04:23.940> could

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
because there's no solder you could

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.120 
because there's no solder you could
almost<00:04:24.240> even<00:04:24.690> reuse<00:04:24.840> this<00:04:25.229> later<00:04:25.470> if<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:25.800> want

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
almost even reuse this later if you want

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.410 
almost even reuse this later if you want
turn<00:04:26.340> it<00:04:26.460> into<00:04:26.580> something<00:04:26.850> else<00:04:27.240> it's

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
turn it into something else it's

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.720 
turn it into something else it's
certainly<00:04:27.630> good<00:04:27.840> hmm<00:04:28.320> I<00:04:28.470> mean<00:04:29.310> Tuesday<00:04:29.550> I'm

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
certainly good hmm I mean Tuesday I'm

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.130 
certainly good hmm I mean Tuesday I'm
gonna<00:04:29.940> use<00:04:30.060> kind<00:04:30.240> of<00:04:30.330> a<00:04:30.390> large<00:04:30.630> flame<00:04:30.900> but<00:04:31.050> it's

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
gonna use kind of a large flame but it's

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.050 
gonna use kind of a large flame but it's
gonna<00:04:31.230> be<00:04:31.290> kind<00:04:31.440> of<00:04:31.530> bushy<00:04:31.800> so<00:04:32.670> it's<00:04:32.820> not<00:04:32.910> going

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
gonna be kind of bushy so it's not going

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.830 
gonna be kind of bushy so it's not going
to<00:04:33.150> be<00:04:33.270> a<00:04:34.260> very<00:04:34.740> hot<00:04:34.950> flame<00:04:35.250> okay<00:04:35.760> and<00:04:36.330> what

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
to be a very hot flame okay and what

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.350 
to be a very hot flame okay and what
type<00:04:37.020> of<00:04:37.050> torch<00:04:37.380> is<00:04:37.530> this<00:04:37.710> this<00:04:38.160> is<00:04:38.340> a<00:04:38.370> oxy

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
type of torch is this this is a oxy

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.210 
type of torch is this this is a oxy
propane<00:04:39.930> torch<00:04:40.610> and<00:04:41.610> you<00:04:42.540> can<00:04:42.690> adjust<00:04:42.780> it

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
propane torch and you can adjust it

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.590 
propane torch and you can adjust it
mm-hmm<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.520> different<00:04:44.910> size<00:04:45.120> of<00:04:45.270> flames<00:04:45.510> I

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
mm-hmm the different size of flames I

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.120 
mm-hmm the different size of flames I
like<00:04:45.720> this<00:04:45.840> for<00:04:46.050> doing<00:04:46.260> this<00:04:46.350> because<00:04:46.710> I<00:04:46.890> can

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
like this for doing this because I can

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.040 
like this for doing this because I can
get<00:04:47.310> anywhere<00:04:48.030> from<00:04:48.090> really<00:04:48.450> hot<00:04:48.630> and<00:04:48.780> small

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
get anywhere from really hot and small

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.350 
get anywhere from really hot and small
mm-hmm<00:04:49.710> they<00:04:49.980> can<00:04:50.130> like<00:04:50.640> push<00:04:50.970> you<00:04:51.120> oh<00:04:51.240> you

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
mm-hmm they can like push you oh you

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.660 
mm-hmm they can like push you oh you
have<00:04:51.540> a<00:04:51.570> lot<00:04:51.750> of<00:04:51.870> control<00:04:52.260> over<00:04:52.410> the<00:04:52.680> flame<00:04:53.400> a

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
have a lot of control over the flame a

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.390 
have a lot of control over the flame a
lot<00:04:53.910> of<00:04:54.030> control<00:04:54.420> okay<00:04:54.980> so<00:04:55.980> now<00:04:56.070> what<00:04:56.220> we<00:04:56.310> need

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
lot of control okay so now what we need

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.790 
lot of control okay so now what we need
to<00:04:56.460> do<00:04:56.610> is<00:04:56.730> kind<00:04:56.880> of<00:04:57.000> come<00:04:57.150> in<00:04:57.270> here<00:04:57.510> and<00:04:58.380> point

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
to do is kind of come in here and point

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.350 
to do is kind of come in here and point
underneath<00:04:59.100> mm-hmm<00:05:00.590> it's<00:05:01.590> kind<00:05:01.770> of<00:05:01.830> rotate<00:05:02.160> it

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
underneath mm-hmm it's kind of rotate it

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.420 
underneath mm-hmm it's kind of rotate it
now<00:05:03.360> one<00:05:03.480> of<00:05:03.510> the<00:05:03.600> cool<00:05:03.750> things<00:05:03.780> about<00:05:04.430> fusing

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
now one of the cool things about fusing

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.860 
now one of the cool things about fusing
this<00:05:05.550> instead<00:05:05.850> of<00:05:05.910> soldering<00:05:06.300> if<00:05:06.510> I<00:05:06.630> had<00:05:06.780> to

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
this instead of soldering if I had to

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.410 
this instead of soldering if I had to
solder<00:05:07.080> this<00:05:07.410> I'd<00:05:08.340> have<00:05:08.430> to<00:05:08.640> use<00:05:08.670> binding<00:05:09.270> wire

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
solder this I'd have to use binding wire

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.340 
solder this I'd have to use binding wire
and<00:05:10.460> I'll<00:05:11.460> but<00:05:11.730> then<00:05:12.660> try<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:12.900> place<00:05:13.170> my

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
and I'll but then try and place my

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.910 
and I'll but then try and place my
solder<00:05:13.650> mm-hmm<00:05:15.080> and<00:05:16.080> yeah<00:05:16.470> I<00:05:16.500> don't<00:05:16.590> have<00:05:16.800> to

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
solder mm-hmm and yeah I don't have to

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.550 
solder mm-hmm and yeah I don't have to
with<00:05:17.040> this<00:05:17.190> I<00:05:17.570> just<00:05:18.570> would<00:05:18.900> you<00:05:18.930> say<00:05:19.170> this<00:05:19.320> is<00:05:19.380> a

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
with this I just would you say this is a

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.730 
with this I just would you say this is a
less<00:05:20.070> intricate<00:05:20.640> way<00:05:21.480> to<00:05:21.540> make<00:05:22.260> a<00:05:22.290> metal<00:05:22.590> bead

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
less intricate way to make a metal bead

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.430 
less intricate way to make a metal bead
it's<00:05:23.640> very<00:05:23.880> simple<00:05:24.660> it's<00:05:24.930> it's<00:05:25.260> not

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
it's very simple it's it's not

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.250 
it's very simple it's it's not
complicated<00:05:25.980> you<00:05:26.760> will<00:05:27.660> have<00:05:27.930> to<00:05:28.110> be

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
complicated you will have to be

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.980 
complicated you will have to be
sensitive<00:05:28.800> to<00:05:28.860> the<00:05:29.070> material<00:05:29.490> mm-hmm<00:05:30.000> and<00:05:30.120> see

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
sensitive to the material mm-hmm and see

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.180 
sensitive to the material mm-hmm and see
how<00:05:31.110> it's<00:05:31.260> starting<00:05:31.470> to<00:05:31.530> get<00:05:31.620> to<00:05:31.770> temperature

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
how it's starting to get to temperature

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.110 
how it's starting to get to temperature
here<00:05:32.400> mm-hmm

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
here mm-hmm

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.790 
here mm-hmm
so<00:05:33.270> we<00:05:33.390> gotta<00:05:33.510> be<00:05:33.600> careful<00:05:33.810> now<00:05:34.140> that<00:05:34.590> we<00:05:34.680> don't

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
so we gotta be careful now that we don't

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.760 
so we gotta be careful now that we don't
melt<00:05:35.070> it<00:05:35.310> okay<00:05:36.180> so<00:05:36.930> I<00:05:36.960> see<00:05:37.200> how<00:05:37.290> I'm<00:05:37.350> dancing

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
melt it okay so I see how I'm dancing

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.040 
melt it okay so I see how I'm dancing
the<00:05:37.860> flame<00:05:38.100> mm-hmm<00:05:38.790> and<00:05:39.510> it's<00:05:39.630> turning<00:05:39.900> a

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
the flame mm-hmm and it's turning a

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.840 
the flame mm-hmm and it's turning a
little<00:05:40.080> bit<00:05:40.350> red<00:05:40.500> yeah<00:05:41.070> a<00:05:41.220> little<00:05:41.430> bit<00:05:41.490> I<00:05:41.550> love

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
little bit red yeah a little bit I love

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.020 
little bit red yeah a little bit I love
a<00:05:41.880> shiny<00:05:42.270> mm-hmm<00:05:43.020> I<00:05:43.460> think<00:05:44.460> we're<00:05:44.790> just<00:05:44.820> about

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
a shiny mm-hmm I think we're just about

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.900 
a shiny mm-hmm I think we're just about
there<00:05:45.500> now<00:05:46.500> what's<00:05:46.710> important<00:05:47.160> hearing<00:05:47.400> is

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
there now what's important hearing is

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.030 
there now what's important hearing is
that<00:05:47.970> we<00:05:48.120> let<00:05:48.270> it<00:05:48.390> cool<00:05:48.600> and<00:05:49.440> do<00:05:49.740> you<00:05:49.800> let<00:05:49.950> it

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
that we let it cool and do you let it

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.560 
that we let it cool and do you let it
cool<00:05:50.160> on<00:05:50.370> the<00:05:50.460> block<00:05:50.670> I'll<00:05:51.120> let<00:05:51.300> it<00:05:51.330> cool<00:05:51.510> right

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
cool on the block I'll let it cool right

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.830 
cool on the block I'll let it cool right
there<00:05:52.020> mm-hmm<00:05:52.530> and<00:05:52.620> then<00:05:53.630> until<00:05:54.630> all<00:05:54.750> that

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
there mm-hmm and then until all that

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.870 
there mm-hmm and then until all that
redness<00:05:55.170> goes<00:05:55.260> hmm<00:05:56.100> then<00:05:56.310> I'll<00:05:56.400> quench<00:05:56.730> it<00:05:56.820> in

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
redness goes hmm then I'll quench it in

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.380 
redness goes hmm then I'll quench it in
the<00:05:56.940> water

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
the water

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.450 
the water
okay<00:05:57.750> and<00:05:58.110> what<00:05:58.560> happens<00:05:58.860> if<00:05:59.010> you<00:05:59.100> quench<00:05:59.340> it

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
okay and what happens if you quench it

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.950 
okay and what happens if you quench it
before<00:05:59.760> it's<00:05:59.880> completely<00:06:00.330> cool<00:06:00.510> it<00:06:00.780> could

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
before it's completely cool it could

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.770 
before it's completely cool it could
crumble<00:06:01.340> okay<00:06:02.340> cool<00:06:02.850> let's<00:06:03.270> take<00:06:03.360> a<00:06:03.480> look<00:06:03.660> at

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
crumble okay cool let's take a look at

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.900 
crumble okay cool let's take a look at
these<00:06:03.870> finished<00:06:04.260> beads<00:06:04.470> because<00:06:05.190> you<00:06:05.460> can<00:06:05.610> see

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
these finished beads because you can see

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.740 
these finished beads because you can see
they're<00:06:06.840> completely<00:06:07.160> solid<00:06:08.160> and<00:06:08.640> so<00:06:09.150> this<00:06:09.570> is

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
they're completely solid and so this is

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.600 
they're completely solid and so this is
a<00:06:09.930> little<00:06:10.290> bit<00:06:10.410> of<00:06:10.530> an<00:06:10.620> advanced<00:06:10.890> project<00:06:11.400> for

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
a little bit of an advanced project for

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.770 
a little bit of an advanced project for
somebody<00:06:11.760> who's<00:06:11.970> just<00:06:12.180> getting<00:06:12.270> started

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
somebody who's just getting started

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.900 
somebody who's just getting started
might<00:06:12.930> be<00:06:13.110> you<00:06:13.770> know<00:06:13.800> not<00:06:14.130> quite<00:06:14.160> ready<00:06:14.580> to<00:06:14.670> do

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
might be you know not quite ready to do

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.900 
might be you know not quite ready to do
soldering<00:06:15.480> this<00:06:16.140> is<00:06:16.290> a<00:06:16.370> next-level<00:06:17.370> type<00:06:17.790> of

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
soldering this is a next-level type of

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.070 
soldering this is a next-level type of
project<00:06:18.270> but<00:06:18.360> you<00:06:18.480> could<00:06:18.630> even<00:06:18.750> take<00:06:18.930> it

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
project but you could even take it

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.860 
project but you could even take it
farther<00:06:19.880> like<00:06:20.880> yeah<00:06:20.940> add<00:06:21.390> some<00:06:21.720> more

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
farther like yeah add some more

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.980 
farther like yeah add some more
embellishing<00:06:22.440> there<00:06:22.760> and<00:06:23.760> is<00:06:24.600> this<00:06:24.810> something

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
embellishing there and is this something

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.260 
embellishing there and is this something
that<00:06:25.290> you<00:06:25.410> do<00:06:25.590> after<00:06:25.890> you<00:06:26.250> have<00:06:26.400> the<00:06:26.520> base<00:06:26.670> bead

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
that you do after you have the base bead

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.870 
that you do after you have the base bead
complete<00:06:28.230> yes<00:06:28.560> this<00:06:28.860> is<00:06:29.070> all<00:06:29.220> done<00:06:29.460> after<00:06:29.640> the
