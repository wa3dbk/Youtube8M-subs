00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
debuted in TNA it just got worse for him

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.970 
debuted in TNA it just got worse for him
so<00:02:26.940> yeah<00:02:27.150> that's<00:02:27.270> basically<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.770> know

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980
