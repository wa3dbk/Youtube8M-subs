as you can see this is a symmetrical map
built<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.779> canvas<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.320> forged<00:00:25.619> eyelid<00:00:25.980> and

it has a very unique sleek look to it in
my<00:00:28.800> personal<00:00:29.039> opinion<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.730> really<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
my personal opinion I really like the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.179 
my personal opinion I really like the
structuring<00:00:31.170> he's<00:00:31.320> done<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.710> map<00:00:31.920> and

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
structuring he's done on this map and

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.830 
structuring he's done on this map and
the<00:00:32.279> layout<00:00:32.579> works<00:00:32.969> wonderfully<00:00:33.809> for

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
the layout works wonderfully for

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.299 
the layout works wonderfully for
some--for<00:00:34.200> before<00:00:34.680> game<00:00:34.890> play<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.250> I

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
some--for before game play and I

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.799 
some--for before game play and I
definitely<00:00:36.120> think<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.480> guys<00:00:36.630> are<00:00:36.719> gonna

enjoy this map so let's progress onto

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.880 
enjoy this map so let's progress onto
the<00:00:38.520> roof<00:00:38.670> showcase<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:40.230> as<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.559> see<00:00:40.710> here

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the roof showcase so as you can see here

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.560 
the roof showcase so as you can see here
the<00:00:41.100> middle<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> entire<00:00:42.030> map<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.300> kind<00:00:42.420> of

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
the middle of the entire map is kind of

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.360 
the middle of the entire map is kind of
dominated<00:00:43.140> by<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.410> really<00:00:43.710> cool<00:00:43.890> structure

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
dominated by this really cool structure

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.979 
dominated by this really cool structure
I<00:00:44.520> really<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:44.969> trouble<00:00:45.210> explaining<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.899> it

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
I really have trouble explaining it it

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.540 
I really have trouble explaining it it
feels<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.260> bit<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.590> some<00:00:46.950> kind<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.219> sale

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
feels a bit like a some kind of a sale

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.639 
feels a bit like a some kind of a sale
of<00:00:47.760> sorts<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.239> all<00:00:48.899> around<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.350> map<00:00:49.469> is

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
of sorts and all around the map is

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.319 
of sorts and all around the map is
filled<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:49.980> these<00:00:50.070> kind<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.370> circular<00:00:50.969> type

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
filled with these kind of circular type

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.450 
filled with these kind of circular type
of<00:00:51.539> very<00:00:52.140> smooth<00:00:52.530> structures<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.190> kind<00:00:53.399> of

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
of very smooth structures that kind of

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.520 
of very smooth structures that kind of
balance<00:00:53.820> everything<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.329> anyways<00:00:55.110> each<00:00:55.260> team

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
balance everything out anyways each team

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.930 
balance everything out anyways each team
has<00:00:55.680> their<00:00:55.829> own<00:00:55.860> independent<00:00:56.489> bases<00:00:56.820> since

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
has their own independent bases since

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.910 
has their own independent bases since
the<00:00:57.120> map<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.449> symmetrical<00:00:58.020> they<00:00:58.199> are<00:00:58.350> colored

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the map is symmetrical they are colored

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.520 
the map is symmetrical they are colored
by<00:00:59.100> both<00:00:59.309> pillars<00:00:59.789> colored<00:01:00.780> blocks<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.379> few

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
by both pillars colored blocks and a few

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.810 
by both pillars colored blocks and a few
screens<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.010> kind<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.190> identify<00:01:02.609> them

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
screens that kind of identify them

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.929 
screens that kind of identify them
clearly<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.390> opposing<00:01:04.229> bases<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.739> as<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.820> can

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
clearly as opposing bases and as you can

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.550 
clearly as opposing bases and as you can
see<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> map<00:01:06.330> does<00:01:06.479> kind<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.750> sprawls<00:01:07.140> itself

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
see the map does kind of sprawls itself

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.500 
see the map does kind of sprawls itself
out<00:01:07.680> into<00:01:07.890> separate<00:01:08.280> areas<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.299> kind

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
out into separate areas so you have kind

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.969 
out into separate areas so you have kind
of<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.659> whole<00:01:09.810> middle<00:01:10.140> structures<00:01:10.619> there<00:01:10.860> and

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
of the whole middle structures there and

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.500 
of the whole middle structures there and
then<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> sides<00:01:11.430> are<00:01:11.640> kind<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.880> dominated<00:01:12.390> by

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
then the sides are kind of dominated by

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.300 
then the sides are kind of dominated by
these<00:01:12.689> bridged<00:01:13.080> areas<00:01:13.530> with<00:01:13.680> these<00:01:13.830> buildings

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
these bridged areas with these buildings

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.160 
these bridged areas with these buildings
that<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.580> these<00:01:14.760> wonderful<00:01:15.090> window<00:01:15.659> setups

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
that have these wonderful window setups

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.950 
that have these wonderful window setups
and<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.340> rather<00:01:17.460> circularly<00:01:18.240> shaped<00:01:18.600> map

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
and it's a rather circularly shaped map

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.300 
and it's a rather circularly shaped map
in<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.200> sense<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.770> don't<00:01:19.920> see<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.250> too

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
in a sense and you don't see that too

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.920 
in a sense and you don't see that too
often<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:21.090> really<00:01:21.270> find<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.509> that's<00:01:21.689> fun

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
often I really find that that's fun

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.660 
often I really find that that's fun
alright<00:01:22.560> here's<00:01:22.740> an<00:01:22.860> awesome<00:01:22.979> clip<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.520> me

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
alright here's an awesome clip of me

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.060 
alright here's an awesome clip of me
getting<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.060> show<00:01:24.360> stopper<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:25.020> h-2a<00:01:25.439> con<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.040> I

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
getting a show stopper on h-2a con and I

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.980 
getting a show stopper on h-2a con and I
thought<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.180> was<00:01:27.299> definitely<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> lot<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.869> fun

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
thought that was definitely a lot of fun

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.940 
thought that was definitely a lot of fun
especially<00:01:28.020> because<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.619> got<00:01:28.770> rather

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
especially because you got rather

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.830 
especially because you got rather
furious<00:01:29.460> about<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.180> uh<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.720> was

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
furious about that but uh it was

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.300 
furious about that but uh it was
definitely<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.290> fun<00:01:31.470> little<00:01:31.650> bit<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.979> gameplay

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
definitely a fun little bit of gameplay

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.950 
definitely a fun little bit of gameplay
there<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.240> these<00:01:33.329> are<00:01:33.450> gonna<00:01:33.540> progress<00:01:33.750> our

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
there and these are gonna progress our

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.359 
there and these are gonna progress our
way<00:01:34.049> down<00:01:34.200> here<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.530> these<00:01:34.650> circular

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
way down here to these circular

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.469 
way down here to these circular
structures<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.790> was<00:01:35.909> talking<00:01:36.180> about<00:01:36.210> earlier

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
structures I was talking about earlier

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.390 
structures I was talking about earlier
they<00:01:37.170> are<00:01:37.200> two<00:01:37.560> leveled<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.130> have<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
they are two leveled so you have the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.249 
they are two leveled so you have the
main<00:01:38.610> floor<00:01:38.970> at<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.210> bottom<00:01:39.329> there<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.840> on

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
main floor at the bottom there and on

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.510 
main floor at the bottom there and on
the<00:01:40.380> upper<00:01:40.500> floor<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.950> kind<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> much

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the upper floor you kind of have a much

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.219 
the upper floor you kind of have a much
higher<00:01:41.670> vantage<00:01:42.119> point<00:01:42.390> are<00:01:42.570> there<00:01:42.930> are<00:01:43.110> these

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
higher vantage point are there are these

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.960 
higher vantage point are there are these
very<00:01:43.500> cool<00:01:43.829> lights<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.250> these<00:01:44.369> tunnels<00:01:44.610> that

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
very cool lights in these tunnels that

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.580 
very cool lights in these tunnels that
for<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> entire<00:01:45.570> lower<00:01:45.780> area<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.380> kind

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
for the entire lower area just to kind

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.499 
for the entire lower area just to kind
of<00:01:46.649> give<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> bit<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.399> contrast<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.270> blend

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
of give a bit of a contrast of the blend

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.330 
of give a bit of a contrast of the blend
instead<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> four<00:01:49.079> giant<00:01:49.439> pieces<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:50.159> other

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
instead the four giant pieces but other

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.920 
instead the four giant pieces but other
than<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.640> he<00:01:50.729> uses<00:01:50.909> his<00:01:51.119> textures<00:01:51.720> rather

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
than that he uses his textures rather

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.539 
than that he uses his textures rather
wonderfully<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:53.130> find<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.520> really

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
wonderfully and I find that it really

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.149 
wonderfully and I find that it really
balances<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.270> entire<00:01:54.600> map<00:01:54.840> out<00:01:55.110> with<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.680> very

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
balances the entire map out with a very

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.920 
balances the entire map out with a very
smooth<00:01:56.579> layout<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> good<00:01:57.420> look<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.659> it

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
smooth layout and a good look to it

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.260 
smooth layout and a good look to it
overall<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.640> bit<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.909> an<00:02:00.000> overview

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
overall so this is a bit of an overview

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.330 
overall so this is a bit of an overview
of<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.600> area<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.200> map<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.710> can<00:02:02.189> see

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
of this area of the map and you can see

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.950 
of this area of the map and you can see
once<00:02:02.670> again<00:02:02.909> we're<00:02:03.030> going<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.180> fly<00:02:03.390> by<00:02:03.600> some<00:02:03.840> of

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
once again we're going to fly by some of

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.660 
once again we're going to fly by some of
these<00:02:04.049> second<00:02:04.710> floors<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.250> structures

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
these second floors of the structures

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.270 
these second floors of the structures
along<00:02:06.060> with<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.479> overall<00:02:06.899> area<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.069> can

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
along with the overall area so you can

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.440 
along with the overall area so you can
see<00:02:08.429> there<00:02:08.610> are<00:02:08.700> once<00:02:08.879> again<00:02:09.149> great

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
see there are once again great

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.940 
see there are once again great

there are a lot of

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.770 
there are a lot of
areas<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.820> can<00:02:15.000> access<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.540> upper

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
areas that you can access the upper

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.870 
areas that you can access the upper
floors<00:02:16.050> by<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.560> just<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.190> basic<00:02:17.490> layout<00:02:17.850> of

floors by and just the basic layout of
the<00:02:18.030> map<00:02:18.240> itself<00:02:18.540> truly<00:02:18.960> allows<00:02:19.140> for<00:02:19.350> some

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
the map itself truly allows for some

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.560 
the map itself truly allows for some
wonderful<00:02:19.710> movement<00:02:20.070> you've<00:02:21.060> just<00:02:21.330> got<00:02:21.450> all

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
wonderful movement you've just got all

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.000 
wonderful movement you've just got all
the<00:02:21.690> pieces<00:02:21.840> set<00:02:22.140> up<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.350> central<00:02:22.650> wonderful

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
the pieces set up in central wonderful

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.280 
the pieces set up in central wonderful
Manor<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.460> can<00:02:23.550> easily<00:02:23.850> jump<00:02:24.300> up<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.780> if

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
Manor that you can easily jump up and if

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.780 
Manor that you can easily jump up and if
you<00:02:25.500> haven't<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.860> jetpack<00:02:26.100> all<00:02:26.520> the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
you haven't have a jetpack all the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.220 
you haven't have a jetpack all the
better<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.210> can<00:02:27.240> really<00:02:27.600> move<00:02:27.720> yourself

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
better you can really move yourself

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.530 
better you can really move yourself
rather<00:02:28.440> wonderfully<00:02:28.980> on<00:02:29.100> this<00:02:29.250> map<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:30.150> it's

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
rather wonderfully on this map so it's

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.080 
rather wonderfully on this map so it's
definitely<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.140> really<00:02:31.830> fun<00:02:32.040> map<00:02:32.280> just<00:02:32.970> from

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
definitely a really fun map just from

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.600 
definitely a really fun map just from
the<00:02:33.200> manoeuvrability<00:02:34.200> on<00:02:34.350> its<00:02:34.530> own<00:02:34.680> anyways

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
the manoeuvrability on its own anyways

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.740 
the manoeuvrability on its own anyways
we're<00:02:35.700> gonna<00:02:35.820> progress<00:02:36.000> over<00:02:36.360> here<00:02:36.540> although

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
we're gonna progress over here although

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.910 
we're gonna progress over here although
I've<00:02:36.900> already<00:02:37.140> showed<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.410> blue<00:02:37.590> base<00:02:37.770> I

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
I've already showed you blue base I

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.320 
I've already showed you blue base I
always<00:02:38.070> like<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.250> do<00:02:38.430> just<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.700> quick<00:02:38.850> once-over

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
always like to do just a quick once-over

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.690 
always like to do just a quick once-over
so<00:02:40.080> although<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.740> symmetrical<00:02:41.280> map<00:02:41.430> and

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
so although it is a symmetrical map and

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.820 
so although it is a symmetrical map and
I<00:02:41.730> see<00:02:41.850> red<00:02:42.060> base<00:02:42.300> here<00:02:42.570> rather<00:02:42.780> quickly<00:02:43.170> very

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
I see red base here rather quickly very

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.710 
I see red base here rather quickly very
similar<00:02:44.280> concept<00:02:44.850> same<00:02:45.120> ideas<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.510> other

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
similar concept same ideas the other

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.920 
similar concept same ideas the other
side<00:02:45.960> and<00:02:46.260> just<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.670> only<00:02:48.240> significant

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
side and just the only significant

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.870 
side and just the only significant
difference<00:02:48.960> is<00:02:49.350> really<00:02:49.680> its<00:02:49.830> colouring<00:02:50.250> so

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
difference is really its colouring so

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.640 
difference is really its colouring so
overall<00:02:51.210> it's<00:02:51.450> very<00:02:51.660> easy<00:02:51.960> to<00:02:52.140> familiarize

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
overall it's very easy to familiarize

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.290 
overall it's very easy to familiarize
yourself<00:02:53.010> with<00:02:53.070> this<00:02:53.220> map<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.790> plays<00:02:54.000> just

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
yourself with this map and it plays just

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.840 
yourself with this map and it plays just
had<00:02:54.630> such<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.840> wonderfully<00:02:55.470> fast<00:02:55.770> pace<00:02:56.100> if

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
had such a wonderfully fast pace if

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.830 
had such a wonderfully fast pace if
you've<00:02:57.000> got<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.150> good<00:02:57.330> setup<00:02:57.600> with<00:02:57.810> your

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
you've got a good setup with your

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.510 
you've got a good setup with your
teammates<00:02:58.320> you<00:02:58.440> can<00:02:58.590> really<00:02:58.890> balance<00:02:59.100> out<00:02:59.370> the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
teammates you can really balance out the
