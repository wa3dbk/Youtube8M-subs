00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.970
 and you 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.020
 all 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.880
 we had high expectations for the tour 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.500
 in crazy wade is in our hearts from 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.119
 several years and the arrival of a video game 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.770
 he completely indicated ie 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.080
 literally made crazy by the live 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.970
 as well known in these cases however i 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.590
 Licensed titles are unlikely to succeed 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.510
 to win over the public and theirs 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.910
 technical realization is usually of 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.540
 slightly more than enough 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.760
 at least and the vast majority 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.410
 of the cases we have sighed of 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.150
 relief so what has been made known 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.100
 that would take care of the project 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.780
 been their own damon studio boys already 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.640
 known for giving the idea recent titles 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.229
 there really good quality transformers 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.390
 but he said it's not a simple one 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.309
 the protagonist indeed has a personality 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.540
 incredible and recreating in video games was 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.530
 probably the most difficult task 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.530
 for developers 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.200
 [Music] 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.920
 [Applause] 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.299
 crowds completely sheet is the only one 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.159
 adjective to define clearly 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.600
 and concisely what we found 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.399
 front starting the game for the first 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.740
 once inside your apartment 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.539
 deadpool was waiting for us sprawled on 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.159
 lounge armchair waiting for 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.259
 receive a very important call from 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.280
 peter of the triad president of aim in 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.899
 study 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.030
 wade knows very well indeed that he is a 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.190
 comic book character not infrequently in 3 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.479
 d the map in this case his reader 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.369
 purpose is obviously to do 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.020
 producing the game is indeed ours 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.060
 does not fail to physically threaten that 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.280
 limits and explosions and blows for that 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.569
 to convince finance from the project is there 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.130
 another small detail of 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.240
 fix before starting lost the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.429
 serious and the script 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.899
 here explosions and beheadings are not 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.909
 a sufficient number has been entered 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.229
 according to the sun and with a quick touch up 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.869
 in pencil the story finally takes over 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.170
 exaggerated shape and over the top with the 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.769
 our protagonist is also a part there 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.239
 around but never 

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:11.859
 before entering into the action at 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.480
 player is left the freedom of 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:15.430
 turn around the apartment interacting 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.959
 with a large quantity of objects it will be 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.579
 possible to eat a pizza contains 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.440
 a plastic doll to play with 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.090
 dog or playing an imaginary guitar 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.829
 so no sense for the note is 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.600
 completely out of context that 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.100
 we will find again later interspersed 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.600
 also during the history with the 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.160
 possibility now to fill with slaps 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.600
 dear wolverine or still to take for 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.970
 the bottoms on 2 races during a break 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.680
 reflection in the cabinet sections 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.329
 fun that the tar have player a 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.489
 break up the dangerous monotony that 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.959
 alongside the people of the title is forbidden for 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.519
 the broken headphone from a quantity of 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.280
 different things to do about the action 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.450
 unfortunately the plot is really commendable 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.430
 does not deepen the truth 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.109
 character but on the contrary give 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.700
 multitude of consequential events 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.590
 linked to randomness that gives a thread 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.970
 precise conductor with the result 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.490
 unique to make it appear like a 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.590
 pretext for leading hands 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.720
 the main enemy then seems a mere one 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.070
 appearance as well as de gregari that yes 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.750
 will join with equi starting from 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.250
 mentioned wolverine passing by whom 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.330
 he wants some of the more anonymous villains 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.070
 of the marvel universe 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.420
 all clearly justified by da 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.260
 that with a budget cut for the 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.070
 their acquittal 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.930
 a little bit for us deadpool 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.370
 however it is not a cartoon but a 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.130
 third-person action with false that 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.780
 flash and shoot started wisely 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.070
 let's start with the photographer then with wade 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.870
 that I do the most classic ones 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.000
 combinations risk blows 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.260
 fast and so sandwiched with jumps 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.480
 gun shots to literally do 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.860
 fly the combo counter 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.570
 the system easily allows 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.760
 already perform different chaining throats 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.320
 the controls moved smoothly between them 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.430
 respond without problems and orders 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.410
 given by the player 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.970
 could not miss the dodge on 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.040
 present in the form of teleportation 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.300
 quick which will not only allow apple 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.160
 to get several seconds of 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.600
 vulnerability but also if activated on 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.400
 right time to counter the 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.470
 minute breaking his guard e 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.550
 usually throwing it in the air of da 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.680
 being able to give the player the chance 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.910
 to insert a new one anyway after 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.590
 camper you can start shooting 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.550
 immediately and the car can't go 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.920
 at the start a specific combination 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.270
 call with kata that will mix the 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.070
 guns with the two blades of 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:10.050
 right to an intelligent guardian of 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.400
 hostile not particularly evolved hear 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.930
 also for it has a danger on the 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.940
 distance to be reckoned with 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.440
 though power 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.640
 generating imagery because heroes and 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.170
 allows me to recover life 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.450
 automatically after exiting the 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.950
 fighting 50 seconds to be revealed 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.050
 with a dario party it wo n't be a thing 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.580
 so rare by publishing player a 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.380
 proceed with caution in any case 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.180
 levels or to abuse the 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.980
 teleportation as that in five positions 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.950
 in a row arrives to make immune to the ports 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.750
 for about ten seconds as good as 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.520
 Powerful shots will reward player 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.960
 with the cool point he boasts in-game 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.070
 thanks to which to buy a whole 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.780
 series of upgrades for the 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.300
 protagonist among which passive abilities 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.740
 regeneration and new combos but also 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.710
 extra weapons and gadgets to switch on 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.240
 freely during the fights a 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.070
 with batiste and in any case far from 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.510
 earthquake centers of the mainstream of the genre 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.670
 and the junta said little 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.320
 special move tools that damage 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.760
 and paralyze anniversaries by leaving it 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.890
 helpless and ready to incur a fee of 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.480
 certain meters to be loaded with a pair of 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.310
 como is definitely over doing it 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.970
 above all and in the disappointing clash 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.470
 the final 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.180
 the system of joining instead has succeeded e 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.320
 presents a convenient lock on system 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.550
 but also leaves the player there 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.320
 possibility of using a mode 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.690
 free aiming to perform ie 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.460
 kill uselessly graphically 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.169
 the title does not exalt even if we have 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.180
 really really enjoyed the details 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.590
 of times and wounds that were believed on 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.880
 its cost is of gauges and 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.240
 various multinations suffered by 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.240
 opponents 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.539
 unfortunately the settings do not enjoy 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.160
 of the same joy with path 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.060
 extremely linear that limit not 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.770
 little to the player 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.090
 in the exploratory files of the eight levels 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.949
 so they are really available 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.720
 reduced to the bone and to get to the 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.610
 end of the campaign without running there 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.960
 will take just over six hours in 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.610
 influential regarding the 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.960
 longevity to survival challenges that 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.820
 will really add meat to the 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.320
 fire and the miserable extras in which 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.270
 we simply find tabs for 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.410
 the characters a pair of costumes 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.120
 surely they would have been 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.560
 most appreciated 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.759
 to this is added a camera 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.470
 really unmanageable in the spaces 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.900
 narrow and a jump system and not 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.759
 particularly precise problematic 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.740
 also the framerate and in situations 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:09.360
 agitated will collapse visibly making 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.490
 particularly difficult to ring 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.080
 long combo we finish this 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.330
 videorecensione talking about dubbing 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.610
 really sublime and executed with mastery 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.830
 and passion give the original voice of 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.750
 inside in america has always exceeded one 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.190
 acting in this case we are 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.440
 not at all disappointed by the lack of translation 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.040
 of the protagonist rewarded instead to his 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.720
 thought 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.310
 like the 37 imposed the dubber 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.450
 demonstrated return could have 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.790
 destroy are the best elements 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:44.910
 of the title has concluded for this time 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:47.010
 we will be satisfied with the subtitles above 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.240
 the vulgar and irreverent lines this is 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.400
 said and this is what we have 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.080
 beloved of the video game in question a 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.280
 probably the main differences 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.560
 game mechanics would not be 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.700
 enough to tear the whole enough 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.620
 the humor of the chatty mercenary 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.880
 and find geniuses to entertain the
