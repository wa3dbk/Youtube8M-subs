after<00:01:38.759> we<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:39.000> our<00:01:39.119> image<00:01:39.390> opened<00:01:39.720> up<00:01:39.869> go

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
after we have our image opened up go

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.340 
after we have our image opened up go
over<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.100> layer<00:01:41.280> pane<00:01:41.670> select<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:43.049> layer

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
over to the layer pane select this layer

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.170 
over to the layer pane select this layer
right<00:01:43.649> click<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.520> you'll<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:44.939> where

right click on it and you'll see where
it<00:01:45.210> says<00:01:45.329> duplicate<00:01:46.320> layer<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.920> want<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.159> click

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
it says duplicate layer we want to click

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.010 
it says duplicate layer we want to click
on<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.420> see<00:01:48.479> we<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.840> this

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
on that as you can see we have this

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.490 
on that as you can see we have this
layer<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.920> layer<00:01:50.420> now<00:01:51.420> we<00:01:52.110> will<00:01:52.259> go<00:01:52.439> to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
layer and that layer now we will go to

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.649 
layer and that layer now we will go to
the<00:01:52.649> one<00:01:52.799> that's<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.070> top<00:01:53.340> make<00:01:54.299> sure<00:01:54.329> it's

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
the one that's on top make sure it's

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.870 
the one that's on top make sure it's
blue<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:54.930> highlighted<00:01:55.640> what<00:01:56.640> we're<00:01:56.729> going<00:01:56.850> to

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
blue and highlighted what we're going to

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.980 
blue and highlighted what we're going to
do<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.149> now<00:01:57.450> go<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.659> colors<00:01:59.750> desaturate<00:02:00.750> it's

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
do is now go to colors desaturate it's

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.780 
do is now go to colors desaturate it's
going<00:02:01.320> black<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.979> white<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.250> picture<00:02:02.610> now

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
going black and white the picture now

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.300 
going black and white the picture now
you<00:02:02.850> have<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.630> few<00:02:04.560> options<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:05.040> have

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
you have a few options you have

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.290 
you have a few options you have
lightness<00:02:06.090> luminosity<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.200> average<00:02:07.680> I

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
lightness luminosity and average I

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.279 
lightness luminosity and average I
normally<00:02:09.300> use<00:02:09.330> average<00:02:09.810> because<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.110> looks

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
normally use average because it looks

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.570 
normally use average because it looks
the<00:02:10.410> best<00:02:10.590> but<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.920> can<00:02:11.069> choose<00:02:11.280> whichever

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
the best but you can choose whichever

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.180 
the best but you can choose whichever
you<00:02:11.730> want<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.150> on<00:02:12.270> take<00:02:12.480> average<00:02:12.959> and

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
you want to on take average and

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.830 
you want to on take average and
like<00:02:13.310> okay<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.540> now<00:02:14.630> we<00:02:14.690> have<00:02:14.810> a

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
like okay so now we have a

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.440 
like okay so now we have a
black-and-white<00:02:15.110> picture<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.880> top<00:02:17.090> layer<00:02:17.420> is

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
black-and-white picture the top layer is

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.030 
black-and-white picture the top layer is
black<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.170> white<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.590> bottom<00:02:18.860> layer<00:02:19.010> is

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
black and white the bottom layer is

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.160 
black and white the bottom layer is
color<00:02:19.490> if<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.850> click<00:02:20.210> this<00:02:20.390> eyeball<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:21.080> will

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
color if I click this eyeball it will

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.960 
color if I click this eyeball it will
disable<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:22.100> black<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.490> white<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.850> goes

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
disable the black and white and goes

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.300 
disable the black and white and goes
back<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.270> color<00:02:23.620> so<00:02:24.620> we<00:02:24.680> have<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.830> black<00:02:25.100> and

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
back to color so we have a black and

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.920 
back to color so we have a black and
white<00:02:25.430> layer<00:02:25.730> sitting<00:02:26.120> on<00:02:26.240> top<00:02:26.390> of<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.660> color

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
white layer sitting on top of a color

sure it says full or white full of
pace-it<00:02:43.900> capacity<00:02:45.070> hit<00:02:46.070> add<00:02:46.990> now<00:02:47.990> you<00:02:48.050> have

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
pace-it capacity hit add now you have

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.720 
pace-it capacity hit add now you have
the<00:02:48.470> image<00:02:48.740> here<00:02:49.040> in<00:02:49.130> this<00:02:49.220> layer<00:02:49.460> and<00:02:49.670> you

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
the image here in this layer and you

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.750 
the image here in this layer and you
have<00:02:49.880> this<00:02:50.000> block<00:02:50.330> of<00:02:50.510> white<00:02:51.550> basically<00:02:52.550> there

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
have this block of white basically there

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.280 
have this block of white basically there
is<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.910> block<00:02:53.210> of<00:02:53.240> white<00:02:53.630> sand<00:02:53.870> on<00:02:53.930> top<00:02:54.110> of<00:02:54.230> this

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
is a block of white sand on top of this

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.620 
is a block of white sand on top of this
image<00:02:54.740> so<00:02:54.920> anything<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.430> color<00:02:55.700> black<00:02:56.180> will

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
image so anything you color black will

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.110 
image so anything you color black will
turn<00:02:56.960> back<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.200> color<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:59.060> will

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
turn back to color and I will

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.720 
turn back to color and I will
demonstrate<00:02:59.810> that<00:02:59.840> with<00:03:00.500> this<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:01.130> have<00:03:01.340> black

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
demonstrate that with this I have black

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.930 
demonstrate that with this I have black
selected<00:03:02.210> I'm<00:03:02.840> going<00:03:03.080> to<00:03:03.140> take<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.470> pencil

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
selected I'm going to take the pencil

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.220 
selected I'm going to take the pencil
and<00:03:04.940> I'm<00:03:05.090> going<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:05.390> take<00:03:05.570> and<00:03:05.750> just<00:03:05.900> drag

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
and I'm going to take and just drag

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.050 
and I'm going to take and just drag
across<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.710> screen<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.400> you're<00:03:07.850> going<00:03:08.000> to

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
across the screen and you're going to

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.630 
across the screen and you're going to
see<00:03:08.180> it<00:03:08.270> turn<00:03:08.420> back<00:03:08.570> to<00:03:08.720> color<00:03:09.310> what<00:03:10.310> this<00:03:10.490> is

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
see it turn back to color what this is

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.450 
see it turn back to color what this is
doing<00:03:10.880> is<00:03:11.180> it's<00:03:11.480> telling<00:03:11.750> this<00:03:12.500> layer<00:03:12.830> to<00:03:13.250> draw

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
doing is it's telling this layer to draw

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.160 
doing is it's telling this layer to draw
this<00:03:13.700> into<00:03:14.030> white<00:03:14.240> and<00:03:14.480> whatever<00:03:14.720> I<00:03:14.900> draw<00:03:15.110> on

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
this into white and whatever I draw on

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
this into white and whatever I draw on
the<00:03:15.320> white<00:03:15.530> will<00:03:15.860> transfer<00:03:16.780> so<00:03:17.780> this<00:03:18.530> the

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
the white will transfer so this the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.479 
the white will transfer so this the
color<00:03:19.430> image<00:03:19.640> shows<00:03:20.000> up<00:03:20.209> through<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:21.220> so<00:03:22.220> how

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
color image shows up through it so how

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:23.979 
color image shows up through it so how
we're<00:03:22.700> going<00:03:22.790> to<00:03:22.850> use<00:03:22.910> this<00:03:23.270> to<00:03:23.450> turn<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.720> stop
