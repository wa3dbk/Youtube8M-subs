00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.900 
mouth for different type of areas we're
basically<00:02:58.560> looking<00:02:58.920> for<00:02:58.980> anything<00:02:59.730> that

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
basically looking for anything that

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.280

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
might be a little bit abnormal a little

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.020 
might be a little bit abnormal a little
bit<00:03:01.380> off<00:03:01.560> doesn't<00:03:02.340> necessarily<00:03:02.880> mean<00:03:03.000> that

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
bit off doesn't necessarily mean that

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.970 
bit off doesn't necessarily mean that
that<00:03:03.180> could<00:03:03.600> be<00:03:03.630> cancer<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.350> just<00:03:04.560> could<00:03:04.800> mean

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
that could be cancer it just could mean

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.070 
that could be cancer it just could mean
that<00:03:05.160> we<00:03:05.250> need<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.550> take<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.730> better<00:03:06.420> look<00:03:06.510> into

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
that we need to take a better look into

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.710 
that we need to take a better look into
it<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:08.250> just<00:03:08.460> basically<00:03:08.610> am<00:03:09.030> detecting<00:03:09.510> four

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
it so I just basically am detecting four

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.020 
it so I just basically am detecting four
things<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.020> might<00:03:10.230> be<00:03:10.260> lumps<00:03:10.680> or<00:03:10.800> bumps

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
things that might be lumps or bumps

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.690 
things that might be lumps or bumps
something<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.210> is<00:03:12.420> really<00:03:12.720> hard<00:03:13.190> an<00:03:14.190> area

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
something that is really hard an area

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.630 
something that is really hard an area
that<00:03:14.910> maybe<00:03:15.270> hasn't<00:03:15.660> healed<00:03:15.960> so<00:03:16.640> basically

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
that maybe hasn't healed so basically

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.210 
that maybe hasn't healed so basically
most<00:03:18.240> people<00:03:18.360> have<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.930> lot<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.830> same<00:03:20.010> type

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
most people have a lot of the same type

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.590 
most people have a lot of the same type
