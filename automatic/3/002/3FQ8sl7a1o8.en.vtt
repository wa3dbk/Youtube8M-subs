00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
it also makes the chasing ESF extremely

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.430 
it also makes the chasing ESF extremely
predictable<00:02:11.819> it's<00:02:12.300> very<00:02:12.569> easy<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.930> see<00:02:13.200> where

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
predictable it's very easy to see where

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.790 
predictable it's very easy to see where
their

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
their

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.220

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
because they are of course following

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.520
