00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.150
 25 thousand subscribers so we're going to 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.070
 good book here first of all we have 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.500
 on the screen my pc monitor is worth 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.199
 with the helmets hanging here 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.110
 tritones xy 180 version insulating tape 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.640
 I have tape and lens in almost all 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.309
 the parts of the newts are made 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.329
 fuck this to see if I buy another 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.999
 new my monitor 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:48.409
 my mouse and my keyboard that are new 

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:50.179
 but they gave away for kings and before 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.519
 you'll remember some of the tower 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:54.559
 right down here stuck in a stand 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.839
 that I had here and then when I bought 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.869
 nothing new so I did not teach it but I had 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.780
 the tower is down there because I have 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:05.750
 changed and now right now the tower the 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.610
 I put on the table it's worth because down 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.380
 It overwhelms me a little when it comes to how I 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.689
 I wanted to stretch what it was 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.750
 so then I decided to put it here on top 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:18.520
 in the table this is my tower one 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.069
 phantom nzx I think I was model something like that 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.229
 as you can see the orange pilots 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:26.030
 makes to control the 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.770
 fans are not all plugged in 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.390
 as you can see because only the 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.009
 plug all for the rest I have to 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.750
 buy an adapter that we were not very 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.179
 expensive the adapter but simply 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.130
 I decided to connect the two fans 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:41.159
 main and the rest do not connect what 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.700
 good 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.009
 there is the tower from behind because I have 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.119
 a shelf with all the games that 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.149
 I have of PC equipment play I have for 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.520
 there also music discs the box of the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.700
 hd pvr the cash box half the box 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.560
 from the scoop back here I have 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.610
 good webcam I have it and oriented 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.399
 backwards because you will not use 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.149
 a lot so it left me oriented towards 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.259
 behind 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.840
 this is a bass base box 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.239
 sorry that the power supply of 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.090
 the xbox and the speakers of the box 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:21.510
 serious because here I have one and there I have 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.910
 the other is worth and with that thing deactivates my 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.590
 ipod you saw the unboxing of 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:31.769
 loading and here I have the TV 24 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.330
 inch I think it was the team and under 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.849
 I have the play because I have right now 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.040
 well the consoles basically because 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.709
 I play a lot more to the team than to the 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.870
 play to say is that the play I do not play 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.910
 in the last months then before 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.060
 they had the two consoles standing here but 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.610
 I decided to put it on it so leave the xbox 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.790
 so with a bit that I have here of 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.860
 foam rubber to shorten the 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.599
 sound and the beach lowered without success with 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.040
 this replay then simply change the 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.250
 order with 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.030
 with the xbox and I can plug it in 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.280
 here the TV on so you can see 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.810
 you see quite well the truth quite well 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.579
 it has left me very good very good tele 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.879
 it was not from a well-known brand and I'm 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:18.659
 very happy with her the scoop 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.849

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.180
