00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
moon like a loop or a straight line and

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.799 
moon like a loop or a straight line and
come<00:00:35.219> back<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.399> different<00:00:35.640> way<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.420> hit<00:00:36.600> some

nothing there and then you go there and
there<00:01:13.650> are<00:01:13.799> bound<00:01:14.040> for<00:01:14.189> two<00:01:14.310> dollars<00:01:14.460> so

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
there are bound for two dollars so

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.399 
there are bound for two dollars so
that's<00:01:15.509> how<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.780> works<00:01:15.990> at<00:01:16.170> thrift<00:01:16.350> stores

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
that's how it works at thrift stores

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.810 
that's how it works at thrift stores
basically<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.070> got<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.400> keep<00:01:17.580> going

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
basically you got to just keep going

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.880 
basically you got to just keep going
back<00:01:17.960> every<00:01:18.960> time<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.170> don't<00:01:19.439> go<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> that

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
back every time you don't go to that

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.219 
back every time you don't go to that
place<00:01:20.659> something<00:01:21.659> could<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:21.900> been<00:01:21.930> passed

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
place something could have been passed

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.929 
place something could have been passed
