watch<00:05:37.780> wait<00:05:38.780> for<00:05:39.020> it<00:05:39.110> bling<00:05:39.440> so<00:05:39.979> the<00:05:40.069> quiet

watch wait for it bling so the quiet

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.879 
watch wait for it bling so the quiet
professional<00:05:40.819> but<00:05:41.090> I<00:05:41.360> think<00:05:42.110> that<00:05:42.319> his<00:05:42.500> kills

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
professional but I think that his kills

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.529 
professional but I think that his kills
like<00:05:43.280> Mother's<00:05:43.610> kills<00:05:43.940> must<00:05:44.360> have

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
like Mother's kills must have

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:47.559 
like Mother's kills must have
contributed<00:05:44.840> to<00:05:45.259> it<00:05:45.849> not<00:05:46.849> the<00:05:47.060> kills<00:05:47.300> that<00:05:47.449> he

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:47.569 
contributed to it not the kills that he

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.369 
contributed to it not the kills that he
got<00:05:47.720> when<00:05:47.960> we<00:05:48.050> slid<00:05:48.379> down<00:05:48.620> the<00:05:49.479> in<00:05:50.479> the<00:05:50.629> snow<00:05:50.960> I

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:51.379 
got when we slid down the in the snow I

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:53.050 
got when we slid down the in the snow I
mean<00:05:51.620> he<00:05:51.740> got<00:05:51.860> like<00:05:52.099> four<00:05:52.550> or<00:05:52.610> five<00:05:52.639> kills

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
mean he got like four or five kills

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.960 
mean he got like four or five kills
there<00:05:53.360> but<00:05:53.800> he<00:05:54.800> got<00:05:55.009> some<00:05:55.250> kills<00:05:55.490> I<00:05:55.729> think<00:05:55.909> he

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
there but he got some kills I think he

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.339 
there but he got some kills I think he
got<00:05:56.090> three<00:05:56.360> kills<00:05:56.630> right<00:05:56.840> there<00:05:56.990> in<00:05:57.080> the<00:05:57.139> camp

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:57.349 
got three kills right there in the camp

00:05:57.349 --> 00:05:59.529 
got three kills right there in the camp
so<00:05:57.650> I<00:05:58.190> think<00:05:58.430> that<00:05:58.759> actually<00:05:58.909> contributes

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
so I think that actually contributes

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.300 
so I think that actually contributes
towards<00:05:59.990> the<00:06:00.199> 13<00:06:00.590> which<00:06:00.770> is<00:06:00.889> kind<00:06:01.069> of<00:06:01.099> weird

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
towards the 13 which is kind of weird

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.640 
towards the 13 which is kind of weird
cuz<00:06:01.909> I<00:06:01.970> only<00:06:02.120> got<00:06:02.270> 10<00:06:02.539> and<00:06:02.870> I<00:06:03.229> got<00:06:03.380> the<00:06:03.470> trophy

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
cuz I only got 10 and I got the trophy

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.700 
cuz I only got 10 and I got the trophy
so<00:06:04.190> anyways<00:06:04.639> that's<00:06:05.509> it<00:06:05.810> you<00:06:06.259> don't<00:06:06.349> have<00:06:06.560> to

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
so anyways that's it you don't have to

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.010 
so anyways that's it you don't have to
actually<00:06:07.009> have<00:06:07.280> to<00:06:07.430> get<00:06:07.729> all<00:06:07.940> 13<00:06:08.479> by<00:06:08.630> yourself

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
actually have to get all 13 by yourself
