00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.730 
going to move into Tuesday but i'm
creating<00:00:15.030> this<00:00:15.179> mostly<00:00:15.630> because<00:00:15.900> i<00:00:16.410> managed

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
creating this mostly because i managed

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.700 
creating this mostly because i managed
to<00:00:16.800> get<00:00:17.010> up<00:00:17.300> right<00:00:18.300> at<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.600> end<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:19.050> Monday<00:00:19.470> it

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
what it came down to is I don't like and

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.400 
what it came down to is I don't like and
I<00:03:47.730> guess<00:03:47.910> I'm<00:03:48.090> still<00:03:48.269> this<00:03:48.420> way<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.870> don't<00:03:49.140> like

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
I guess I'm still this way I don't like

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.360 
I guess I'm still this way I don't like
it<00:03:49.620> cold<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:50.970> know<00:03:51.120> like<00:03:51.420> if<00:03:51.900> it's<00:03:52.500> kind<00:03:53.250> of

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
it cold you know like if it's kind of

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.390 
it cold you know like if it's kind of
mixed<00:03:54.090> in<00:03:54.239> with<00:03:54.420> something<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:54.930> melted<00:03:55.400> down

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
mixed in with something and melted down

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.970 
mixed in with something and melted down
and<00:03:56.640> it's<00:03:56.820> warm<00:03:57.150> then<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:58.019> don't<00:03:58.200> mind<00:03:58.380> it<00:03:58.590> but

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
and it's warm then I don't mind it but

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.720 
and it's warm then I don't mind it but
when<00:03:59.130> it's<00:03:59.310> like<00:03:59.549> a<00:03:59.959> caught<00:04:00.959> a<00:04:01.140> cold<00:04:01.829> contrast

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
when it's like a caught a cold contrast

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:03.949 
when it's like a caught a cold contrast
to<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.000> hot<00:04:03.120> food<00:04:03.359> I<00:04:03.510> don't<00:04:03.660> like<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:03.930> I

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
to the hot food I don't like that I

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.030 
to the hot food I don't like that I
think<00:04:03.989> it's<00:04:04.200> why<00:04:04.350> I<00:04:04.380> don't<00:04:04.590> like<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:04.859> so<00:04:04.980> much

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
think it's why I don't like it so much

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.590 
think it's why I don't like it so much
in<00:04:05.250> tacos<00:04:05.640> this<00:04:05.850> because<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.180> always<00:04:06.299> stands

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
in tacos this because it always stands

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.840 
in tacos this because it always stands
out<00:04:06.870> but<00:04:07.709> then<00:04:07.829> this<00:04:07.950> it's<00:04:08.280> better<00:04:08.489> because<00:04:08.670> I

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
out but then this it's better because I

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.640 
out but then this it's better because I
can<00:04:08.970> mix<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.299> down<00:04:09.450> into<00:04:09.810> my<00:04:09.930> food<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.470> then<00:04:10.560> I

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
can mix it down into my food and then I

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.560 
can mix it down into my food and then I
don't<00:04:10.799> really<00:04:10.920> it's<00:04:11.609> not<00:04:11.760> cold<00:04:12.090> it's<00:04:12.450> not

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
don't really it's not cold it's not

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.399 
don't really it's not cold it's not
jarring<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:13.290> my<00:04:14.280> mouth<00:04:14.519> I<00:04:15.169> think<00:04:16.169> it<00:04:16.260> makes

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
jarring to my mouth I think it makes

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.070 
jarring to my mouth I think it makes
sense<00:04:16.620> so<00:04:17.459> in<00:04:17.640> actuality<00:04:17.970> I<00:04:18.299> do<00:04:18.390> kind<00:04:18.720> of<00:04:18.840> like

this<00:05:38.069> is<00:05:38.219> some<00:05:38.370> kind<00:05:38.520> of<00:05:38.610> celestial<00:05:39.060> map<00:05:39.330> that

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
this is some kind of celestial map that

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.040 
this is some kind of celestial map that
makes<00:05:40.020> sense<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:41.400> Arabs<00:05:41.759> used<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.300> Stars<00:05:42.659> to

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
makes sense the Arabs used the Stars to

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.110 
makes sense the Arabs used the Stars to
navigate<00:05:43.080> the<00:05:43.770> desert<00:05:44.130> just<00:05:44.159> like<00:05:44.400> sailors<00:05:44.969> on

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
navigate the desert just like sailors on

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.890 
navigate the desert just like sailors on
the<00:05:45.240> ocean<00:05:45.650> that's<00:05:46.650> right<00:05:47.389> so<00:05:48.389> you<00:05:48.449> could<00:05:48.719> use

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
the ocean that's right so you could use

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.719 
the ocean that's right so you could use
these<00:05:49.110> constellations<00:05:49.560> to<00:05:50.069> find<00:05:50.279> the<00:05:50.400> site<00:05:50.610> of

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
these constellations to find the site of

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.240 
these constellations to find the site of
the<00:05:50.819> lost<00:05:51.000> city
