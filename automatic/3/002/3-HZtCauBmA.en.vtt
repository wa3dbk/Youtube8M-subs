00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.590
 hello welcome room easy dotcom 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.010
 the topic that we are going to deal with now is the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.920
 half a number 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.079
 how can we calculate half of a 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.920
 number 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.949
 Well the first thing we will say is that the 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.060
 half of a number is calculated by dividing 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:44.980
 the number between 2 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.260
 let's see an example 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.670
 we have our two friends runners 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:56.829
 of cars and they have been told to take 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:00.989
 half of the tires each one let's see 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.989
 first how many tires do we have 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:10.630
 One Two Three 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:14.820
 4 5 6 7 8 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.820
 we have 8 wheels 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:24.520
 as it says that to calculate the number the 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:28.180
 half the number we have to divide it 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.370
 between 2 then it means that 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.870
 we would be talking about that we have to 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.370
 divide 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:39.060
 8 between 2 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:42.560
 let's do it first here and then we're going to 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.490
 do in writing 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.060
 and we started distributing in equal parts 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.750
 the rims 1 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.750
 one 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.420
 22 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.130
 is 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.630
 4 and 4 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:12.700
 as we can see both have four 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.480
 tires we have divided the eight tires 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.720
 who were between the two runners 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:23.170
 we can say then that half of 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.950
 eight is four then each one at 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.670
 divide it we have four wheels for 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.670
 each 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.760
 let's see another example 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:44.310
 here we have Sofia piloting the 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.400
 police helicopter 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.940
 but you have been told that you should remove the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.360
 half of the antlers of the helicopter of the 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.540
 propeller 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:05.650
 for maintenance 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:09.159
 let's see if the propellers are 1 2 3 and 4 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.590
 let's think then how many propellers have 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:16.750
 what to remove sofia 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.810
 if we divide 4 between 2 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.410
 would have 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.280
 what is 2 then let's remove two 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.280
 propellers 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.830
 a 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.330
 and 2 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.890
 these two helices 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.560
 They are the ones we will take 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.760
 maintenance so that our friend 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.549
 can fly the helicopter 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.069
 we are then in the understanding that 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:56.069
 when we talk about getting half of a 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:59.689
 number means that this is going to be 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.689
 divided by 2 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.739
 with the previous examples we could 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.599
 notice that when you take out half of a number 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.370
 and divide it between 2 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:14.350
 let's see how it would be written 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.620
 for example 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.630
 two 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.770
 if we want to get half to two 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:26.500
 we have to divide it between 2 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:32.740
 what does this mean we're going to look for 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:35.699
 a number that multiplied by two we 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.699
 give that result 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.300
 and then half of 2 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.300
 in this case if we go to the table 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.979
 we lived 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.580
 2 x 1 is 2 then the number that we 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:55.190
 It serves is 1 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:58.810
 1 x 2 2 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.529
 and here we have to do 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.770
 what would be the same 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:10.540
 what to say 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:14.610
 for example we have two tomatoes 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:17.510
 and we want to know half of those two 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:21.650
 then what we do 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:23.610
 as we draw here a line 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.750
 and we have left 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:31.529
 one either side of the other well 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:34.960
 we can say that one 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:38.949
 it's half of 2 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.260
 another example would be to take out half 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:44.050
 of 2 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.120
 and if they told us to separate this 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.770
 group of girls 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:53.440
 the group has two girls 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.440
 what happens if we take half 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:58.749
 she is one half and she is the other 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.749
 half 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.560
 means that of two girls who were 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.840
 if we take half 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.300
 which would be to divide it between 2 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:20.820
 there is a girl here 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:25.460
 and another girl here 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:33.190
 then how many girls are left of each 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:37.139
 side one and one 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:41.590
 then 2 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:46.700
 between 2 is a 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:49.520
 half of two is 1 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:52.250
