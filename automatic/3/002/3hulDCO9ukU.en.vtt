00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:04.809
 2 Christian Voss to 10 a light Hauer Defense yes Michael I would say that 

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:08.840
 One way the strategy game happens in two phases is always building a phase 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.150
 Defenses and in the second phase you look like the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.549
 Breaking up attacking enemies but 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.760
 since just shooting down enemies has gone so blindly through more that 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:18.890
 not boring 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.509
 No, on the contrary, it is extremely demanding 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:24.149
 because you have the of course so small RPG elements in it 

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:27.769
 that you defeat opponents Sondershausen so that you build again 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.089
 new towers upgrades its towers and so on 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.839
 why are you looking forward to three years, because that's where it comes from 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:37.760
 him that it is not the origin of pauli fans but murder consumers free 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.660
 that's really popular 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.360
 Meanwhile, you can feed your PC under big community 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.359
 Right of way woman the finest There are very many offshoots out there 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:49.040
 and six of them where you can watch all at once 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.310
 Just then write your one with one of the best in my opinion this one 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.310
 is it quite good that fits a classic tower defense can be said of the 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.039
 Mechanics too turnover also pointed Markov driver at that time 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.350
 one builds to shoot opponents is important here 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.309
 Towers automatically fire on the opponents ORF and the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.220
 currently you can accelerate too 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.970
 but this has nice variations in the gameplay the opponents run 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.150
 for example, back again after the sun twice but there are branches 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.670
 So you have to think well where to plow the sounds and place it 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.000
 Again and again there are regular new towers 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.140
 By the way, they are not Fanta monsters as you might expect afterwards 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.570
 shoots in Lienz in March synonymous times something users are always more of it 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.750
 It's surprising that most of the Fence games he science fiction 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.830
 Games take place 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.250
 which does not mean that you have your SOS Heinz Fiege refinery by for mother 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.040
 and five in what he rejects IGES Channel 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.900
 that looks pretty pretty too the effects are very chic seriously 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.700
 is that told Susanne story what must we say a phenomenal 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.140
 for son for defense game about saving yourself the most 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.210
 bring history has been found 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.100
 dpa Trion Worlds 2 Castle 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.370
 because even he is twisted around it is an offshoot of the role-playing game Two 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.900
 Worlds 2 also committed by values ​​so of the kickers of role-playing 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.640
 and 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.420
 and here you do not build a plummer 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.570
 Picture ddp 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.540
 Units are moving here, the towers are moving 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.880
 Defensive fall units on the map that work similarly with 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.299
 local associations Action Council India they are moving to their knees 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.079
 but they were here you can not control them Med and the carriers 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.739
 Unfortunately one does not have to say that the ALAG is something else than the units 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.799
 always grabbing the nearest Peter Andres Iniesta he let know 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.269
 if now in the healer is next to this way of holiness then may 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.219
 he continues one he is not attacked as well as pleading this caliber 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.909
 Soldier mine is not on shelling Well that can be pretty frustrating 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.950
 because one of the core elements of for the Fence is that you are your company 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.870
 or defenses can no longer give orders to this case if the 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.980
 Opponents first come 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.290
 and you are annoying that Michelle has already said 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.599
 then they would like to go to 1 0 against Honduras 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.269
 yes that's really a very nice idea but unfortunately not so 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.079
 great is implemented 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.369
 and then Springer again committed to his skits that thanks so 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:56.099
 Leyens 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.510
 Munich has it Massat Encounter you take on the role of human 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.720
 Raw material sammer 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.070
 on a distant planet, logically attacked by aliens 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.060
 and you have to build defensive zone and this fell a bag 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.740
 This is not a typical tower defense game they claimed 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.769
 Variations and Horte televisions gives 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.120
 because this one you can not win this game there is just that 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.600
 To endure as long as possible until one of the aliens vouched were overfull 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.530
 exactly as many raw materials together as possible 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.280
 Building material is used for the sounds you are building here 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.500
 Sword Enel, that you have to supply the company with energy 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.059
 you can get your energy nodules and then supply them with electricity 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:35.859
 And in order to do that, you also have to look after the expansion of the energy network 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.599
 dapd there are not so many variations of the companies but that 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:40.290
 not so bad 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.819
 and the few you have, you have to use them tactically 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.840
 possibly quite superior that is the challenge from which one will be here 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.790
 from real hope attacked ACE already fair Fankhauser 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.709
 so by the weather plays 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.069
 and here we see a normalization Roos of the 11 again one-sided play 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.749
 yes and again a variation locality also the crime scene is in principle 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:03.200
 but also offensive for me are already around and are enemies 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.640
 one can not even become a general with these commander in the middle of the picture 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.170
 say 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.560
 4 to when convoy accompanies this convoy drives machine for show the map 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.380
 Controlled his route you can be on the map you can handle it 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.209
 rectors 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.469
 Basically it consists of up to six vehicles and the order of these 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:22.419
 Vehicles with conventions these questions assemble a cowboy 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.909
 it is very important so you can drive for example large Kanzach ahead 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:29.719
 let it stop the fire from, for example, the rocket launcher for it 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:33.060
 Higher range but has never experienced and there is still much 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.659
 of it and so on and so forth as it is already practical out that is one 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:40.319
 change very interesting perspective you only notice how to play in this game 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.960
 probably widowed as the backs of the hand fine earlier this morning and water more tactical 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.370
 Execution I had already told 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.629
 he purely a consequence of the offenses to defy these companies 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:53.819
 he too that their food and in the way audi-fans offshoot namely his films 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.990
 is in principle a mixture of Rhauderfehn to ego-shooter in two 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.919
 Phases is divided there's the construction phase first that's a normal one 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.110
 So it looks like a normal woman playing defense in the tour 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.389
 built there but nothing happens first there are no opponents right and 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.089
 then you switch if the opponents come in the eu-pass with this mode you can 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:14.580
 The research says Bertow Defense Marius Hahn units give no instruction 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.180
 that's why we use the time officiated ourselves to shoot the community 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.099
 but now nothing to do you have advised me 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.479
 There are, among other things, assault rifles just normal and also after once cannon 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.410
 with which one can slow down opponents 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.410
 and so you try to support the self-made companies 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:33.630
 And he still did not bother me so much what the meaning behind it should be 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.550
 because of the son in Trebur Shooter you want her then the enemies 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.220
 Dodge and Christians can be hurt with their self that they go through 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.020
 The dense traffic flows the feeling that this is pushed to the side 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.650
 Under usually the company also comes quite well alone with supplements of the lawyer 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.360
 one of those concepts that always look great on paper and how much 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.850
 Gladbach 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.089
 Bochumer had five cool idea 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:56.009
 but if you are when you are playing the edge of the field 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.580
 No I do not calm down but still have to 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.349
 so we conclude by securing an interesting version »Vereinslied 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:05.490
 not as impressive as the song like Smash 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.000
 As well as you are allowed to have your game on board with the best names in the player 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.460
 this case is one of the worst cards 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.699
 it's about a city being overrun by zombies in this one 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:15.610
 colorful dots 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.960
 and you have to try to save as many civilians as possible yourself 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.499
 Helicopters landing places 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:24.069
 and then allowed later in the game 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:28.110
 In addition to being placed around CeBIT Hall Troops square four the one you place 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.280
 then gets more and more aids 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.580
 and to stop this tide as long as possible in the beginning 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.860
 really so and stop 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.150
 You can even catch these neighborhoods actually complete later 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.539
 To Clean Up Zombies With Sunny Melon Civilians The Savior The More 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:42.569
 You get points 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:46.300
 with which you can buy from now on so a kind of research to new ones 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.719
 Guided tours to get new weapons are golden the concept but unfortunately it is 

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:51.819
 Edit a little Mr let me 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:55.379
 In order to try so only 2 you know in the beginning I was so far the 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:58.629
 you have to try it first to do not know what the most effective 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:59.780
 defenses 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.940
 yes but still something but it is also about three players co-op mode 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.350
 Thanks to Christian the wars provided by these mourning doctors make up 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.510
 have the games customs borders next to son ever the next 6 50 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.650
 Apostolic until then
