00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.750
 of charlone iphone and in this short video 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.970
 We will teach you how to make videos or 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.309
 take or make a video using the 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.719
 This is very useful in case 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.710
 we are suddenly in an enclosure with 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.600
 a lot of darkness and we wanted to like 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.609
 make a video in which you can see the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.920
 sharper things using also the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.050
 help of the flash to take our video 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.890
 but we invite you to subscribe 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.199
 to our channel 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.140
 here abajito that says to subscribe 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.640
 stripes and that way they can follow 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.489
 our videos and the questions arrive 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.270
 comments with suggestions to activate 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.010
 the flash to to shoot a video is 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.360
 very simple we just enter here 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.160
 to the camera 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.070
 remember that normally the suddenly 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.410
 will be here where it says photo here 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.910
 where it says photos where we take photos 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.100
 but here where it says videos and we move it 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.860
 left once where we can 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.370
 make videos 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.040
 the normally up here has the 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.829
 Flash indicator is usually on 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.379
 automatic 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.110
 if it is in automatic, the safest thing is 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.420
 that suddenly we do need 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.630
 use the flash do not activate it because in 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.970
 how much the camera will not think it does not 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.590
 requires but for some need 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.710
 own we need to make a 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.420
 video with much more light after 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.119
 we just click here again 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.820
 up where it says automatic or where 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.429
 say yes or no and read and in this way 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.799
 we force the flash to turn on 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.619
 as you can see in the background 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.850
 the flash immediately went on 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.819
 let's do a test to bad in 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.780
 automatic here is not the automatic 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:46.539
 and the flash is off you can not see 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.790
 you in the background the brightness if I start 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:53.590
 to make a video 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.960
 by darby let's see I think no no 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.409
 I activate the flash 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.969
 let's stop it 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.549
 to have it here and let's put it on 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:07.079
 annual and how can you see right now the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.460
 light in the front 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:13.210
 that is the camera flash 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:17.530
 to video mode and in this case already 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.569
 we have a video with much more light in the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.060
 if we remove it 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.680
 so the ideal is to keep it from 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.099
 soon on automatic if you see that 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.379
 they need more light somewhere 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.560
 simply changing it automatically so 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.849
 as he teaches previously that was 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.590
 all for this video 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.689
