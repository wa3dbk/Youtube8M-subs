per<00:00:01.660> flight<00:00:01.990> with<00:00:02.260> Bo

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:05.570 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.510 

ok<00:00:06.560> so<00:00:06.620> now<00:00:06.830> we're<00:00:06.950> going<00:00:06.980> to<00:00:07.100> have<00:00:07.220> a<00:00:07.310> little

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:07.520 
ok so now we're going to have a little

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.379 
ok so now we're going to have a little
look<00:00:07.670> at<00:00:07.820> the<00:00:08.060> the<00:00:08.540> B<00:00:09.020> twist<00:00:09.410> vault<00:00:10.389> obviously

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
look at the the B twist vault obviously

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.230 
look at the the B twist vault obviously
best<00:00:12.050> thing<00:00:12.290> to<00:00:12.320> to<00:00:13.190> learn<00:00:13.400> for<00:00:13.790> this<00:00:13.940> before

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
best thing to to learn for this before

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.330 
best thing to to learn for this before
you<00:00:14.540> try<00:00:14.750> this<00:00:14.780> volt<00:00:15.289> is<00:00:15.469> the<00:00:15.889> butterfly<00:00:16.160> twist

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
you try this volt is the butterfly twist

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.370 
you try this volt is the butterfly twist
on<00:00:16.730> the<00:00:16.820> floor<00:00:17.030> so<00:00:17.510> check<00:00:17.780> that<00:00:17.810> one<00:00:17.990> out<00:00:18.230> and

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
on the floor so check that one out and

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.820 
on the floor so check that one out and
get<00:00:18.560> that<00:00:18.650> nice<00:00:18.860> and<00:00:18.890> solid<00:00:19.250> on<00:00:19.520> floor<00:00:19.820> first

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
get that nice and solid on floor first

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.169 
get that nice and solid on floor first
the<00:00:21.830> way<00:00:21.980> you<00:00:22.039> approach<00:00:22.429> it<00:00:22.640> with<00:00:22.760> a<00:00:22.789> vault<00:00:23.029> is

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:23.179 
the way you approach it with a vault is

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.480 
the way you approach it with a vault is
actually<00:00:23.480> very<00:00:23.599> similar<00:00:24.279> you're<00:00:25.279> going<00:00:25.429> to

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
actually very similar you're going to

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.779 
actually very similar you're going to
take<00:00:25.730> off<00:00:26.230> in<00:00:27.230> fact<00:00:27.500> show<00:00:27.679> my<00:00:27.949> demo<00:00:28.189> in<00:00:28.429> one

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
take off in fact show my demo in one

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:36.100 
take off in fact show my demo in one
first<00:00:29.119> for<00:00:29.359> us<00:00:33.250> nice<00:00:34.250> so<00:00:34.850> you<00:00:34.940> see<00:00:35.150> it's<00:00:35.450> it's<00:00:35.990> a

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
first for us nice so you see it's it's a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.979 
first for us nice so you see it's it's a
one<00:00:36.260> foot<00:00:36.470> takeoff<00:00:36.980> basically<00:00:37.579> and<00:00:37.789> this<00:00:38.690> move

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
one foot takeoff basically and this move

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.619 
one foot takeoff basically and this move
really<00:00:39.379> is<00:00:39.649> about<00:00:39.829> intense<00:00:40.340> power<00:00:40.670> ok<00:00:41.270> so<00:00:41.329> as

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
really is about intense power ok so as

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.139 
really is about intense power ok so as
you<00:00:41.840> take<00:00:42.050> off<00:00:42.289> it's<00:00:43.190> very<00:00:43.430> similar<00:00:43.670> to<00:00:43.820> that<00:00:43.969> B

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
you take off it's very similar to that B

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.029 
you take off it's very similar to that B
twist<00:00:44.449> where<00:00:44.629> you<00:00:44.750> you<00:00:45.079> really<00:00:45.379> do<00:00:45.530> you<00:00:45.680> set<00:00:46.010> up

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
twist where you you really do you set up

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.459 
twist where you you really do you set up
with<00:00:46.340> that<00:00:46.550> that<00:00:46.969> arm<00:00:47.239> and<00:00:47.449> you<00:00:47.840> just<00:00:48.050> wrap<00:00:48.440> it

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
with that that arm and you just wrap it

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.650 
with that that arm and you just wrap it
real<00:00:48.860> tight<00:00:49.219> once<00:00:49.460> you<00:00:49.640> come<00:00:49.820> through<00:00:50.090> but<00:00:50.539> the

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
real tight once you come through but the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.270 
real tight once you come through but the
key<00:00:50.840> thing<00:00:50.870> is<00:00:51.199> to<00:00:51.350> not<00:00:51.469> wrap<00:00:51.710> too<00:00:51.949> early

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
key thing is to not wrap too early

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.729 
key thing is to not wrap too early
because<00:00:52.640> as<00:00:52.850> you<00:00:53.510> take<00:00:53.750> off<00:00:53.960> of<00:00:54.140> your<00:00:54.170> one<00:00:54.469> foot

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
because as you take off of your one foot

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.750 
because as you take off of your one foot
you<00:00:55.219> take<00:00:55.899> the<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:57.230> lifting<00:00:57.649> leg<00:00:57.859> comes<00:00:58.519> up

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
you take the the lifting leg comes up

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.430 
you take the the lifting leg comes up
over<00:00:59.000> the<00:00:59.269> Volkers<00:00:59.750> obviously<00:01:00.079> you've<00:01:00.199> got<00:01:00.230> a

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
over the Volkers obviously you've got a

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.990 
over the Volkers obviously you've got a
volt<00:01:00.710> or<00:01:00.980> a<00:01:01.039> wall<00:01:01.340> or<00:01:01.550> whatever<00:01:01.699> you're

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
volt or a wall or whatever you're

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.459 
volt or a wall or whatever you're
looking<00:01:02.210> to<00:01:02.329> clear<00:01:02.600> you've<00:01:03.019> got<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:03.230> get<00:01:03.350> over

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
looking to clear you've got to get over

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.380 
looking to clear you've got to get over
that<00:01:03.739> obstacle<00:01:03.890> because<00:01:04.699> if<00:01:04.850> you<00:01:04.970> just<00:01:05.210> try

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
that obstacle because if you just try

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.490 
that obstacle because if you just try
and<00:01:05.420> go<00:01:05.600> like<00:01:05.780> that<00:01:05.900> then<00:01:06.110> you're<00:01:06.230> just<00:01:06.320> going

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
and go like that then you're just going

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.530 
and go like that then you're just going
to<00:01:06.530> go<00:01:06.680> into<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:07.160> so<00:01:07.370> you<00:01:07.820> really<00:01:07.910> have<00:01:08.330> got

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
to go into it so you really have got

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.330 
to go into it so you really have got
approach<00:01:09.080> it<00:01:09.260> almost<00:01:09.440> like<00:01:09.650> a<00:01:09.680> speed<00:01:10.040> fault

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
approach it almost like a speed fault

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.460 
approach it almost like a speed fault
where<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:10.970> powerfully<00:01:11.479> jump<00:01:11.810> up<00:01:12.020> bring<00:01:12.439> your

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
where you powerfully jump up bring your

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.980 
where you powerfully jump up bring your
body<00:01:12.799> almost<00:01:13.400> kind<00:01:13.610> of<00:01:13.670> horizontal<00:01:13.939> get<00:01:14.840> that

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
body almost kind of horizontal get that

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.320 
body almost kind of horizontal get that
leg<00:01:15.200> up<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:15.590> then<00:01:16.009> once<00:01:16.520> you've<00:01:16.729> planted<00:01:17.030> that

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
leg up and then once you've planted that

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.770 
leg up and then once you've planted that
hand<00:01:17.659> on<00:01:17.840> it's<00:01:18.380> not<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:19.759> hand<00:01:20.150> really

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
hand on it's not the hand really

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.719 
hand on it's not the hand really
you<00:01:20.900> don't<00:01:21.110> look<00:01:21.320> use<00:01:21.530> it<00:01:21.770> loads<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:22.369> know<00:01:22.400> it

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
you don't look use it loads you know it

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.060 
you don't look use it loads you know it
really<00:01:22.880> is<00:01:23.060> just<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.570> bit<00:01:24.200> of<00:01:24.229> an<00:01:24.380> aid<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:24.740> kind

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
really is just a bit of an aid to kind

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.530 
really is just a bit of an aid to kind
of<00:01:25.250> give<00:01:25.430> you<00:01:25.520> a<00:01:25.549> bit<00:01:25.729> more<00:01:25.909> height<00:01:26.150> and<00:01:26.360> push

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
of give you a bit more height and push

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.109 
of give you a bit more height and push
off<00:01:26.750> of<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.049> vault<00:01:27.259> for<00:01:27.500> when<00:01:28.009> you<00:01:28.280> wrap

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
off of the vault for when you wrap

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.910 
off of the vault for when you wrap
straight<00:01:29.509> artists<00:01:30.020> it<00:01:30.290> kind<00:01:30.500> of<00:01:30.560> helps<00:01:30.829> with

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
straight artists it kind of helps with

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.830 
straight artists it kind of helps with
that<00:01:31.070> timing<00:01:31.400> so<00:01:32.030> once<00:01:32.210> you've<00:01:32.390> taken<00:01:32.570> off

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
that timing so once you've taken off

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.590 
that timing so once you've taken off
you've<00:01:32.990> pushed<00:01:33.229> off<00:01:33.500> as<00:01:33.650> you're<00:01:33.860> you're

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
you've pushed off as you're you're

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.690 
you've pushed off as you're you're
jumping<00:01:35.600> leg<00:01:35.780> really<00:01:36.409> pushed<00:01:36.649> off<00:01:36.890> driven<00:01:37.610> up

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
jumping leg really pushed off driven up

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.940 
jumping leg really pushed off driven up
into<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.119> air<00:01:38.240> push<00:01:38.899> off<00:01:39.079> of<00:01:39.110> that<00:01:39.350> hand<00:01:39.649> and

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
into the air push off of that hand and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.590 
into the air push off of that hand and
then<00:01:40.250> that's<00:01:40.490> once<00:01:40.759> when<00:01:41.149> you're<00:01:41.299> kind<00:01:41.540> of

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
then that's once when you're kind of

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.780 
then that's once when you're kind of
coming<00:01:41.810> over<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:42.200> vault<00:01:42.409> this<00:01:42.950> arms<00:01:43.340> set<00:01:43.610> up

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
coming over the vault this arms set up

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.789 
coming over the vault this arms set up
high<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:44.329> you<00:01:44.390> wrap<00:01:44.869> it<00:01:44.899> real<00:01:45.259> tight<00:01:45.590> like<00:01:45.619> a

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
high and you wrap it real tight like a
