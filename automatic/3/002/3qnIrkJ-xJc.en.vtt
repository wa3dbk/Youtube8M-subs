huh now there's various degrees of
staccato<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.850> can<00:02:18.120> make<00:02:18.270> something<00:02:18.480> very

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
staccato you can make something very

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.310 
staccato you can make something very
short<00:02:23.060> or<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.120> can<00:02:24.420> make<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.930> little<00:02:25.140> bit

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
short or you can make it a little bit

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.820 
short or you can make it a little bit
longer<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:30.140> depends<00:02:31.140> on<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.320> particular

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
longer that depends on a particular

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.690 
longer that depends on a particular
passage<00:02:32.600> now<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.630> lot<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:33.930> times<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:35.190> neither

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
passage now a lot of times you neither

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.360 
passage now a lot of times you neither
want<00:02:36.030> staccato<00:02:36.420> nor<00:02:36.930> legato<00:02:37.320> in<00:02:37.920> which<00:02:38.130> case

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
want staccato nor legato in which case

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.040 
want staccato nor legato in which case
you<00:02:38.520> can<00:02:38.730> place<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.270> note<00:02:39.450> play<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.840> notes

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
you can place the note play the notes

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.080 
you can place the note play the notes
just<00:02:40.560> slightly<00:02:41.100> detached<00:02:41.400> from<00:02:41.700> each<00:02:41.850> other

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
just slightly detached from each other

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.090 
just slightly detached from each other
and<00:02:42.300> that's<00:02:42.870> more<00:02:43.050> evident<00:02:43.440> if<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.710> repeat

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
and that's more evident if you repeat

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.670 
and that's more evident if you repeat
the<00:02:44.250> same<00:02:44.460> note<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:44.940> if<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.210> play<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:46.170> same<00:02:46.350> note

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
the same note so if I play the same note

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.610 
the same note so if I play the same note
um<00:02:46.950> just<00:02:47.850> legato<00:02:48.240> and<00:02:48.540> I'm<00:02:48.840> going<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.230> mute<00:02:49.440> the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
um just legato and I'm going to mute the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.770 
um just legato and I'm going to mute the
other<00:02:49.740> strings<00:02:50.220> with<00:02:50.460> a<00:02:50.850> slight<00:02:51.090> bar<00:02:51.300> just<00:02:51.600> so

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
other strings with a slight bar just so

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.600 
other strings with a slight bar just so
the<00:02:52.380> resonance<00:02:52.800> from<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.040> guitar<00:02:53.280> doesn't

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
the resonance from the guitar doesn't

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:01.610 
the resonance from the guitar doesn't
get<00:02:53.790> in<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:53.970> way<00:02:54.110> so<00:02:55.110> if<00:02:55.200> I'm<00:02:55.290> playing<00:02:55.470> legato<00:03:00.620> if

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
get in a way so if I'm playing legato if

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.550 
get in a way so if I'm playing legato if
I<00:03:01.710> play<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.040> same<00:03:02.160> thing<00:03:02.220> staccato<00:03:06.440> that's<00:03:07.440> a

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
I play the same thing staccato that's a

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.730 
I play the same thing staccato that's a
very<00:03:07.770> clean<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.400> very<00:03:08.570> different<00:03:09.590> two<00:03:10.590> ways

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
very clean and very different two ways

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.620 
very clean and very different two ways
of<00:03:10.920> articulating<00:03:11.040> now<00:03:12.030> in<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.480> in-between

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
of articulating now in the in-between

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.260 
of articulating now in the in-between
the<00:03:13.200> detachment<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:14.040> just<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.760> little<00:03:15.060> bit<00:03:15.150> of

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
the detachment is just a little bit of

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:23.229 
the detachment is just a little bit of
silence<00:03:15.660> between<00:03:15.950> one<00:03:16.950> note<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.430> next

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.410 

it's<00:03:24.239> almost<00:03:24.510> like<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.780> tiny<00:03:25.110> little<00:03:25.350> on<00:03:26.420> muting

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
it's almost like a tiny little on muting

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.420 
it's almost like a tiny little on muting
right<00:03:27.900> before<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.380> plug<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.739> next<00:03:29.010> note<00:03:29.190> and

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
right before you plug the next note and

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.870 
right before you plug the next note and
it<00:03:29.760> introduces<00:03:30.330> a<00:03:30.390> slight<00:03:30.830> jump<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.640> slight

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
it introduces a slight jump and a slight

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.740 
it introduces a slight jump and a slight
kind<00:03:33.209> of<00:03:33.330> um<00:03:33.480> make<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:34.020> jump<00:03:34.230> in<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.350> step<00:03:38.750> this

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
kind of um make a jump in the step this

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.240 
kind of um make a jump in the step this
can<00:03:39.959> come<00:03:40.140> in<00:03:40.170> handy<00:03:40.290> especially<00:03:40.650> if<00:03:41.130> you're

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
can come in handy especially if you're

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.400 
can come in handy especially if you're
repeating<00:03:41.520> one<00:03:41.820> note<00:03:42.060> that<00:03:42.540> way<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:42.720> can<00:03:43.020> sort

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
repeating one note that way you can sort

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.840 
repeating one note that way you can sort
of<00:03:43.470> articulate<00:03:44.100> it<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.250> little<00:03:44.400> better<00:03:44.580> and

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
of articulate it a little better and

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.680 
of articulate it a little better and
something<00:03:45.420> different<00:03:45.750> than<00:03:45.870> legato<00:03:47.510> by<00:03:48.510> for

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
something different than legato by for

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.500 
something different than legato by for
example<00:03:48.900> if<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.440> were<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.709> play<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.970> bar<00:03:51.150> few

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
example if you were to play the bar few

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.810 
example if you were to play the bar few
from<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.350> first<00:03:52.530> violin<00:03:52.800> sonata<00:03:53.100> you<00:03:53.580> could

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
from the first violin sonata you could

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:00.240 
from the first violin sonata you could
do<00:03:54.060> all<00:03:54.690> legato

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.100 

Zehra<00:04:01.250> you<00:04:01.910> could<00:04:02.090> do<00:04:02.180> everything<00:04:02.569> staccato

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
Zehra you could do everything staccato

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.630 
Zehra you could do everything staccato
which<00:04:03.319> is<00:04:03.440> probably<00:04:03.800> not<00:04:03.980> not<00:04:04.610> very

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
which is probably not not very

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.170 
which is probably not not very
recommended

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.430 

I<00:04:11.209> don't<00:04:11.450> think<00:04:11.510> buff<00:04:11.780> will<00:04:11.959> be<00:04:12.050> very<00:04:12.230> happy

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
I don't think buff will be very happy

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.140 
I don't think buff will be very happy
with<00:04:12.650> that<00:04:12.769> or<00:04:12.950> you<00:04:13.250> could<00:04:13.519> do<00:04:13.670> a<00:04:13.700> little<00:04:13.970> bit

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
with that or you could do a little bit

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:22.900 
with that or you could do a little bit
of<00:04:14.300> detachment<00:04:14.660> between<00:04:15.349> the<00:04:15.709> notes<00:04:21.490> and<00:04:22.490> you

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
of detachment between the notes and you

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.690 
of detachment between the notes and you
wouldn't<00:04:23.180> do<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.510> on<00:04:23.570> every<00:04:23.960> single<00:04:24.320> note<00:04:24.700> so

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
wouldn't do it on every single note so

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.760 
wouldn't do it on every single note so
by<00:04:25.850> having<00:04:26.030> these<00:04:26.810> techniques<00:04:27.380> in<00:04:27.530> your

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
by having these techniques in your

by having these techniques in your
vocabulary<00:04:28.310> in<00:04:28.669> your<00:04:28.790> arsenal<00:04:29.270> you<00:04:29.479> can<00:04:30.050> pick

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
vocabulary in your arsenal you can pick

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.379 
vocabulary in your arsenal you can pick
and<00:04:30.650> choose<00:04:30.889> which<00:04:31.190> note<00:04:31.460> gets<00:04:31.850> how<00:04:32.330> much

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
and choose which note gets how much

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.600 
and choose which note gets how much
detachment<00:04:33.169> how<00:04:33.350> much<00:04:33.590> legato<00:04:33.979> or<00:04:34.310> how<00:04:34.490> much

detachment how much legato or how much

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.360 
detachment how much legato or how much
staccato<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:35.330> a<00:04:35.780> combination<00:04:36.080> of<00:04:36.500> those<00:04:36.770> will

staccato and a combination of those will

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.680 
staccato and a combination of those will
make<00:04:37.400> your<00:04:37.729> phrasing<00:04:38.150> a<00:04:38.240> little<00:04:38.450> bit<00:04:38.540> more

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
make your phrasing a little bit more

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.340 
make your phrasing a little bit more
interesting<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.410> more<00:04:39.950> lively
