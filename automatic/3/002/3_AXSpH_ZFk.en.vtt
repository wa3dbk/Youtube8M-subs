00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 of the dull plastic roller to the 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.919
 biggest decoration projects in brazil 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.090
 we are in a sanctuary for any 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.250
 decorator 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.200
 this is the showroom of the biggest company that 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.870
 sells Christmas effects in the country 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.820
 it is from here that all the trends of the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.180
 large networks and decoration 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.670
 for example in 2011 the greatest novelty is 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.510
 this decorative branch here in the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.510
 different colors 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.800
 in this factory beyond the traditional garland 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.520
 trees are also produced. 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.160
 Christmas 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.710
 are dozens of models and sizes good 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.110
 part of the process is also machined 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.239
 the plastic and the wire are placed in the 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.000
 machine that twists everything to give this 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.379
 volume that changes with each season is 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.510
 the color of the material 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.700
 this year for example the darker green 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.700
 and dull is trendy 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.220
 the models are also different 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.770
 thinner and taller trees are 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.650
 apartments with less space in the most 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.570
 wide and low are home but what 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.330
 makes the difference in 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.150
 company is selling props are more 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.670
 of 2,000 items in the catalog most of them 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.900
 of them is imported that is why every 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.700
 three months 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.740
 this company manager travels to the 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.070
 China to control the system of 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.300
 they have a process and a cost 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.210
 cheaper 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.000
 This may be the difference, but this 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.040
 it is not for us a difference that the 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.170
 people try to do with lower cost 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.190
 but always worrying about the 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.660
 quality 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:50.240
 [Music] 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.920
 Christmas starts here in February and only 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.350
 Ends in November 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.270
 but most of the employees 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.240
 coming back practically next year 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.170
 also when I start production I go 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.350
 play again 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.740
 It's been a long time since he worked for me. 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.000
 Do you know how he knows my job? 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.310
 [Music] 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.480
 [Applause] 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.220
 for Christmas 2011 vibrant colors 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.959
 renew classic red and green 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.569
 that's why this showcase in 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.069
 size you can find several 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.349
 different scenarios 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.620
 the charm of white gives the faces here 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:30.430
 but the vedete this tree decorated with 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.430
 shades of blue 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.950
 still on time I do not know if you 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.200
 noticed but the good old man is 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:47.150
 losing space 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.150
