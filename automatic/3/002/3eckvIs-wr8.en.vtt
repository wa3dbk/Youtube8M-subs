00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 this is the hon six plus and the plus in it 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.160
 his name already reveals it is the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.230
 larger version of the hunger six and yes 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.210
 how much larger than to the dogs is 6 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.670
 15 gives a 5 inch screen and this one 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.990
 has a 5.5 inch screen 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.490
 but the rest is actually that 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.310
 have not changed much 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.050
 yes he is basically the same 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.750
 still see a nice metal border 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.060
 on the side and yes on the back 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.380
 you will also find a full glass plate 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.210
 maybe a little bit in that glass plate 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.099
 hard to see is sort of 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.480
 text hour now incorporated it looks 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.520
 actually quite nice when you lie 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.860
 shine on it are small ones 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.750
 yes a kind of reflective pixel 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.760
 bull then you see the rest 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.920
 basically everything you expect 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.660
 find here the buttons on the on the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.850
 usual places include the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.590
 different slots and at the back 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.360
 you will of course also find the camera 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.969
 to come back to you right away 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.199
 sees that there are two lenses and on the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.579
 top you can also find infrared 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.559
 so you can also do sports 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.090
 to know how to operate 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.559
 Well then go watch device itself 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.940
 how it works 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.710
 then you actually see that it is one 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.590
 one hundred device is running on android 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.020
 4 point 4 and there is another one over it 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.430
 so-called sauce of hunger itself 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.890
 e-motion you why 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.240
 well your motion joah you can do a lot 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.470
 support it or you can do it 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.140
 not find anything 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.759
 but in itself it works just fine 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.650
 only real drawback I think is you 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.369
 not all applications in one overview 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.530
 from a to Z 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.030
 but for the rest 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.680
 it just works well you can do everything 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.939
 completely in parts the way you want 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.130
 different tabs 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.920
 you can also organize everything into folders and 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.509
 in addition, it is also freely adaptable 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.250
 because you see that I now have a certain theme 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.240
 have installed but can just go on 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.020
 themes busy and you can do that too 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.360
 endless 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.250
 download many themes or standard 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.290
 choose themes so that all works 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.820
 very easy and walk 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.259
 I think the notification screen is handy for you 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.659
 it actually sees all your notifications 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.649
 a kind of timeline but I like it 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.659
 pretty nice because then you see exactly 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.329
 when something has come in without 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.680
 that you continue the app or notification 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.149
 have to open 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.799
 Well it's about a nice smooth one 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.840
 octa-core processor which actually two 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.850
 times a quad core processor is one of them 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.680
 the quad core processor is a 1.8 3gs 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.569
 processor and other is in a bowl with 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.010
 three gigahertz process become prezi 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.260
 supported by 3 gigabytes of ram memory 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.060
 internally it has 32 gigabytes 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.409
 storage and you can possibly do that 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.209
 when you use it 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.400
 with a sim card that can expand 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.019
 using a micro sd card and you can 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.090
 so also use it with two 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.280
 SIM cards and if you have 2 SIM cards in it 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.690
 so then you can't do another micro 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.280
 insert sd card 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.769
 so he also has the ability to 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.909
 just do as in functionalities too 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.470
 support 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.329
 well the rear camera that is 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.250
 a very interesting thing you see 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:42.159
 they are two members they really are 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.530
 two cameras of 8 megapixels and two 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.849
 year flash is found next to the 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.170
 front camera is actually 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.629
 exactly the same unit because that is also 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.010
 an 8 megapixel variant but the question is 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.079
 of course what can you do with that 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.609
 room at the back we see 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.620
 here standard that you actually have 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:59.379
 over three different modes you can 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.079
 just the normal photo mode mode 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.909
 year use also have all kinds 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.829
 such changes that it can make 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.720
 You can also get filters right 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.670
 and things like that 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.750
 you can do the same with the 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.269
 front camera 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.920
 the nice thing is that below again say 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.169
 but a small preview at the top left 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.519
 shows that you really look into the lens 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:20.049
 at moment when you take a selfie to it 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.250
 make it 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.410
 yes you also have some of that 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.709
 beautify it making your face more beautiful 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.870
 is becoming 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.449
 well you can also film filming you do 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.280
 the maximum resolution of 1080 p or 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:33.250
 full hd but then we come here to the 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.019
 separate modes with yes, call them broad 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.120
 aperture bit poor 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.739
 but what it comes down to here 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.560
 is you can focus on something and you can 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.760
 also choose the same aperture value 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.440
 but you can also do that afterwards 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.609
 and also adjust the sharpness and depth 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.449
 ratio that tub is completely 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.280
 To adjust 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:50.199
 thanks to those two lenses to let that 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.209
 would not see a picture of my hand 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:54.430
 so not so exciting but i show 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.290
 have made a picture of Kevin here and 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.879
 you see that here i kevin his head and 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.680
 sharp and basically everything there 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.299
 following an az is out of focus 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.370
 and when I press this button I can 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.220
 is wiser so I can focus 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.489
 move completely and in addition I can 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.379
 also the value of say yes that 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.690
 just ask how blurry rest is 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.579
 I can also change completely afterwards and 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.079
 then I may want to stand up as our photo or 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.150
 I can just do that again afterwards 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.979
 how often I want to change that 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.710
 is really a very cool feature of it 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:26.110
 this hunger finally bus 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.160
 you still have a battery of 36 100 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.190
 milligrams per hour 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.449
 that 's a lot of battery capacity and you 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.370
 would actually have no problem 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.560
 to use with this phone also at 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.569
 the SIM card for a whole day 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.610
 now you want more information about the other 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.479
 6 plus or maybe the same 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.509
 purchase 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:47.130
 go to pdashop.nl or point b or come 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:47.130
 of course in one of our stores
