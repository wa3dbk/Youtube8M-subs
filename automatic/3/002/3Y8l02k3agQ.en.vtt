move<00:01:35.229> but<00:01:35.619> it<00:01:35.709> actually<00:01:35.860> worked<00:01:36.220> out<00:01:36.429> for<00:01:37.149> the

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:37.209 
move but it actually worked out for the

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:39.359 
move but it actually worked out for the
shoe<00:01:37.390> being<00:01:37.569> mostly<00:01:37.899> purple<00:01:38.319> and<00:01:38.440> gold<00:01:38.590> they

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
went with a white midsole which I think

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:41.400 
went with a white midsole which I think
was<00:01:40.959> hot

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
was hot

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.199 
was hot
um<00:01:41.740> I<00:01:41.920> actually<00:01:42.069> think<00:01:42.340> it<00:01:42.459> was<00:01:42.640> purple<00:01:42.970> of<00:01:43.090> God

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:43.209 
um I actually think it was purple of God

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:44.880 
um I actually think it was purple of God
I<00:01:43.330> probably<00:01:43.569> wouldn't<00:01:43.840> about<00:01:44.080> it<00:01:44.259> but<00:01:44.440> uh<00:01:44.470> I

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
I probably wouldn't about it but uh I

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.680 
I probably wouldn't about it but uh I
think<00:01:45.429> the<00:01:45.520> white<00:01:45.729> actually<00:01:46.209> makes<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.509> shoe

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
think the white actually makes the shoe

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.529 
think the white actually makes the shoe
pop<00:01:46.929> the<00:01:47.110> white<00:01:47.289> midsole<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:48.670> bears<00:01:49.119> suede

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
pop the white midsole this bears suede

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.960 
pop the white midsole this bears suede

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
or nubuck on the shoe on certain areas

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.180
