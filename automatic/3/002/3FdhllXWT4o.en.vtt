that could have had a lot to do with
that<00:00:53.219> maybe<00:00:53.579> if<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.789> don't<00:00:53.879> drink<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.210> lot<00:00:54.239> of

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
that maybe if you don't drink a lot of

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.720 
that maybe if you don't drink a lot of
water<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.780> might<00:00:54.960> experience<00:00:55.579> right<00:00:56.579> guys

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
water you might experience right guys

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.260 
water you might experience right guys
because<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.120> high<00:00:57.239> dosage<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:58.100> biotin<00:00:59.270> but

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
because it's a high dosage of biotin but

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.900 
because it's a high dosage of biotin but
drink<00:01:00.899> water<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.829> mean<00:01:02.160> drinking<00:01:02.430> water<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
drink water I mean drinking water is the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.020 
drink water I mean drinking water is the
free<00:01:03.120> anyway<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.470> didn't<00:01:05.309> experience<00:01:05.610> any

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
free anyway so I didn't experience any

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.980 
free anyway so I didn't experience any
of<00:01:06.180> those<00:01:06.420> um<00:01:08.090> let's<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.270> what<00:01:09.420> else<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.869> I

of those um let's see what else and I

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.630 
of those um let's see what else and I
guess<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.470> could<00:01:10.619> just<00:01:10.799> say<00:01:10.950> everything<00:01:11.430> works

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640
