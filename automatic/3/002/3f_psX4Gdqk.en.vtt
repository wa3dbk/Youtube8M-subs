00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 a girl is that she is made and because 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.759
 I'm great and those things are here 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.410
 in black ops 2 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.090
 I should not have seen that because I did not 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.220
 I wanted to come and that but good 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.900
 let's play a free for all 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.900
 with the ballista with this camouflage 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:23.560
 I like carrier very much for 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:25.510
 a lot of people are crap it's all 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.460
 open carrier to play with him is my 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.460
 but it is a joy 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.640
 because on this map you are not 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.360
 old pitillas when you look is the country 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.360
 followed by the j 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.629
 on this map free for all play it 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.480
 shit 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.070
 cemex 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.070
 no luck 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.920
 Why are you leaving 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.920
 I started stealing 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.699
 I'm sorry to take out the secondary thing 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.060
 that I really hate that they do to me the 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:11.820
 cni but in fact there was not the other 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.820
 I have not seen that it was in the drums 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.360
 and is pointing focused on my vision 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.930
 because I now realize that is was 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.930
 batum 20 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.420
 is thrown 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.610
 Wow 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.910
 it's a person thing that we better tell 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.530
 because they are those things that you think 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.530
 but if you say them on youtube, people 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:55.290
 I have eaten a good tip mita 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.290

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.070
 effectively this map for free for 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.070

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:17.170

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.170

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.829

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.720
 I do not know what happened, I should have 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.720
 killed 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.730
 in attention of enemy on the way 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.439
 in the experience 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.439
 cocks to kill 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.470

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.420

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.300

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.590
