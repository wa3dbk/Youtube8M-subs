00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.300
 and the game we have is called puppies save 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.210
 farm and as always in the beginning I will say 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.600
 subscribe to the put put likes channel 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.520
 comment on videos and drove in puppies 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.340
 we have a very important task 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.189
 his farm needs our help coming 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.590
 snow and everything can fall asleep and whale 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:36.000
 need him juicy help to spend 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:39.480
 trophy and here is our most important 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.370
 assignment so brushes ahead we need 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:48.090
 it would be understandable because the task of which will be 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:53.120
 first to perform to help so here 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.120
 us and because of the approaching snowfall 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:01.920
 pumpkin bath and we need their cousins in 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:06.210
 special box and watch carefully 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:10.530
 so as not to catch hay from the pumpkin 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.979
 can fly help us this puppy 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.939
 marshal and miss already from the beginning 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.650
 and begin to actually rolls 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.780
 pumpkin starts to roll 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.060
 which we need to identify urgently 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:30.720
 to help the term harvest the whole crop 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:35.070
 then the moment it comes to snowfall 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:40.500
 jokes so this stuff can't be 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:45.180
 just fall because they give us a grain of sand 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:48.570
 knock off the barrels of smog this like that 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.120
 so what do you miss her need 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.659
 and I didn't steal all the pumpkins on our left 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.220
 there is on top which shows how much 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.760
 already gone kidney 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.540
 this show the taiga scales which 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:07.310
 It happens therefore as soon as chocolate 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:11.430
 diggers so I understand at least we can 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:15.060
 whose barrel will be filled and will be mini 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.990
 the game is over and see what you 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.990
 cool 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:27.150
 the puppy got in beautiful and here is the puppy 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.200
 collected everything we actually have pumpkin chase 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:36.090
 he helps in general well done and now we 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.340
 can so we collected 44 pumpkins and can 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.780
 be his next assignment for help on 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:49.550
 farm so now we pick apples and 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.550
 here we own rocky and burly 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.540
 need to specifically build a road to 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.050
 apples fell into the basket 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.160
 so here we go and here burly pushes 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.750
 on i will be on the bulldozer i don't use 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.960
 of course the store 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.740
 so now build on us a lot 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:18.340
 design so that the apples 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.320
 fell only in the basket 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.650
 After all, on the apples there is difficult to transfer 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.090
 another way in bucket example 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.890
 bulldozer so we only have 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.200
 with this device everything is possible 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.490
 do 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.320
 window really is not very difficult 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.860
 so we will gladly help 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.930
 pads and ours for the best farmer 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.500
 which drive rolls alone with all 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:47.480
 work and we see and collected all 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.170
 the apples here we actually or 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.380
 embroidered shirts 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.550
 and because everything turned out well and choose 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.550
 next task 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:05.590
 can a bunch of different vegetables of mighty and 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.590
 helicopter move them 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.590
 So 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.460
 move with the mouse 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.030
 take 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:31.810
 so here so take everything and spread 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:35.020
 the car needs this one understood it that way 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.390
 of course it is faster, although it is worth 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.480
 so often happy that something 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.800
 right 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.440
 lays out vegetables what man 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.340
 falls on his helicopter and this is ours 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:53.110
 takes a lot of time and of course she 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.310
 We put so central to cheer 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.630
 so far we take again 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:02.140
 oh no go there if we take cabbage carry 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:05.580
 her rockets take corn window myself 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:08.670
 I'll add and take 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:14.770
 I think these are apples and mashka tomatoes 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:17.710
 well and actually 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:21.570
 scale as much as possible vegetables spread and 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.570
 thereby helping farmers 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:32.500
 time is quite a bit left but i 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:35.560
 I think you can if that farmer help 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:38.610
 almost all vegetables spread just 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.610
 having played again 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.470
 so if you find yourself 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:47.389
 bring a myriad of vegetables and 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.020
 just a little bit of time and still remains 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.020
 our little apple 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:06:01.880
 I want time to dig concessions and time is out 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:04.880
 we did it says sky and on its 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:10.430
 special machines our puppies are still 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:15.440
 brought a bunch of vegetables from under the snow and us 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:17.949
 there is the last task in this 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.949
 tasks 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.699
 so here we need to do to us 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:38.740
 it is necessary with the help of specially will of a 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:41.289
 which have to learn to pull off the apple 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:54.580
 wood and 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:57.150
 and try to throw all horrible 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.150
 bull's eye 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:03.830
 and so every apple should be thrown 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:08.209
 but something does not always show a bar 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:14.360
 and so far not only the apple mastered 

00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:16.309
 throw there two already thrown and time 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.909
 out of even quite a few apples from us 

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:22.809
 turned pinkish bit though 

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:25.610
 marshall he says he will try and 

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:27.379
 he himself is trying to do something he does not 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:32.800
 it turns out to think the initiative is not so 

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:32.800
 strong and I can only save myself 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:41.169
 we got all four tasks to pass 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:44.209
 him again and go all if you want and 

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:46.429
 match farmers all re-assemble if 

00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:49.249
 that although apparently we were also able 

00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:51.279
 do and hope you enjoyed it
