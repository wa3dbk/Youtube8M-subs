00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
flatten later that way I can I can work

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.810 
flatten later that way I can I can work
on<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.520> layer<00:00:56.760> under<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:58.399> color<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.670> won't

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
on a layer under and color and it won't

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.670 
on a layer under and color and it won't
affect<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.930> I'm<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.289> going<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> go

affect it so I'm just going to go
through<00:01:01.949> here<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.730> color<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.629> real<00:01:03.899> quick

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
to get a feel for the colors that I

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.850 
to get a feel for the colors that I
would<00:03:31.070> like<00:03:31.250> and<00:03:31.610> then<00:03:32.330> I<00:03:32.630> go<00:03:32.840> from<00:03:32.990> there<00:03:33.290> if

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
would like and then I go from there if

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.470 
would like and then I go from there if
there's<00:03:34.130> not<00:03:34.250> a<00:03:34.310> Pantone<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.940> matches<00:03:35.300> up

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
there's not a Pantone the matches up

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.290 
there's not a Pantone the matches up
I'll<00:03:36.100> find<00:03:37.100> one<00:03:37.310> that's<00:03:37.490> similar<00:03:37.910> close

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
I'll find one that's similar close

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.840 
I'll find one that's similar close
enough<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:39.560> other<00:03:39.680> thing<00:03:40.010> about<00:03:40.040> coloring

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
enough the other thing about coloring

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.820 
enough the other thing about coloring

once i'm ready to pick the Pantone so
this<00:04:09.110> is<00:04:09.260> another<00:04:09.500> place<00:04:09.860> where<00:04:10.210> these<00:04:11.210> little

this is another place where these little

color sample the color that I want and

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.000 
color sample the color that I want and
then<00:04:23.390> go<00:04:23.510> to<00:04:23.540> color<00:04:23.840> libraries<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:24.860> it's

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
then go to color libraries and it's

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.030 
then go to color libraries and it's
going<00:04:25.160> to<00:04:25.250> give<00:04:25.430> me<00:04:25.610> what<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:27.650> closest

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
going to give me what the closest

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.260 
going to give me what the closest
approximation<00:04:29.260> to<00:04:30.260> my<00:04:30.410> color<00:04:30.650> in<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.820> Pantone

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
approximation to my color in the Pantone

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.460 
approximation to my color in the Pantone
family<00:04:34.660> now<00:04:35.660> once<00:04:35.870> i<00:04:36.020> have<00:04:36.230> that<00:04:36.260> actually

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
family now once i have that actually

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.560 
family now once i have that actually
once<00:04:39.470> I<00:04:39.620> my<00:04:39.830> pantel<00:04:40.250> color<00:04:40.520> selected<00:04:41.060> here<00:04:41.360> I

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
once I my pantel color selected here I

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.490 
once I my pantel color selected here I
can<00:04:42.320> make<00:04:42.500> a<00:04:42.530> new<00:04:42.740> layer<00:04:42.980> fill<00:04:43.430> that<00:04:44.390> in<00:04:44.450> on<00:04:44.930> the

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
can make a new layer fill that in on the

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.280 
can make a new layer fill that in on the
layer<00:04:45.710> and<00:04:46.420> that's<00:04:47.620> my<00:04:49.180> my<00:04:50.180> color<00:04:50.450> you<00:04:51.110> should

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
layer and that's my my color you should

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.350 
layer and that's my my color you should
always<00:04:51.410> take<00:04:51.680> note<00:04:51.950> of<00:04:51.980> what<00:04:52.490> pantone<00:04:53.090> color

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
always take note of what pantone color

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.960 
always take note of what pantone color
you<00:04:53.630> just<00:04:53.900> used<00:04:54.260> so<00:04:55.010> that<00:04:55.040> would<00:04:55.280> be<00:04:55.310> Pantone

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
you just used so that would be Pantone

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:08.150 
you just used so that would be Pantone
74<00:04:57.130> 94c<00:04:58.130> and<00:04:58.460> that's<00:04:59.270> what<00:04:59.480> i'll<00:04:59.690> call<00:04:59.720> this

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.910 

and<00:05:08.850> then<00:05:09.150> you<00:05:09.480> basically<00:05:09.750> just<00:05:10.110> go<00:05:10.470> right<00:05:10.860> on

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
and then you basically just go right on

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:20.890 
and then you basically just go right on
down<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.520> line<00:05:14.900> and<00:05:16.370> fill<00:05:17.370> those<00:05:17.550> in<00:05:19.550> and

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
down the line and fill those in and

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.210 
down the line and fill those in and
you'd<00:05:21.900> of<00:05:22.110> course<00:05:22.350> make<00:05:22.560> a<00:05:22.590> new<00:05:22.770> layer<00:05:22.920> for

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
you'd of course make a new layer for

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.250 
you'd of course make a new layer for
each<00:05:23.280> one<00:05:23.580> but<00:05:24.240> that's<00:05:24.360> basically<00:05:24.600> how<00:05:25.020> it

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
each one but that's basically how it

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.620 
each one but that's basically how it
works<00:05:25.560> and<00:05:25.830> when<00:05:26.100> I'm<00:05:26.250> done<00:05:26.490> I'll<00:05:26.880> have<00:05:27.150> six

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
works and when I'm done I'll have six

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.260 
works and when I'm done I'll have six
layers<00:05:28.310> that<00:05:29.310> actually<00:05:29.700> should<00:05:29.880> be<00:05:30.000> on<00:05:30.090> its

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
layers that actually should be on its

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:36.680 
layers that actually should be on its
own<00:05:30.450> layer<00:05:34.820> so<00:05:35.820> when<00:05:35.940> it's<00:05:36.090> done<00:05:36.270> you'll<00:05:36.540> have

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
own layer so when it's done you'll have

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.480 
own layer so when it's done you'll have
six<00:05:36.990> layers<00:05:37.290> including<00:05:38.070> a<00:05:38.220> white<00:05:38.430> layer<00:05:38.730> and

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
six layers including a white layer and

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.240 
six layers including a white layer and
black<00:05:41.490> layer<00:05:42.110> those<00:05:43.110> just<00:05:43.470> those<00:05:43.860> can<00:05:44.040> just

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
black layer those just those can just

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.520 
black layer those just those can just
get<00:05:44.400> their<00:05:44.550> own<00:05:44.700> layer<00:05:45.510> obviously<00:05:46.170> don't<00:05:46.410> need

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
get their own layer obviously don't need

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.980 
get their own layer obviously don't need
a<00:05:46.560> Pantone<00:05:47.070> to<00:05:47.250> match<00:05:47.430> to<00:05:47.730> those<00:05:50.870> but<00:05:51.870> yeah

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
a Pantone to match to those but yeah

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.120 
a Pantone to match to those but yeah
that's<00:05:52.200> pretty<00:05:52.410> much<00:05:52.530> it<00:05:52.710> for<00:05:52.950> that<00:05:53.750> and

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
that's pretty much it for that and

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.550 
that's pretty much it for that and
that's<00:05:56.130> the<00:05:56.370> basics<00:05:56.790> of<00:05:56.970> coloring<00:05:57.720> your<00:05:58.050> shirt

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
that's the basics of coloring your shirt

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.630 
that's the basics of coloring your shirt
