 had the good fortune to enter the 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.760
 medicine career overwhelmed 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.580
 emotionally for the achievement achieved 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.650
 the new students shared their 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.090

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.410
 all the penalties of that exercise 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.450
 it cost a lot more nerves than 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.510
 they had more stress all the time 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.590
 that we were studying but in the end 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:21.160
 everything is compensated three years sacrifice goes 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.160
 the third time 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.369
 this year seniors 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.220
