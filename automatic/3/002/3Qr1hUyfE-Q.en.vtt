00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
really couldn't figure out what what the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.620 
really couldn't figure out what what the
deal<00:01:24.990> was<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.799> did<00:01:26.310> look<00:01:26.430> at<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.640> back<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.119> at

deal was I did look at the back and at
first<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.020> thought<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.409> maybe<00:01:28.560> there<00:01:28.860> was<00:01:29.009> a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
first I thought that maybe there was a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.469 
first I thought that maybe there was a
connection<00:01:29.369> thing<00:01:29.790> there<00:01:30.030> wasn't<00:01:30.150> enough

connection thing there wasn't enough

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.649 
connection thing there wasn't enough
electricity<00:01:30.840> or<00:01:31.140> amperage<00:01:31.500> one<00:01:31.740> through<00:01:32.659> but

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659
