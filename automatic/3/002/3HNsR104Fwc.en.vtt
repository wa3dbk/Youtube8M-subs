these<00:01:44.890> jumps<00:01:45.250> are<00:01:45.310> really<00:01:45.549> weird<00:01:45.759> is<00:01:46.680> see<00:01:47.680> I

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
these jumps are really weird is see I

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.440 
these jumps are really weird is see I
can<00:01:47.920> hold<00:01:48.159> it<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:48.430> do<00:01:48.549> a<00:01:48.579> super<00:01:48.969> high<00:01:49.149> jump

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
can hold it and do a super high jump

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.910 
can hold it and do a super high jump
where<00:01:49.600> I<00:01:49.630> can<00:01:49.750> just<00:01:49.869> barely<00:01:50.049> tap<00:01:50.439> and<00:01:50.680> get<00:01:50.799> this

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
where I can just barely tap and get this

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.830 
where I can just barely tap and get this

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
now I'm dead not dead but just to get

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.630 
now I'm dead not dead but just to get
back<00:02:01.899> there<00:02:02.200> is<00:02:02.409> gonna<00:02:03.159> take<00:02:03.399> me<00:02:03.520> a<00:02:03.610> really

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
back there is gonna take me a really

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.639 
back there is gonna take me a really
long<00:02:03.880> time<00:02:05.939> all<00:02:06.939> right<00:02:07.179> here's<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.140> mechanic

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
long time all right here's the mechanic

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:09.719 
long time all right here's the mechanic
I<00:02:08.739> don't<00:02:08.890> even<00:02:08.979> know<00:02:09.160> if<00:02:09.190> this<00:02:09.340> is<00:02:09.489> the<00:02:09.580> right

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
I don't even know if this is the right

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:17.250 
I don't even know if this is the right
place<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.330> use<00:02:10.539> it<00:02:10.750> or<00:02:10.869> not<00:02:12.390> let's<00:02:13.390> try<00:02:16.260> that

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
place to use it or not let's try that

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.250 
place to use it or not let's try that
wasn't<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.709> okay<00:02:18.720> but<00:02:19.720> do<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:19.840> see<00:02:20.110> that

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
wasn't it okay but do you see that

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.660 
wasn't it okay but do you see that
that's<00:02:20.380> an<00:02:20.530> element<00:02:20.769> of<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.099> game<00:02:21.280> I<00:02:21.310> hope

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
that's an element of the game I hope

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.330 
that's an element of the game I hope
that<00:02:21.880> isn't<00:02:22.239> uh<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.750> don't<00:02:23.650> know<00:02:23.739> I<00:02:23.980> hope<00:02:24.190> that

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
that isn't uh I don't know I hope that

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.050 
that isn't uh I don't know I hope that
isn't<00:02:24.459> too<00:02:24.700> spoilery<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:27.280> whenever<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:27.730> flip

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
isn't too spoilery and whenever you flip

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.009 
isn't too spoilery and whenever you flip
it<00:02:30.030> that's<00:02:31.030> fine<00:02:31.269> because<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:31.720> is<00:02:31.840> what<00:02:31.989> I

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
it that's fine because this is what I

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.880 
it that's fine because this is what I
need<00:02:32.489> now<00:02:33.489> we're<00:02:33.640> back<00:02:34.500> some<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.530> these<00:02:35.680> other

paths on the left and right are like

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.270 
paths on the left and right are like
loop-d-loop<00:02:38.019> so<00:02:38.440> they'll<00:02:38.620> just<00:02:38.650> take<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.069> for
