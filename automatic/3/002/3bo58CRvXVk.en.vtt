of<00:00:23.820> what<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.210> guys<00:00:24.420> think<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.869> difference<00:00:25.199> is

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
of what you guys think the difference is

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.730

ok<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.000> public<00:00:27.539> universities<00:00:28.199> are<00:00:28.230> usually

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
ok so public universities are usually

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.160 
ok so public universities are usually
funded<00:00:28.949> by<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.250> state<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.599> reason<00:00:31.019> why

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
funded by the state and the reason why

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.500 
funded by the state and the reason why
they're<00:00:31.439> subsidized<00:00:32.040> by<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.250> state<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.850> to

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
they're subsidized by the state is to

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.170 
they're subsidized by the state is to
keep<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.050> tuition<00:00:34.500> costs<00:00:34.890> low<00:00:35.130> now<00:00:35.700> lately

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
keep the tuition costs low now lately

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.420 
keep the tuition costs low now lately
because<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.840> budget<00:00:37.140> cuts<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.559> tuition<00:00:38.040> has

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
because of budget cuts the tuition has

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.369 
because of budget cuts the tuition has
not<00:00:38.700> remained<00:00:39.030> low<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:39.540> actually<00:00:39.930> increased

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
not remained low it's actually increased

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.530 
not remained low it's actually increased
significantly<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.610> lot<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.030> states<00:00:42.270> uh

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
significantly in a lot of states uh

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.529 
significantly in a lot of states uh
public<00:00:43.370> university<00:00:44.370> tuition<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:45.120> pretty

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
public university tuition is pretty

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.560 
public university tuition is pretty
comparable<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.410> uh<00:00:46.770> prop<00:00:47.579> private<00:00:48.090> university

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
comparable to uh prop private university

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.840 
comparable to uh prop private university
tuition<00:00:48.750> which<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.230> very<00:00:49.530> unfortunate

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
tuition which is very unfortunate

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.130 
tuition which is very unfortunate
however<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.300> also<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.780> keep<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.110> mind

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
however you also have to keep in mind

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.319 
however you also have to keep in mind
that<00:00:52.469> out<00:00:53.039> when<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> university<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.120> being

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
that out when a university is being

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.750 
that out when a university is being
subsidized<00:00:54.960> by<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> state<00:00:55.559> they<00:00:56.399> have<00:00:56.579> to

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
subsidized by the state they have to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.910 
subsidized by the state they have to
adhere<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.149> certain<00:00:57.449> rules<00:00:57.809> whereas<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> public

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
adhere to certain rules whereas a public

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.680 
adhere to certain rules whereas a public
university<00:00:59.100> gets<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.820> play<00:01:00.000> by<00:01:00.180> its<00:01:00.210> own<00:01:00.510> rules

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
university gets to play by its own rules

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.280 
university gets to play by its own rules
in<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.140> lot<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.469> cases<00:01:01.680> not<00:01:01.980> completely<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.629> I

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
in a lot of cases not completely so I I

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.870 
in a lot of cases not completely so I I
think<00:01:04.439> that's<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.949> best<00:01:05.129> distinction<00:01:05.760> to

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
think that's the best distinction to

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.370 
think that's the best distinction to
make<00:01:05.909> do<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.659> have<00:01:06.750> anything<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.140> add<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.350> that

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
make do you have anything to add to that

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.320 
make do you have anything to add to that
job<00:01:07.680> ID<00:01:07.950> elaborate<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.670> your<00:01:08.850> second<00:01:09.150> point

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
job ID elaborate in your second point

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.450 
job ID elaborate in your second point
yes<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.229> at<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> private<00:01:10.770> college<00:01:11.070> they<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
yes so at a private college they have a

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.830 
yes so at a private college they have a
lot<00:01:11.640> more<00:01:11.670> control<00:01:11.970> over<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.540> sorts<00:01:12.780> of

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
lot more control over the sorts of

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.080 
lot more control over the sorts of
groups<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.260> get<00:01:13.380> formed<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.430> know<00:01:14.580> what

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
groups that get formed you know what

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.149 
groups that get formed you know what
does<00:01:15.270> your<00:01:15.450> free<00:01:15.810> speech<00:01:16.170> count<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
does your free speech count for and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.530 
does your free speech count for and
private<00:01:17.580> colleges<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.270> lot<00:01:18.390> more

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
private colleges it's a lot more
