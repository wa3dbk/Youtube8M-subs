00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
were some hits and misses of the waves

were some hits and misses of the waves
and<00:00:28.769> most<00:00:28.980> people<00:00:29.250> agree<00:00:29.609> which<00:00:30.570> figures<00:00:30.840> were

and most people agree which figures were

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.690 
and most people agree which figures were
the<00:00:31.289> best<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.740> I'm<00:00:31.800> really<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.189> here<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.489> kind

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
the best so I'm really just here to kind

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.979 
the best so I'm really just here to kind
of<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:32.880> something<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.300> haven't<00:00:33.510> done<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.960> long

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
of do something I haven't done in a long

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.590 
of do something I haven't done in a long
time<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.739> I'm<00:00:35.340> looking<00:00:35.579> at<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.880> best<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
time and I'm looking at the best and the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.720 
time and I'm looking at the best and the
worst<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.170> wave<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:38.070> we<00:00:38.280> start<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
worst of the wave so we start with the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.160 
worst of the wave so we start with the
bad<00:00:38.850> news<00:00:39.120> first<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.510> feel<00:00:39.690> like<00:00:39.809> rocket

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
bad news first I feel like rocket

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.900 
bad news first I feel like rocket
raccoon<00:00:40.469> was<00:00:40.620> probably<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.070> worst<00:00:41.100> figure<00:00:41.730> of

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
raccoon was probably the worst figure of

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.119 
raccoon was probably the worst figure of
the<00:00:42.030> wave<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.629> feel<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:42.930> Gomorrah<00:00:43.860> was

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the wave but I feel like Gomorrah was

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.069 
the wave but I feel like Gomorrah was
probably<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.610> close<00:00:44.969> second<00:00:45.570> but<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.780> feel<00:00:46.050> like

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
probably a close second but I feel like

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.889 
probably a close second but I feel like
rocket<00:00:46.950> raccoon<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.789> worst<00:00:48.120> because<00:00:48.510> they

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
rocket raccoon is the worst because they

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.229 
rocket raccoon is the worst because they
actually<00:00:49.260> already<00:00:49.440> did<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.190> rocket<00:00:50.730> raccoon

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
actually already did a rocket raccoon

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.790 
actually already did a rocket raccoon
and<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.539> feel<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:52.020> you've<00:00:52.170> done<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.410> figure

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and I feel like if you've done a figure

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.639 
and I feel like if you've done a figure
already<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.270> another<00:00:55.110> version<00:00:55.350> that

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
already and you do another version that

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.470 
already and you do another version that
I<00:00:55.739> figure<00:00:56.160> than<00:00:56.640> some<00:00:56.940> things<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.329> you

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
I figure than some things that you

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.510 
I figure than some things that you
didn't<00:00:58.320> get<00:00:58.469> right<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> first<00:00:59.129> time<00:00:59.219> you

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
didn't get right the first time you

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.770 
didn't get right the first time you
should<00:00:59.699> be<00:00:59.789> able<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.059> fix<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.570> should<00:01:00.750> be

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
should be able to fix and you should be

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.139 
should be able to fix and you should be
able<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.109> make<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.530> superior<00:01:02.129> figure<00:01:02.940> here's

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
able to make a superior figure here's

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.179 
able to make a superior figure here's

current one this was not really how he

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
looks in the comics right now but what

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.820 
looks in the comics right now but what
they<00:01:21.119> got<00:01:21.330> right<00:01:21.360> about<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.049> figure<00:01:22.350> was<00:01:22.530> that

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
they got right about the figure was that

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.460 
they got right about the figure was that
the<00:01:22.979> head<00:01:23.220> was<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.240> ball-joint<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:25.110> gets<00:01:25.320> a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
the head was on a ball-joint that gets a

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.819 
the head was on a ball-joint that gets a
nice<00:01:25.710> full<00:01:26.250> range<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.240> motion<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:28.259> mouth<00:01:28.500> can

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
nice full range of motion the mouth can

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.090 
nice full range of motion the mouth can
open<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.280> was<00:01:29.700> cool<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.810> waist<00:01:31.079> turns<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710

and<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.729> little<00:01:36.030> joint<00:01:36.360> at<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.630> elbow<00:01:37.290> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
and a little joint at the elbow and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.810 
and a little joint at the elbow and
could<00:01:38.490> swivel<00:01:38.790> at<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.270> glove<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.670> you<00:01:41.670> know

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
could swivel at the glove and you know

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.460 
could swivel at the glove and you know
that<00:01:42.119> was<00:01:42.299> good<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.720> they<00:01:42.869> got<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.200> tail

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
that was good and they got the tail

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.950 
that was good and they got the tail
right<00:01:43.829> it's<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.850> ball-joint<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.840> move

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
right it's on a ball-joint it can move

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.300 
right it's on a ball-joint it can move
around<00:01:46.110> would<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.649> been<00:01:46.770> nice<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:46.950> they

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
around would have been nice if they

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.069 
around would have been nice if they
actually<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.729> put<00:01:48.030> some<00:01:48.149> articulation<00:01:48.479> and

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
actually I put some articulation and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.080 
actually I put some articulation and
here<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.710> move<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.100> at<00:01:50.310> another<00:01:50.670> point

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
here you can move it at another point

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.300 
here you can move it at another point
here<00:01:51.240> maybe<00:01:51.600> at<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.990> middle<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.470> tail<00:01:52.770> but

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
here maybe at the middle of the tail but

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.789 
here maybe at the middle of the tail but
there<00:01:53.520> was<00:01:53.700> no<00:01:53.939> lake<00:01:54.380> articulation<00:01:55.380> at<00:01:55.619> all

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
there was no lake articulation at all

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.230 
there was no lake articulation at all
and<00:01:56.070> that's<00:01:56.490> where<00:01:56.640> they<00:01:56.729> dropped<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.090> ball

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
and that's where they dropped the ball

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.120 
and that's where they dropped the ball
on<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.509> particular<00:01:57.990> fast<00:01:58.500> forward<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.100> the

Rocket Raccoon here and you have a

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.789 
Rocket Raccoon here and you have a
really<00:02:05.009> nice<00:02:05.310> looking<00:02:06.030> figure<00:02:06.290> like<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.439> said

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
really nice looking figure like I said

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.460 
really nice looking figure like I said
in<00:02:08.069> a<00:02:08.250> main<00:02:08.789> course<00:02:09.119> which<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.720> shot<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.229> couple

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
in a main course which I shot a couple

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.710 
in a main course which I shot a couple
of<00:02:10.709> segments<00:02:11.129> for<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.640> couple<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.540> days<00:02:12.660> ago

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
of segments for a couple of days ago

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.550 
of segments for a couple of days ago
what

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
what

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.110 
what
we'll<00:02:13.650> be<00:02:13.739> out<00:02:13.860> after<00:02:14.069> this<00:02:14.310> review<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.760> said

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
we'll be out after this review I said

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.339 
we'll be out after this review I said
you<00:02:15.239> know<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.360> like<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.660> way<00:02:15.750> he<00:02:15.870> looks<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:16.260> a

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
you know I like the way he looks in a

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.620 
you know I like the way he looks in a
nice<00:02:16.500> vanilla<00:02:17.130> stance<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.000> his<00:02:18.090> arms<00:02:18.360> can<00:02:18.480> go

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
nice vanilla stance and his arms can go

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.120 
nice vanilla stance and his arms can go
to<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.900> side<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.709> he's<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> nice-looking

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
to the side and he's a nice-looking

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.000 
to the side and he's a nice-looking
figure<00:02:21.030> but<00:02:21.569> they<00:02:21.690> went<00:02:21.870> backwards<00:02:22.470> as<00:02:22.709> far<00:02:22.890> as

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
figure but they went backwards as far as

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.190 
figure but they went backwards as far as
articulation<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:23.910> concerned<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.870> head<00:02:25.080> is

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
articulation is concerned the head is

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.110 
articulation is concerned the head is
not<00:02:25.349> really<00:02:25.709> on<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:25.980> ball-joint<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.670> mean<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:26.970> is

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
not really on a ball-joint I mean it is

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.690 
not really on a ball-joint I mean it is
on<00:02:27.270> a<00:02:27.300> ball-joint<00:02:27.599> because<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.620> how<00:02:28.800> they<00:02:28.830> have

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
on a ball-joint because of how they have

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.850 
on a ball-joint because of how they have
the<00:02:29.910> neck<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.599> head<00:02:30.780> can't<00:02:31.110> really<00:02:31.380> rotate

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
the neck the head can't really rotate

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.790 
the neck the head can't really rotate
like<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.340> could<00:02:32.580> on<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.569> previous<00:02:34.380> comic

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
like it could on the previous comic

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.440 
like it could on the previous comic
accurate<00:02:35.310> version<00:02:35.489> so<00:02:35.940> when<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.209> turn<00:02:36.420> the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
accurate version so when you turn the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.420 
accurate version so when you turn the
head<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.989> just<00:02:37.019> kind<00:02:37.380> of<00:02:37.440> looks<00:02:37.500> silly<00:02:38.010> there

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
head it just kind of looks silly there

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.800 
head it just kind of looks silly there
is<00:02:38.670> no<00:02:39.260> pivot<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.650> really<00:02:40.890> there's<00:02:41.310> no

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
is no pivot to it really there's no

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.270 
is no pivot to it really there's no
angle<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.470> can<00:02:43.650> make<00:02:43.800> it<00:02:44.010> where<00:02:44.160> it

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
angle that you can make it where it

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.070 
angle that you can make it where it
looks<00:02:44.489> cool<00:02:44.730> ways<00:02:45.030> turn<00:02:45.360> in<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.630> head<00:02:45.840> so

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
looks cool ways turn in the head so

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.490 
looks cool ways turn in the head so
that's<00:02:46.260> one<00:02:46.560> now<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.430> arms<00:02:47.670> do<00:02:48.000> move<00:02:48.500> pretty

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
that's one now the arms do move pretty

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.930 
that's one now the arms do move pretty
much<00:02:49.709> in<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.860> same<00:02:50.069> fashion<00:02:50.370> as<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.760> other

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
much in the same fashion as the other

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.150 
much in the same fashion as the other
one<00:02:51.530> would<00:02:52.530> have<00:02:52.620> been<00:02:52.709> nice<00:02:52.860> if<00:02:52.890> they

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
one would have been nice if they

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.740 
one would have been nice if they
actually<00:02:53.340> gave<00:02:53.640> them<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:53.910> hinge<00:02:54.180> on<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.510> wrist

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
actually gave them a hinge on the wrist

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.110 
actually gave them a hinge on the wrist
the<00:02:54.959> wrist<00:02:55.170> does<00:02:55.380> turn<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:56.280> waist<00:02:56.549> does<00:02:56.819> turn

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
the wrist does turn the waist does turn

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.320 
the wrist does turn the waist does turn
but<00:02:57.750> again<00:02:57.840> no<00:02:58.530> leg<00:02:58.950> articulation<00:02:59.849> at<00:03:00.000> all

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
but again no leg articulation at all

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.020 
but again no leg articulation at all
would<00:03:01.230> have<00:03:01.260> been<00:03:01.380> perfect<00:03:02.220> if<00:03:02.340> they<00:03:02.519> just<00:03:02.760> put

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
would have been perfect if they just put

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.030 
would have been perfect if they just put
in<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.299> break<00:03:03.569> at<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.989> knee<00:03:04.170> give<00:03:04.739> them<00:03:04.860> some

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
in a break at the knee give them some

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.580 
in a break at the knee give them some
knee<00:03:05.190> articulation<00:03:06.150> give<00:03:06.810> them<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:07.080> hinge<00:03:07.349> on

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
knee articulation give them a hinge on

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.259 
knee articulation give them a hinge on
the<00:03:07.650> foot<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.220> then<00:03:08.670> they<00:03:08.760> even<00:03:09.090> went

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
the foot and then they even went

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.550 
the foot and then they even went
backwards<00:03:09.750> as<00:03:09.900> far<00:03:10.080> as<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.290> tail<00:03:10.530> is

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
backwards as far as the tail is

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.320 
backwards as far as the tail is
concerned<00:03:11.099> now<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.370> tail<00:03:11.700> only<00:03:12.030> spends

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
concerned now the tail only spends

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.759 
concerned now the tail only spends
around<00:03:12.390> like<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:12.959> they<00:03:13.380> could<00:03:13.530> have<00:03:13.620> easily

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
around like that they could have easily

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.740 
around like that they could have easily
just<00:03:14.010> made<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.610> into<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.940> ball<00:03:15.209> joint<00:03:15.480> and

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
just made that into a ball joint and

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.870 
just made that into a ball joint and
made<00:03:16.110> it<00:03:16.260> at<00:03:16.349> least<00:03:16.560> move<00:03:16.920> as<00:03:17.130> much<00:03:17.310> as<00:03:17.579> the

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
made it at least move as much as the

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.970 
made it at least move as much as the
comic<00:03:18.570> accurate<00:03:19.079> version<00:03:19.260> but<00:03:19.620> they<00:03:19.769> went

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
comic accurate version but they went

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.460 
comic accurate version but they went
backwards<00:03:20.700> now<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.239> got<00:03:21.570> this<00:03:21.780> figured<00:03:22.049> I<00:03:22.290> can

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
backwards now you got this figured I can

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.020 
backwards now you got this figured I can
barely<00:03:22.680> move<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.160> this<00:03:23.340> could<00:03:23.549> have<00:03:23.700> been<00:03:23.730> one

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
barely move and this could have been one

Nova appeared in a very first version of

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.460

that<00:05:58.820> secret<00:05:59.820> avengers<00:06:00.180> group<00:06:00.690> even<00:06:01.380> though

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
that secret avengers group even though

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.700 
that secret avengers group even though
he<00:06:01.620> only<00:06:01.770> appeared<00:06:02.190> in<00:06:02.310> a<00:06:02.400> couple

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
he only appeared in a couple

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.410 
he only appeared in a couple
issues<00:06:03.130> before<00:06:03.490> he<00:06:03.610> ran<00:06:03.790> off<00:06:03.820> into<00:06:04.150> space

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.420 
issues before he ran off into space

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.300 
issues before he ran off into space
again<00:06:04.750> but<00:06:05.470> still<00:06:05.740> that<00:06:05.950> was<00:06:05.980> the<00:06:06.160> last

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
again but still that was the last

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.220 
again but still that was the last
character<00:06:06.820> that<00:06:06.970> we<00:06:07.090> were<00:06:07.240> missing<00:06:07.420> he<00:06:08.050> was

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:08.230 
character that we were missing he was

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.830 
character that we were missing he was
the<00:06:08.350> main<00:06:08.650> character<00:06:09.400> and<00:06:09.840> annihilation

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
the main character and annihilation

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.940 
the main character and annihilation
which<00:06:11.230> was<00:06:11.410> a<00:06:11.440> excellent<00:06:12.400> cosmic<00:06:13.360> story<00:06:13.950> and

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950 
which was a excellent cosmic story and

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.380 
which was a excellent cosmic story and
that's<00:06:15.340> during<00:06:15.640> the<00:06:15.730> time<00:06:15.910> that<00:06:15.940> I<00:06:16.120> actually

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
that's during the time that I actually

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.840 
that's during the time that I actually
had<00:06:16.780> a<00:06:16.810> little<00:06:17.050> skirmish<00:06:17.320> with<00:06:17.740> Drax<00:06:18.460> you<00:06:18.640> see

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
had a little skirmish with Drax you see

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.730 
had a little skirmish with Drax you see
here<00:06:19.090> and<00:06:19.300> Drax<00:06:19.570> is<00:06:19.810> the<00:06:20.080> this<00:06:20.530> is<00:06:20.590> the

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
here and Drax is the this is the

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.790 
here and Drax is the this is the
original<00:06:21.060> comic<00:06:22.060> version<00:06:22.240> of<00:06:22.540> Drax<00:06:22.840> I<00:06:23.140> believe

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
original comic version of Drax I believe

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.860 
original comic version of Drax I believe
that<00:06:23.830> the<00:06:24.130> draks<00:06:24.430> that<00:06:24.670> came<00:06:24.910> and<00:06:25.210> the<00:06:25.660> wave

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
that the draks that came and the wave

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.980 
that the draks that came and the wave
with<00:06:26.110> this<00:06:26.140> Nova<00:06:26.740> is<00:06:27.360> probably<00:06:28.360> a<00:06:28.480> close

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
with this Nova is probably a close

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.930 
with this Nova is probably a close
second<00:06:29.770> or<00:06:30.540> could<00:06:31.540> have<00:06:31.660> been<00:06:31.900> the<00:06:32.560> most<00:06:32.940> the

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
second or could have been the most the

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.240 
second or could have been the most the
best<00:06:34.210> figure<00:06:34.570> in<00:06:34.720> a<00:06:34.810> wave<00:06:34.990> had<00:06:35.260> it<00:06:35.410> been<00:06:35.650> this

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
best figure in a wave had it been this

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.520 
best figure in a wave had it been this
version<00:06:36.550> of<00:06:36.850> drags<00:06:37.180> on<00:06:37.710> the<00:06:38.710> group<00:06:38.980> way<00:06:39.190> buck

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530 
version of drags on the group way buck

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.520 
version of drags on the group way buck
but<00:06:42.120> because<00:06:43.120> of<00:06:43.150> that<00:06:43.390> I<00:06:43.420> think<00:06:43.600> Nova<00:06:44.140> is<00:06:44.320> the

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
but because of that I think Nova is the

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.560 
but because of that I think Nova is the
best<00:06:44.740> fig<00:06:44.950> and<00:06:45.160> it's<00:06:45.310> wave<00:06:45.490> and<00:06:45.820> absolutely

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.570 
best fig and it's wave and absolutely

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.210 
best fig and it's wave and absolutely
deserves<00:06:47.140> the<00:06:47.830> AC<00:06:48.010> be<00:06:48.340> a<00:06:48.370> seal<00:06:48.880> of<00:06:49.150> approval

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 
deserves the AC be a seal of approval

deserves the AC be a seal of approval

forward<00:07:05.350> like<00:07:05.380> I<00:07:05.590> said<00:07:05.800> this<00:07:05.920> is<00:07:05.980> something

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.430 
forward like I said this is something

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:08.710 
that I haven't done in a while and it's

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.680 
that I haven't done in a while and it's
actually<00:07:08.830> a<00:07:09.070> lot<00:07:09.220> of<00:07:09.400> figures<00:07:09.610> that<00:07:09.910> are<00:07:10.090> out

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:10.690 
actually a lot of figures that are out

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.210 
actually a lot of figures that are out
there<00:07:10.720> I<00:07:10.930> deserved<00:07:11.470> the<00:07:11.710> the<00:07:11.980> seal<00:07:12.190> of

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:12.220 
there I deserved the the seal of

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.250 
there I deserved the the seal of
approval<00:07:12.460> that<00:07:12.790> have<00:07:13.030> come<00:07:13.180> out<00:07:13.240> over<00:07:13.600> the

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:14.260 
approval that have come out over the

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.030 
approval that have come out over the
past<00:07:14.820> year<00:07:15.820> or<00:07:16.000> two<00:07:16.360> I<00:07:16.600> think<00:07:17.590> probably<00:07:17.740> the

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:18.040 
past year or two I think probably the

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.710 
past year or two I think probably the
last<00:07:18.310> figure<00:07:18.580> that<00:07:18.790> I<00:07:18.820> gave<00:07:19.060> the<00:07:19.240> seals<00:07:19.510> who

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:19.720 
last figure that I gave the seals who

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.780 
last figure that I gave the seals who
was<00:07:20.910> maybe<00:07:21.910> the<00:07:22.210> link<00:07:22.480> figure<00:07:23.320> to<00:07:24.250> fig<00:07:24.430> my<00:07:24.580> link

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:24.790 
was maybe the link figure to fig my link

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.230 
was maybe the link figure to fig my link
figure<00:07:25.150> so<00:07:25.900> it's<00:07:26.110> been<00:07:26.350> quite<00:07:27.010> a<00:07:27.040> while<00:07:27.250> but<00:07:28.210> uh
