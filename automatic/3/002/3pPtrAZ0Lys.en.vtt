00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.619
 Halli hello welcome to 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.910
 my second tutorial today is on 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.169
 again about the subject of tactics at this time 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.170
 I use the FC Bayern Munich because 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:36.580
 Today it's about beautiful ball possession as well 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.269
 pressing the soccer fc bayern 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:45.470
 I have the tactical individual 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:49.190
 under my profile here under the fifa 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.230
 Saved and saved settings 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.199
 but you have the same one here 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.570
 chosen because the lineup 4541 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.080
 Simply divine is owned for lead and 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.890
 pressing in tur new senate stop here 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:09.310
 a 67 speed will start from christi 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:12.260
 85 85 85 82 and from 84 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.689
 to have 85-speed as 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.280
 bad talks and oars I have 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.890
 then that is a central defensive 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.320
 But he has been in the defense until now 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.650
 a good job especially because 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.430
 he is faster than dante and left 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:32.990
 I then all was with an 86 and 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:37.360
 lame with a '75 and intercept 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.990
 really good here lame 290 and 84 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.560
 I've got Schweinsteiger im 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.950
 midfield of you also beautiful interception 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.440
 valued idol now no strong 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.909
 downturn will but makes a 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.010
 solid job with his sprint 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.920
 speed also has one here 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.860
 very nice graduation and a nice one 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:03.580
 drove to do a nice pass 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:06.530
 pass pass values ​​86 here around 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.989
 of course a good shot four 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.310
 it has to be permanent 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.569
 ribery exactly the same and then go 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.409
 let's roll over to ours 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.690
 I did not do anything else except 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.709
 I get your instructions 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.360
 lewandowski I have nothing else 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.030
 made except defensive overflow 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.110
 the other one here is almost perfect and 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.540
 at the tactics 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.650
 of course I have speed 68 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.720
 this should not be too fast 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.430
 but not too slow but almost 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.580
 still better than 50 beautiful 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.260
 quick pass example pass 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.360
 distance of course for coaches 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.000
 Short game and at visits football 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.770
 position as short as possible plays naturally 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.480
 a free choice to join their 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.480
 teammates always run free 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.020
 I can risk the game here 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.000
 for the passages so 43 it's supposed to be natural 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.670
 be sure but also nice 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.380
 nice steep pass or so flank 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.690
 Of course, not so often 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.780
 mediocre 45 shot also fall off and 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.180
 At 49 I always have your positional game 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.630
 was still free and the defense is 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.560
 Of course, press is also pressing 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.160
 Of course, very high 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.310
 the pressure the pressing so the 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.930
 Aggressiveness on pressing with 65 and 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.150
 moving the defense times 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.170
 because otherwise we still have here 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.090
 static and that is of course static 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.830
 not even his design always nice 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.660
 on the back and the defense line 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.430
 shield and not deductible is iris 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.900
 can 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.970
 and let's do mine too 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.010
 play here on the bench I have 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.600
 still 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:53.280
 wise rainer raffel warned himself here 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.830
 We'll just take them without it 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.900
 in places it is actually 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.080
 also so that pretty pretty good 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.080
 team 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:13.239
 a piece that we played beautifully 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.239
 I wish 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.670
 One belong to the trousers head 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.320
 from the textbook 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.390
 and you have a situation where you 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.260
 he believes in jumping feathers in the 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.420
 have school 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.420
 it's a great one 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.870
 lewandowski 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.420
 jordi alba 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.230
 cherry 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.330
 an important baller conquest in the 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.330
 midfield alaba 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.740
 swiss cup 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.180
 Philipp Lahm 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.919
 Arjen Robben in ball possession 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:23.619
 this is a very nice matching game 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.619
 she is lame 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.670
 it was it 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.180
 Mario Götze 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.770
 that's it for now
