00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.060 

I<00:00:31.360> think<00:00:32.360> a<00:00:32.450> big<00:00:32.630> part<00:00:32.900> of<00:00:32.960> it<00:00:33.080> is<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.470> the

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
I think a big part of it is the the

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.160 
I think a big part of it is the the
independent<00:00:34.550> rear<00:00:34.670> suspension<00:00:34.700> and<00:00:35.390> as<00:00:36.140> a

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
independent rear suspension and as a

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.229 
independent rear suspension and as a
journalist<00:00:36.770> I'm<00:00:36.950> always<00:00:37.160> wary<00:00:37.610> of<00:00:37.760> that<00:00:37.940> stuff

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
journalist I'm always wary of that stuff

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.790 
journalist I'm always wary of that stuff
a<00:00:38.390> lot<00:00:38.540> of<00:00:38.660> people<00:00:38.900> will<00:00:39.020> go<00:00:39.140> oh<00:00:39.290> they've<00:00:39.680> gone

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
a lot of people will go oh they've gone

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.370 
a lot of people will go oh they've gone
from<00:00:40.040> an<00:00:40.220> independent<00:00:40.430> to<00:00:40.910> a<00:00:40.940> to<00:00:41.540> a<00:00:41.570> twist<00:00:42.200> beam

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
from an independent to a to a twist beam

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.380 
from an independent to a to a twist beam
rear<00:00:42.590> axle<00:00:42.980> that's<00:00:43.160> absolutely<00:00:43.730> no<00:00:43.910> good<00:00:44.120> well

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
rear axle that's absolutely no good well

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.570 
rear axle that's absolutely no good well
I<00:00:44.660> think<00:00:45.440> that<00:00:45.830> a<00:00:45.860> lot<00:00:46.010> of<00:00:46.040> these<00:00:46.190> cars<00:00:46.430> you

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
I think that a lot of these cars you

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.820 
I think that a lot of these cars you
could<00:00:47.030> substitute<00:00:47.270> the<00:00:47.780> entire<00:00:48.199> suspension

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
could substitute the entire suspension

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.619 
could substitute the entire suspension
setup<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:49.400> nobody<00:00:49.910> would<00:00:50.150> know<00:00:50.180> the

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
setup and nobody would know the

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.810 
setup and nobody would know the
difference<00:00:50.660> but<00:00:51.170> there<00:00:51.379> really<00:00:51.650> is<00:00:51.920> a<00:00:51.949> very<00:00:52.370> to

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
difference but there really is a very to

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.150 
difference but there really is a very to
me<00:00:53.030> there's<00:00:53.600> a<00:00:53.690> very<00:00:54.080> markedly<00:00:54.800> different

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
me there's a very markedly different

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.240 
me there's a very markedly different
feel<00:00:55.760> to<00:00:56.360> this<00:00:56.780> car<00:00:57.080> then<00:00:57.470> you'll<00:00:57.620> find<00:00:57.890> in<00:00:58.100> the

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
feel to this car then you'll find in the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.560 
feel to this car then you'll find in the
in<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.730> in<00:00:59.660> the<00:00:59.690> regular<00:00:59.960> Kenneth<00:01:04.150> my<00:01:05.150> second
