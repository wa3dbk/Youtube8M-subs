 Talk to you, pet gal here with you guys for more. 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.380
 a video and said it was is a 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.030
 different from the one of code is say 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.150
 top 3 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.330
 I 'll tell you guys how to do a 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:21.029
 combo at infinity when you are 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.430
 playing online ranking will help 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.869
 enough and does what she liked without 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.330
 replacement 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:35.010
 then let me come here configured to 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:38.910
 training put me here on the limit 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:43.440
 the first thing you 'll have to use 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.110
 normal color that is thiago pellet 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.230
 that he makes a special or just ball 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.059
 but here we will add the x that 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.260
 for example when the guy is here 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.149
 I'll leave the life there for you. 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.260
 I also do not know how much to take 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:08.010
 so you do not do what you wanted 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:10.830
 the little ball portugal as if the door is a 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:22.530
 x came to shake as much of life 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:24.170
 took out will beat and beat again champion 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.829
 go home, farm 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:34.650
 So I go here and let me put the 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:39.119
 of chakra to see the whole theater that 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.590
 going to spend is basically the ball 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.040
 ball ball ball ball there 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.930
 ended up having to swallow pretty and 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.170
 blushes volleyball and harmony volleyball 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.170
 I did not make goalkeeper enters the debate wiki 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:02:01.469
 bigger good took practically a life 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:06.030
 whole but now we're going to take 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.950
 much more that I think it's better this way 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.709
 basically you will do what you do to 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.709
 same thing a goal ball 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.670
 beats beats beats beats it beats election 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.300
 hit hit 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.450
 it goes out from there that it beats it beats and has to 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.480
 law and fahel now did not give it but here 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.980
 he takes much more life than if he were 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.240
 You hit that way and it gets 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.750
 because the trio ball 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:40.470
 let's see here Ghosn sign over 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:45.930
 as the final low martin balance 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:50.090
 between nadal and create he came in sometimes 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:54.660
 when you hit a lot on the team but 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.660
 basically it will if this is the one that used this 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.690
 level here the beautiful river will work 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.209
 for someone who has something instant and is doing 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.920
 this is always used for life 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.300
 now I will leave the last test when the 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.700
 boy to you 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.390
 and then I'll leave another character 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.390
 come on 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.170
 So you see that I have 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.450
 pretty much everything from the guy's life and there 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.830
 It's up to you and I'm a police officer. 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.060
 A more dance is coming here. 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.470
 replacement 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.350
 so when you hit the guy he 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.400
 replace itv1 channel easier 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.740
 beauty 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.160
 now I'll leave the other character to 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.160
 you 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.810
