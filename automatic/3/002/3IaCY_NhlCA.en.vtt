00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
them pretty well during this time even

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.500 
them pretty well during this time even
did<00:02:09.080> some<00:02:09.110> polling<00:02:09.619> on<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.890> front<00:02:10.510> thought

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
did some polling on the front thought

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.870 
did some polling on the front thought
hey<00:02:11.720> this<00:02:11.930> isn't<00:02:12.170> so<00:02:12.379> bad

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.090 

going<00:02:16.880> by<00:02:17.030> North<00:02:17.330> Greenville<00:02:17.740> this<00:02:18.740> I<00:02:18.920> guess

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
going by North Greenville this I guess

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.699 
going by North Greenville this I guess
becomes<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.910> traditional<00:02:20.600> starting<00:02:21.260> spot

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
becomes the traditional starting spot

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.010 
becomes the traditional starting spot
for<00:02:23.020> going<00:02:24.020> up<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:25.400> watershed<00:02:25.970> here<00:02:26.840> we've
