00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.479 
think guys should have our glycolic acid
pads<00:02:09.259> and<00:02:09.560> this<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.830> reason<00:02:09.979> why<00:02:10.280> is<00:02:10.340> because

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
pads and this the reason why is because

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.790
