00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
something like that but it is just I

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
used this room for four days and it was

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.439 
used this room for four days and it was
the<00:00:37.809> worst<00:00:38.080> possible<00:00:38.379> experience<00:00:39.100> I've<00:00:39.250> ever

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:39.449 
the worst possible experience I've ever

experienced on the Nexus 7 2012 so the

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:46.020 
experienced on the Nexus 7 2012 so the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
first part of my rent is mostly against

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.149 
first part of my rent is mostly against
the<00:00:46.089> performance<00:00:46.570> itself<00:00:46.629> on<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.559> Nexus<00:00:47.860> 7<00:00:48.100> in

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 
the performance itself on the Nexus 7 in

the performance itself on the Nexus 7 in
the<00:00:48.220> second<00:00:48.519> part<00:00:48.699> against<00:00:49.030> the<00:00:49.059> Rob<00:00:49.269> and<00:00:49.510> I

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:50.049 
the second part against the Rob and I

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:53.689 
the second part against the Rob and I
try<00:00:50.379> to<00:00:50.409> keep<00:00:50.739> it<00:00:50.860> quick<00:00:51.159> if<00:00:51.430> you<00:00:52.120> open<00:00:52.570> apps

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
try to keep it quick if you open apps

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.490 
try to keep it quick if you open apps
it's<00:00:54.699> not<00:00:54.909> that<00:00:54.970> visible<00:00:55.239> right<00:00:55.629> now<00:00:55.869> but<00:00:56.199> in

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
it's not that visible right now but in

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.859 
it's not that visible right now but in
general<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.220> performance<00:00:57.850> is<00:00:58.239> pretty<00:00:58.600> poor

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:58.869 
general the performance is pretty poor

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:02.369 
general the performance is pretty poor
it<00:00:59.589> startles<00:01:00.159> all<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.400> time<00:01:00.610> it<00:01:00.820> lacks<00:01:01.379> it's

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
it startles all the time it lacks it's

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.760 
it startles all the time it lacks it's
loading<00:01:03.369> constantly<00:01:03.970> something<00:01:04.479> it's

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770 
loading constantly something it's

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.340 
loading constantly something it's
absolutely<00:01:05.770> not<00:01:06.280> a<00:01:06.310> good<00:01:06.520> experience<00:01:06.880> and<00:01:07.390> I

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
absolutely not a good experience and I

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.990 
absolutely not a good experience and I
don't<00:01:08.590> want<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:08.979> get<00:01:09.159> much<00:01:09.369> into<00:01:09.700> detail

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
don't want to get much into detail

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.609 
don't want to get much into detail
because<00:01:10.299> it's<00:01:10.750> just<00:01:11.079> not<00:01:11.200> worth<00:01:11.380> it<00:01:11.500> the

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
because it's just not worth it the

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.190 
because it's just not worth it the
performance<00:01:12.460> isn't<00:01:12.729> good<00:01:13.030> I<00:01:13.240> tried<00:01:13.750> custom

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
performance isn't good I tried custom

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.289 
performance isn't good I tried custom
kernels<00:01:14.530> they<00:01:15.009> made<00:01:15.399> it<00:01:15.609> a<00:01:15.700> little<00:01:15.880> bit<00:01:16.060> better

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
kernels they made it a little bit better

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.289 
kernels they made it a little bit better
but<00:01:16.840> not<00:01:16.899> really<00:01:17.439> it<00:01:17.890> didn't<00:01:18.250> make<00:01:18.850> it<00:01:19.060> a

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
but not really it didn't make it a

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.859 
but not really it didn't make it a
pleasant<00:01:20.049> experience<00:01:20.369> just<00:01:21.369> because<00:01:21.640> of<00:01:21.789> that

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
pleasant experience just because of that

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.020 
pleasant experience just because of that
so<00:01:22.869> let's<00:01:23.170> check<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.130> room<00:01:24.310> features<00:01:24.729> that<00:01:24.969> i

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
so let's check the room features that i

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.819 
so let's check the room features that i
don't<00:01:25.299> like<00:01:25.509> paranoid<00:01:26.409> android<00:01:26.679> has<00:01:26.799> a

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
don't like paranoid android has a

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.749 
don't like paranoid android has a
problem<00:01:27.159> in<00:01:27.399> my<00:01:27.520> in<00:01:27.850> my<00:01:28.649> opinion<00:01:29.649> they<00:01:30.579> have

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
problem in my in my opinion they have

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.660 
problem in my in my opinion they have
toast<00:01:31.030> their<00:01:31.810> own<00:01:31.990> features<00:01:32.499> they<00:01:32.679> have<00:01:32.859> the

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
toast their own features they have the

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.910 
toast their own features they have the
hybrid<00:01:33.999> engine<00:01:34.329> which<00:01:34.600> is<00:01:34.810> genius<00:01:35.109> I<00:01:35.350> like<00:01:35.740> it

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
hybrid engine which is genius I like it

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.609 
hybrid engine which is genius I like it
absolutely<00:01:36.549> love<00:01:36.759> it<00:01:37.020> then<00:01:38.020> they<00:01:38.140> have<00:01:38.320> pie

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
absolutely love it then they have pie

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.730 
absolutely love it then they have pie
which<00:01:39.130> I<00:01:39.310> don't<00:01:39.369> use<00:01:39.700> because<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:41.140> slows<00:01:41.380> me

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
which I don't use because it slows me

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.120 
which I don't use because it slows me
down<00:01:42.149> gestures<00:01:43.149> offer<00:01:43.329> me<00:01:43.600> way<00:01:43.899> faster<00:01:44.409> then

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
down gestures offer me way faster then

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.279 
down gestures offer me way faster then
they<00:01:45.310> have<00:01:45.429> halo<00:01:45.700> which<00:01:46.359> I<00:01:46.509> don't<00:01:46.569> use<00:01:46.990> because

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
they have halo which I don't use because

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.239 
they have halo which I don't use because
it<00:01:47.649> just<00:01:47.799> gives<00:01:48.100> me<00:01:48.189> this<00:01:48.399> small<00:01:48.880> window<00:01:49.299> and

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:50.249 
it just gives me this small window and

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:53.039 
it just gives me this small window and
since<00:01:51.249> I<00:01:51.399> use<00:01:51.579> gestures<00:01:51.999> I<00:01:52.329> am<00:01:52.420> faster

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
since I use gestures I am faster

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.069 
since I use gestures I am faster
switching<00:01:53.619> through<00:01:53.920> tasks<00:01:54.490> with<00:01:55.179> jesters<00:01:56.049> and

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
switching through tasks with jesters and

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.050 
switching through tasks with jesters and
not<00:01:56.499> with<00:01:56.950> halo<00:01:57.219> so<00:01:58.079> what<00:01:59.079> is<00:01:59.229> left<00:01:59.880> left<00:02:00.880> is

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
not with halo so what is left left is

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.480 
not with halo so what is left left is

this one for me isn't so that's why I
