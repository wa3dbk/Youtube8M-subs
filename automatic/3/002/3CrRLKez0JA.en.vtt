00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
industry well I think that a couple of

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.260 
industry well I think that a couple of
really<00:06:08.920> important<00:06:09.430> things<00:06:09.460> number<00:06:09.820> one<00:06:09.940> is

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.470 
my view a great job of bringing new
people<00:06:26.950> in<00:06:27.160> from<00:06:27.310> the<00:06:27.400> outside<00:06:27.550> and<00:06:28.030> promoting

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
people in from the outside and promoting

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.940 
people in from the outside and promoting
some<00:06:28.660> talented<00:06:28.990> people<00:06:29.050> that<00:06:29.410> we<00:06:29.500> had<00:06:29.650> here<00:06:29.800> at

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
some talented people that we had here at

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.400 
some talented people that we had here at
naira<00:06:30.160> so<00:06:31.000> I<00:06:31.030> think<00:06:31.240> they<00:06:31.690> really<00:06:32.110> set<00:06:32.320> the

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410 
naira so I think they really set the

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.159 
naira so I think they really set the
stage<00:06:32.440> for<00:06:32.650> what<00:06:32.950> we<00:06:33.100> can<00:06:33.280> do<00:06:33.960> obviously<00:06:34.960> with

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
goals we've got to really address things

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.890

like the take-up you know it's too

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.320 
like the take-up you know it's too
expensive<00:06:53.140> right<00:06:53.590> now<00:06:53.790> to<00:06:54.790> bet<00:06:54.940> on<00:06:55.060> horses

compared to other forms of gambling and

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.770 
compared to other forms of gambling and
I<00:06:57.130> think<00:06:57.370> that<00:06:57.490> that's<00:06:57.610> when<00:06:58.510> we<00:06:58.630> have<00:06:58.750> a

00:06:58.770 --> 00:06:58.780 
I think that that's when we have a

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.240 
I think that that's when we have a
little<00:06:59.050> bit<00:06:59.200> of<00:06:59.229> money<00:06:59.470> and<00:06:59.680> we<00:06:59.800> were<00:06:59.890> able<00:07:00.010> to

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.250 
little bit of money and we were able to

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.520 
little bit of money and we were able to
step<00:07:00.460> out<00:07:00.580> a<00:07:00.640> little<00:07:00.760> bit<00:07:01.260> you<00:07:02.260> know<00:07:02.290> we're

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.530 
step out a little bit you know we're

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.830 
step out a little bit you know we're
looking<00:07:02.770> forward<00:07:03.010> to<00:07:03.190> that<00:07:03.479> one<00:07:04.479> of<00:07:04.570> our<00:07:04.630> big
