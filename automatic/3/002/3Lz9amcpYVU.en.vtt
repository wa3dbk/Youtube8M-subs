00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
phenomenal I mean what a brilliant

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.709 
phenomenal I mean what a brilliant
feeling<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.670> would<00:01:02.820> be<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.449> writing

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
feeling that would be so in this writing

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.299 
feeling that would be so in this writing
video<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.140> just<00:01:04.260> kind<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.680> wanted<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.040> talk<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
video I just kind of wanted to talk a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.219 
video I just kind of wanted to talk a
little<00:01:05.519> bit<00:01:05.700> about<00:01:05.820> my<00:01:06.240> experiences<00:01:06.930> getting

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
little bit about my experiences getting

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.050 
little bit about my experiences getting
back<00:01:07.530> into<00:01:07.830> writing<00:01:08.010> because<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:08.970> be

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
back into writing because that can be

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.340 
back into writing because that can be
quite<00:01:09.210> difficult<00:01:09.390> especially<00:01:09.689> if<00:01:10.110> you've<00:01:10.200> had

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
a manuscript like I have done that

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.870 
a manuscript like I have done that
you've<00:01:13.200> left<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.830> while<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.220> becomes<00:01:14.549> I

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
it's kind of a fairy tale ish voice and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.950 
it's kind of a fairy tale ish voice and
that's<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.369> mode<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.270> style<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.750> use

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
that's the mode and the style that I use

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.990 
that's the mode and the style that I use
when<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> write<00:01:40.409> for<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.250> need<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.790> kind

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
when I write for this so I need to kind

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.460 
when I write for this so I need to kind
of<00:01:42.060> switch<00:01:42.360> back<00:01:42.570> into<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.290> sometimes

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
of switch back into that and sometimes

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.200 
of switch back into that and sometimes
that's<00:01:43.770> not<00:01:43.860> always<00:01:44.250> easy<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:44.970> feel<00:01:45.180> a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
that's not always easy it can feel a

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.109 
that's not always easy it can feel a
little<00:01:45.329> clunky<00:01:45.630> at<00:01:45.869> first<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:47.100> little<00:01:47.430> like

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
little clunky at first and a little like

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.969 
little clunky at first and a little like
you've<00:01:48.299> put<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:49.049> coat<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.320> doesn't<00:01:49.799> quite

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
you've put on a coat that doesn't quite

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.340 
you've put on a coat that doesn't quite
fit<00:01:50.040> right<00:01:50.689> that<00:01:51.689> was<00:01:51.810> just<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.020> terrible

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
fit right that was just a terrible

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.780 
fit right that was just a terrible
analogy<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.770> don't<00:01:52.979> know<00:01:53.040> why<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.159> use<00:01:53.369> that<00:01:53.399> but

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
analogy I don't know why I use that but

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.160 
analogy I don't know why I use that but
hopefully<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.360> can<00:01:54.420> understand<00:01:54.810> what<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:54.990> mean

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
hopefully you can understand what I mean

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.510 
hopefully you can understand what I mean
I<00:01:55.350> think<00:01:55.560> there<00:01:55.680> isn't<00:01:55.829> anything<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.310> can

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
I think there isn't anything you can

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.910 
I think there isn't anything you can
particularly<00:01:56.820> do<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.840> get<00:01:57.990> rid<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.469> apart

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
particularly do to get rid of that apart

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.249 
particularly do to get rid of that apart
from<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.579> going<00:02:00.060> for<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.659> sitting<00:02:01.020> down

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
from just going for it and sitting down

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.920 
from just going for it and sitting down
and<00:02:01.560> spending<00:02:01.799> time<00:02:02.280> writing<00:02:03.210> with<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.750> work

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
and spending time writing with the work

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.510 
and spending time writing with the work
so<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.350> spent<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.680> little<00:02:04.799> bit<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.100> time<00:02:05.280> doing

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
so I spent a little bit of time doing

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.940 
so I spent a little bit of time doing
that<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.969> also<00:02:06.390> put<00:02:06.780> pen<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.020> paper<00:02:07.140> as<00:02:07.500> well<00:02:07.649> so

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
that I also put pen to paper as well so

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.089 
that I also put pen to paper as well so
primarily<00:02:08.399> I'm<00:02:08.789> write<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.479> my<00:02:09.539> laptop<00:02:10.349> because

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
primarily I'm write on my laptop because

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.390 
primarily I'm write on my laptop because
that's<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
that's the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.339 
that's the
quickest<00:02:12.819> form<00:02:13.060> for<00:02:13.629> me<00:02:13.780> that's<00:02:14.049> the<00:02:14.230> way<00:02:14.319> I

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
quickest form for me that's the way I

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.009 
quickest form for me that's the way I
can<00:02:14.560> do<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.799> the<00:02:14.920> speediest<00:02:15.310> however<00:02:16.060> if<00:02:16.750> I'm

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
can do it the speediest however if I'm

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.319 
can do it the speediest however if I'm
finding<00:02:17.409> something<00:02:17.849> blocking<00:02:18.849> or

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
finding something blocking or

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:20.490 
finding something blocking or
something's<00:02:19.599> not<00:02:19.720> quite<00:02:19.870> working<00:02:20.049> out<00:02:20.260> then<00:02:20.470> I

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
something's not quite working out then I

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.199 
something's not quite working out then I
will<00:02:20.739> just<00:02:20.950> go<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.159> grab<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.370> notebook<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.970> a

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
will just go and grab a notebook and a

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.940 
will just go and grab a notebook and a
pen<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.450> sit<00:02:22.870> down<00:02:23.049> and<00:02:23.379> try<00:02:23.439> writing<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:23.890> that

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
pen and sit down and try writing it that

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.199 
pen and sit down and try writing it that
way<00:02:24.189> so<00:02:24.459> that's<00:02:24.549> just<00:02:24.700> another<00:02:24.970> thing<00:02:25.060> that

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
way so that's just another thing that

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.819 
way so that's just another thing that
works<00:02:25.540> for<00:02:25.780> me<00:02:25.989> do<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.290> guys<00:02:26.409> have<00:02:26.620> anything

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
works for me do you guys have anything

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.679 
works for me do you guys have anything
that<00:02:27.099> you<00:02:27.189> like<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.459> do<00:02:27.640> if<00:02:28.209> you're<00:02:28.450> finding

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689 
that you like to do if you're finding

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:30.000 
that you like to do if you're finding
writing<00:02:29.049> particularly<00:02:29.409> difficult<00:02:29.530> do<00:02:29.920> you

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
writing particularly difficult do you

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.170 
writing particularly difficult do you
leave<00:02:30.129> me<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.310> comment<00:02:30.519> down<00:02:30.670> below<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.060> let<00:02:31.150> me

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
leave me a comment down below and let me

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.429 
leave me a comment down below and let me
know<00:02:31.269> because<00:02:31.629> I<00:02:32.019> think<00:02:32.170> it's<00:02:32.290> really

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:32.439 
know because I think it's really

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.199 
know because I think it's really
important<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.430> useful<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.909> share<00:02:34.090> these

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
important and useful to share these

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.429 
important and useful to share these
things<00:02:34.390> with<00:02:34.510> each<00:02:34.659> other<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.079> so<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.260> last

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
things with each other and so the last

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:36.660 
things with each other and so the last
thing<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:35.769> wanted<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.099> talk<00:02:36.280> about<00:02:36.310> today

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
thing that I wanted to talk about today

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.690 
thing that I wanted to talk about today
is<00:02:37.950> writing<00:02:38.950> about<00:02:39.189> travel<00:02:39.670> now<00:02:41.129> my<00:02:42.129> character

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
is writing about travel now my character

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.039 
is writing about travel now my character
just<00:02:42.730> recently<00:02:43.359> has<00:02:43.510> been<00:02:43.659> doing<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.900> lot<00:02:44.019> of

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
just recently has been doing a lot of

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.099 
just recently has been doing a lot of
traveling<00:02:44.530> between<00:02:44.889> spaces<00:02:45.879> and<00:02:46.750> he's<00:02:46.959> been

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
traveling between spaces and he's been

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.559 
traveling between spaces and he's been
travelling<00:02:47.440> across<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.709> map<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.310> mean<00:02:49.120> if<00:02:49.209> you've

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
travelling across a map I mean if you've

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.050 
travelling across a map I mean if you've
read<00:02:49.870> roses<00:02:50.230> you'll<00:02:50.379> know<00:02:50.470> what<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.620> mean

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
read roses you'll know what I mean

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.949 
read roses you'll know what I mean
doing<00:02:52.060> some<00:02:52.239> sort<00:02:52.329> of<00:02:52.420> travelling<00:02:52.810> across

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
doing some sort of travelling across

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.099 
doing some sort of travelling across
different<00:02:53.349> lands<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:54.389> that<00:02:55.389> can<00:02:55.629> be<00:02:55.780> so

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
different lands and that can be so

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.080 
different lands and that can be so
difficult<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.889> write<00:02:57.099> at<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.370> issue<00:02:57.639> I<00:02:57.970> think

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
difficult to write at the issue I think

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.530 
difficult to write at the issue I think
is<00:02:58.629> that<00:02:59.500> it<00:03:00.310> just<00:03:00.459> becomes<00:03:00.790> very<00:03:01.150> repetitive

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
is that it just becomes very repetitive

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.259 
is that it just becomes very repetitive
and<00:03:02.109> as<00:03:02.560> a<00:03:02.590> writer<00:03:02.889> as<00:03:03.069> well<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:03.340> becomes<00:03:03.579> very

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
and as a writer as well it becomes very

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.530 
and as a writer as well it becomes very
dull<00:03:04.659> so<00:03:05.670> he's<00:03:06.670> moving<00:03:06.939> through<00:03:07.090> all<00:03:07.329> these

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
dull so he's moving through all these

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.300

tribal background so he has absolutely
no<00:03:37.750> concept<00:03:38.470> of<00:03:38.680> cities<00:03:39.099> and<00:03:39.459> houses<00:03:40.359> and

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:06.780 
difficult with travel and I would be

traveled for
two<00:04:26.860> years<00:04:27.900> that<00:04:28.980> doesn't<00:04:29.980> seem<00:04:30.330> realistic<00:04:31.330> I

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
two years that doesn't seem realistic I

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.870 
two years that doesn't seem realistic I
mean<00:04:32.050> it<00:04:32.170> works<00:04:32.410> in<00:04:32.680> some<00:04:32.860> cases<00:04:33.400> but<00:04:33.580> in<00:04:33.730> this

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
mean it works in some cases but in this

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.060 
mean it works in some cases but in this
particular<00:04:34.180> case<00:04:34.600> with<00:04:34.900> my<00:04:35.110> book<00:04:35.380> I<00:04:35.680> don't

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
particular case with my book I don't

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.260 
particular case with my book I don't
think<00:04:36.190> that<00:04:36.310> would<00:04:36.430> have<00:04:36.520> worked<00:04:36.760> that<00:04:37.120> beef

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
think that would have worked that beef

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.880 
think that would have worked that beef
really<00:04:37.420> I've<00:04:37.600> broken<00:04:37.900> through<00:04:38.200> that<00:04:38.290> now<00:04:38.590> and

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
really I've broken through that now and

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.730 
really I've broken through that now and
my<00:04:39.010> character<00:04:39.490> has<00:04:39.670> got<00:04:39.910> from<00:04:40.180> A<00:04:40.360> to<00:04:40.390> B<00:04:40.660> I<00:04:41.080> am<00:04:41.320> so

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
happy about that because in the middle

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.630 
happy about that because in the middle
things<00:04:44.200> were<00:04:44.350> getting<00:04:44.440> confusing<00:04:45.040> and<00:04:45.400> sort
