here<00:00:07.560> at<00:00:07.710> Towson<00:00:08.099> University<00:00:08.130> we've<00:00:08.790> really

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
here at Towson University we've really

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.759 
here at Towson University we've really
been<00:00:09.210> very<00:00:09.480> fortunate<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:10.650> the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
been very fortunate and that the

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.070 
been very fortunate and that the
university<00:00:11.490> has<00:00:11.910> made<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.210> large<00:00:12.630> investment

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
university has made a large investment

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.099 
university has made a large investment
in<00:00:13.500> nursing<00:00:13.950> simulation<00:00:14.299> education<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.509> with

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
in nursing simulation education and with

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.750 
in nursing simulation education and with
these<00:00:16.289> resources<00:00:16.350> we've<00:00:17.190> been<00:00:17.369> able<00:00:17.520> to

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
these resources we've been able to

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.970 
these resources we've been able to
increase<00:00:18.300> simulation<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.380> our<00:00:19.470> clinical

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
increase simulation in our clinical

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.620 
increase simulation in our clinical
courses<00:00:20.570> to<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> greater<00:00:21.900> extent<00:00:22.230> each<00:00:22.650> year<00:00:23.630> so

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
courses to a greater extent each year so

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.060 
courses to a greater extent each year so
what<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:24.960> really<00:00:25.320> great<00:00:25.500> about<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
what is really great about the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.730 
what is really great about the
simulation<00:00:26.340> now<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.750> we're<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.529> can

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
simulation now is that we're we can

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.939 
simulation now is that we're we can
allow<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.099> students<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.060> do<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:31.140> skills<00:00:31.500> and

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
allow the students to do the skills and

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.860 
allow the students to do the skills and
interact<00:00:32.489> with<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.880> mannequins<00:00:33.450> like<00:00:33.540> their

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
interact with the mannequins like their

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.500 
interact with the mannequins like their
rural<00:00:34.200> patients<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.670> learning<00:00:35.940> becomes

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
rural patients so the learning becomes

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.500 
rural patients so the learning becomes
more<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.770> words<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.430> book<00:00:38.460> or<00:00:38.969> words

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
more of just words in a book or words

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.660 
more of just words in a book or words
that<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.840> might<00:00:39.870> say<00:00:40.350> as<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> faculty<00:00:40.920> member<00:00:41.520> in

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
that I might say as a faculty member in

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.569 
that I might say as a faculty member in
a<00:00:41.760> class<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.930> words<00:00:43.469> now<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.950> learning

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
a class the words now the learning

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.090 
a class the words now the learning
becomes<00:00:45.030> live<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.559> lived<00:00:46.920> experience

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
becomes live if it's a lived experience

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.639 
becomes live if it's a lived experience
that<00:00:47.879> these<00:00:48.059> students<00:00:48.539> are<00:00:48.600> now<00:00:48.750> having

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.830 

lecture<00:00:55.309> is<00:00:55.399> definitely<00:00:55.730> one<00:00:55.850> thing<00:00:56.000> you<00:00:56.210> read

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
lecture is definitely one thing you read

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.060 
lecture is definitely one thing you read
it<00:00:56.930> from<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:57.140> book<00:00:57.350> we<00:00:57.620> study<00:00:57.860> from<00:00:58.010> the

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
it from the book we study from the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.490 
it from the book we study from the
PowerPoint<00:00:58.309> to<00:00:58.670> take<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:58.969> test<00:00:59.180> but

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
PowerPoint to take the test but

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.990 
PowerPoint to take the test but
simulation<00:01:00.500> kind<00:01:00.739> of<00:01:00.860> ties<00:01:01.280> all<00:01:01.640> what<00:01:01.879> you

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
simulation kind of ties all what you

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.780 
simulation kind of ties all what you
were<00:01:02.149> in<00:01:02.360> lecture<00:01:02.660> together<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.580> you<00:01:04.580> just

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
were in lecture together and you just

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.340 
were in lecture together and you just
have<00:01:04.909> to<00:01:04.970> do<00:01:05.150> it<00:01:05.269> in<00:01:05.420> a<00:01:05.720> certain<00:01:06.049> amount<00:01:06.229> of

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
have to do it in a certain amount of

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.320 
have to do it in a certain amount of
time<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:06.799> it<00:01:07.190> kind<00:01:07.670> of<00:01:07.700> helps<00:01:07.909> you<00:01:07.940> think<00:01:08.210> on

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
time and it kind of helps you think on

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.710 
time and it kind of helps you think on
your<00:01:08.450> feet

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
your feet

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.510 
your feet
and<00:01:08.930> first<00:01:09.830> time<00:01:09.920> I<00:01:10.040> was<00:01:10.159> really<00:01:10.280> nervous

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
and first time I was really nervous

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.510 
and first time I was really nervous
going<00:01:10.820> into<00:01:11.300> it<00:01:11.420> but<00:01:11.659> as<00:01:12.500> I<00:01:12.770> went<00:01:13.070> on<00:01:13.220> with<00:01:13.399> the

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
going into it but as I went on with the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.230 
going into it but as I went on with the
simulation<00:01:14.320> comfortable<00:01:15.320> with<00:01:15.470> it

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
simulation comfortable with it

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.420 
simulation comfortable with it
confidence<00:01:17.240> is<00:01:18.049> the<00:01:18.409> tool<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:18.890> need<00:01:19.100> in

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
confidence is the tool you need in

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.070 
confidence is the tool you need in
nursing<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:21.170> confidence<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:21.950> something<00:01:22.460> that

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
nursing the confidence is something that

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.830 
nursing the confidence is something that
you<00:01:24.080> must<00:01:24.290> have<00:01:24.649> so<00:01:25.159> you<00:01:25.250> cannot<00:01:25.759> walk<00:01:26.360> in<00:01:26.600> and

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
you must have so you cannot walk in and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.620 
you must have so you cannot walk in and
not<00:01:27.350> have<00:01:27.789> the<00:01:28.789> needed<00:01:29.210> tool<00:01:30.610> simulation<00:01:31.630> do

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
not have the needed tool simulation do

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.870 
not have the needed tool simulation do
see<00:01:32.840> that<00:01:33.050> this<00:01:33.409> is<00:01:33.590> not<00:01:33.740> just<00:01:33.800> textbook<00:01:34.550> you

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
see that this is not just textbook you

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.320 
see that this is not just textbook you
know<00:01:35.030> this<00:01:35.840> simulation<00:01:36.649> labs<00:01:37.070> actually

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
know this simulation labs actually

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.529 
know this simulation labs actually
exposes<00:01:38.330> you<00:01:38.539> to<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:39.229> real<00:01:39.470> world<00:01:39.979> I<00:01:40.330> want<00:01:41.330> all

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
exposes you to the real world I want all

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.840 
exposes you to the real world I want all
the<00:01:41.750> students<00:01:42.229> to<00:01:42.409> get<00:01:42.800> to<00:01:42.950> witness<00:01:43.159> different

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
the students to get to witness different

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.389 
the students to get to witness different
types<00:01:44.060> of<00:01:44.240> patients<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.259> you<00:01:45.319> all<00:01:45.679> will<00:01:46.039> get<00:01:46.220> to

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
types of patients so you all will get to

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.450 
types of patients so you all will get to
see<00:01:46.640> a<00:01:46.940> heart<00:01:47.869> patient<00:01:48.110> someone<00:01:48.679> with<00:01:48.950> chest

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
see a heart patient someone with chest

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.279 
see a heart patient someone with chest
pain<00:01:49.789> or<00:01:49.819> someone<00:01:50.390> with<00:01:50.569> problems<00:01:51.050> with<00:01:51.110> their

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
pain or someone with problems with their

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.639 
pain or someone with problems with their
diabetes<00:01:51.920> with<00:01:52.610> sim<00:01:52.940> we've<00:01:53.659> now<00:01:54.020> been<00:01:54.259> able<00:01:54.440> to

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
diabetes with sim we've now been able to

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.160 
diabetes with sim we've now been able to
really<00:01:55.100> standardize<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:56.179> type<00:01:56.450> of<00:01:56.659> patients

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
really standardize the type of patients

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.139 
really standardize the type of patients
that<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.500> students<00:01:57.920> are<00:01:58.039> going<00:01:58.190> to<00:01:58.310> see<00:01:58.399> prior

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
that the students are going to see prior

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.810 
that the students are going to see prior
to<00:01:59.420> going<00:01:59.570> into<00:01:59.840> their<00:02:00.200> work<00:02:00.439> setting<00:02:00.890> you

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
to going into their work setting you

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.850 
to going into their work setting you
have<00:02:01.850> to<00:02:02.240> believe<00:02:02.570> in<00:02:02.689> yourself<00:02:02.780> and<00:02:03.320> in<00:02:03.740> each

have to believe in yourself and in each
scenario<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:04.430> have<00:02:04.549> to<00:02:04.640> be<00:02:04.729> ready<00:02:04.909> for<00:02:05.149> it<00:02:05.210> if

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
scenario you have to be ready for it if

you don't believe in yourself you won't

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.060 
you don't believe in yourself you won't
be<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.140> best<00:02:09.170> notice<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.679> you<00:02:09.799> can<00:02:09.920> be
