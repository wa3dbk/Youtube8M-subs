okay so recently someone asked me about

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.570 
okay so recently someone asked me about
the<00:00:02.939> pentatonic<00:00:03.899> patterns<00:00:04.830> and<00:00:05.100> pattern<00:00:05.460> of

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
the pentatonic patterns and pattern of

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.670 
the pentatonic patterns and pattern of
scale<00:00:05.819> so<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:06.660> just<00:00:06.870> want<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.109> show<00:00:07.290> kind<00:00:07.589> of

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
scale so I just want to show kind of

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.940 
scale so I just want to show kind of
five<00:00:08.429> boxes<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.450> minor<00:00:09.750> pentatonic<00:00:10.200> scale

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
five boxes of the minor pentatonic scale

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.940 
five boxes of the minor pentatonic scale
we're<00:00:11.429> gonna<00:00:11.519> use<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.969> minor<00:00:12.349> okay<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.740> I'm

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
we're gonna use a minor okay and I'm

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.200 
we're gonna use a minor okay and I'm
just<00:00:14.070> gonna<00:00:14.219> give<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> quick<00:00:14.490> overview<00:00:14.700> and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
just gonna give a quick overview and

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.450 
just gonna give a quick overview and
then<00:00:15.570> also<00:00:16.440> go<00:00:16.590> through<00:00:16.890> kind<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.250> how<00:00:17.400> to

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
then also go through kind of how to

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.320 
then also go through kind of how to
incorporate<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.900> into<00:00:19.170> your<00:00:19.380> playing<00:00:20.330> all

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
incorporate it into your playing all

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.790 
incorporate it into your playing all
right<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.810> first<00:00:21.990> one<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.439> going<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.650> be

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
right so the first one is going to be

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.590 
right so the first one is going to be
the<00:00:23.100> first<00:00:23.250> position<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.150> root<00:00:24.359> note

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
the first position is on the root note

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.460 
the first position is on the root note
and<00:00:24.810> we're<00:00:25.380> an<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.570> on<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.960> sixth<00:00:28.260> string

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
and we're an a so a on the sixth string

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.040 
and we're an a so a on the sixth string
okay<00:00:29.369> here's<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.730> root<00:00:29.880> note<00:00:30.090> for<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:30.840> one

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
okay here's the root note for this one

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.630 
okay here's the root note for this one
oh<00:00:31.230> man<00:00:32.219> there<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.550> goes<00:00:32.930> five<00:00:33.930> eight<00:00:34.640> five

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640

five eight but uh since if we're in a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.639 
five eight but uh since if we're in a
minor<00:00:45.390> that's<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.870> case<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.379> don't<00:00:46.530> really

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
minor that's the case you don't really

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.979 
minor that's the case you don't really
want<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.980> remember<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> fret<00:00:48.120> numbers<00:00:48.809> you

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
want to remember the fret numbers you

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.319 
want to remember the fret numbers you
want<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.200> just<00:00:49.350> remember<00:00:49.620> kind<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.329> what

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
want to just remember kind of that what

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.660 
want to just remember kind of that what
your<00:00:51.449> fingers<00:00:51.750> are<00:00:51.870> doing<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.199> 1<00:00:52.469> 4<00:00:52.829> 1<00:00:53.100> 3<00:00:53.129> 1<00:00:53.610> 3

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
your fingers are doing it's 1 4 1 3 1 3

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
your fingers are doing it's 1 4 1 3 1 3
1<00:00:53.940> 3<00:00:54.239> 1<00:00:54.510> 4<00:00:55.140> 1<00:00:55.199> 4<00:00:55.850> because<00:00:56.850> if<00:00:56.969> we're<00:00:57.120> not<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.270> minor

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
1 3 1 4 1 4 because if we're not a minor

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.540 
1 3 1 4 1 4 because if we're not a minor
then<00:00:58.170> we're<00:00:58.289> not<00:00:58.379> gonna<00:00:58.500> be<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:59.010> doing<00:00:59.340> that

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
then we're not gonna be here doing that

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.279 
then we're not gonna be here doing that
pattern<00:00:59.879> we're<00:00:59.969> gonna<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.270> let's<00:01:00.930> say<00:01:01.109> we're

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
pattern we're gonna be let's say we're

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.780 
pattern we're gonna be let's say we're
in<00:01:01.350> C<00:01:01.680> where<00:01:03.589> you<00:01:04.589> only<00:01:04.710> remembered<00:01:05.040> 580<00:01:05.519> then

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
in C where you only remembered 580 then

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.190 
in C where you only remembered 580 then
you'll<00:01:05.909> have<00:01:06.000> no<00:01:06.180> idea<00:01:06.420> what<00:01:06.570> C<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.049> just

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
you'll have no idea what C is so just

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.160 
you'll have no idea what C is so just
remember<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.680> finger<00:01:08.479> pattern<00:01:09.479> more<00:01:09.960> than

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
remember the finger pattern more than

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.359 
remember the finger pattern more than
necessarily<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> fret<00:01:11.000> anyways<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.479> 2nd<00:01:13.369> 2nd

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
necessarily a fret anyways the 2nd 2nd

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.390 
necessarily a fret anyways the 2nd 2nd
position<00:01:14.580> he<00:01:14.939> goes<00:01:15.119> 810<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.380> 2<00:01:16.439> 4<00:01:17.330> 7<00:01:18.330> 10<00:01:18.630> 1<00:01:19.530> 4<00:01:19.830> 7

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
position he goes 810 so 2 4 7 10 1 4 7

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.460 
position he goes 810 so 2 4 7 10 1 4 7
10<00:01:21.439> 7<00:01:22.439> 9

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
10 7 9

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.920 
10 7 9
810<00:01:24.880> 810<00:01:27.040> with<00:01:28.040> all<00:01:28.220> these<00:01:28.490> you<00:01:29.030> kind<00:01:29.300> of<00:01:29.360> you

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
810 810 with all these you kind of you

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.400 
810 810 with all these you kind of you
don't<00:01:30.020> want<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.290> necessarily<00:01:30.410> just<00:01:30.830> go<00:01:35.410> when

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
don't want to necessarily just go when

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.750 
don't want to necessarily just go when
you're<00:01:36.530> practicing<00:01:36.650> cuz<00:01:37.280> then<00:01:37.430> that's<00:01:37.580> how

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
you're practicing cuz then that's how

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.700 
you're practicing cuz then that's how
you're<00:01:37.880> gonna<00:01:37.940> play<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.479> things<00:01:39.410> when<00:01:39.590> you're

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
you're gonna play the things when you're

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.350 
you're gonna play the things when you're
soloing<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:40.190> that's<00:01:40.400> not<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.670> most<00:01:40.850> fun<00:01:41.180> to

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
soloing and that's not the most fun to

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.670

down and go 1 4 and then 1 3 ok so the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.830 
down and go 1 4 and then 1 3 ok so the
fourth<00:02:50.180> position<00:02:50.360> we<00:02:50.810> got<00:02:51.049> 12<00:02:52.010> 15<00:02:52.459> 12<00:02:53.420> 15<00:02:54.010> 12<00:02:55.010> 14

1 4 1 4 1 3 1 3 2 4 1 4 ok and then the

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.559 
1 4 1 4 1 3 1 3 2 4 1 4 ok and then the
fifth<00:03:12.000> position<00:03:12.480> um<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:14.060> mean<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.120> guess<00:03:15.390> it's

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
fifth position um I mean I guess it's

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.460 
fifth position um I mean I guess it's
fifteen<00:03:16.410> seventeen<00:03:16.910> fifteen<00:03:17.910> seventeen

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470

fifteen seventeen fifteen seventeen
fourteen<00:03:19.470> seventeen<00:03:20.060> fourteen<00:03:21.060> seventeen

fifteen seventeen fifteen seventeen

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.229 
fifteen seventeen fifteen seventeen
again<00:03:25.560> that's<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.640> mean<00:03:26.790> that's<00:03:26.850> what<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.209> is

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
again that's I mean that's what it is

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.470 
again that's I mean that's what it is
but<00:03:27.630> most<00:03:28.319> of<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.590> time<00:03:28.800> you<00:03:29.489> use<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.730> fifth

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
but most of the time you use a fifth

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.440 
but most of the time you use a fifth
position<00:03:30.930> up<00:03:31.170> here<00:03:31.530> like<00:03:31.980> above<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.910> first

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
position up here like above the first

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.290 
position up here like above the first
position<00:03:33.930> which<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:35.610> reason<00:03:35.880> that<00:03:36.000> is<00:03:36.269> is

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
position which the reason that is is

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.350 
position which the reason that is is
because<00:03:36.750> this<00:03:37.230> is<00:03:37.380> 15<00:03:37.769> minus<00:03:38.610> twelve<00:03:38.880> is<00:03:39.269> three

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
because this is 15 minus twelve is three

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.900 
because this is 15 minus twelve is three
and<00:03:40.350> they<00:03:40.470> kind<00:03:40.709> of<00:03:40.769> start<00:03:41.160> over<00:03:41.310> again<00:03:41.489> after

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
and they kind of start over again after

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.880 
and they kind of start over again after
twelve<00:03:42.180> frets<00:03:42.480> so<00:03:42.690> this<00:03:43.200> is<00:03:43.380> you're<00:03:43.709> more

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
twelve frets so this is you're more

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.910 
twelve frets so this is you're more
likely<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.310> be<00:03:44.459> over<00:03:44.670> here<00:03:44.850> since<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.299> sure

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
likely to be over here since you sure

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.400 
likely to be over here since you sure
root<00:03:46.920> first<00:03:47.580> position<00:03:48.030> then<00:03:48.450> it's<00:03:48.989> not<00:03:49.200> as

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
root first position then it's not as

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.350 
root first position then it's not as
easy<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:50.870> kind<00:03:51.870> of<00:03:51.930> slide<00:03:52.530> all<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.739> way<00:03:52.830> down

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
easy to kind of slide all the way down

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.120 
easy to kind of slide all the way down
so<00:03:54.360> we<00:03:54.900> like<00:03:55.080> to<00:03:57.049> so<00:03:58.049> think<00:03:58.500> of<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:58.739> as<00:03:58.890> more

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
so we like to so think of it as more

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:06.170 
so we like to so think of it as more
just<00:03:59.519> one<00:03:59.760> three<00:04:00.090> one<00:04:00.330> three<00:04:04.970> the<00:04:05.970> fifth

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
just one three one three the fifth

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.259 
just one three one three the fifth
position<00:04:06.540> is<00:04:06.660> more<00:04:06.840> than<00:04:06.959> one<00:04:07.110> above<00:04:07.560> the

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
position is more than one above the

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.319 
position is more than one above the
first<00:04:09.269> position<00:04:10.430> okay<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.700> those<00:04:12.000> are<00:04:12.209> the

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
first position okay and those are the

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:13.970 
first position okay and those are the
those<00:04:12.810> are<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.989> five<00:04:13.170> positions<00:04:13.350> and<00:04:13.859> now

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
those are the five positions and now

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.099 
those are the five positions and now
we'll<00:04:14.100> get<00:04:14.190> to<00:04:14.370> some<00:04:14.609> licks<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.329> like<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.690> use<00:04:15.810> to

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
we'll get to some licks I like to use to

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.930 
we'll get to some licks I like to use to
try<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:16.590> connect<00:04:16.890> them<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.280> make<00:04:17.640> them<00:04:17.760> sound

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
try and connect them and make them sound

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:25.600 
try and connect them and make them sound
good

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:05:58.879 

you

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:13.580 

you

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:35.070 

you
