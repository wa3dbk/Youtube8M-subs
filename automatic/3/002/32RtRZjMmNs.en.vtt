00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.859
 Hi guys how are you? 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.859
 I'm going to teach you how to play le blanc today. 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.260
 le blanc or the murderous magician who 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.320
 high damage on a single target and thus the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.230
 used as a millennium lie is only 95 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.689
 percent of what I make your passive is the 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.720
 mirror image when reading blanc 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.149
 less than 40% of life it becomes invisible 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.040
 for a second and creates a mirror image 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.950
 which does no harm and lasts up to eight 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.379
 Yours is the secret of malice. 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.329
 le blanc design order in the direction of your 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.270
 target causing magical damage and marking the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.039
 target for 3.5 seconds will only receive 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.530
 damage of one of the abilities of le blanc 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.530
 stealth will be activated causing damage to the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.050
 your w is distortion le blanc quickly 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.090
 advances to the target location causing more 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.100
 close communities within four seconds 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.780
 following it can activate distortion 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.780
 again to return to your place 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.909
 and its internal currents are 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.310
 blanc cast an illusory current on the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.200
 local albums she hit an enemy her 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.110
 causes magic damage and slows down 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.119
 of enemy movement by 25% 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.920
 if the target remains attached for two 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.900
 seconds he gets giving more 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.200
 and gets stuck by the chains 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.090
 your r is almir mika de blanc may 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:35.090
 conjure up a mass version of the last 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:35.090
 spell that cast appearances deceive 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:46.680
 destroying in the streets I use penetration 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.689
 magic in the ears seven life stamps 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.659
 for the level and two life stamps in the 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.610
 yellow 5 app grabs the level and 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.369
 four brands and recharge time for the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.149
 level in the blues and in the fifth and 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:04.590
 power of talent in talents I use the 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.549
 appetite and put 21 09 the build for blanc 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.409
 it's very simple 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.170
 begins with a two-ring dhoran 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.000
 life positions totem surveillance or 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.680
 if you have played against a cali 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.989
 exchange the totem of 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.569
 already by milk detector the items 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.750
 essential for leblanc is a morel 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.629
 shoes of the wizard abaddon staff 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.719
 empty hymn and suffocation items 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.549
 defense zones are angel guardian right 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.290
 bissau and weldon snack 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.480
 if you are having a law made me with 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.639
 enough exchange with your enemy I 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.780
 I recommend you do morel because he 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:40.049
 will give you p 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.859
 mana regen and 20% reduction in the 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.540
 recharge 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:44.969
 already if you are having a lenny made 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.310
 quietly giving enough damage to your 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:50.189
 he is not playing with you. 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:54.419
 you can do the choking and corn 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:56.849
 it will give more app 120 and 10% 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:58.769
 reduction in recharge time after having 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.959
 closed one of the two items 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.669
 I recommend closing the shoe made early 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.260
 so you will have a penetration 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:07.230
 magic in the enemy 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.939
 after closing the shoe of the sorcerer I 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.769
 I recommend already buying the items for 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.439
 raba dom so you will have more 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.930
 120 app or if you are 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:18.599
 very focused by his enemies as 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.870
 Do you exchange the raba sun for the buses? 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.739
 so you'll get over 120 atp and 50 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.229
 of armor 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.449
 if you decided to do the raba first 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:29.489
 gift the next item to the eyes 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.810
 if you decided to make the zone the next 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.479
 item is the sun raba 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.829
 and to close with the golden key you do 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:41.069
 the staff of the void that will give you 70 deap 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:43.409
 ignores 35% of target magic resistance 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.000
 and if you're being too focused 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.280
 You can make a guardian angel go 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.739
 50 give more armor 50 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.019
 magic resistance and let's go there 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:57.780
 It will be two lives because you die and 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:04:01.919
 then return energy wp one of the combos and 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.750
 le blanc is qr davi and you are focused 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.109
 I'll leave it to you in slow motion. 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.109
 see better 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.100
 another as I quite like 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.790
 it is for you to approach the enemy that is 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:30.620
 wr and ends with what or with it in 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:36.040
 case ends with and another such as wqs r 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.040
 and ends with the internet or with 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.919
 lÃª blanc has a lot of damage already down 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.600
 level so never let your 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.790
 opponent stay calm in the beyond 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.880
 always troquez with him mainly 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.370
 using what the hell are you going to give 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.970
 too much damage but logical always take 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.800
 beware of gang and with your mana 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.900
 as I said at the beginning of the video leblanc 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.090
 has great damage on a single target 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.340
 but your mistake is trying to hit a 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.960
 when you are with your team 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.690
 whenever the opposing team is 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.450
 together you can not jump on top of a 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.580
 album because if you miss your combo 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:22.880
 you're probably going to take a look at 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:24.410
 die always keep an eye on your mini 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.320
 map because besides blanc it is not a 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.870
 character that families and sim champions 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.430
 so keep an eye out to see where you are 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.430
 You can go and get your kills. 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:46.789
 The boy is never afraid to go up. 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.009
 of his target when he is alone in the law and 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:51.319
 especially if the target is humble to read 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.479
 or that he wants to be a German who has a 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:56.800
 great damage to see if you have a 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.800
 millennium or a small 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.379
 It's what's so personal, I hope. 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:13.599
 You liked it, did you like it? 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:15.789
 forget to leave your own 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:18.159
 leave your comment just sleeping underneath 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:21.340
 on the video and I really hope to have 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:23.409
 help you and see you in the next 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:38.189
 tutorial with the next czech valeu 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:38.189
 said and until the next video I loved her 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.460
 the street
