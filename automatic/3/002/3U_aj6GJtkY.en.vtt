contraction or you're doing things in

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.160 
contraction or you're doing things in
your<00:00:22.890> bath<00:00:23.160> exercises<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.510> are<00:00:24.630> helping<00:00:24.990> you

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
your bath exercises that are helping you

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.349 
your bath exercises that are helping you
to<00:00:25.199> perform<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.769> primary<00:00:26.189> function<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
to perform the primary function on the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.810 
to perform the primary function on the
lap<00:00:27.570> one<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.080> them<00:00:28.230> being<00:00:28.730> extending<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
lap one of them being extending the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.510 
lap one of them being extending the
shoulder<00:00:30.269> back<00:00:30.720> here<00:00:31.140> okay<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
shoulder back here okay so this is the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.850 
shoulder back here okay so this is the
function<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.000> your<00:00:33.149> lap<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.600> flex<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.680> to

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
function of your lap to flex it and to

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.830 
function of your lap to flex it and to
extend<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.820> if<00:00:35.910> we're<00:00:36.059> applying<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.630> to

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
extend it so if we're applying this to

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.810 
extend it so if we're applying this to
our<00:00:36.960> back<00:00:37.170> training<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:38.040> want<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.370> think<00:00:38.579> how

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
our back training we want to think how

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.119 
our back training we want to think how
can<00:00:39.120> extend<00:00:39.510> my<00:00:39.629> shoulder<00:00:40.200> through<00:00:40.950> this

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
can extend my shoulder through this

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.340 
can extend my shoulder through this
movement<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> lap<00:00:42.210> pull<00:00:42.480> down<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:43.230> want

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
movement so on a lap pull down we want

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.410 
movement so on a lap pull down we want
to<00:00:43.500> think<00:00:43.649> about<00:00:43.770> bringing<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.760> bumper<00:00:45.210> arm

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420

here behind us so down and back down and

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.190 
here behind us so down and back down and
back

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
back

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.840 
back

an overhand grip you only be able to get

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.340 
an overhand grip you only be able to get
down<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:11.880> large<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.720> angle<00:01:15.110> okay<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
down so large is it the angle okay and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.140 
down so large is it the angle okay and
this<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.979> great<00:01:17.689> it's<00:01:18.689> not<00:01:18.840> wrong<00:01:19.110> nothing<00:01:20.150> bad
