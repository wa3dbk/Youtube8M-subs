00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
when we are going to look into a

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.969 
when we are going to look into a
hardware<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.369> device<00:01:36.079> plus<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.320> ignites

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
hardware of this device plus it ignites

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.030

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
by dual core Qualcomm S 4 chipset which

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.690 
by dual core Qualcomm S 4 chipset which
is<00:01:41.220> clocked<00:01:41.579> at<00:01:41.759> 1.2<00:01:42.240> gigahertz<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.369> gig

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
is clocked at 1.2 gigahertz with one gig

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.080 
is clocked at 1.2 gigahertz with one gig
of<00:01:44.880> ram<00:01:48.500> now<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.560> are<00:01:49.890> going<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.280> run<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.640> enter

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
of ram now we are going to run and enter

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.749 
of ram now we are going to run and enter
the<00:01:51.119> benchmark<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.930> see<00:01:52.170> what<00:01:52.920> type<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.220> score

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
the benchmark to see what type of score

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.240 
the benchmark to see what type of score
we<00:01:54.030> will<00:01:54.240> get<00:01:54.479> from<00:01:54.750> its<00:01:55.110> CPU<00:01:55.530> GPU<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.310> ram<00:01:58.250> so

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
we will get from its CPU GPU and ram so

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:15.230 
we will get from its CPU GPU and ram so
let's<00:01:59.490> start<00:02:00.030> it

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.770 

now<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.510> save<00:02:15.900> some<00:02:16.170> time<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:17.060> will<00:02:18.060> be<00:02:18.210> back<00:02:18.240> one

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
now to save some time I will be back one

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.960 
now to save some time I will be back one
I<00:02:19.050> will<00:02:19.230> get<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.680> result<00:02:19.980> from<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.850> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
I will get a result from and to the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.770 
I will get a result from and to the
benchmark<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:23.310> these<00:02:23.640> are<00:02:23.700> all<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.210> processes

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
benchmark so these are all the processes

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.020 
benchmark so these are all the processes
we<00:02:24.960> are<00:02:25.230> going<00:02:25.620> through<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:26.010> when<00:02:26.430> we<00:02:26.610> run<00:02:26.730> onto

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
we are going through it when we run onto

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:47.770 
we are going through it when we run onto
the<00:02:27.150> benchmark<00:02:27.720> on<00:02:27.960> HTC<00:02:28.620> one<00:02:28.800> sv

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.620 

so<00:02:48.440> here<00:02:48.709> we<00:02:48.920> have<00:02:48.950> results<00:02:49.610> in<00:02:49.760> front<00:02:50.150> of<00:02:50.360> us

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
so here we have results in front of us

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.690 
so here we have results in front of us
it<00:02:50.870> has<00:02:51.110> a<00:02:51.140> scored<00:02:51.500> ten<00:02:51.980> thousand<00:02:52.459> nine

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
it has a scored ten thousand nine

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.430 
it has a scored ten thousand nine
hundred<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:53.150> ninety<00:02:53.569> three<00:02:53.750> so<00:02:54.140> this<00:02:54.290> is<00:02:54.319> a

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
hundred and ninety three so this is a

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
in internal storage of this device so

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.120 
in internal storage of this device so
there<00:04:42.120> is<00:04:42.240> an<00:04:42.360> 8gb<00:04:42.870> of<00:04:43.080> internal<00:04:43.290> storage<00:04:43.590> in

there is an 8gb of internal storage in

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.550 
there is an 8gb of internal storage in
this<00:04:44.430> device<00:04:44.790> available<00:04:45.030> force<00:04:45.630> and<00:04:45.930> there<00:04:46.410> is

this device available force and there is
a<00:04:46.590> 4gb<00:04:47.100> version<00:04:47.250> of<00:04:47.700> this<00:04:47.880> device<00:04:48.210> as<00:04:48.450> well<00:04:48.720> but

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
a 4gb version of this device as well but

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.040 
a 4gb version of this device as well but
as<00:04:49.770> I<00:04:49.800> said<00:04:50.220> it<00:04:50.520> can<00:04:50.820> be<00:04:51.000> expanded<00:04:51.300> from<00:04:51.750> a

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
as I said it can be expanded from a

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.950 
as I said it can be expanded from a
microSD<00:04:52.860> card<00:04:53.100> slot<00:04:53.160> so<00:04:54.030> this<00:04:54.270> is<00:04:54.300> a<00:04:54.630> good

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960
