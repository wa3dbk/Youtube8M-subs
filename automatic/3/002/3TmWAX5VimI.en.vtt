interesting<00:02:17.380> matchup<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.490> hopefully<00:02:18.850> we<00:02:18.940> get

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
just waiting I think I think they can

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.030 
just waiting I think I think they can
get<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.370> done<00:02:30.520> this<00:02:30.790> year<00:02:30.850> sometime<00:02:31.600> this<00:02:31.780> year

get it done this year sometime this year

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.070 
get it done this year sometime this year
probably<00:02:33.040> in<00:02:33.430> probably<00:02:34.210> in<00:02:34.240> one<00:02:34.360> of<00:02:34.540> Canelo's

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
probably in probably in one of Canelo's

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.810 
probably in probably in one of Canelo's
under<00:02:35.410> cards<00:02:35.740> that's<00:02:35.920> my<00:02:36.070> guess<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.460> think<00:02:36.520> I'm

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
under cards that's my guess I think I'm

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.820 
under cards that's my guess I think I'm
pretty<00:02:37.000> sure<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.540> would<00:02:38.410> love<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.590> see<00:02:38.800> a

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
pretty sure and I would love to see a

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.380 
pretty sure and I would love to see a
fight<00:02:39.040> between<00:02:39.190> them<00:02:39.520> I<00:02:39.820> think<00:02:40.150> that's

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
fight between them I think that's

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.480 
fight between them I think that's
basically<00:02:40.630> it<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:41.410> think<00:02:41.860> that's<00:02:41.980> what's<00:02:42.190> next

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
basically it I think that's what's next

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.820 
basically it I think that's what's next
for<00:02:42.610> both<00:02:42.760> guys<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.720> mean<00:02:44.290> there's<00:02:44.500> still<00:02:44.770> a

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.300 
at Aqaba I think he should just take a
little<00:02:49.510> break<00:02:49.720> for<00:02:49.930> now<00:02:49.990> from<00:02:50.350> now<00:02:50.560> try<00:02:51.250> to
