00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
to a slightly longer longer wat before

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.110 
to a slightly longer longer wat before
we<00:01:11.560> go<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:11.890> full-size<00:01:12.490> one<00:01:12.790> the<00:01:12.940> one<00:01:13.090> I

saved for myself that I do not get my
students

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.670 

and<00:01:23.730> you'll<00:01:24.090> notice<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.720> one<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.470> one

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
and you'll notice that this one this one

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.190 
and you'll notice that this one this one
only<00:01:25.830> win<00:01:26.040> two<00:01:26.310> rows<00:01:26.580> back<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:26.940> the<00:01:27.150> crowd<00:01:27.240> I'm

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
looking to hit that some of the people

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.130 
looking to hit that some of the people
in<00:01:29.730> the<00:01:29.820> leg<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> boot<00:01:30.240> behind<00:01:30.810> them<00:01:30.990> let's

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
in the leg of a boot behind them let's

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.070 
in the leg of a boot behind them let's
see<00:01:31.260> if<00:01:31.350> we<00:01:31.440> can<00:01:31.590> do<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.860> other<00:01:32.100> marvel<00:01:32.460> booth

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.690 

that's<00:01:37.080> pretty<00:01:37.350> close<00:01:37.560> uh<00:01:37.830> oh<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.100> took<00:01:38.250> out

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
that's pretty close uh oh I took out

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.890 
that's pretty close uh oh I took out
that<00:01:38.940> such<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> change

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.780 

and<00:01:42.990> then<00:01:43.740> with<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.010> longer<00:01:44.430> one<00:01:44.580> it's<00:01:44.730> a

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
and then with the longer one it's a

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.640 
and then with the longer one it's a
little<00:01:45.060> bin<00:01:45.330> so<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.690> gives<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.050> little<00:01:46.170> curve

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
little bin so it gives it a little curve

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.050 
little bin so it gives it a little curve
on<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.400> makes<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.790> hard<00:01:47.970> for

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
on it but that just makes it hard for

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.110 
on it but that just makes it hard for
anyone<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.510> dodge<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:49.520> will<00:01:50.520> see<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.700> how<00:01:50.880> far

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
anyone to dodge I will see you how far

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.810 
anyone to dodge I will see you how far
we<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.360> really<00:01:51.540> get<00:01:51.690> with<00:01:51.870> this<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:55.820> it's

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
we can really get with this one it's

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.040 
we can really get with this one it's
someone<00:01:57.090> who<00:01:57.150> doesn't<00:01:57.540> even<00:01:57.660> know<00:01:57.780> what's

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
someone who doesn't even know what's

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.930 
someone who doesn't even know what's
going<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.380> all<00:01:58.710> they<00:01:59.010> saw<00:01:59.280> was<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.520> marshmallow

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
going on all they saw was a marshmallow

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.040 
going on all they saw was a marshmallow
come<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.570> air<00:02:00.720> at<00:02:00.960> them<00:02:02.930> so<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
come out of the air at them so the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.050 
come out of the air at them so the
longer<00:02:04.290> one<00:02:04.620> is<00:02:04.740> better<00:02:04.920> there<00:02:05.370> is<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.550> limit

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
longer one is better there is a limit

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.460 
longer one is better there is a limit
you<00:02:06.210> only<00:02:06.360> have<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.600> certain<00:02:06.780> amount<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.140> breath

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
you only have a certain amount of breath

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.710 
you only have a certain amount of breath
so<00:02:07.920> any<00:02:08.280> tube<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.820> has<00:02:08.940> more<00:02:09.179> volume<00:02:09.420> than

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
so any tube that has more volume than

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.390 
so any tube that has more volume than
your<00:02:09.990> lungs<00:02:10.259> does<00:02:10.619> there's<00:02:10.890> no<00:02:11.009> longer<00:02:11.220> any

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
your lungs does there's no longer any

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.980 
your lungs does there's no longer any
advantage<00:02:12.030> because<00:02:12.180> we're<00:02:12.360> not<00:02:12.390> pushing<00:02:12.750> on

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
advantage because we're not pushing on

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.070 
advantage because we're not pushing on
the<00:02:13.110> air<00:02:13.230> very<00:02:13.500> much<00:02:13.710> anymore<00:02:14.570> indeed<00:02:15.570> this<00:02:15.959> is

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
the air very much anymore indeed this is

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.930 
the air very much anymore indeed this is
a<00:02:16.140> really<00:02:16.350> good<00:02:16.560> for<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.980> famous<00:02:17.490> impulse

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
a really good for the famous impulse

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.150 
a really good for the famous impulse
