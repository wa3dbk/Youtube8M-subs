00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
because there are some big differences

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.740 
because there are some big differences
between<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.820> game<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.060> black<00:01:27.299> ops<00:01:27.479> 2<00:01:27.630> that

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
between this game and black ops 2 that

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.840 
between this game and black ops 2 that
I've<00:01:27.840> noticed<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.799> I've<00:01:28.920> listed<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.460> sort<00:01:29.820> of

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
I've noticed and I've listed a sort of

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.910 
I've noticed and I've listed a sort of
you<00:01:30.030> know<00:01:30.150> some<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.360> them<00:01:30.540> down<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.860> a

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
you know some of them down just just a

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.620 
you know some of them down just just a
be<00:01:32.009> prepared<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.520> whatnot<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.030> I'm<00:01:33.450> going<00:01:33.570> to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
be prepared and whatnot so I'm going to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.929 
be prepared and whatnot so I'm going to
go<00:01:33.720> through<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> changes<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.530> think<00:01:34.860> are<00:01:35.070> most

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
go through the changes I think are most

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.760 
go through the changes I think are most
noticeable<00:01:36.600> between<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.110> game<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.380> black

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
noticeable between this game and black

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.010 
noticeable between this game and black
ops<00:01:37.950> 2<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.430> there's<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:38.939> no<00:01:39.240> particular<00:01:39.390> order

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
ops 2 so there's in no particular order

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.960 
ops 2 so there's in no particular order
there<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.560> some<00:01:40.770> thoughts<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.369> had<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.880> I

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
there just some thoughts I had and I

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.760 
there just some thoughts I had and I
thought<00:01:42.090> they'd<00:01:42.270> listen<00:01:42.600> down<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
thought they'd listen down so the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.170 
thought they'd listen down so the
biggest<00:01:44.040> differences<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.579> my<00:01:44.700> opinion<00:01:45.030> are

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
biggest differences in my opinion are

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.810 
biggest differences in my opinion are
the<00:01:45.240> guns<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.710> guns<00:01:46.740> are<00:01:47.130> ridiculous<00:01:47.640> for

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
the guns the guns are ridiculous for

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.270 
the guns the guns are ridiculous for
example<00:01:48.180> if<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.390> took<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.810> ACR<00:01:49.320> or<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.829> mp7

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
example if you took the ACR or the mp7

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.399 
example if you took the ACR or the mp7
which<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.790> what<00:01:50.939> amusing<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.360> gameplay<00:01:51.600> if

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
which is what amusing this gameplay if

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.050 
which is what amusing this gameplay if
you<00:01:52.590> haven't<00:01:52.920> already<00:01:53.040> noticed<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.850> put

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
you haven't already noticed and you put

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.969 
you haven't already noticed and you put
it<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.210> black<00:01:54.390> ops<00:01:54.570> 2<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.020> kept<00:01:55.530> all<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.829> other

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
it in black ops 2 and kept all the other

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.130 
it in black ops 2 and kept all the other
guns<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.280> same<00:01:56.490> no<00:01:57.149> one<00:01:57.180> would<00:01:57.450> use<00:01:57.659> anything

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
guns the same no one would use anything

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.469 
guns the same no one would use anything
else<00:01:58.350> other<00:01:58.619> than<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.920> other<00:01:59.189> than<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.700> mp7<00:02:00.030> is

else other than it other than the mp7 is

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.109 
else other than it other than the mp7 is
too<00:02:00.869> good<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.350> black<00:02:01.500> ops<00:02:01.710> 2<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.850> don't

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
too good for black ops 2 and I don't

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.520 
too good for black ops 2 and I don't
know<00:02:03.180> why<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.360> trailer<00:02:03.750> cores<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.170> had<00:02:04.409> this

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
know why the trailer cores have had this

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.100 
know why the trailer cores have had this
mentality<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.219> making<00:02:05.549> every<00:02:05.850> gun<00:02:06.030> pretty<00:02:06.840> bad

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
mentality of making every gun pretty bad

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.469 
mentality of making every gun pretty bad
and<00:02:07.409> then<00:02:07.649> making<00:02:08.039> every<00:02:08.369> gun<00:02:08.580> equally<00:02:09.119> as<00:02:09.179> bad

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
and then making every gun equally as bad

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.960 
and then making every gun equally as bad
as<00:02:09.690> each<00:02:09.899> other<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:11.039> way<00:02:11.220> people<00:02:11.519> eat

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
as each other and that way people eat

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.850 
as each other and that way people eat
x-mas<00:02:12.870> kill<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.170> play<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.409> game<00:02:13.560> which<00:02:13.739> is

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
x-mas kill to play the game which is

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.710 
x-mas kill to play the game which is
cool<00:02:14.099> but<00:02:14.519> at<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.700> same<00:02:14.819> time<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.299> just

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
cool but at the same time it just

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.539 
cool but at the same time it just
doesn't<00:02:16.049> fit<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.349> what<00:02:16.590> Call<00:02:16.799> of<00:02:16.830> Duty's<00:02:17.250> Call

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
doesn't fit in what Call of Duty's Call

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.399 
doesn't fit in what Call of Duty's Call
of<00:02:17.580> Duty<00:02:17.909> isn't<00:02:18.269> about<00:02:18.450> taking<00:02:18.930> skill

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
of Duty isn't about taking skill

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.280 
of Duty isn't about taking skill
it's<00:02:19.769> more<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.010> an<00:02:20.190> arcade<00:02:20.879> shooter<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.599> I

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
it's more of an arcade shooter and I

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.869 
it's more of an arcade shooter and I
don't<00:02:22.680> know<00:02:22.920> if<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.099> really<00:02:23.220> like<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.640> or<00:02:23.730> not

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
don't know if I really like it or not

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.190 
don't know if I really like it or not
but<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> guns<00:02:24.360> are<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.540> big<00:02:24.690> change

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
but the guns are a big change

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.140 
but the guns are a big change
I'm<00:02:25.409> not<00:02:25.620> saying<00:02:25.860> which<00:02:25.980> one<00:02:26.129> I<00:02:26.160> prefer<00:02:26.310> but

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
I'm not saying which one I prefer but

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.820 
I'm not saying which one I prefer but
the<00:02:27.510> black<00:02:27.660> ops<00:02:27.810> 2<00:02:27.959> can<00:02:28.170> seem<00:02:28.379> a<00:02:28.470> lot<00:02:28.590> worse

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
the black ops 2 can seem a lot worse

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.770 
the black ops 2 can seem a lot worse
than<00:02:29.129> some<00:02:29.849> of<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.030> ones<00:02:30.180> in<00:02:30.420> modern<00:02:30.660> warfare

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
than some of the ones in modern warfare

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.750 
than some of the ones in modern warfare
3<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.319> at<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.799> big<00:02:31.950> change<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.400> can<00:02:32.430> see

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
3 and at the big change that I can see

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.520 
3 and at the big change that I can see
is<00:02:32.940> like<00:02:33.180> compensation<00:02:33.930> now<00:02:33.989> this<00:02:34.140> is<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.290> weird

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
is like compensation now this is a weird

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.410 
is like compensation now this is a weird
one<00:02:34.709> because<00:02:35.000> people<00:02:36.000> are<00:02:36.090> saying<00:02:36.239> there's

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
one because people are saying there's

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.940 
one because people are saying there's
loads<00:02:36.599> of<00:02:36.660> like<00:02:36.810> comp<00:02:37.049> in<00:02:37.200> black<00:02:37.349> ops<00:02:37.530> 2<00:02:37.739> I

loads of like comp in black ops 2 I

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.860 
loads of like comp in black ops 2 I
don't<00:02:38.579> feel<00:02:38.909> it<00:02:39.060> maybe<00:02:39.390> it's<00:02:39.569> because<00:02:39.690> I've

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
don't feel it maybe it's because I've

most<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.799> time<00:02:52.980> I'm<00:02:53.220> hosts<00:02:53.519> if<00:02:53.760> there's<00:02:54.000> a

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
most of the time I'm hosts if there's a

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.849 
most of the time I'm hosts if there's a
host<00:02:54.239> migration<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:55.319> he's<00:02:55.440> picking<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.769> new

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
host migration and he's picking a new

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.890 
host migration and he's picking a new
host<00:02:56.099> chances<00:02:56.670> are<00:02:56.879> it's<00:02:57.390> going<00:02:57.599> to<00:02:57.690> be<00:02:57.750> made

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
host chances are it's going to be made

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.330 
host chances are it's going to be made
it's<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.140> new<00:02:58.260> host<00:02:58.470> because<00:02:58.829> my<00:02:58.950> connection

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
it's the new host because my connection

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.710 
it's the new host because my connection
is<00:02:59.430> pretty<00:02:59.640> good<00:02:59.849> so<00:03:00.060> maybe<00:03:00.269> it's<00:03:00.420> because<00:03:00.540> of

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
is pretty good so maybe it's because of

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.210 
is pretty good so maybe it's because of
that<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:00.870> don't<00:03:01.109> feel<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.290> like<00:03:01.500> compensation

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
that I don't feel the like compensation

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.190 
that I don't feel the like compensation
