00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
straight onto the sims 4 things I was

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.029 
straight onto the sims 4 things I was
going<00:01:40.750> to<00:01:40.960> do<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.880> here's<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.630> mod<00:01:43.869> this<00:01:44.860> is

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
going to do so here's the mod this is

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.510 
going to do so here's the mod this is
how<00:01:45.220> you<00:01:45.280> download<00:01:45.759> it<00:01:46.750> right<00:01:47.259> first<00:01:47.770> though

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
how you download it right first though

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.289 
how you download it right first though
you<00:01:48.909> will<00:01:49.060> want<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.390> probably<00:01:49.899> look<00:01:50.259> at<00:01:50.470> the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
you will want to probably look at the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.240 
you will want to probably look at the
interactions<00:01:52.299> which<00:01:52.600> are<00:01:52.869> involved<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:53.920> the

frequently asked questions and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.850 
frequently asked questions and

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.130 
definitely the issues you've got to look
at<00:02:00.009> the<00:02:00.130> issues<00:02:00.490> because<00:02:01.240> there<00:02:01.450> are<00:02:01.630> a<00:02:01.690> few

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
at the issues because there are a few

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.690 
at the issues because there are a few
issues<00:02:02.319> that<00:02:02.830> you'll<00:02:02.950> have<00:02:03.069> to<00:02:03.220> consider

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
issues that you'll have to consider

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.809 
issues that you'll have to consider
especially<00:02:04.149> you've<00:02:04.569> got<00:02:04.750> bad<00:02:04.990> computer<00:02:05.819> most

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
especially you've got bad computer most

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.900 
especially you've got bad computer most
of<00:02:07.179> them<00:02:07.390> are<00:02:07.509> just<00:02:07.659> to<00:02:08.110> do<00:02:08.259> with<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.619> game

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
of them are just to do with the game

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.570 
of them are just to do with the game
usually<00:02:09.910> you<00:02:10.030> computer<00:02:10.599> won't<00:02:10.929> crash<00:02:11.590> it's

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
usually you computer won't crash it's

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.320 
usually you computer won't crash it's
extremely<00:02:13.420> unlikely<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:14.560> it's<00:02:15.130> nothing<00:02:15.910> too

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
extremely unlikely so it's nothing too

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.240 
extremely unlikely so it's nothing too
much<00:02:16.569> to<00:02:16.840> worry<00:02:17.049> about<00:02:17.170> as<00:02:17.680> long<00:02:17.739> as<00:02:18.130> you

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
much to worry about as long as you

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.610 
much to worry about as long as you
willing<00:02:18.519> to<00:02:18.640> take<00:02:18.819> a<00:02:18.880> small<00:02:19.330> risk

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.759 

I<00:02:24.709> won't<00:02:25.400> be<00:02:25.489> downloading<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.510> because<00:02:27.019> my

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
I won't be downloading it because my

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.160 
I won't be downloading it because my
friend<00:02:28.099> doesn't<00:02:28.959> unfortunately<00:02:29.959> doesn't

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
friend doesn't unfortunately doesn't

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.940 
friend doesn't unfortunately doesn't
have<00:02:30.440> sims<00:02:30.879> so<00:02:31.879> it<00:02:32.360> would<00:02:32.599> be<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.900> bit<00:02:33.200> silly<00:02:33.590> to

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
have sims so it would be a bit silly to

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.809 
have sims so it would be a bit silly to
download<00:02:34.549> it<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.000> also<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:36.080> might<00:02:36.349> take<00:02:36.620> up

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
download it and also it might take up

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.470 
download it and also it might take up
some<00:02:37.819> time<00:02:37.849> but<00:02:38.629> anyway<00:02:39.019> so<00:02:39.610> once<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:41.239> get

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
some time but anyway so once you get

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.080 
some time but anyway so once you get
onto<00:02:41.780> these<00:02:42.560> are<00:02:42.799> the<00:02:42.890> issues<00:02:43.129> and<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:43.909> should

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
onto these are the issues and you should

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.690 
onto these are the issues and you should
look<00:02:44.269> in<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.629> chat<00:02:44.900> rooms<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.890> see<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.250> issues

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
thinking about it right and then you got

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.569 
thinking about it right and then you got
to<00:03:13.730> look<00:03:13.849> at<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.180> mods<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:15.340> then<00:03:16.340> you've<00:03:16.549> got

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
to look at the mods and then you've got

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.240 
to look at the mods and then you've got
to<00:03:16.730> think<00:03:17.120> look<00:03:17.690> at<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.930> patch<00:03:18.200> level<00:03:18.590> you

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
to think look at the patch level you

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.369 
to think look at the patch level you
need<00:03:19.459> to<00:03:19.730> know<00:03:19.879> what<00:03:20.180> patch<00:03:20.450> level<00:03:20.810> your<00:03:21.140> game

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
need to know what patch level your game

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.250 
need to know what patch level your game
is<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:22.310> make<00:03:22.730> sure<00:03:22.760> it's<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.390> right<00:03:23.540> one<00:03:23.900> and

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
is and make sure it's the right one and

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.410 
is and make sure it's the right one and
the<00:03:24.590> phrase<00:03:24.859> doesn't<00:03:25.310> really<00:03:25.670> matter<00:03:26.030> though

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
the phrase doesn't really matter though

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.409 
the phrase doesn't really matter though
so<00:03:27.109> find<00:03:27.409> that<00:03:27.859> one<00:03:28.069> older<00:03:28.760> versions<00:03:29.239> if

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
so find that one older versions if

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.629 
so find that one older versions if
you've<00:03:29.630> not<00:03:29.930> really<00:03:30.260> updated<00:03:30.680> you<00:03:30.950> game<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.489> a

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
you've not really updated you game to a

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.259 
you've not really updated you game to a
patch<00:03:31.940> level<00:03:32.440> then<00:03:33.440> I'm<00:03:33.889> gonna<00:03:34.459> go<00:03:34.760> on<00:03:35.030> this

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
wishes are for the sims 4 and like how I

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.920 
wishes are for the sims 4 and like how I
think<00:05:44.780> it<00:05:44.930> will<00:05:45.140> progress<00:05:46.270> what<00:05:47.270> I<00:05:47.300> want<00:05:47.690> for

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
think it will progress what I want for

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.440 
think it will progress what I want for
the<00:05:48.020> sims<00:05:48.290> 4<00:05:48.470> is<00:05:49.070> just<00:05:49.460> generally<00:05:50.710> more

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
the sims 4 is just generally more

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.400 
the sims 4 is just generally more
realism<00:05:53.450> and<00:05:53.960> less<00:05:55.360> EAC<00:05:56.360> they<00:05:56.479> always<00:05:56.870> seem<00:05:57.169> to

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
realism and less EAC they always seem to

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.800 
realism and less EAC they always seem to
think<00:05:57.680> that<00:05:58.070> just<00:05:58.430> because<00:05:58.580> it's<00:05:58.880> a<00:05:59.000> 12<00:05:59.300> plus

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
think that just because it's a 12 plus

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.719 
think that just because it's a 12 plus
it<00:05:59.990> has<00:06:00.140> to<00:06:00.290> be<00:06:00.410> really<00:06:00.710> appropriate<00:06:01.040> but<00:06:01.700> I

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
it has to be really appropriate but I

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.610 
it has to be really appropriate but I
could<00:06:02.060> say<00:06:02.210> it<00:06:02.300> could<00:06:02.450> be<00:06:02.570> 7<00:06:03.110> plus<00:06:03.169> at<00:06:03.560> the

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
could say it could be 7 plus at the

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.300 
could say it could be 7 plus at the
moment

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
moment

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.350 
moment
so<00:06:04.820> I<00:06:04.910> would<00:06:05.390> say<00:06:05.690> that<00:06:06.320> they<00:06:06.530> have<00:06:06.560> to<00:06:07.160> make<00:06:08.150> it

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
so I would say that they have to make it

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.070 
so I would say that they have to make it
a<00:06:08.450> bit<00:06:08.630> more<00:06:08.660> really<00:06:09.560> stick<00:06:10.130> and<00:06:11.080> more

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
a bit more really stick and more

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.930 
a bit more really stick and more
lifelike<00:06:13.000> to<00:06:14.000> be<00:06:14.150> honest<00:06:14.480> with<00:06:14.810> you<00:06:15.080> and<00:06:15.380> also

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
lifelike to be honest with you and also

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.110 
lifelike to be honest with you and also
more<00:06:16.940> things<00:06:17.840> and<00:06:18.380> also<00:06:18.650> oh<00:06:19.070> yeah<00:06:19.520> and<00:06:19.760> they

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
more things and also oh yeah and they

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.630 
more things and also oh yeah and they
need<00:06:20.330> more<00:06:20.570> life<00:06:20.870> stages<00:06:21.530> if<00:06:22.130> you<00:06:22.310> know<00:06:22.430> what<00:06:22.610> I

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
need more life stages if you know what I

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.630 
need more life stages if you know what I
