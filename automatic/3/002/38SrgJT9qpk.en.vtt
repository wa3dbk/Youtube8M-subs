00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.009
 our air in which a lot of oxygen on 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.010
 our stretch which is a little bit 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:22.390
 more than well, it seems like we would 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:25.060
 nice not quite that all she 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.009
 humans are the only creatures on earth 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.900
 who suffer from varicose veins 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.060
 varicose veins from curvature 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.670
 spinal osteochondrosis 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.340
 Moreover, man is the only species 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.860
 on the planet the female carries 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.080
 pregnancy 2 need all the rest 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.210
 living creatures bear offspring on 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.790
 fours it is much more comfortable and 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.949
 safer why then man like 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.210
 surprisingly ill-adapted from life 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.769
 on our planet 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.430
 if you even look at life 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.620
 human cake maximum pilaf life 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.920
 maximum we live in a comfortable environment 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.180
 in terms of its condition 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.070
 body health procreation 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.890
 some sort of intellectual work there 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.630
 creativity creating something recycling 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.090
 something and so on, about later 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.399
 the rest and just as it were, we wish 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.110
 we strive to extend as much as possible 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:20.130
 our biological existence at that 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.750
 while as possible other conditions 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.080
 quietly our body would allow us to live 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.840
 Well, two or three hundred years old human skin 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.390
 she reacts poorly to the sun's rays 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.729
 lying down on the beach extra 15 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.310
 here we start to become covered in painful 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.159
 blistering and literally shedding skin 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.190
 if a man appeared on earth 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.390
 then why hasn't he adapted yet 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.290
 to her terms 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.900
 but this is not all we bad swims all 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.270
 animals from birth easily kept on 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.240
 water first hitting for example in the lake 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.940
 they instinctively begin to row even 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.000
 baby easily overcome wide 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.869
 rivers to man to swim across the pond 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.090
 need to study i am another factor which 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.539
 It proves that a strange person 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.150
 these are our bones they are too fragile nor 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.320
 one living thing slipping on 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.030
 level ground does not break itself and limbs 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.810
 man to get a broken arm or 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:26.350
 legs just enough to stumble then 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.430
 that we live but roughly got it 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.739
 so average we live tablet 80 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.140
 generally speaking too paradox because 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.690
 that in principle when a person is born and 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.070
 Here develops the whole body threw very 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.709
 many many many energy opportunities 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.040
 potentially live well, at least up to a thousand 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.219
 years old 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.400
 all your time your health is not yours 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:55.670
 spend spend overcoming our 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.420
 terrestrial environment our air in which a lot 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.450
 oxygen well throughout which a little 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.120
 a little more than well 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.739
 would be nice 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.239
 pressure which means surrounds us 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.430
 thanks to our atmosphere in one 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.340
 the atmosphere there is 700 65 millimeters 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.900
 mercurial with not quite this here 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.370
 what 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.170
 there is one more argument our astronauts 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.180
 the fact is that in zero gravity with 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.909
 human body occur various 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.240
 transformation from blood is washed away 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.790
 calcium bones become brittle 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.790
 eggs work the digestive system out 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.610
 body extra fluid 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.320
 weight decreases and muscles atrophy 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.990
 however, all these changes occur 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.690
 fairly quickly and painlessly 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.380
 man adapts easily to life in 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.350
 space 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.540
 in two or three days while returning 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.500
 back to earth 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.560
 the human body is experiencing 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.470
 huge overload to adapt 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.350
 to normal earthly state 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.240
 cosmonaut needs a rehabilitation period 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.150
 lasting from a few months to 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.170
 several years 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.840
 proponents of extraterrestrial theory 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.720
 origin of mankind 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.270
 claims that this is clear evidence 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.040
 man 's land of strangers 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:19.040
 this is why some scientists consider 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.739
 that the cradle of human civilization 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.410
 could their planet mars and that's why 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.450
 Mars is in the belt of life by others 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.540
 words at the optimal distance from 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.710
 the sun and has almost the same 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.750
 astronomical parameters as the earth 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.630
 unlike our other planets 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.680
 the mars and earth have a solar system 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.260
 a magnetic field 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.530
 it protects against cosmic radiation 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.330
 similar and relief these two worlds have mountains and 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.670
 the plains of the sea ​​and the river 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.280
 the atmosphere of both planets consists of one 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:52.120
 the same gases on Mars are even 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.120
 oxygen 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.570
 from 6
