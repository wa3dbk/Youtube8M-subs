 I could live without her we have spiritual desires 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.520
 need to be personal experiential 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.730

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.159
 i a mountain generously provides me areas with enormous satisfactions 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:25.259
 in these double senses in him the initial in the experience in breathing the 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.729
 pure air running in a forest that is frozen the altar a stream 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.880
 ps fulvio a boy on the mountain was not and something innocent and candid in the 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.400
 mountain that is splendid 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.020
 and then I spend my life as a geographer studying mountains and I want 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.160
 Keep studying why you provide me with satisfactions 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.320
 intellectuals 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.570
 the culture of the mountains read the authors who have written I pass it very 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.880
 good with those books 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.940
 he surrounded me with his libraries that talk about mountains when I can not be more 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.950
 mountains 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.330
 memories 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.200
 maybe it's that the mountains according to a study the limit many the poster 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.230
 limits not only your own limit but 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.350
 to the limit of your world does not limit 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.460
 the material and the stereos of the stay and grenade 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.280
 what we are and the emptiness 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.420
 that in the mountain of when 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.410
 at a certain moment 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.940
 where you think maturity I think it's something that what is not left 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.350
 they decide all their lives but a first time when three since these in 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.070
 entering that maturity 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.730
 suppose a 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.240
 a test I was not 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.490
 is one is a means to relate depth with yourself the background me to the mountain 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.580
 I went to know her better that way 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.840
 from the mountains I will tereré the inner mountain that always found first 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.320
 He mentioned the one that is maybe later, with luck he has sent me 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.960
 to that list that yearned not but there is but what more means and look 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.060
 inward 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.210
 the silence 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.800
 is formed in the middle of the roar 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.460
 discuss the wind that hits your sides without fatigue 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.550
 the rumor of the avalanches that fall 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.080
 the abyss is just the frame the limit of the sheet 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.569
 and the effort and loneliness of climbing 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.939
 it's not so much a way to delve into the rough nature of the mountain 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.369
 as a way of looking inside 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.899
 after recognizing our limitations 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:22.359
 to learn to be humble and / or coffees at the same time 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.369
 e with your example and these of the public and so on 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.929
 acp their responsible 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:33.599
 for his mastery of the idea of ​​what 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.179
 who wants to see mountain people a single gesture psoe another side 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:38.610
 Nestor civilization 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.610
 I think that more problems of Yanbian of humanity is that he has lost 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:46.290
 forward accident has lost contact with nature I believe that 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.589
 that man has lived millions of years in nature carries these 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:51.269
 last minutes 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.759
 seeing it cities 

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:57.519
 I think that atavistic power was imposed to sow having cut with that or is 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:58.839
 tremendous 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:02.289
 It is the last redoubt where men 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:06.489
 he will be able to find the still with great satisfaction high level 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:12.829
 the moral relationship with the land does not and connection of extinction to the 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.129
 great landscapes only remain on the mountain high miyagi 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.279
 so it is in those high mountains above all 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:24.379
 non of that must be left 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.819
 live the concert of nature and therefore without noise without bathroom without 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.199
 transformation without disfigurement what is there is splendid enough 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:35.929
 and hamas we do not need to change at all 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:38.929
 as to remain 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:55.109
 eye 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.639
 that is why the great pilots with their celebrated summits seem to get up 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.639
 to infinity very good music of those who are buried 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.259
 entered in addition tve state 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:12.289
 I duel the fragrant breath of the pines 

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:14.210
 and when all that fades 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.330
 0 another cortege of thought was presented 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:23.969
 Memories of a month that were correct in several months and 12 years uu there 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:26.969
 you would choose too big to be described with words 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.620
 and there pains 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.620
 oo about which I do not dare to extend 

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:40.089
 nothing flattering 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.479
 federer 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.979
 the soul to another 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.349
 the army to 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:23.270
 for the anchovy 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:38.909
