00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
that i'm not sure the exact number but

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.469 
that i'm not sure the exact number but
this<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.409> definitely<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:14.070> really<00:01:14.280> fun<00:01:14.700> game<00:01:14.880> so

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
this is definitely a really fun game so

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.510 
this is definitely a really fun game so
what<00:01:15.659> you're<00:01:15.810> doing<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.140> you're<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.250> race

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
game but this race game is a little bit

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.649 
game but this race game is a little bit
different<00:01:20.009> once<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.970> get<00:01:21.090> enough<00:01:21.360> points

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
different once you get enough points

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.179 
different once you get enough points
from<00:01:21.900> drifting<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.560> different<00:01:22.920> things<00:01:22.950> like

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
from drifting and different things like

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.510 
from drifting and different things like
that<00:01:23.720> you<00:01:24.720> actually<00:01:24.900> get<00:01:25.409> enough<00:01:25.830> points<00:01:26.130> and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
that you actually get enough points and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.280 
that you actually get enough points and
then<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:26.909> demolish<00:01:27.330> things<00:01:27.750> ahead<00:01:28.020> of

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
then you can demolish things ahead of

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.260 
then you can demolish things ahead of
you<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.280> your<00:01:29.460> partner<00:01:29.850> not<00:01:30.240> your

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
you so that your partner not your

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.780 
you so that your partner not your
partner's<00:01:30.750> but<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.770> other<00:01:32.220> people<00:01:32.579> that

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
partner's but the other people that

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.390 
partner's but the other people that
you're<00:01:32.909> racing<00:01:33.329> against<00:01:33.780> get<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.409> blown<00:01:35.220> up

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
you're racing against get like blown up

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.859 
you're racing against get like blown up
almost<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.880> could<00:01:36.060> break<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> roof<00:01:36.659> and

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
almost so you could break a roof and

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.810 
almost so you could break a roof and
then<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.670> falls<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.509> cars<00:01:39.720> ahead<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:40.020> you

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
then it falls on the cars ahead of you

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.030 
then it falls on the cars ahead of you
so<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:41.970> game<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.360> fairly<00:01:43.290> hard<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.710> get<00:01:43.829> used

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
so this game is fairly hard to get used

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.850 
so this game is fairly hard to get used
to<00:01:44.220> them<00:01:44.369> I'm<00:01:44.759> not<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.329> good<00:01:45.630> at<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.860> it's

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
to them I'm not that good at it it's

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.910 
to them I'm not that good at it it's
pretty<00:01:47.100> hard<00:01:47.250> for<00:01:47.340> me<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.700> play<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.920> right

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
pretty hard for me to play on the right

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.780 
pretty hard for me to play on the right
here<00:01:50.100> because<00:01:50.189> i'm<00:01:50.340> looking<00:01:50.460> through<00:01:50.729> a

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
here because i'm looking through a

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.840 
here because i'm looking through a
little<00:01:51.180> screen<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.110> my<00:01:52.140> camera<00:01:52.399> so<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:53.549> hard

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
