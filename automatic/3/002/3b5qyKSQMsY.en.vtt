on so my question is would you think
will<00:03:22.709> be<00:03:22.739> in<00:03:22.980> that<00:03:23.130> time<00:03:23.370> like<00:03:23.610> do<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:23.940> think

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
will be in that time like do you think

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.390 
will be in that time like do you think
we<00:03:24.239> would<00:03:24.390> have<00:03:24.420> cured<00:03:25.380> hunger<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.040> poverty

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
we would have cured hunger and poverty

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.310 
we would have cured hunger and poverty
and<00:03:26.550> we<00:03:27.000> had<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.120> more<00:03:27.390> educated<00:03:27.630> advanced

that's<00:03:55.640> that's<00:03:55.849> kind<00:03:56.000> of<00:03:56.030> my<00:03:56.120> question

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
that's that's kind of my question

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.360 
that's that's kind of my question
because<00:03:56.720> if<00:03:57.230> you<00:03:57.319> think<00:03:57.379> about<00:03:57.560> it<00:03:57.709> with<00:03:58.190> our

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
because if you think about it with our

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.170 
because if you think about it with our
current<00:03:58.720> world<00:03:59.720> I<00:04:00.080> mean<00:04:00.379> I<00:04:00.730> really<00:04:01.730> see<00:04:02.030> two

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
current world I mean I really see two

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.089 
current world I mean I really see two
different<00:04:02.299> possibilities<00:04:03.049> like<00:04:03.620> on<00:04:03.829> the<00:04:03.920> one

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
different possibilities like on the one

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.360 
different possibilities like on the one
hand<00:04:04.250> you<00:04:04.579> can<00:04:04.879> easily<00:04:05.180> see<00:04:05.390> how<00:04:05.720> in<00:04:06.019> 60<00:04:06.890> or<00:04:07.010> 100

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
hand you can easily see how in 60 or 100

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.890 
hand you can easily see how in 60 or 100
years<00:04:07.579> not<00:04:07.909> much<00:04:08.090> could<00:04:08.390> it<00:04:08.420> could<00:04:08.690> change

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
years not much could it could change

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.649 
years not much could it could change
like<00:04:09.290> I<00:04:09.650> was<00:04:10.310> still<00:04:10.610> hold<00:04:11.060> on<00:04:11.209> to<00:04:11.390> their

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
like I was still hold on to their

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.990 
like I was still hold on to their
personal<00:04:12.110> believes<00:04:12.590> their<00:04:13.000> personal

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
personal believes their personal

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.940

know<00:04:16.070> something<00:04:16.669> to<00:04:16.880> light<00:04:17.359> which<00:04:17.600> i<00:04:17.750> think<00:04:17.810> is

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
know something to light which i think is

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.370 
know something to light which i think is
key<00:04:18.290> by<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.560> way<00:04:19.419> no<00:04:20.419> one<00:04:20.600> would<00:04:20.690> I<00:04:20.900> guess<00:04:21.139> care

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
key by the way no one would I guess care

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.620 
key by the way no one would I guess care
about<00:04:21.620> don't<00:04:22.220> worry<00:04:22.400> for<00:04:22.669> the<00:04:22.760> society<00:04:23.090> and<00:04:23.479> we

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
about don't worry for the society and we

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.150 
about don't worry for the society and we
won't<00:04:23.780> just<00:04:24.080> be<00:04:24.199> a<00:04:24.350> slightly<00:04:24.650> more<00:04:24.919> advanced

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
won't just be a slightly more advanced

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.850 
won't just be a slightly more advanced
version<00:04:25.520> of<00:04:25.610> ourselves<00:04:25.729> that<00:04:26.300> little<00:04:26.990> time

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
version of ourselves that little time

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.060 
version of ourselves that little time
you<00:04:27.889> know<00:04:28.840> onwards<00:04:29.840> but<00:04:30.620> then<00:04:30.710> go<00:04:30.800> get<00:04:30.979> her

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
you know onwards but then go get her

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.620 
you know onwards but then go get her
hand<00:04:31.280> there's<00:04:31.820> also<00:04:32.030> that<00:04:32.210> possibility

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
hand there's also that possibility

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.050 
hand there's also that possibility
though<00:04:33.020> I<00:04:33.650> know<00:04:33.949> whether<00:04:34.310> through<00:04:34.669> something

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
though I know whether through something

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.760 
though I know whether through something
big<00:04:35.300> or<00:04:37.210> just<00:04:38.210> gradually<00:04:38.780> over<00:04:38.960> time<00:04:39.080> we<00:04:39.590> could

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
big or just gradually over time we could

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.580 
big or just gradually over time we could
actually<00:04:39.979> develop<00:04:40.490> into<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:42.110> universal

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
actually develop into the universal

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.920 
actually develop into the universal
society<00:04:43.010> where<00:04:43.250> we<00:04:43.820> actually<00:04:43.940> don't<00:04:44.330> try<00:04:44.870> to

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
society where we actually don't try to

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.020 
society where we actually don't try to
kill<00:04:45.169> each<00:04:45.199> other<00:04:45.410> anymore<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:46.100> we<00:04:46.669> only<00:04:46.820> do

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
kill each other anymore and we only do

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.320 
kill each other anymore and we only do
so<00:04:47.240> in<00:04:47.860> computer<00:04:48.860> games<00:04:49.039> or<00:04:49.370> I<00:04:49.669> don't<00:04:49.850> know<00:04:49.910> 3d

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
so in computer games or I don't know 3d

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.860 
so in computer games or I don't know 3d
simulations<00:04:51.200> of<00:04:51.620> the<00:04:51.740> time<00:04:51.950> Black<00:04:52.130> I<00:04:52.630> don't<00:04:53.630> I

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
simulations of the time Black I don't I

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.170 
simulations of the time Black I don't I
mean<00:04:54.139> if<00:04:55.130> you<00:04:55.280> look<00:04:55.430> at<00:04:55.520> it<00:04:55.550> objectively<00:04:55.669> I

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
mean if you look at it objectively I

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.170 
mean if you look at it objectively I
think<00:04:56.419> we<00:04:57.320> have<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:57.919> potential<00:04:58.220> to<00:04:58.400> get<00:04:59.000> to

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
think we have the potential to get to

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.420 
think we have the potential to get to
either<00:04:59.270> side<00:04:59.599> but<00:04:59.930> oh<00:05:00.229> what<00:05:01.070> do<00:05:01.160> you<00:05:01.190> think

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
either side but oh what do you think

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.350 
either side but oh what do you think
what<00:05:02.090> do<00:05:02.180> you<00:05:02.240> think<00:05:02.270> will<00:05:02.510> go<00:05:03.610> I<00:05:04.610> don't<00:05:05.270> so

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
what do you think will go I don't so

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.330 
what do you think will go I don't so
heavy<00:05:05.539> question<00:05:05.900> but<00:05:06.080> anyway<00:05:06.470> think<00:05:07.130> it<00:05:07.250> over

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
heavy question but anyway think it over

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.190 
heavy question but anyway think it over
