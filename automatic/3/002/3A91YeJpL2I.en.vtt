the<00:01:52.290> motherboard<00:01:52.770> i<00:01:52.829> got<00:01:52.979> an<00:01:53.130> asus<00:01:53.960> z87<00:01:54.960> board

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the motherboard i got an asus z87 board

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.429 
the motherboard i got an asus z87 board
and<00:01:55.560> kenneth<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:56.460> not<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> poor<00:01:56.909> night<00:01:57.030> is

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
and kenneth it's not a poor night is

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:04.850 
and kenneth it's not a poor night is
1387<00:01:58.439> um<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:59.670> has<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:01.670> DVI<00:02:02.670> vga<00:02:03.360> hdmi<00:02:03.860> wsp

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
1387 um it has a DVI vga hdmi wsp

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.660 
1387 um it has a DVI vga hdmi wsp
three-point<00:02:05.850> oh<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.119> then<00:02:06.270> I've<00:02:06.450> got<00:02:06.479> some

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
three-point oh and then I've got some

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.710 
three-point oh and then I've got some
I've<00:02:08.670> got<00:02:08.789> some<00:02:08.940> things<00:02:08.970> plugged<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.450> here<00:02:09.569> and

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
I've got some things plugged in here and

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.600 
I've got some things plugged in here and
this<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:10.140> basically<00:02:10.379> goes<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.099> front

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
this this basically goes to the front

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.200 
this this basically goes to the front
so<00:02:11.790> these<00:02:12.150> are<00:02:12.530> USB<00:02:13.530> 3<00:02:13.890> points<00:02:14.250> when<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.850> front

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
so these are USB 3 points when the front

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.900 
so these are USB 3 points when the front
is<00:02:15.330> just<00:02:15.570> easier<00:02:15.960> to<00:02:16.200> wire<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.220> through<00:02:17.730> the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
is just easier to wire it through the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.720 
is just easier to wire it through the
computer<00:02:18.000> rather<00:02:18.420> than<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:19.050> know<00:02:19.170> um<00:02:19.730> wiring

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
computer rather than you know um wiring

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.630 
computer rather than you know um wiring
it<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.690> whole<00:02:21.840> way<00:02:21.870> inside<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.040> eps<00:02:23.370> i<00:02:23.490> make

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
it the whole way inside of it eps i make

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.010 
it the whole way inside of it eps i make
sense<00:02:23.670> i'm<00:02:24.030> just<00:02:24.150> being<00:02:24.360> all<00:02:24.450> nonsense<00:02:24.870> here

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
sense i'm just being all nonsense here

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:32.210 
sense i'm just being all nonsense here
uh<00:02:27.290> this<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.850> gtx<00:02:29.850> 980<00:02:30.540> i<00:02:30.860> was<00:02:31.860> going<00:02:31.980> for<00:02:32.130> a

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
uh this is the gtx 980 i was going for a

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.100 
uh this is the gtx 980 i was going for a
970<00:02:32.790> but<00:02:32.940> ended<00:02:33.210> up<00:02:33.240> going<00:02:33.480> for<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.690> nanny<00:02:33.870> d

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
970 but ended up going for the nanny d

970 but ended up going for the nanny d
um<00:02:34.850> pretty<00:02:35.850> cool<00:02:36.170> this<00:02:37.170> DVI<00:02:37.560> port<00:02:37.920> there<00:02:38.100> some

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
um pretty cool this DVI port there some

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.720 
um pretty cool this DVI port there some
hdmi<00:02:39.360> stuff<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:40.310> yeah<00:02:41.310> we're<00:02:41.550> looking

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
hdmi stuff and yeah we're looking

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.550 
hdmi stuff and yeah we're looking
forward<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:41.970> check<00:02:42.150> about<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:42.690> then<00:02:43.230> i<00:02:43.410> got

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
forward to check about it and then i got

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.720 
forward to check about it and then i got
a<00:02:43.700> RM<00:02:45.920> 550<00:02:47.180> 550<00:02:48.180> watts<00:02:48.680> old<00:02:49.680> edition<00:02:50.010> just<00:02:50.190> make

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
a RM 550 550 watts old edition just make

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.870 
a RM 550 550 watts old edition just make
a<00:02:50.760> little<00:02:50.970> bit<00:02:51.300> quieter<00:02:51.989> ah<00:02:52.580> probably<00:02:53.580> asking

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
a little bit quieter ah probably asking

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.420 
a little bit quieter ah probably asking
y<00:02:54.000> 1<00:02:54.150> 45<00:02:54.450> 50<00:02:54.780> not<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.410> higher<00:02:55.620> power<00:02:55.890> supply<00:02:56.190> it's

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
y 1 45 50 not a higher power supply it's

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.949 
y 1 45 50 not a higher power supply it's
just<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.760> system<00:02:57.090> doesn't<00:02:57.300> use<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.750> much

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
just the system doesn't use that much

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.740 
just the system doesn't use that much
and<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.530> really<00:02:58.560> see<00:02:59.010> no<00:02:59.040> need<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.790> upgrade<00:03:00.570> your

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
and I really see no need to upgrade your

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.400 
and I really see no need to upgrade your
PSU<00:03:01.350> unless<00:03:01.680> you're<00:03:01.920> as<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.100> wine<00:03:02.400> uh<00:03:03.080> two<00:03:04.080> cards

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
PSU unless you're as a wine uh two cards

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
PSU unless you're as a wine uh two cards
together<00:03:04.530> which<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:04.950> won't<00:03:05.160> be<00:03:05.280> I'm<00:03:05.400> just

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
together which I won't be I'm just

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.420 
together which I won't be I'm just
running<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.850> 980<00:03:06.239> by<00:03:06.780> itself<00:03:07.080> so<00:03:07.410> that's<00:03:07.650> the

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
running a 980 by itself so that's the

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.790 
running a 980 by itself so that's the
back<00:03:08.640> let's<00:03:09.420> open<00:03:09.959> up<00:03:10.050> inside<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.470> check<00:03:10.650> out

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
back let's open up inside and check out

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.050 
back let's open up inside and check out
they're<00:03:10.950> not<00:03:13.520> all<00:03:14.520> that<00:03:14.580> I'm<00:03:14.760> just<00:03:14.880> going<00:03:15.030> to

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
they're not all that I'm just going to

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:24.130 
they're not all that I'm just going to
open<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.330> up<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:16.220> I'm<00:03:17.220> gonna<00:03:17.340> check<00:03:17.580> that

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.170 

there<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.230> is<00:03:25.459> inside<00:03:27.170> so<00:03:28.170> this<00:03:28.380> is<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:29.180> the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
there it is inside so this is a the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.699 
there it is inside so this is a the
motherboard<00:03:30.630> again<00:03:30.959> as<00:03:31.049> i<00:03:31.140> was<00:03:31.290> talking<00:03:31.620> about

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
motherboard again as i was talking about

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.539 
motherboard again as i was talking about
i<00:03:31.890> ended<00:03:32.220> up<00:03:32.280> going<00:03:32.430> for<00:03:32.850> um<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:34.549> water-cooling

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
i ended up going for um a water-cooling

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.380 
i ended up going for um a water-cooling
on<00:03:36.360> there<00:03:37.140> so<00:03:37.830> that's<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.100> custom<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.820> but<00:03:39.299> it's

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
on there so that's the custom I but it's

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.979 
on there so that's the custom I but it's
a<00:03:39.450> coarser<00:03:41.150> c110<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:42.420> water<00:03:43.350> cooling<00:03:43.769> system

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
a coarser c110 I water cooling system

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.199 
a coarser c110 I water cooling system
it's<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.110> custom<00:03:46.440> one<00:03:46.470> thats<00:03:47.280> can<00:03:47.580> modify<00:03:48.060> I

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
it's a custom one thats can modify I

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.390 
it's a custom one thats can modify I
think<00:03:48.630> so<00:03:48.900> that's<00:03:49.530> why<00:03:49.680> they<00:03:49.830> have<00:03:49.860> their<00:03:50.130> logo

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
think so that's why they have their logo

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.500 
think so that's why they have their logo
on<00:03:50.580> there<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:51.000> man<00:03:51.570> ah<00:03:52.940> it<00:03:53.940> looks<00:03:54.030> pretty<00:03:54.299> cool

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
on there a man ah it looks pretty cool

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.940 
on there a man ah it looks pretty cool
looks<00:03:54.690> bigger<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.019> mean<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.200> managed<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:55.590> go<00:03:55.739> for

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
looks bigger I mean I managed to go for

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.110 
looks bigger I mean I managed to go for
the<00:03:56.510> 16<00:03:57.510> gig<00:03:57.750> round<00:03:58.350> this<00:03:58.500> time<00:03:58.820> you<00:03:59.820> can<00:03:59.940> see

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
the 16 gig round this time you can see

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.030 
the 16 gig round this time you can see
that<00:04:00.170> you<00:04:01.170> can't<00:04:01.290> really<00:04:01.380> seem<00:04:01.560> pass<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.890> wire

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
that you can't really seem pass the wire

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.890 
that you can't really seem pass the wire
there<00:04:02.250> but<00:04:02.459> there's<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.330> eat<00:04:03.630> gig<00:04:05.299> ram<00:04:06.299> ram

there but there's to eat gig ram ram

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.479 
there but there's to eat gig ram ram
cards<00:04:07.320> chips<00:04:07.560> in<00:04:07.739> there<00:04:07.890> everyone<00:04:08.100> go<00:04:08.220> I<00:04:08.250> don't

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
cards chips in there everyone go I don't
