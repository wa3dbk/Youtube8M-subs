00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
and again so we did about actually

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.690 
and again so we did about actually
number<00:02:33.709> two<00:02:33.739> read<00:02:34.069> through<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.280> bottom<00:02:34.520> here

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
number two read through the bottom here

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.759 
number two read through the bottom here
a<00:02:34.849> number<00:02:35.239> three<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:35.959> a<00:02:36.200> half<00:02:36.380> right<00:02:36.680> in

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
a number three and a half right in

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.199 
a number three and a half right in
through<00:02:36.920> here<00:02:37.190> now<00:02:37.670> all<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:37.910> way<00:02:37.970> throughout

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
through here now all the way throughout

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.490 
the back and then we worked it in so to
over<00:02:40.220> comb<00:02:40.459> to<00:02:40.640> blend<00:02:40.849> it<00:02:40.970> in<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.300> now<00:02:42.170> we<00:02:42.230> have

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
over comb to blend it in and now we have

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.860 
over comb to blend it in and now we have
the<00:02:42.739> side<00:02:42.980> part<00:02:43.280> here<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:44.209> front<00:02:44.540> here<00:02:44.720> the

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
the side part here the front here the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.380 
the side part here the front here the
top<00:02:45.080> is<00:02:45.230> probably<00:02:45.560> about<00:02:45.709> I'd<00:02:46.400> say<00:02:46.489> three<00:02:46.910> and

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
top is probably about I'd say three and

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.000 
top is probably about I'd say three and
a<00:02:47.420> half<00:02:47.569> inches<00:02:48.050> in<00:02:48.200> length<00:02:48.530> right<00:02:48.860> in<00:02:48.950> the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
a half inches in length right in the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.520 
a half inches in length right in the
front<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.430> then<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:49.819> goes<00:02:49.970> back<00:02:50.450> up<00:02:50.750> shorter

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
front and then it goes back up shorter

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.720 
front and then it goes back up shorter
in<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.680> back<00:02:51.739> starting<00:02:52.310> at<00:02:52.400> probably<00:02:52.610> about

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
in the back starting at probably about

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.150 
in the back starting at probably about
an<00:02:52.970> inch<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.480> half<00:02:53.560> blending<00:02:54.560> in<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:55.010> where

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
an inch and a half blending in to where

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.500 
an inch and a half blending in to where
this<00:02:55.310> is<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.580> longest<00:02:55.850> point<00:02:56.060> in<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.330> front

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
this is the longest point in the front

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.120
