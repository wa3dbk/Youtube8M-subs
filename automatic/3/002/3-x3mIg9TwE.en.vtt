00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.960
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.519
 new cultivation xing on toews german 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.500
 Today we pack once again 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:49.250
 playstation 3 game and indeed 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.760
 dragging the battle on set or dragon 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.159
 where you have the means to go, yes, the people 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.970
 This is how it sounds but for me 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:02.449
 was and is forever dragon 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.110
 Bose so yes the game is already one 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.850
 a bit older 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.649
 I'm not going to release myself then 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.979
 bought as me in principle, not to 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.440
 expensive 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:17.110
 it has so much cost as each new ps3 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.970
 play but I was so disappointed by the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:24.380
 last dragon board game ultimate 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.160
 tenkaichi and yes I wanted to have one 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.140
 little hope in the 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.300
 counterexamples lost now it is a 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.850
 a bit cheaper because I wanted marisk 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.820
 but mainly there are and there 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.399
 I finally got that yesterday 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.759
 watched the latest movie 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:45.020
 dragonball z battle of god and yes the 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:48.110
 I actually liked it a lot 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.550
 for me but rather a very long special 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.069
 I would not have it as a movie 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.009
 describe 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:57.830
 It was a very long special episode so 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.599
 expresses now and yes for it found 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.670
 I'm quite good at filming now 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:03.920
 not so great 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.959
 yes but as I said movie I liked 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.060
 and that's why I did not want to 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:10.480
 also try under game and yes 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.260
 I am particularly keen on times as 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.590
 picture to play 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.940
 he came over to me in the movie very cool and 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.640
 even his servant of whom I am now 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.560
 forgot the name you can play 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.629
 although the film did not fight at all 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.390
 I'm curious what he was there 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.790
 have come up with ideas 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.090
 and yes what else is worth mentioning 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.400
 In the game you can play there 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.730
 sonko then the costume of naruto 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.750
 put on a costume or from a costume 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.500
 series 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.500
 I can just do it here 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:56.120
 autofocus wants now so I can 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.090
 me with naruto not me at all 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.290
 I'm not a fan of the series 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.030
 I do not know if it's a costume of 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.040
 Naruto is himself or another 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.420
 character 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.700
 this could be like my comments to 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:15.430
 say 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:18.680
 and yes , that's a nice touch and in 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.610
 There was one of the last naruto games 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.470
 then in exchange for a naruto a costume 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.630
 from sangoma so these turtles 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.940
 Suit does not have to be from san rocco 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.940
 you can also be green or dongguan 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.880
 But now we are packing out of it 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:56.540
 make the film and then look 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:57.860
 we also cover the envelope 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.990
 I like it quite well 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.830
 the only thing I do not like 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.900
 is that here in this set is just 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.240
 exactly the same picture of songbook in it 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.580
 like here 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:16.220
 since this is because God and 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.799
 but I like it very much and 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.569
 on the back we still have 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:24.050
 the features of the game a bit 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:26.389
 explain games for the first time by boku 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.930
 as a superstar in god and above all 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:32.449
 also play first for the first time 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.160
 as is then possible to his character 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.370
 adapt again then there is somehow 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.860
 such a gear key system has with the key 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.110
 to do 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.580
 and yes that 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.860
 noteworthy about this game is that 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.749
 one now with four characters in the team 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.269
 So fight like it already here 

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:53.519
 one can now describe one 

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:54.379
 battle with a total of eight characters 

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:56.789
 do 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:05:00.169
 and yes there is a lot going on there 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:02.699
 battlefield and there will be again 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.050
 Giant endbosses but thats not 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:09.949
 definitely something new that already exists 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.949
 longer time characters are also some 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:16.050
 and yes, I'll just leave me 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:17.759
 surprise your game language so 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.860
 the texts are all in German but the 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.959
 Synchronization can be either on 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.279
 make Japanese or in English and 

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:24.719
 I watch the film in Japanese 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.569
 I'll watch the game too 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:32.699
 to play in Japanese 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:38.069
 and yes, now what you do at once 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:40.499
 the louis has a different cover than that 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.300
 game itself, I find very nice and 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:45.800
 Now I'm just looking for these dlc 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.800
 for the new costume 

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:52.909
 I'll show you that quickly covered 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.730
 yes, even if you start with naruto nothing 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.350
 can 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:07.460
 the costume I would me then no 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:11.000
 download here is something you are 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.889
 on a certain one is the side 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.190
 there is not over there 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:19.520
 Playstation store just has to be there 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:22.190
 I'll have a look here 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.110
 still the game manual has now 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.970
 itself chamber again but so how 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:30.190
 the cover because that does not matter 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.190
 and yes she is even reasonably fat 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:37.280
 but in black and white but it is not 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:42.680
 so bad so and she apparently has 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:47.690
 all 14 pages was there but I am 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:49.010
 Now a bit surprised if you can 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.200
 it's not that fast 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:54.220
 a lot, but always nice 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.220
 to have learned how to 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:03.919
 I'm looking forward to the game 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:05.360
 I do not expect that much, yes 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:06.889
 I have already stopped at some places 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.919
 heard that the game is not so 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:11.990
 should be bringer 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:16.789
 yes and as I said the ultimate tenkaichi 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:18.200
 I found it very simple and here 

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:20.000
 I just let myself be surprised 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.280
 I'll go with the lowest one 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.240
 expectant attitude and then you can 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.289
 yes not to be very disappointed 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.630
 yes but that was it for now now 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:30.260
 from unboxing i hope it has you 

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.360
 like 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.210
 and yes, have a look anyway 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.410
 the dragonboat movie on battle of gods 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.390
 he is really cool 

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:41.990
 Well and then I say 

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.990
 and look
