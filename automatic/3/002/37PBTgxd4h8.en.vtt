properly instead of having more then I

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.710 
properly instead of having more then I

think there's something is something
wrong<00:06:38.900> upstairs<00:06:39.550> and<00:06:40.550> I'm<00:06:40.790> not<00:06:40.970> trying<00:06:41.150> to

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
wrong upstairs and I'm not trying to

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.550 
wrong upstairs and I'm not trying to
belittle<00:06:41.450> or<00:06:41.810> I<00:06:41.840> just<00:06:42.110> think<00:06:42.290> that's<00:06:42.470> the

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
belittle or I just think that's the

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.480 
belittle or I just think that's the
truth<00:06:42.740> I<00:06:42.830> think<00:06:42.860> there's<00:06:43.160> something<00:06:43.340> wrong

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
truth I think there's something wrong

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.330 
truth I think there's something wrong
like<00:06:43.820> she<00:06:44.030> needs<00:06:44.360> attention<00:06:45.320> that's<00:06:46.190> what

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
like she needs attention that's what

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.220 
like she needs attention that's what
this<00:06:46.460> all<00:06:46.760> is<00:06:47.120> I<00:06:47.180> think<00:06:47.450> it's<00:06:47.810> a<00:06:47.930> cry<00:06:48.200> for

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.230 
this all is I think it's a cry for

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.130 
this all is I think it's a cry for
attention<00:06:49.000> she<00:06:50.000> wants<00:06:50.240> to<00:06:50.360> be<00:06:50.510> the<00:06:50.690> center<00:06:50.930> of

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.140 
attention she wants to be the center of

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.950 
attention she wants to be the center of
attention<00:06:51.350> I<00:06:52.070> think<00:06:52.910> what<00:06:53.030> she's<00:06:53.210> doing<00:06:53.240> is

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
attention I think what she's doing is

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.720 
attention I think what she's doing is
going<00:06:54.200> to<00:06:54.380> have<00:06:54.530> a<00:06:54.560> harmful<00:06:54.920> effect<00:06:55.460> on<00:06:55.610> her

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:55.730 
going to have a harmful effect on her

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.940 
going to have a harmful effect on her
kids<00:06:56.030> and<00:06:56.720> obviously<00:06:57.170> I'm<00:06:57.320> not<00:06:57.350> the<00:06:57.680> only<00:06:57.830> one

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:57.950 
kids and obviously I'm not the only one

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.160
