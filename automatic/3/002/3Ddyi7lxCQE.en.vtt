 if they don't attack each other then 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:15.110
 chips just stay standing next then 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.600
 one step at a time they make armies 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.180
 may cross the sea or even a few 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.580
 the seas with a convoy of ships
