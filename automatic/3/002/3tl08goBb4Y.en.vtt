00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.799 
and I'm going to add to that 175 grams
of<00:00:54.399> caster<00:00:54.609> sugar<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.850> easiest<00:00:58.269> to<00:00:58.479> do<00:00:58.629> this

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
of caster sugar it's easiest to do this

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.779 
of caster sugar it's easiest to do this
if<00:00:59.019> you<00:00:59.140> have<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.350> tabletop<00:00:59.979> mixer<00:01:00.189> because<00:01:00.609> it

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
if you have a tabletop mixer because it

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.729 
if you have a tabletop mixer because it
takes<00:01:01.059> about<00:01:01.239> five<00:01:01.689> to<00:01:01.719> seven<00:01:02.109> minutes<00:01:02.379> to

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
takes about five to seven minutes to

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.380 
takes about five to seven minutes to
whisk<00:01:02.920> it<00:01:03.100> up<00:01:03.250> until<00:01:03.640> it's<00:01:03.789> at<00:01:03.909> full<00:01:04.089> volume

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
whisk it up until it's at full volume

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.240 
whisk it up until it's at full volume
but<00:01:04.989> if<00:01:05.080> you<00:01:05.170> don't<00:01:05.379> have<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.590> mixer<00:01:06.039> like<00:01:06.189> this

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
but if you don't have a mixer like this

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.120 
but if you don't have a mixer like this
what<00:01:07.000> you<00:01:07.119> can<00:01:07.360> do<00:01:07.600> is<00:01:07.869> put<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.229> bowl<00:01:08.530> over<00:01:08.799> a<00:01:09.070> pan

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
what you can do is put a bowl over a pan

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.550 
what you can do is put a bowl over a pan
of<00:01:09.490> simmering<00:01:09.520> water<00:01:09.939> and<00:01:10.539> then<00:01:11.020> use<00:01:11.200> a<00:01:11.229> hand

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
of simmering water and then use a hand

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.410 
of simmering water and then use a hand
whisk<00:01:11.830> and<00:01:12.130> that<00:01:12.399> will<00:01:12.549> help<00:01:12.700> to<00:01:12.909> speed<00:01:13.119> it<00:01:13.270> up

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
whisk and that will help to speed it up

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:22.139 
whisk and that will help to speed it up
a<00:01:13.509> little<00:01:13.539> bit<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:21.369> when<00:01:21.549> it's<00:01:21.729> finished

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
a little bit so when it's finished

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.149 
a little bit so when it's finished
whisking<00:01:22.690> it<00:01:23.140> should<00:01:23.440> be<00:01:23.560> very<00:01:23.799> light<00:01:24.100> and

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
whisking it should be very light and

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.270 
whisking it should be very light and
frothy<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.990> you<00:01:26.049> can<00:01:26.289> see<00:01:26.500> that<00:01:26.679> it's<00:01:26.830> come<00:01:27.159> up

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
frothy so you can see that it's come up

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.800 
frothy so you can see that it's come up
quite<00:01:27.549> a<00:01:27.580> lot<00:01:27.850> in<00:01:28.030> the<00:01:28.119> bowl<00:01:28.299> because<00:01:28.479> it's<00:01:28.659> got

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
quite a lot in the bowl because it's got

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.249 
quite a lot in the bowl because it's got
so<00:01:29.020> much<00:01:29.200> air<00:01:29.440> incorporated<00:01:30.369> with<00:01:30.549> it<00:01:31.080> so<00:01:32.080> now

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
so much air incorporated with it so now

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.620 
so much air incorporated with it so now
I'm<00:01:32.380> going<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.649> sift<00:01:32.920> over<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.399> top<00:01:33.670> 2

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
I'm going to sift over the top 2

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.600 
I'm going to sift over the top 2
tablespoons<00:01:35.409> of<00:01:35.649> cocoa<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:38.039> also<00:01:39.039> I'm<00:01:39.340> going

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.210 
unless it spread out to the corners it
needs<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.090> bake<00:02:33.270> at<00:02:33.510> 180<00:02:34.080> degrees<00:02:34.620> centigrade

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
needs to bake at 180 degrees centigrade

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.940 
needs to bake at 180 degrees centigrade
which<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:35.520> gas<00:02:35.940> mark<00:02:36.270> 4<00:02:36.540> for<00:02:37.170> about<00:02:37.350> 20<00:02:37.800> minutes

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
which is gas mark 4 for about 20 minutes

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.830 
which is gas mark 4 for about 20 minutes
so<00:02:40.950> when<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.250> roulade<00:02:41.580> is<00:02:41.610> almost<00:02:42.120> cooked<00:02:42.480> I'm

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
so when the roulade is almost cooked I'm

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.510 
so when the roulade is almost cooked I'm
going<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.620> dust<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.070> sheet<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.400> baking

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
going to dust the sheet of baking

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.860 
going to dust the sheet of baking
parchment<00:02:45.030> with<00:02:46.020> some<00:02:46.200> icing<00:02:46.560> sugar<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:48.690> this

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
parchment with some icing sugar so this

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.350 
parchment with some icing sugar so this
is<00:02:49.020> all<00:02:49.140> ready<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.500> turn<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.980> roulade<00:02:50.310> out<00:02:51.000> on

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
is all ready to turn the roulade out on

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.860 
is all ready to turn the roulade out on
to<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:54.260> for<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.320> roulade<00:02:55.680> it's<00:02:56.460> ready

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
to it and for the roulade it's ready

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.020 
to it and for the roulade it's ready
when<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:57.990> press<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.410> center<00:02:58.830> of<00:02:58.980> it<00:03:00.080> and<00:03:02.030> it

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
when you press the center of it and it

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.920 
when you press the center of it and it
springs<00:03:03.420> back<00:03:03.720> lightly<00:03:04.260> when<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:04.770> touch<00:03:05.010> it

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
springs back lightly when you touch it

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.980 
springs back lightly when you touch it
so<00:03:06.930> I'm<00:03:06.990> going<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.260> take<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.680> out<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.130> oven

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
so I'm going to take it out of the oven

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.460 
so I'm going to take it out of the oven
and<00:03:10.640> then<00:03:11.640> turn<00:03:12.060> this<00:03:12.270> out<00:03:12.630> onto<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.110> baking

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
and then turn this out onto the baking

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.860 
and then turn this out onto the baking
parchment<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:16.850> now<00:03:17.850> while<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.270> cools<00:03:18.570> I'm

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
parchment and now while it cools I'm

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.140 
parchment and now while it cools I'm
going<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.200> cover<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.710> with<00:03:19.740> a<00:03:19.950> clean<00:03:20.340> damp<00:03:20.760> tea

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
going to cover it with a clean damp tea

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.570 
going to cover it with a clean damp tea
towel<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:22.530> just<00:03:22.800> helps<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.250> keep<00:03:23.400> it

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
towel and that just helps to keep it

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.640 
towel and that just helps to keep it
moist<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.120> won't<00:03:24.360> dry<00:03:24.630> up<00:03:24.840> too<00:03:25.140> much<00:03:25.350> and

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
moist so it won't dry up too much and

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.220 
moist so it won't dry up too much and
crap<00:03:25.950> when<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.250> roll<00:03:26.520> it<00:03:26.700> up<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.810> leave<00:03:28.020> that

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
crap when I roll it up and I leave that

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.790 
crap when I roll it up and I leave that
now<00:03:28.410> until<00:03:28.710> it's<00:03:28.860> completely<00:03:29.220> cold

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
now until it's completely cold

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.560 
now until it's completely cold
so<00:03:31.800> once<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.190> roulade<00:03:32.520> is<00:03:32.580> cold<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.420> can

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
so once the roulade is cold you can

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.180 
so once the roulade is cold you can
prepare<00:03:33.960> the<00:03:34.140> filling<00:03:34.500> for<00:03:34.770> it

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
prepare the filling for it

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.630 
prepare the filling for it
I've<00:03:35.700> got<00:03:35.940> in<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.240> bowl<00:03:36.750> 450<00:03:37.650> milliliters<00:03:37.920> of

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
I've got in the bowl 450 milliliters of

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.210 
I've got in the bowl 450 milliliters of
double<00:03:39.330> cream<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.900> I'm<00:03:40.410> going<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.680> whisk<00:03:40.980> this

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
double cream and I'm going to whisk this

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.380 
double cream and I'm going to whisk this
until<00:03:41.490> it<00:03:41.730> reaches<00:03:42.150> soft<00:03:42.390> peaks

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.210 

so<00:03:48.390> once<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.780> mixture<00:03:49.140> has<00:03:49.290> started<00:03:49.860> to<00:03:50.040> hold

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
so once the mixture has started to hold

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.180 
so once the mixture has started to hold
its<00:03:50.550> shape<00:03:50.640> I'm<00:03:51.330> going<00:03:51.599> to<00:03:52.080> add<00:03:52.290> six

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
its shape I'm going to add six

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.729 
its shape I'm going to add six
tablespoons<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:54.540> Irish<00:03:54.989> Cream<00:03:55.319> Liqueur<00:03:55.500> and

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
tablespoons of Irish Cream Liqueur and

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.500 
tablespoons of Irish Cream Liqueur and
I've<00:03:58.739> got<00:03:58.950> in<00:03:59.129> the<00:03:59.190> bowl<00:03:59.370> three<00:03:59.819> tablespoons

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
I've got in the bowl three tablespoons

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.490 
I've got in the bowl three tablespoons
of<00:04:00.690> icing<00:04:00.870> sugar<00:04:01.140> so<00:04:02.660> I'm<00:04:03.660> going<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:03.959> stir<00:04:04.260> this

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
of icing sugar so I'm going to stir this

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.970 
of icing sugar so I'm going to stir this
in<00:04:05.599> so<00:04:06.599> I'm<00:04:06.690> just<00:04:06.900> beating<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.470> very<00:04:07.680> lightly

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
in so I'm just beating it very lightly

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.339 
in so I'm just beating it very lightly
just<00:04:08.700> to<00:04:08.879> make<00:04:09.000> sure<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.360> thickens<00:04:09.840> so<00:04:10.080> it's<00:04:10.230> a

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
just to make sure it thickens so it's a

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.970 
just to make sure it thickens so it's a
spreadable<00:04:10.769> consistency<00:04:12.500> I'm<00:04:13.500> always<00:04:13.709> very

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
spreadable consistency I'm always very

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.270 
spreadable consistency I'm always very
careful<00:04:14.879> not<00:04:15.360> to<00:04:15.540> over<00:04:15.900> whisk<00:04:16.109> it<00:04:16.410> or<00:04:16.769> to<00:04:16.979> over

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
careful not to over whisk it or to over

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.990 
careful not to over whisk it or to over
beat<00:04:17.400> it<00:04:17.760> because<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.479> will<00:04:18.630> separate<00:04:19.940> so<00:04:20.940> you

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
beat it because it will separate so you

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.020 
beat it because it will separate so you
want<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.389> to<00:04:21.540> stay<00:04:21.780> nice<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.079> soft<00:04:22.620> so<00:04:23.070> once

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
want it to stay nice and soft so once

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.240 
want it to stay nice and soft so once
that's<00:04:24.330> done<00:04:24.660> I<00:04:24.900> now<00:04:25.380> need<00:04:25.590> to<00:04:25.620> prepare<00:04:26.040> the

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
that's done I now need to prepare the

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.629 
that's done I now need to prepare the
roulade<00:04:27.590> so<00:04:28.590> I'm<00:04:28.680> going<00:04:28.889> to<00:04:28.950> take<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.340> cloth

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
roulade so I'm going to take the cloth

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:41.379 
roulade so I'm going to take the cloth
off<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:31.010> and<00:04:32.960> peel<00:04:33.960> away<00:04:34.200> the<00:04:34.380> lining<00:04:35.160> paper

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.029 

the<00:04:42.389> edges<00:04:42.780> of<00:04:42.810> it<00:04:43.080> tend<00:04:43.379> to<00:04:43.469> go<00:04:43.560> a<00:04:43.590> little<00:04:43.770> bit

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
the edges of it tend to go a little bit

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.760 
the edges of it tend to go a little bit
crispy<00:04:44.580> so<00:04:45.389> I'm<00:04:45.449> going<00:04:45.689> to<00:04:45.840> use<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.050> long<00:04:46.439> knife

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
crispy so I'm going to use a long knife

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.339 
crispy so I'm going to use a long knife
with<00:04:47.099> a<00:04:47.129> serrated<00:04:47.310> blade<00:04:47.669> to<00:04:48.629> trim<00:04:48.659> away<00:04:49.020> the

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349 
with a serrated blade to trim away the

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:55.159 
with a serrated blade to trim away the
edges<00:04:51.439> and<00:04:53.419> then<00:04:54.419> I'm<00:04:54.599> going<00:04:54.779> to<00:04:54.900> put<00:04:55.080> the

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
edges and then I'm going to put the

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:06.270 
edges and then I'm going to put the
cream<00:04:55.439> on<00:04:55.800> top

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.440 

now<00:05:07.280> I'm<00:05:07.370> going<00:05:07.550> to<00:05:07.580> spread<00:05:07.850> the<00:05:08.030> cream<00:05:08.240> out

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
now I'm going to spread the cream out

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.530 
now I'm going to spread the cream out
with<00:05:08.810> the<00:05:08.900> palette<00:05:09.260> knife<00:05:09.290> and<00:05:10.390> then<00:05:11.390> I'm

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
with the palette knife and then I'm

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.260 
with the palette knife and then I'm
going<00:05:11.690> to<00:05:11.840> loosely<00:05:12.110> roll<00:05:12.590> it<00:05:12.800> up<00:05:13.010> so<00:05:13.790> I<00:05:13.820> find<00:05:14.120> it

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
going to loosely roll it up so I find it

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.240 
going to loosely roll it up so I find it
easier<00:05:14.600> to<00:05:14.660> start<00:05:14.990> with<00:05:15.230> the<00:05:15.320> side<00:05:15.560> closest<00:05:16.220> to

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
easier to start with the side closest to

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.600 
easier to start with the side closest to
me<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:17.110> then<00:05:18.110> use<00:05:18.350> the<00:05:18.740> paper<00:05:19.070> that<00:05:19.520> you

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
me and then use the paper that you

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:29.160 
me and then use the paper that you
turned<00:05:19.910> it<00:05:20.030> out<00:05:20.150> on<00:05:20.450> to<00:05:21.110> help<00:05:21.350> roll<00:05:21.650> it<00:05:21.860> up<00:05:22.070> and

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.260 

then<00:05:30.170> just<00:05:30.680> make<00:05:30.860> sure<00:05:31.070> the<00:05:31.220> paper<00:05:31.460> comes<00:05:31.910> away

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
then just make sure the paper comes away

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.630 
then just make sure the paper comes away
from<00:05:32.660> it<00:05:32.840> don't<00:05:33.290> worry<00:05:33.560> it's<00:05:33.770> sometimes<00:05:34.280> the

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
from it don't worry it's sometimes the

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.590 
from it don't worry it's sometimes the
topping<00:05:35.390> will<00:05:35.600> stick<00:05:35.930> to<00:05:36.169> the<00:05:36.290> paper<00:05:37.600> you

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
topping will stick to the paper you

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:47.500 
topping will stick to the paper you
could<00:05:38.780> transfer<00:05:39.260> it<00:05:39.680> to<00:05:40.010> a<00:05:40.820> serving<00:05:41.390> plate<00:05:46.510> and

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
could transfer it to a serving plate and

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.100 
could transfer it to a serving plate and
then<00:05:47.870> pull<00:05:48.169> the<00:05:48.290> paper<00:05:48.500> away<00:05:48.919> totally<00:05:51.130> and

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
then pull the paper away totally and

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.370 
then pull the paper away totally and
then<00:05:54.110> before<00:05:54.380> serving<00:05:55.160> it<00:05:55.690> you<00:05:56.690> dust<00:05:56.960> the<00:05:57.050> top

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
then before serving it you dust the top

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.830 
then before serving it you dust the top
with<00:05:57.410> lots<00:05:58.130> of<00:05:58.280> icing<00:05:58.730> sugar<00:05:59.740> and<00:06:01.660> this<00:06:02.660> will

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
with lots of icing sugar and this will

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.010 
with lots of icing sugar and this will
disguise<00:06:03.169> any<00:06:03.500> cracks<00:06:03.890> on<00:06:04.190> the<00:06:04.280> top<00:06:04.900> so<00:06:05.900> that's

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
disguise any cracks on the top so that's

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.620 
disguise any cracks on the top so that's
the<00:06:06.229> finished<00:06:06.530> chocolates
