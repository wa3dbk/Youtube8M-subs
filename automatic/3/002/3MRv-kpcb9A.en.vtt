00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:23.449
 all this is so ancient one as a dual 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:29.720
 then little knitter felix huby 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.720
 cheap flyer patrick dama fabiana base 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.600
 the committee wanted to 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:49.570
 you can have fun the poor one wins 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.570
 is that just a football festival 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.370
 inflation last motivation 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.409
 bad 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.979
 thinks 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.830
 play minute 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.900
 still in 2005 for this august 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.019
 b 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.500
 behind the bug wheel after boarding at 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.739
 bv cloppenburg spied a glance 1 0 for 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.640
 the teams on an exciting second 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.220
 half 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.340
 that was already the finest as today 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.819
 we use the first hour wants to 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.530
 Drink to fill for an exchange of views 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.530
 and again 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.260
 si 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.050
 2 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.510
 never 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.549
 Yes 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.940
 Today we have 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.340
 seen who have played at eye level 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.370
 first half has, of course 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.350
 big kneaded combative runner one 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.510
 playful things also make us big 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.250
 tasks or problems 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.220
 and we just did not get involved 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.950
 and earning is in a big knead as well 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.290
 it was at half-time 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.360
 Also deserves a second half 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.540
 clearly it always shifts a bit 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.150
 make more pressure if the 1 1 and then 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.070
 the 2 1 am I guess normal 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.330
 been playing would be 2 2 would be absolutely 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.310
 fair for both 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.920
 Finally, there is a station in 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.190
 things that thiel brings us problems 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.570
 or heat 390 kite but 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.310
 I think we now we have my 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.910
 wipe your mouth and continue until extra 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.910
 is not today 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.130
 played well in the first half and 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.170
 The opponent also immediately showed that we 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.060
 want to win here and I think 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.980
 we have held well against the opponent 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.540
 life is hard too 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.940
 Happy Yannick 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.880
 Farmer in front of a nice turn of flow 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.560
 and after the halftime are one 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.270
 a little broken act as well 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.280
 get the 1 1 relatively quickly then 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.690
 even the 2 1 are therefore also by 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.040
 individual mistakes so what can 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.850
 happen that then but just bitter and 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.710
 that has us a bit out of the way 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.000
 thrown but then in the end too late 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.420
 waking up would certainly be something 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.420
 been in it
