00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
i'm going to show you the difference in

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.680 
i'm going to show you the difference in
the<00:00:43.170> fat<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.129> animations<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> animation

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
the fat and the animations the animation

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.799 
the fat and the animations the animation
speeds<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.050> iOS<00:00:46.320> 7.1<00:00:46.800> are<00:00:47.190> greatly<00:00:47.809> improved

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
speeds in iOS 7.1 are greatly improved

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.270 
speeds in iOS 7.1 are greatly improved
so<00:00:49.079> let's<00:00:49.289> see<00:00:49.410> we're<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.860> open<00:00:49.920> up

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
so let's see we're just going to open up

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.310 
so let's see we're just going to open up
let's<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.000> say<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.329> phone<00:00:51.480> application<00:00:52.079> so

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
let's just say the phone application so

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.360 
let's just say the phone application so
if<00:00:52.410> we're<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.680> click<00:00:52.800> at<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.010> same<00:00:53.190> time

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
if we're going to click at the same time

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.729 
if we're going to click at the same time
and<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:54.899> see<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.230> opens<00:00:55.500> up<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.710> lot

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
and as you can see it opens up a lot

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.180 
and as you can see it opens up a lot
quicker<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.570> iOS<00:00:57.570> 7.1<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.500> an<00:00:58.649> iphone<00:00:58.980> 5

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
quicker on iOS 7.1 this is an iphone 5

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.760 
quicker on iOS 7.1 this is an iphone 5
this<00:00:59.820> is<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> iphone<00:01:00.300> 5s<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.469> let's<00:01:01.590> go<00:01:01.739> ahead

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
this is the iphone 5s so let's go ahead

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.299 
this is the iphone 5s so let's go ahead

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
and open music as you can see same thing

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.590 
and open music as you can see same thing
you<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.030> do<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.210> with<00:01:06.330> male<00:01:08.210> same<00:01:09.210> thing<00:01:09.450> it

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
speed but it is nice to have it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.520 
speed but it is nice to have it

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
crashes quite a bit and i'm not sure if

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.420 
crashes quite a bit and i'm not sure if
thats<00:01:37.079> related<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> jailbreak<00:01:38.130> or<00:01:38.280> not
