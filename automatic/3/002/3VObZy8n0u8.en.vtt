00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.180 

so<00:00:01.110> this<00:00:01.589> is<00:00:02.659> an<00:00:03.659> experiment<00:00:04.380> that<00:00:04.410> I'm<00:00:04.620> I'm

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
so this is an experiment that I'm I'm

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.930 
so this is an experiment that I'm I'm
conducting<00:00:05.970> on<00:00:06.770> what<00:00:07.770> I<00:00:07.799> call<00:00:08.069> Verma<00:00:08.370> ponics

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
conducting on what I call Verma ponics

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.720 
conducting on what I call Verma ponics
and<00:00:09.500> the<00:00:10.500> idea<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:11.210> if<00:00:12.210> we<00:00:12.269> add<00:00:12.660> worms<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:14.009> even

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
and the idea is if we add worms and even

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.470 
and the idea is if we add worms and even
worm<00:00:14.910> castings<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:16.220> aquaponic<00:00:17.220> system<00:00:18.119> this

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
worm castings to a aquaponic system this

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.259 
worm castings to a aquaponic system this
is<00:00:18.660> my<00:00:18.869> aquaponic<00:00:19.800> tank<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.760> table<00:00:22.100> then

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
is my aquaponic tank and and table then

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.700 
is my aquaponic tank and and table then
you<00:00:24.269> know<00:00:24.390> we<00:00:24.539> can<00:00:24.570> add<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> certain<00:00:25.230> element<00:00:25.680> of

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
you know we can add a certain element of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.029 
you know we can add a certain element of
nutrients<00:00:26.220> aerate<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.510> rock<00:00:27.840> beds<00:00:28.199> this

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
nutrients aerate the the rock beds this

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.089 
nutrients aerate the the rock beds this
is<00:00:29.099> an<00:00:29.340> ebb<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.550> flow<00:00:29.760> style<00:00:30.300> system<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.439> it

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
is an ebb and flow style system so it it

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.540 
is an ebb and flow style system so it it
has<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:33.110> an<00:00:34.110> ideal<00:00:34.530> stone<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:34.920> use<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:36.050> lightweight

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
has a an ideal stone I use a lightweight

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:45.020 
has a an ideal stone I use a lightweight
aerated<00:00:39.530> slate<00:00:41.390> aragonite<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:43.129> it's<00:00:44.129> it's<00:00:44.789> a

makes a perfect biological medium and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.310 
makes a perfect biological medium and
it's<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.700> tends<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.120> do<00:00:51.480> well<00:00:51.719> in

essentially a soil buildup in the rock

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.620 
essentially a soil buildup in the rock

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
important in the ground but in this case

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.210 
important in the ground but in this case
we're<00:04:41.970> we're<00:04:42.419> adding<00:04:42.750> them<00:04:42.810> to<00:04:43.220> aquaponics

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
that prevents us from doing that you

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.990 
that prevents us from doing that you
know<00:04:48.389> nobody<00:04:48.720> really<00:04:48.780> seems<00:04:49.710> to<00:04:49.800> want<00:04:50.040> earth

but<00:04:58.950> worms<00:04:59.190> I<00:04:59.430> think<00:04:59.639> they're<00:04:59.760> going<00:04:59.880> to

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
but worms I think they're going to

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.810 
but worms I think they're going to
provide<00:05:00.210> a<00:05:00.270> great<00:05:00.479> solution<00:05:00.930> so<00:05:01.550> this<00:05:02.550> is<00:05:02.700> our

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
provide a great solution so this is our

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.090 
provide a great solution so this is our
experiment<00:05:03.389> and<00:05:03.570> and<00:05:04.320> I<00:05:04.500> think<00:05:04.560> this<00:05:04.889> is<00:05:04.979> going

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
experiment and and I think this is going

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.320 
experiment and and I think this is going
to<00:05:05.160> this<00:05:05.490> is<00:05:05.610> going<00:05:05.729> to<00:05:05.790> be<00:05:05.910> something<00:05:06.150> very

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
to this is going to be something very

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.629 
to this is going to be something very

other aspects of aquaponics you know I'm

other aspects of aquaponics you know I'm
interested<00:05:16.590> in<00:05:16.950> seeing<00:05:17.389> you<00:05:18.389> know

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.500 

practice<00:05:28.620> and<00:05:29.130> I<00:05:29.400> think<00:05:29.669> we'll<00:05:30.180> find<00:05:30.419> that

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
practice and I think we'll find that

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.379 
practice and I think we'll find that
this<00:05:30.660> becomes<00:05:31.139> the<00:05:31.410> sort<00:05:31.710> of<00:05:31.740> the<00:05:31.830> Holy<00:05:32.010> Grail

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
this becomes the sort of the Holy Grail

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.010 
this becomes the sort of the Holy Grail
as<00:05:33.389> a<00:05:34.039> solution<00:05:35.039> to<00:05:35.250> the<00:05:35.460> fact<00:05:35.700> that

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
as a solution to the fact that

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.040 
as a solution to the fact that
aquaponics<00:05:37.020> does<00:05:37.169> not<00:05:37.350> entirely<00:05:39.050> support

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
aquaponics does not entirely support

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.760 
aquaponics does not entirely support
heavy<00:05:40.979> feeding<00:05:41.400> plans<00:05:41.700> and<00:05:42.620> certain<00:05:43.620> things

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
heavy feeding plans and certain things

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.379 
heavy feeding plans and certain things
that<00:05:43.979> are<00:05:44.070> missing<00:05:44.510> include<00:05:45.510> the<00:05:46.200> the<00:05:47.389> the

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
that are missing include the the the

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:53.230 
that are missing include the the the
salts<00:05:48.810> like<00:05:48.990> potassium<00:05:49.919> calcium<00:05:50.599> magnesium

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
salts like potassium calcium magnesium

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.219 
salts like potassium calcium magnesium
breakdown<00:05:54.240> of<00:05:54.419> the<00:05:54.570> minerals<00:05:55.050> like

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
breakdown of the minerals like

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.310 
breakdown of the minerals like
phosphorus<00:05:55.849> absorbability<00:05:56.849> of<00:05:57.300> iron<00:05:57.690> and<00:05:58.080> so

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
phosphorus absorbability of iron and so

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.460 
phosphorus absorbability of iron and so
on<00:05:58.500> so<00:05:58.860> adding<00:05:59.760> adding<00:06:00.690> this<00:06:00.810> to<00:06:01.050> the<00:06:01.139> system

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
on so adding adding this to the system

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.830 
on so adding adding this to the system
may<00:06:01.620> make<00:06:01.800> it<00:06:01.979> possible<00:06:02.160> to<00:06:02.490> take<00:06:02.840> aquaponics

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
may make it possible to take aquaponics

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.670 
may make it possible to take aquaponics
beyond<00:06:04.250> typically<00:06:06.080> grown<00:06:07.280> leafy<00:06:08.280> greens<00:06:09.180> and

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
beyond typically grown leafy greens and

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.540 
beyond typically grown leafy greens and
and<00:06:10.680> expanding<00:06:11.460> that<00:06:11.580> to<00:06:11.990> creating<00:06:12.990> a

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
and expanding that to creating a

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.860 
and expanding that to creating a
something<00:06:14.550> that<00:06:14.700> can<00:06:14.880> grow<00:06:15.120> more<00:06:15.360> more

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
something that can grow more more

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.960 
something that can grow more more
tomatoes<00:06:16.349> and<00:06:16.710> and<00:06:16.979> heavy<00:06:17.220> feeding<00:06:17.610> plants

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
tomatoes and and heavy feeding plants

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.060 
tomatoes and and heavy feeding plants
I'm<00:06:18.479> also<00:06:18.599> gonna<00:06:18.780> add<00:06:18.840> it<00:06:19.139> to<00:06:19.260> this<00:06:19.410> vine<00:06:19.680> which

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
I'm also gonna add it to this vine which

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.300 
I'm also gonna add it to this vine which
has<00:06:20.280> a<00:06:20.310> bright<00:06:20.820> sort<00:06:21.630> of<00:06:21.720> green<00:06:22.050> to<00:06:22.710> it<00:06:22.889> and<00:06:23.160> I'm

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
has a bright sort of green to it and I'm

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.629 
has a bright sort of green to it and I'm
hoping<00:06:23.880> that<00:06:24.320> by<00:06:25.320> adding<00:06:25.530> the<00:06:25.800> the<00:06:26.130> worms<00:06:26.460> to

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
hoping that by adding the the worms to

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:29.060 
hoping that by adding the the worms to
the<00:06:26.940> to<00:06:27.300> the<00:06:27.419> rocks<00:06:27.630> that<00:06:27.990> that<00:06:28.650> are<00:06:28.800> in<00:06:28.919> this

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 
the to the rocks that that are in this

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.010 
the to the rocks that that are in this
container<00:06:29.580> here<00:06:29.910> that<00:06:30.300> get<00:06:30.479> flooded<00:06:30.930> and

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
container here that get flooded and

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.110 
container here that get flooded and
drain<00:06:31.200> when<00:06:31.440> the<00:06:31.560> whole<00:06:31.740> system<00:06:31.919> floods<00:06:32.370> that

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
drain when the whole system floods that

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.090 
drain when the whole system floods that
we'll<00:06:33.390> be<00:06:33.990> able<00:06:34.050> to<00:06:34.169> improve<00:06:34.469> the

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.100 
we'll be able to improve the

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.920 
we'll be able to improve the
the<00:06:35.550> richness<00:06:35.760> and<00:06:36.090> the<00:06:36.180> darkness<00:06:36.450> of<00:06:36.750> these

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
the richness and the darkness of these

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.690 
the richness and the darkness of these
leads<00:06:37.320> so<00:06:37.800> that'll<00:06:38.130> be<00:06:38.190> a<00:06:38.220> pretty<00:06:38.580> good

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.700 
leads so that'll be a pretty good

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.470 
leads so that'll be a pretty good
indicator<00:06:39.120> on<00:06:40.050> that<00:06:40.320> note<00:06:40.530> so<00:06:41.270> that's<00:06:42.270> it

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
indicator on that note so that's it

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.500 
indicator on that note so that's it
we'll<00:06:42.690> keep<00:06:42.870> you<00:06:42.990> updated<00:06:43.110> as<00:06:43.560> as<00:06:44.550> as<00:06:44.940> thanks
