00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.060
 hum 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.080

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.030
 it was nice to do because 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.320

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.280

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.380
 with different sizes although most are from 3 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.860
 therefore details from this movement 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.270
