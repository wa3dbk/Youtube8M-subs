00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello thank you for being in a new video 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.689
 today is a very, very fast video 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.850
 and that is that some of you have 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.520
 asked how can they do to see 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.120
 football matches from your android well 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.789
 is that on this day we are going to see this topic 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.380
 more or less very quickly to start 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.990
 we are going to have to install the flash 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.759
 player for this we will have us to go 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.769
 to adjustments more security and here we go to 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.749
 activate the option to be able to install 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.960
 applications from outside the play store 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:36.180
 since as you know adobe flash player no 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.620
 is in play store then we have to 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.930
 activate this origins option 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.960
 unknown the one that is above 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.460
 sorry you have to have it activated we are going to 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.429
 show an alert and we put to 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.289
 accept once we activate this 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:51.300
 option we have to download a file 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.670
 the download link is in the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.010
 description and then we go to a 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.560
 file manager and we locate 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.360
 the file that we already downloaded 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.070
 you just have to open it so that 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.080
 start your installation 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.210
 we install and we hope this 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.910
 installer is out of the play store by 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.800
 reasons for google simply to google 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.920
 he did not want flash player to be 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.260
 on android but there's still support 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.540
 then this flash player we are going to 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.480
 need to enter a web page 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.159
 where we can see some game of 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.719
 football 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.159
 but as you will know not all 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:32.499
 web browsers support 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.329
 the flash player so you're going to have 

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:37.270
 to download also this browser that 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.950
 it's called porfin browser is free in 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.409
 play store this if you find it on 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.509
 plays thor and here we are going to address if 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.240
 you've watched games from the computer 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.759
 You will know that redirect is a page in 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.189
 which there are many games that's 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.020
 that once now from redirect 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.780
 make sure you have the mode 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.789
 desktop in off in browser 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.569
 we will achieve this by going to the menu 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.520
 and then to the configuration being 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.939
 here in the configuration let's see what 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.129
 it says to charge auto flash and the mode of the 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.290
 Mobile browser is disabled as well 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.750
 we are sure that it will load the 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.710
 desktop version very well now that 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.260
 we are already in redirect 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.450
 we expand to see the list of matches 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.030
 here the matches will come out 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.560
 available and this time I do not know the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.040
 true if there is a match at this time 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.530
 but let's see if it opens some or 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.900
 some some transmission you have to 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.350
 give here to expand a list and 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.850
 then click where it says watch a 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.220
 Once you give in watch it starts to 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.680
 charge and you will get a lot of 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.450
 ads of those and so I have 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.210
 be careful not to press 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.720
 about them and as you see here it started 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.870
 a transmission obviously if you want your 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.540
 device is going to be even better 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.599
 and just if you slide down it 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.390
 hides the address bar and the 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.430
 tabs you can now expand if you 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.720
 you wait a few moments for that announcement 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.430
 be removed there are only ads 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.640
 [Applause] 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.950
 this screen so you can see from a 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.870
 best way the party 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.260
 only on this occasion there is not a match 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.769
 as you see but there is a transmission that 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.660
 maybe you patient says what it is 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.209
 but in this way you can see matches 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.300
 in a fairly easy way how to see it 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.730
 sees very well and also depends on your 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.950
 disguise equity 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.560
 when you want to stop watching the game 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.860
 you simply slide and close the 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.720
 window 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.820
 sometimes it seems that the 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.680
 I still do not know if you manage to notice 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.780
 the sound is still 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.150
 and although I already left, it takes about 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.150
 seconds to react more or less and there 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.890
 is then how do you see the only thing 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.530
 what to do is install the flash adobe 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.900
 player and also a compatible browser 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.939
 I recommend this popping browser 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.829
 because from here I tried it and if 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.629
 it worked very well then being in 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:11.409
 rojadirecta you select nothing else here in 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:13.180
 this list is the match you want to see and 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.099
 then it will open to another page in 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.259
 which you will be able to see the match 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.359
 yes so many advertisements that 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:22.000
 You must be very patient, I hope you 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.970
 have liked this video was very short 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.009
 It was very brief but I wanted to take advantage today 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.130
 which is the final of Mexican football for 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.780
 give you this application is 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.759
 I could say but it is not in itself a 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.650
 application but is a combination of 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:37.780
 install adobe and finally install 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.680
 browser I wish you liked it and we 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.680
 we see the next
