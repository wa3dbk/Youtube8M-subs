00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
really plan on owning or even watching

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.160 
really plan on owning or even watching
for<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.250> matter<00:00:11.550> but<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.300> found<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:13.019> for<00:00:13.110> a

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
for that matter but I found it for a

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.140 
for that matter but I found it for a
really<00:00:13.320> good<00:00:13.469> price<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.340> just<00:00:14.519> figured<00:00:14.820> go

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
really good price and I just figured go

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.010 
really good price and I just figured go
ahead<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.509> get<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:16.010> it's<00:00:17.010> salt<00:00:17.310> 5<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:18.000> know<00:00:18.779> I've

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
ahead and get it it's salt 5 I know I've

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.300 
ahead and get it it's salt 5 I know I've
said<00:00:19.199> in<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> lot<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.560> other<00:00:19.680> videos<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.250> I

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
said in a lot of other videos that I

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.970 
said in a lot of other videos that I
would<00:00:20.430> never<00:00:20.580> actually<00:00:21.029> watch<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:21.980> yeah

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
would never actually watch this but yeah

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.330 
would never actually watch this but yeah
I<00:00:23.340> found<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.330> for<00:00:24.449> like<00:00:24.570> $4.99<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.830> was<00:00:26.070> used

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
I found it for like $4.99 it was used

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.009 
I found it for like $4.99 it was used
but<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.670> was<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:26.849> really<00:00:27.029> good<00:00:27.150> condition<00:00:27.300> and

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
but it was in really good condition and

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.109 
but it was in really good condition and
I<00:00:28.769> figured<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.130> might<00:00:29.279> as<00:00:29.340> well<00:00:29.460> get<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.029> I

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
I figured I might as well get it and I

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.560 
I figured I might as well get it and I
did<00:00:30.359> watch<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.460> just<00:00:32.460> like<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.700> expected<00:00:33.059> I

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
did watch it and just like I expected I

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.049 
did watch it and just like I expected I
didn't<00:00:33.989> like<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.350> movie<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.309> will<00:00:35.820> say

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
didn't like the movie but I will say

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.580 
didn't like the movie but I will say
that<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.420> was<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> little<00:00:36.809> bit<00:00:37.020> better<00:00:37.200> than<00:00:37.469> I

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
that it was a little bit better than I

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.500 
that it was a little bit better than I
thought<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.920> was<00:00:38.010> going<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.219> be<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.360> also

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
thought it was going to be and I also

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.720 
thought it was going to be and I also
thought<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.870> was<00:00:39.989> better<00:00:40.290> than<00:00:40.530> salt<00:00:40.829> 4<00:00:41.160> by<00:00:41.700> a

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
thought it was better than salt 4 by a

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.290 
thought it was better than salt 4 by a
mile

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
mile

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.380 
mile
actually<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.260> mean<00:00:44.129> sulphur<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.700> really<00:00:45.149> really

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
actually I mean sulphur I really really

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.330 
actually I mean sulphur I really really
hate<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.780> but<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.800> one<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.010> thought<00:00:47.219> was

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
hate it but this one I thought was

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.889 
hate it but this one I thought was
actually<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.700> lot<00:00:47.850> better<00:00:48.059> even<00:00:48.690> though<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
actually a lot better even though it

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.779 
actually a lot better even though it
still<00:00:49.170> wasn't<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.530> great<00:00:51.710> but<00:00:52.710> yeah<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.640> do

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
still wasn't that great but yeah I do

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.389 
still wasn't that great but yeah I do
think<00:00:54.210> it's<00:00:54.390> worth<00:00:54.600> giving<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.079> try<00:00:55.110> but<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.129> mean

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
think it's worth giving a try but I mean

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.340 
think it's worth giving a try but I mean
it's<00:00:56.520> not<00:00:56.670> worth<00:00:56.850> watching<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.690> million<00:00:58.079> times

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
it's not worth watching a million times

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.700 
it's not worth watching a million times
or<00:00:58.590> anything<00:00:58.879> and<00:01:00.170> be<00:01:01.170> honest<00:01:01.410> with<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.680> I

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
or anything and be honest with you I

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.860 
or anything and be honest with you I
can't<00:01:02.010> really<00:01:02.190> remember<00:01:02.879> what<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.329> about<00:01:03.420> I

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
can't really remember what it's about I

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.289 
can't really remember what it's about I
mean<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.199> kind<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.790> confusing<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.090> can't

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
mean it was kind of confusing so I can't

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.820 
mean it was kind of confusing so I can't
really<00:01:06.510> describe<00:01:06.840> exactly<00:01:07.110> what<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> plot

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
they're basically going through a whole

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.060 
they're basically going through a whole
bunch<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.570> rooms<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> house<00:01:28.229> trying<00:01:28.799> to

I thought was pretty good and plus I had

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.660 
I thought was pretty good and plus I had
some<00:03:07.909> money<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.239> I<00:03:08.299> wanted<00:03:08.569> to<00:03:08.629> spend<00:03:08.840> anyway

$14.99

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
was pretty decent it's about this group

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.390 
was pretty decent it's about this group
of<00:05:05.720> friends<00:05:06.110> they<00:05:06.200> go<00:05:06.350> to<00:05:06.410> Camp<00:05:06.919> Crystal<00:05:07.190> Lake

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
it was more funny than scary like when

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.040 
it was more funny than scary like when
people<00:05:27.470> got<00:05:27.560> killed<00:05:27.910> but<00:05:28.910> um<00:05:29.090> yeah<00:05:29.930> it

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
really stupid in parts which are not

pretty cheap at FYE it was used for
those<00:06:25.160> apprec<00:06:25.700> price<00:06:26.030> think<00:06:26.539> it<00:06:26.599> was<00:06:26.690> like<00:06:26.870> 399

or<00:06:28.010> something<00:06:28.250> like<00:06:28.310> that<00:06:28.840> but<00:06:30.220> yeah<00:06:31.220> I've

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
or something like that but yeah I've

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.980 
or something like that but yeah I've
heard<00:06:31.550> decent<00:06:31.970> things<00:06:32.150> about<00:06:32.360> this<00:06:32.539> one<00:06:32.750> too

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
heard decent things about this one too

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.839 
heard decent things about this one too
or<00:06:33.650> at<00:06:33.740> least<00:06:33.889> I<00:06:34.010> think<00:06:34.070> I<00:06:34.430> don't<00:06:34.490> know<00:06:34.639> if<00:06:34.729> I'm

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:34.849 
or at least I think I don't know if I'm

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:37.089 
or at least I think I don't know if I'm
confusing<00:06:35.300> it<00:06:35.450> with<00:06:35.570> a<00:06:35.599> another<00:06:36.590> movie<00:06:36.979> or

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:37.099 
confusing it with a another movie or

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:38.920 
confusing it with a another movie or
what<00:06:37.310> but<00:06:37.669> I<00:06:38.000> thought<00:06:38.419> it'd<00:06:38.510> sound<00:06:38.659> pretty

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
what but I thought it'd sound pretty

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.210 
what but I thought it'd sound pretty
good<00:06:39.110> and<00:06:39.200> I<00:06:39.229> wanted<00:06:39.469> to<00:06:39.530> give<00:06:39.620> it<00:06:39.650> a<00:06:39.740> try

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
good and I wanted to give it a try
