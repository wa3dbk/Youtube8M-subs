00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
is strange because it's most of mine

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.710

have<00:04:29.010> little<00:04:29.520> marks<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.000> stuff<00:04:30.210> on<00:04:30.360> it<00:04:30.389> I

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
have little marks and stuff on it I

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.050 
have little marks and stuff on it I
really<00:04:31.320> like<00:04:31.530> this<00:04:31.710> one<00:04:31.889> a<00:04:32.100> lot<00:04:32.280> just<00:04:32.610> like<00:04:32.820> all

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
really like this one a lot just like all

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.969 
really like this one a lot just like all
the<00:04:33.240> colors<00:04:33.419> they<00:04:33.870> go<00:04:34.050> really<00:04:34.530> well<00:04:34.800> together

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
the colors they go really well together

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.980 
the colors they go really well together
and<00:04:35.690> it's<00:04:36.690> just<00:04:37.139> a<00:04:37.500> really<00:04:38.220> cool<00:04:38.460> Bulldog<00:04:38.990> okay

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
and it's just a really cool Bulldog okay

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.560 
and it's just a really cool Bulldog okay
so<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.410> last<00:04:40.560> Bulldog<00:04:41.070> I<00:04:41.340> have<00:04:41.700> it's<00:04:42.060> a<00:04:42.330> bit

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
so the last Bulldog I have it's a bit

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.090 
so the last Bulldog I have it's a bit
different<00:04:42.780> to<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:43.080> others<00:04:43.470> but<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:43.950> would

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
different to the others but I would

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.670 
different to the others but I would
still<00:04:44.280> say<00:04:44.490> it's<00:04:44.639> a<00:04:44.700> bulldog<00:04:45.090> and<00:04:45.330> it's<00:04:45.680> this
