course<00:00:59.820> my<00:01:00.030> only<00:01:00.329> gripe<00:01:00.629> would<00:01:00.930> be<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.320> I'd

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
course my only gripe would be that I'd

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.900 
course my only gripe would be that I'd
like<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:01.949> be<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> little<00:01:02.399> bit<00:01:02.520> larger

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
like to see this be a little bit larger

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.479 
like to see this be a little bit larger
probably<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> half<00:01:03.780> pot<00:01:04.049> range<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.769> 1250

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
probably in the half pot range like 1250

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.390 
probably in the half pot range like 1250
1300<00:01:06.450> something<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.380> think<00:01:08.159> that

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
1300 something like that I think that

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.580 
1300 something like that I think that
players<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.420> tournament<00:01:09.780> especially<00:01:10.049> early

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
players in a tournament especially early

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.890 
players in a tournament especially early
on<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:11.430> only<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.880> dollar<00:01:12.090> fifty<00:01:12.479> tournaments

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
on it's only a dollar fifty tournaments

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.330 
on it's only a dollar fifty tournaments
so<00:01:13.020> I'm<00:01:13.140> not<00:01:13.260> expecting<00:01:13.409> like<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> toughest

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
so I'm not expecting like the toughest

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.160 
so I'm not expecting like the toughest
competition<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.030> world<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.540> think<00:01:15.930> that

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
competition in the world I think that

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.600 
competition in the world I think that
they're<00:01:16.409> going<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.770> draw<00:01:17.040> incorrectly

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
they're going to draw incorrectly

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.030 
they're going to draw incorrectly
they're<00:01:17.880> going<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.270> call<00:01:18.990> he<00:01:19.229> repairs<00:01:19.680> more

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
they're going to call he repairs more

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.370 
they're going to call he repairs more
liberally<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.360> think<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> prime

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
liberally and I think this is a prime

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.080 
liberally and I think this is a prime
opportunity<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:23.100> get<00:01:23.189> some<00:01:23.430> money<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.939> in

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
opportunity to get some money going in

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.520 
opportunity to get some money going in
both<00:01:24.270> from<00:01:24.450> people<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:24.840> pairs<00:01:25.080> people<00:01:25.439> it

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
both from people with pairs people it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.380 
both from people with pairs people it
draws<00:01:25.799> people<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.490> over<00:01:26.729> value<00:01:27.090> things

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
draws people to just over value things

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.330 
draws people to just over value things
and<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.140> think<00:01:28.290> they're<00:01:28.409> gonna<00:01:28.500> do<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> pinch

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
and I think they're gonna do so a pinch

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.490 
and I think they're gonna do so a pinch
more<00:01:29.549> inelastically<00:01:30.240> at<00:01:30.540> least<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.290> a

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
more inelastically at least up to a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.319 
more inelastically at least up to a
point<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.369> think<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.090> difference

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
point and I think that the difference

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.030 
point and I think that the difference
between<00:01:33.360> them<00:01:33.990> calling<00:01:34.409> nine<00:01:34.590> hundred<00:01:34.950> and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
between them calling nine hundred and

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.280 
between them calling nine hundred and
thirteen<00:01:35.460> hundred<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.939> very<00:01:36.119> slight<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.780> think

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
thirteen hundred is very slight I think

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.020 
thirteen hundred is very slight I think
they're<00:01:37.380> gonna<00:01:37.500> continue<00:01:37.740> both<00:01:38.280> numbers<00:01:38.729> very

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
they're gonna continue both numbers very

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.179 
they're gonna continue both numbers very
very<00:01:39.299> similarly<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.409> I'd<00:01:40.530> really<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.040> see

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
very similarly so I'd really like to see

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.399 
very similarly so I'd really like to see
the<00:01:41.340> larger<00:01:41.850> number<00:01:42.180> here<00:01:42.420> totally<00:01:42.869> for<00:01:43.079> value

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
the larger number here totally for value

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.830 
the larger number here totally for value
of<00:01:43.560> course<00:01:43.909> so<00:01:44.909> we<00:01:45.000> end<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.210> getting<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.570> call

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
of course so we end up getting a call

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.440 
of course so we end up getting a call
another<00:01:46.560> call<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.159> another<00:01:47.460> call<00:01:47.610> only<00:01:48.149> go

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
another call and another call only go

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.469 
another call and another call only go
for<00:01:48.780> way<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.290> turn<00:01:49.530> which<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.430> 10<00:01:50.759> check

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
for way to the turn which is a 10 check

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.109 
for way to the turn which is a 10 check
check<00:01:52.110> here<00:01:52.740> decides<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.220> bet<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.640> thousand

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
check here decides to bet for a thousand

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.300 
check here decides to bet for a thousand
so<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.750> situation<00:01:54.990> same<00:01:55.770> as<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.040> flop

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
so in this situation same as the flop

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.800 
so in this situation same as the flop
I'm<00:01:56.549> happy<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.030> we're<00:01:57.329> betting<00:01:57.509> I

money's going in I have no real reason

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.359 
money's going in I have no real reason
to<00:02:01.079> think<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.320> other<00:02:01.619> people<00:02:01.710> are<00:02:02.009> gonna<00:02:02.100> bet

and the King in my hands so it's not

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.520 
and the King in my hands so it's not
like<00:02:06.240> anyone<00:02:06.570> can<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.259> that

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.399 
me but whatever if they have that good
for<00:02:16.030> them<00:02:16.180> just<00:02:16.540> is<00:02:16.750> what<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.049> is

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
for them just is what it is

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.890 
for them just is what it is
suck<00:02:17.680> it<00:02:17.829> up<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.069> be<00:02:18.189> a<00:02:18.219> cooler<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.540> in<00:02:19.780> the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
suck it up to be a cooler so in the

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.300 
suck it up to be a cooler so in the
situation<00:02:20.049> again<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.680> like<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.040> fact<00:02:21.219> that

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
situation again I like the fact that

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.339 
situation again I like the fact that
we're<00:02:21.489> betting<00:02:21.790> my<00:02:22.359> only<00:02:22.569> gripe<00:02:22.810> here<00:02:23.079> again

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
we're betting my only gripe here again

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.470 
we're betting my only gripe here again
is<00:02:23.560> gonna<00:02:23.709> be<00:02:23.859> with<00:02:24.099> this<00:02:24.489> size<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:25.090> think<00:02:25.359> in

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
is gonna be with this size I think in

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.910 
is gonna be with this size I think in
this<00:02:25.629> situation<00:02:26.049> we're<00:02:26.170> giving<00:02:26.409> too<00:02:26.620> good<00:02:26.829> of

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
this situation we're giving too good of

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.470 
this situation we're giving too good of
a<00:02:27.010> price<00:02:27.250> here<00:02:27.519> we're<00:02:27.670> giving<00:02:27.760> seven<00:02:28.239> to<00:02:28.329> one

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
a price here we're giving seven to one

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.619 
a price here we're giving seven to one
on<00:02:28.629> a<00:02:28.689> call<00:02:28.959> with<00:02:29.349> some<00:02:30.040> implied<00:02:30.370> odds<00:02:30.609> and<00:02:31.030> I

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
on a call with some implied odds and I

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.479 
on a call with some implied odds and I
just<00:02:31.989> think<00:02:32.079> this<00:02:32.260> isn't<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.950> situation<00:02:33.159> where

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
just think this isn't a situation where

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.660 
just think this isn't a situation where
we<00:02:33.579> need<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.760> bet<00:02:33.969> so<00:02:34.329> small<00:02:34.810> now<00:02:35.650> obviously<00:02:36.519> if

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
we need to bet so small now obviously if

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.979 
we need to bet so small now obviously if
we<00:02:36.760> bet<00:02:36.879> a<00:02:36.909> thousand<00:02:37.269> were<00:02:37.329> giving<00:02:37.599> about

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
we bet a thousand were giving about

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.750 
we bet a thousand were giving about
seven<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.349> one<00:02:38.530> if<00:02:38.799> we<00:02:38.980> bet<00:02:39.189> something<00:02:39.519> like

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
seven to one if we bet something like

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.220 
seven to one if we bet something like
two<00:02:39.939> thousand<00:02:40.420> we're<00:02:40.540> still<00:02:40.720> getting<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:41.049> good

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
two thousand we're still getting a good

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.589 
two thousand we're still getting a good
price<00:02:41.590> but<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.579> still<00:02:42.939> think<00:02:43.239> one<00:02:43.450> they're

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
price but I still think one they're

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.720 
price but I still think one they're
gonna<00:02:43.659> continue<00:02:43.959> on<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.829> turn<00:02:45.189> at<00:02:45.430> roughly

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
gonna continue on the turn at roughly

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.640 
gonna continue on the turn at roughly
the<00:02:45.819> same<00:02:45.909> frequency<00:02:46.629> I<00:02:46.870> mean<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.379> think<00:02:47.439> I<00:02:47.590> can

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
the same frequency I mean I think I can

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.080 
the same frequency I mean I think I can
generate<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.069> lot<00:02:48.220> more<00:02:48.370> value<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:48.879> way<00:02:49.030> to

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
generate a lot more value that way to

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.879 
generate a lot more value that way to
plus<00:02:49.569> it<00:02:49.720> also<00:02:49.810> sticks<00:02:50.319> them<00:02:50.500> into<00:02:50.739> maybe

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
plus it also sticks them into maybe

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:52.470 
plus it also sticks them into maybe
feeling<00:02:51.189> a<00:02:51.310> bit<00:02:51.459> more<00:02:51.489> committed<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.239> river

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
feeling a bit more committed to a river

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.039 
feeling a bit more committed to a river
bet

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
bet

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.709 
bet
whereas<00:02:53.650> if<00:02:53.919> say<00:02:54.219> MP<00:02:54.849> two<00:02:55.030> decides<00:02:55.389> to<00:02:55.540> just

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:55.719 
whereas if say MP two decides to just

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:57.780 
whereas if say MP two decides to just
call<00:02:55.989> here<00:02:56.379> and<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.590> decided<00:02:56.889> jam<00:02:57.159> the<00:02:57.340> river<00:02:57.519> he

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
call here and I decided jam the river he

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.819 
call here and I decided jam the river he
may<00:02:57.909> not<00:02:58.060> feel<00:02:58.299> as<00:02:58.450> comfortable<00:02:58.959> calling<00:02:59.709> at

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
may not feel as comfortable calling at

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.470 
may not feel as comfortable calling at
that<00:02:59.980> point<00:03:00.250> because<00:03:00.310> he<00:03:00.489> didn't<00:03:00.760> invest<00:03:01.209> as

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
that point because he didn't invest as

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.990 
that point because he didn't invest as
much<00:03:01.530> on<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.739> earlier<00:03:03.069> streets<00:03:03.489> again<00:03:03.819> the

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
much on the earlier streets again the

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.670 
much on the earlier streets again the
flop<00:03:04.239> in<00:03:04.419> the<00:03:04.450> turn<00:03:04.719> I<00:03:04.750> think<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.139> sizing<00:03:05.530> it's

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
flop in the turn I think the sizing it's

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.250 
flop in the turn I think the sizing it's
gonna<00:03:05.799> be<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.099> major<00:03:06.280> issue<00:03:06.549> here<00:03:07.139> so<00:03:08.139> again

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
gonna be the major issue here so again

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.080 
gonna be the major issue here so again
like<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.620> fact<00:03:08.889> that<00:03:08.919> we're<00:03:09.069> betting<00:03:09.250> I<00:03:09.549> just

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
like the fact that we're betting I just

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.429 
like the fact that we're betting I just
want<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.329> see<00:03:10.419> it<00:03:10.510> larger<00:03:10.870> it's<00:03:11.079> still<00:03:11.349> gonna

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:11.439 
want to see it larger it's still gonna

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.229 
want to see it larger it's still gonna
be<00:03:11.530> perceived<00:03:12.159> as<00:03:12.340> getting<00:03:12.519> a<00:03:12.639> good<00:03:12.760> price<00:03:13.060> if

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
be perceived as getting a good price if

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.670 
be perceived as getting a good price if
we<00:03:13.269> bet<00:03:13.540> two<00:03:13.750> thousand<00:03:14.229> we're<00:03:14.349> giving<00:03:14.590> them

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
we bet two thousand we're giving them

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.589 
we bet two thousand we're giving them
four<00:03:14.949> to<00:03:15.040> one<00:03:15.159> on<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.370> call<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.940> lot<00:03:16.299> of<00:03:16.419> players

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
four to one on a call a lot of players

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.390 
four to one on a call a lot of players
will<00:03:16.720> get<00:03:16.840> very<00:03:17.079> excited<00:03:17.530> about<00:03:17.590> calling<00:03:18.099> four

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
will get very excited about calling four

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.610 
will get very excited about calling four
to<00:03:18.489> one<00:03:18.639> even<00:03:19.120> with<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.510> dominated<00:03:20.079> flush<00:03:20.379> like

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
to one even with a dominated flush like

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.309 
to one even with a dominated flush like
the<00:03:20.829> naked<00:03:21.190> queen<00:03:21.609> of<00:03:21.729> clubs<00:03:21.970> maybe<00:03:22.720> two<00:03:22.989> pair

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
the naked queen of clubs maybe two pair

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.960 
the naked queen of clubs maybe two pair
I<00:03:23.739> don't<00:03:24.099> think<00:03:24.250> they're<00:03:24.370> gonna<00:03:24.459> be<00:03:24.639> too<00:03:24.819> many

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
I don't think they're gonna be too many

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.580 
I don't think they're gonna be too many
sets<00:03:25.299> here<00:03:25.569> just<00:03:25.810> some<00:03:25.870> because<00:03:26.139> I<00:03:26.229> assume

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
sets here just some because I assume

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.629 
sets here just some because I assume
that<00:03:26.620> they<00:03:26.979> probably<00:03:27.220> would<00:03:27.430> have<00:03:27.459> gotten

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
that they probably would have gotten

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.420 
that they probably would have gotten
raised<00:03:27.909> on<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.239> flop<00:03:28.540> but<00:03:29.199> whatever<00:03:29.859> is<00:03:30.189> what

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
raised on the flop but whatever is what

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.800 
raised on the flop but whatever is what
it<00:03:30.519> is<00:03:30.669> this<00:03:30.909> limit<00:03:31.239> we<00:03:31.329> can't<00:03:31.510> be<00:03:31.629> too

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
it is this limit we can't be too

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.500 
it is this limit we can't be too
surprised<00:03:32.199> about<00:03:32.379> things<00:03:33.030> end<00:03:34.030> up<00:03:34.180> getting

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
surprised about things end up getting

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.219 
surprised about things end up getting
called<00:03:35.229> by<00:03:35.650> mp2<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:36.760> call<00:03:37.540> by<00:03:37.689> the<00:03:37.750> small<00:03:38.019> mind

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:38.229 
called by mp2 and call by the small mind

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:40.679 
called by mp2 and call by the small mind
and<00:03:38.620> call<00:03:39.040> by<00:03:39.129> the<00:03:39.189> big<00:03:39.370> blind<00:03:39.549> as<00:03:39.849> well<00:03:39.879> so

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:40.689 
and call by the big blind as well so

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:42.960 
and call by the big blind as well so
very<00:03:41.259> very<00:03:41.530> obviously<00:03:42.009> a<00:03:42.069> micro<00:03:42.430> tournament

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
very very obviously a micro tournament

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.170 
very very obviously a micro tournament
dynamic<00:03:43.449> check<00:03:44.290> check<00:03:44.799> here<00:03:45.430> decides<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:46.000> rip

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
dynamic check check here decides to rip

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.240 
dynamic check check here decides to rip
it<00:03:46.359> and<00:03:46.599> again<00:03:47.109> like<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.680> fact<00:03:47.889> that<00:03:48.009> we're

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
it and again like the fact that we're

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.179 
it and again like the fact that we're
repping<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:48.759> here<00:03:49.150> I<00:03:49.299> think<00:03:49.750> that<00:03:49.989> if<00:03:50.859> we<00:03:51.069> had

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:51.189 
repping it here I think that if we had

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.099 
repping it here I think that if we had
bent<00:03:51.400> larger<00:03:51.849> on<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.120> flop<00:03:52.509> in<00:03:52.720> term<00:03:52.930> we

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
bent larger on the flop in term we

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.240 
bent larger on the flop in term we
probably<00:03:53.349> still<00:03:53.590> would<00:03:53.709> have<00:03:53.799> gotten<00:03:53.979> very

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
probably still would have gotten very

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.249 
probably still would have gotten very
similar<00:03:54.669> continuance<00:03:55.269> from<00:03:55.449> these<00:03:55.599> guys<00:03:55.840> it

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:56.259 
similar continuance from these guys it

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:57.569 
similar continuance from these guys it
just<00:03:56.650> would<00:03:56.769> have<00:03:56.859> given<00:03:57.009> them<00:03:57.159> an<00:03:57.340> even

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
just would have given them an even

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.520 
just would have given them an even
better<00:03:57.879> price<00:03:58.269> to<00:03:58.629> call<00:03:58.959> us<00:03:59.079> on<00:03:59.259> the<00:03:59.349> river

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
better price to call us on the river

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.689 
better price to call us on the river
which<00:03:59.739> obviously<00:04:00.069> we're<00:04:00.280> comforted<00:04:00.609> with

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:00.699 
which obviously we're comforted with

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.969 
which obviously we're comforted with
when<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.750> know<00:04:01.870> majority<00:04:02.319> of<00:04:02.409> rivers<00:04:02.680> are<00:04:02.829> not

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:02.979 
when you know majority of rivers are not

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:04.890 
when you know majority of rivers are not
going<00:04:03.310> to<00:04:03.400> pair<00:04:03.579> the<00:04:03.729> board<00:04:03.939> and<00:04:04.209> again<00:04:04.569> even

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
going to pair the board and again even

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.509 
going to pair the board and again even
though<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.109> board<00:04:05.319> did<00:04:05.500> pair<00:04:05.739> I'm<00:04:05.949> not<00:04:06.129> super

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
though the board did pair I'm not super

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.009 
though the board did pair I'm not super
worried<00:04:06.790> about<00:04:06.970> it<00:04:07.150> could<00:04:07.449> they<00:04:07.540> have<00:04:07.659> a<00:04:07.720> boat

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
worried about it could they have a boat

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.319 
worried about it could they have a boat
or<00:04:08.620> do<00:04:09.159> I<00:04:09.220> expect<00:04:09.549> to<00:04:09.609> see<00:04:09.639> a<00:04:09.790> ton<00:04:10.030> of<00:04:10.060> them

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
or do I expect to see a ton of them

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.899 
or do I expect to see a ton of them
mm-hmm<00:04:11.379> not<00:04:11.590> really<00:04:11.859> but<00:04:12.340> whatever

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
mm-hmm not really but whatever

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:14.159 
mm-hmm not really but whatever
definitely<00:04:13.449> still<00:04:13.569> gonna<00:04:13.659> be<00:04:13.810> shoving

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
definitely still gonna be shoving

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.539 
definitely still gonna be shoving
they're<00:04:14.319> still<00:04:14.530> second<00:04:14.829> best<00:04:14.859> hands<00:04:15.189> they<00:04:15.370> can

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
they're still second best hands they can

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:16.769 
they're still second best hands they can
I<00:04:15.609> will<00:04:15.819> call<00:04:16.060> they're<00:04:16.269> still<00:04:16.479> getting<00:04:16.570> a

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:16.779 
I will call they're still getting a

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.300 
I will call they're still getting a
price<00:04:17.049> blah<00:04:17.440> blah<00:04:17.590> blah

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
price blah blah blah

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.960 
price blah blah blah
so<00:04:19.060> we<00:04:19.180> end<00:04:19.299> up<00:04:19.329> getting<00:04:19.450> looked<00:04:19.720> up<00:04:19.870> by<00:04:20.019> mp2<00:04:20.470> on

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
so we end up getting looked up by mp2 on

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.490 
so we end up getting looked up by mp2 on
unfortunately<00:04:21.970> he<00:04:22.120> ends<00:04:22.300> up<00:04:22.360> having<00:04:22.420> the<00:04:23.050> set

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
unfortunately he ends up having the set

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.680 
unfortunately he ends up having the set
that<00:04:23.770> river<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.130> boat<00:04:24.310> sucks<00:04:24.820> to<00:04:25.000> be<00:04:25.120> us<00:04:25.150> we

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
that river the boat sucks to be us we

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.320 
that river the boat sucks to be us we
end<00:04:25.810> up<00:04:25.900> losing<00:04:26.170> the<00:04:26.260> pod<00:04:26.440> it<00:04:26.620> is<00:04:26.770> what<00:04:26.950> it<00:04:27.070> is

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
end up losing the pod it is what it is

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.850 
end up losing the pod it is what it is
so<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.480> result<00:04:28.810> is<00:04:28.990> not<00:04:29.169> the<00:04:29.290> important<00:04:29.710> thing

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
so the result is not the important thing

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.320 
so the result is not the important thing
here<00:04:30.040> what's<00:04:30.220> really<00:04:30.550> important<00:04:31.000> is<00:04:31.120> that<00:04:31.150> we

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
here what's really important is that we

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.020 
here what's really important is that we
made<00:04:32.200> good<00:04:32.560> decisions<00:04:32.590> leading<00:04:33.400> up<00:04:33.669> to<00:04:33.700> the

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
made good decisions leading up to the

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.460 
made good decisions leading up to the
results<00:04:34.450> and<00:04:34.540> again<00:04:34.810> I<00:04:34.840> like<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.200> fact<00:04:35.380> that

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
results and again I like the fact that

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.409 
results and again I like the fact that
we're<00:04:35.620> betting<00:04:36.010> that<00:04:36.040> action<00:04:36.669> itself<00:04:37.090> looked

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
we're betting that action itself looked

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.200 
we're betting that action itself looked
good<00:04:37.690> but<00:04:38.410> the<00:04:38.560> detail<00:04:39.070> in<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.370> action<00:04:39.820> for

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
good but the detail in the action for

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.120 
good but the detail in the action for
the<00:04:40.300> size<00:04:40.570> did<00:04:41.080> not<00:04:41.290> look<00:04:41.530> as<00:04:41.680> good

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
the size did not look as good

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.100 
the size did not look as good
so<00:04:42.550> again<00:04:42.820> flop<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:43.419> turn<00:04:43.600> are<00:04:43.720> gonna<00:04:43.840> be<00:04:44.020> the

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
so again flop and turn are gonna be the

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.840 
so again flop and turn are gonna be the
major<00:04:44.290> inflection<00:04:44.650> points<00:04:45.310> definitely<00:04:45.730> need

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
major inflection points definitely need

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.180 
major inflection points definitely need
to<00:04:45.910> be<00:04:46.030> Betty<00:04:46.240> and<00:04:46.419> larger<00:04:46.810> giving<00:04:47.620> someone<00:04:47.830> 7

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
to be Betty and larger giving someone 7

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.560 
to be Betty and larger giving someone 7
to<00:04:48.250> 1<00:04:48.400> at<00:04:48.490> a<00:04:48.580> turn<00:04:48.820> when<00:04:49.060> they<00:04:49.150> would<00:04:49.240> gladly

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
to 1 at a turn when they would gladly

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.780 
to 1 at a turn when they would gladly
take<00:04:49.930> 4<00:04:50.260> to<00:04:50.380> 1<00:04:50.560> means<00:04:51.100> you<00:04:51.280> should<00:04:51.490> bet<00:04:51.669> the

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
take 4 to 1 means you should bet the

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.400 
take 4 to 1 means you should bet the
price<00:04:52.000> that<00:04:52.180> gives<00:04:52.360> them<00:04:52.510> 4<00:04:52.780> to<00:04:52.870> 1<00:04:53.020> there's

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
price that gives them 4 to 1 there's

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.659 
price that gives them 4 to 1 there's
just<00:04:53.560> kind<00:04:53.650> of<00:04:53.740> no<00:04:53.860> way<00:04:54.010> around<00:04:54.130> that<00:04:54.370> so

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
just kind of no way around that so

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:55.860 
just kind of no way around that so
that's<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:54.970> way<00:04:55.060> that<00:04:55.090> I<00:04:55.270> would<00:04:55.330> visualize

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
that's the way that I would visualize

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.570 
that's the way that I would visualize
that<00:04:56.080> turn<00:04:56.350> spot<00:04:56.650> do<00:04:56.800> I<00:04:56.860> need<00:04:57.130> to<00:04:57.280> give<00:04:57.400> them

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
that turn spot do I need to give them

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.880 
that turn spot do I need to give them
such<00:04:57.790> a<00:04:57.820> sick<00:04:58.120> price<00:04:58.390> or<00:04:58.870> are<00:04:59.410> they<00:04:59.530> gonna<00:04:59.710> be

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
such a sick price or are they gonna be

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.370 
such a sick price or are they gonna be
inelastic<00:05:00.130> and<00:05:00.640> fishy<00:05:01.000> and<00:05:01.419> continue<00:05:02.110> at<00:05:02.230> that

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
inelastic and fishy and continue at that

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.620 
inelastic and fishy and continue at that
second<00:05:02.800> best<00:05:02.980> hand<00:05:03.250> at<00:05:03.520> either<00:05:03.970> price<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:04.540> if

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630
