hey everyone I'm going to go over five

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.530 
hey everyone I'm going to go over five
basic<00:00:07.980> fundamentals<00:00:08.639> that<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:09.179> should<00:00:09.360> know

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
basic fundamentals that you should know

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.089 
basic fundamentals that you should know
for<00:00:10.050> indoor<00:00:10.320> rock<00:00:10.500> climbing

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
for indoor rock climbing

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.100 
for indoor rock climbing
one<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.730> first<00:00:11.880> fundamentals<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.719> just

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
one of the first fundamentals is just

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.259 
one of the first fundamentals is just
general<00:00:13.440> body<00:00:13.740> awareness<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.400> being<00:00:14.940> able<00:00:15.059> to

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
general body awareness and being able to

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.540 
general body awareness and being able to
identify<00:00:15.750> your<00:00:15.900> center<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.289> gravity<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.949> want

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
identify your center of gravity you want

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.330 
identify your center of gravity you want
to<00:00:17.670> use<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.660> be<00:00:18.810> able<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.680> keep<00:00:20.160> your

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
to use that to be able to keep your

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.400 
to use that to be able to keep your
weight<00:00:20.609> in<00:00:20.760> balance<00:00:21.449> which<00:00:21.990> would<00:00:22.170> be<00:00:22.289> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
weight in balance which would be the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.109 
weight in balance which would be the
second<00:00:22.830> fundamental<00:00:23.400> learning<00:00:23.820> how<00:00:24.090> to

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
second fundamental learning how to

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.439 
second fundamental learning how to
balance<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.960> shift<00:00:25.320> your<00:00:25.500> weight<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.449> once

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
balance and shift your weight and once

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.640 
balance and shift your weight and once
you've<00:00:27.570> identified<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:28.109> center<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.560> gravity

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
you've identified that center of gravity

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.099 
you've identified that center of gravity
keeping<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.640> weight<00:00:29.820> over<00:00:30.029> your<00:00:30.330> feet<00:00:30.570> so

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
keeping that weight over your feet so

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.299 
keeping that weight over your feet so
you're<00:00:31.230> going<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.380> be<00:00:31.529> pushing<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:32.160> your

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
you're going to be pushing with your

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.120 
you're going to be pushing with your
legs<00:00:32.579> rather<00:00:33.120> than<00:00:33.390> pulling<00:00:33.780> with<00:00:33.930> your<00:00:33.960> arms

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
legs rather than pulling with your arms

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.560 
legs rather than pulling with your arms
which<00:00:35.130> brings<00:00:35.399> us<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.820> next<00:00:35.969> fundamental

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
which brings us to the next fundamental

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.049 
which brings us to the next fundamental
of<00:00:36.719> climbing<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.469> straight<00:00:37.890> arms<00:00:38.059> using

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
of climbing with straight arms using

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.660 
of climbing with straight arms using
this<00:00:39.360> position<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.079> much<00:00:40.649> more<00:00:40.860> beneficial<00:00:41.370> as

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
this position is much more beneficial as

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.520 
this position is much more beneficial as
far<00:00:41.760> as<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> efficiency<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.780> your<00:00:43.050> movement

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
far as the efficiency of your movement

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.830 
far as the efficiency of your movement
goes<00:00:43.770> right<00:00:44.579> now<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:44.940> my<00:00:45.090> arms<00:00:45.329> straight<00:00:45.660> I'm

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
goes right now with my arms straight I'm

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.110 
goes right now with my arms straight I'm
not<00:00:46.050> taking<00:00:46.469> any<00:00:46.680> energy<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.250> pull<00:00:47.489> myself<00:00:47.670> in

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
not taking any energy to pull myself in

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.510 
not taking any energy to pull myself in
you<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.809> see<00:00:48.989> my<00:00:49.140> left<00:00:49.350> leg<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.620> bent<00:00:49.950> here<00:00:50.250> so

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
you can see my left leg is bent here so

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.670 
you can see my left leg is bent here so
as<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.820> initiate<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.420> movement<00:00:51.480> up<00:00:51.960> I'll<00:00:52.230> be

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
as I initiate this movement up I'll be

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.779 
as I initiate this movement up I'll be
pushing<00:00:52.949> rather<00:00:53.699> than<00:00:53.940> pulling<00:00:55.489> that<00:00:56.489> allows

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
pushing rather than pulling that allows

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.750 
pushing rather than pulling that allows
for<00:00:57.090> much<00:00:57.300> more<00:00:57.510> efficient<00:00:57.989> motion<00:00:58.550> we<00:00:59.550> also

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
for much more efficient motion we also

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.729 
for much more efficient motion we also
have<00:01:00.090> two<00:01:00.420> other<00:01:00.600> basic<00:01:01.199> fundamental

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
have two other basic fundamental

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.260 
have two other basic fundamental
techniques<00:01:02.160> known<00:01:02.609> as<00:01:02.910> edging<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.920> flagging

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
techniques known as edging and flagging

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.609 
techniques known as edging and flagging
edging<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.420> when<00:01:06.869> you're<00:01:06.990> using<00:01:07.229> your

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
edging is when you're using your

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.300 
edging is when you're using your
climbing<00:01:08.340> shoes<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:10.880> basically<00:01:12.590> be<00:01:13.590> edging<00:01:14.189> on

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
climbing shoes to basically be edging on

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.539 
climbing shoes to basically be edging on
a<00:01:14.340> hold<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.200> use<00:01:16.380> both<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.799> inside<00:01:17.280> edge

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
a hold so I can use both the inside edge

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.149 
a hold so I can use both the inside edge
and<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.600> outside<00:01:19.049> edge<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.439> my<00:01:19.740> climbing

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
and the outside edge of my climbing

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.850 
and the outside edge of my climbing
shoes<00:01:20.369> both<00:01:21.000> should<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.330> applied<00:01:21.860> frequently

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
shoes both should be applied frequently

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.649 
shoes both should be applied frequently
to<00:01:23.100> change<00:01:23.400> your<00:01:23.580> body<00:01:23.670> position<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.420> help

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
to change your body position and help

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.819 
to change your body position and help
you<00:01:24.780> move<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.229> balance<00:01:25.950> for<00:01:26.159> example<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.840> can

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
you move in balance for example I can

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.230 
you move in balance for example I can
use<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.100> outside<00:01:29.520> edge<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.820> my<00:01:29.970> right<00:01:30.180> foot

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
use the outside edge of my right foot

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.420 
use the outside edge of my right foot
here<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:31.200> keep<00:01:31.320> my<00:01:31.500> right<00:01:31.710> hip<00:01:31.890> close<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
here to keep my right hip close to the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.030 
here to keep my right hip close to the
wall<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.540> as<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.780> move<00:01:33.990> up<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.590> center<00:01:34.950> of

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
wall so that as I move up that center of

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.950 
wall so that as I move up that center of
gravity<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.119> stay<00:01:36.299> over<00:01:36.570> my<00:01:36.720> leg

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
gravity is going to stay over my leg

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.200 
gravity is going to stay over my leg
allowing<00:01:37.530> me<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.680> push<00:01:38.009> rather<00:01:38.670> than<00:01:38.909> pull

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
allowing me to push rather than pull

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.450 
allowing me to push rather than pull
I've<00:01:39.810> also<00:01:40.049> grabbed<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.680> next<00:01:41.009> hold<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.430> a

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
I've also grabbed that next hold with a

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.700 
I've also grabbed that next hold with a
straight<00:01:41.880> arm<00:01:42.060> rather<00:01:42.780> than<00:01:43.020> with<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> bent<00:01:43.530> arm

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
straight arm rather than with a bent arm

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.100 
straight arm rather than with a bent arm
saving<00:01:44.399> me<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> little<00:01:44.759> bit<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.000> energy

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.230 

flagging<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> technique<00:01:50.250> that's

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
flagging is a technique that's

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.569 
flagging is a technique that's
fundamental<00:01:51.990> once<00:01:52.619> again<00:01:52.920> for<00:01:53.159> keeping<00:01:53.460> your

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
fundamental once again for keeping your

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.359 
fundamental once again for keeping your
balance<00:01:54.049> flagging<00:01:55.049> comes<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.500> handy<00:01:55.680> when<00:01:56.159> all

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
balance flagging comes in handy when all

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.490 
balance flagging comes in handy when all
of<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> holds<00:01:57.210> are<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> same<00:01:58.170> side<00:01:58.469> of

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
of the holds are on the same side of

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.749 
of the holds are on the same side of
your<00:01:58.740> body<00:01:58.950> right<00:01:59.909> now<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.750> stay<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.079> balance

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.459 
your body right now to stay in balance
it'd<00:02:02.759> be<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.000> little<00:02:03.149> tricky<00:02:03.630> for<00:02:03.810> me<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.259> move

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
it'd be a little tricky for me to move

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.830 
it'd be a little tricky for me to move
without<00:02:04.680> having<00:02:05.159> my<00:02:05.280> body<00:02:05.460> kind<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.570> swing

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
without having my body kind of swing

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.359 
without having my body kind of swing
around<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.229> little<00:02:07.439> bit<00:02:07.590> which<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.920> big<00:02:08.160> waste

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
around a little bit which is a big waste

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.449 
around a little bit which is a big waste
of<00:02:08.580> energy<00:02:09.080> so<00:02:10.080> with<00:02:10.229> one<00:02:10.440> foot<00:02:10.709> up<00:02:10.890> with<00:02:11.310> my

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
of energy so with one foot up with my

of energy so with one foot up with my
right<00:02:11.700> hand<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.239> right<00:02:12.840> foot<00:02:12.870> in<00:02:13.170> line

right hand and right foot in line
I<00:02:13.890> can<00:02:14.310> flag<00:02:14.580> my<00:02:14.790> left<00:02:15.030> foot<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.780> help<00:02:15.990> keep

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
I can flag my left foot to help keep

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.730 
I can flag my left foot to help keep
that<00:02:16.380> center<00:02:16.710> of<00:02:16.740> gravity<00:02:16.830> better<00:02:17.820> aligned

what<00:02:19.740> that<00:02:19.920> would<00:02:20.070> look<00:02:20.100> like<00:02:20.280> well<00:02:20.670> moving

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
what that would look like well moving

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.490 
what that would look like well moving
would<00:02:23.340> be<00:02:23.520> either<00:02:24.000> flagging<00:02:24.870> in<00:02:24.990> this

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
would be either flagging in this

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.350 
would be either flagging in this
direction<00:02:25.710> to<00:02:26.520> keep<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.910> center<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.300> gravity

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
direction to keep that center of gravity

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.920

centered over my foot or if I switch
hands<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.440> feet<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:32.000> can<00:02:33.000> flag<00:02:33.210> in<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.420> other

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
hands and feet I can flag in the other

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.090 
hands and feet I can flag in the other
direction<00:02:33.960> to<00:02:34.380> highlight<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.890> same

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
direction to highlight the same

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:47.270 
direction to highlight the same
principle<00:02:43.640> okay<00:02:44.640> take<00:02:45.710> all<00:02:46.710> right<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.130> that

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
principle okay take all right so that

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.760 
principle okay take all right so that
was<00:02:47.400> five<00:02:47.670> fundamentals<00:02:48.510> for<00:02:49.260> rock<00:02:49.500> climbing

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
was five fundamentals for rock climbing

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.070
