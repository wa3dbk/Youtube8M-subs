can get on it and if they find that the

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.639 
can get on it and if they find that the
risk<00:01:51.280> increases<00:01:52.060> more<00:01:52.270> than<00:01:52.299> that<00:01:52.659> by<00:01:52.869> an

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
risk increases more than that by an

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.289 
risk increases more than that by an
incredible<00:01:54.280> risk<00:01:54.549> then<00:01:54.879> there's<00:01:55.119> always

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
incredible risk then there's always

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.520 
incredible risk then there's always
something<00:01:55.719> that<00:01:55.840> increases<00:01:56.020> through<00:01:56.409> his

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
something that increases through his

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.619 
something that increases through his
development<00:01:57.060> then<00:01:58.060> they<00:01:58.239> would<00:01:58.420> know<00:01:58.599> that

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:58.629 
development then they would know that

00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:01.050 
development then they would know that
that<00:01:59.140> they<00:01:59.799> taught<00:02:00.219> needs<00:02:00.579> a<00:02:00.700> different

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
that they taught needs a different

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.880 
that they taught needs a different
treatment<00:02:01.270> or<00:02:01.659> use<00:02:01.959> it<00:02:02.110> in<00:02:02.200> a<00:02:02.319> different<00:02:02.439> way

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
treatment or use it in a different way

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.589 
treatment or use it in a different way
