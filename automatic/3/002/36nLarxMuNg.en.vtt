00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
we'll go over that in a bit but let's

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.450 
we'll go over that in a bit but let's
take<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> look<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.200> what<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.470> has<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:08.250> was

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
take a look and what it has this was

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.140 
take a look and what it has this was
made<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.180> kind<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.939> almost<00:01:11.939> like<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
made of a kind of like a almost like a

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.600 
made of a kind of like a almost like a
ballistic<00:01:12.450> nylon<00:01:12.780> material<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.950> front<00:01:14.130> so

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
ballistic nylon material on the front so

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.289 
ballistic nylon material on the front so
it<00:01:14.820> keeps<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.119> elements<00:01:15.360> away<00:01:15.840> from<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:17.270> peat

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
it keeps the elements away from the peat

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.630 
it keeps the elements away from the peat
whether<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.439> insulates<00:01:20.009> pretty<00:01:20.369> well

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
whether it's insulates pretty well

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.940 
whether it's insulates pretty well
actually<00:01:21.020> have<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.200> sitting<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> Sun

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
actually have this sitting in the Sun

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.880 
actually have this sitting in the Sun
for<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> while<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.270> actually<00:01:24.750> barely<00:01:25.619> got

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
for a while and it actually barely got

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.550 
for a while and it actually barely got
pretty<00:01:26.250> hot<00:01:26.490> inside<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.299> was<00:01:27.390> just<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.049> little

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
pretty hot inside it was just a little

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.960 
pretty hot inside it was just a little
bit<00:01:28.650> warm<00:01:28.829> inside<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.280> guess<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.729> works

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
bit warm inside so I guess it works

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.569

like that and then you have your memory
cards<00:02:52.840> pockets<00:02:53.590> here<00:02:53.770> so<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.010> hold<00:02:54.160> your

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
little memory in there really cool stuff

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.800 
little memory in there really cool stuff
I<00:02:56.980> think<00:02:57.040> it's<00:02:57.459> one<00:02:57.940> my<00:02:58.030> favorite<00:02:58.420> ones<00:02:58.630> here

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
I think it's one my favorite ones here

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.780 
I think it's one my favorite ones here
so<00:02:58.989> and<00:02:59.650> then<00:02:59.739> this<00:02:59.980> is<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.250> main<00:03:00.400> compartment

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
so and then this is the main compartment

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.920 
so and then this is the main compartment
has<00:03:01.270> a<00:03:01.630> full<00:03:02.230> zip<00:03:02.580> so<00:03:03.580> it's<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.850> dual<00:03:04.090> strap<00:03:04.570> zip

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
has a full zip so it's a dual strap zip

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.630 
has a full zip so it's a dual strap zip
here<00:03:06.870> so<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:07.959> goes<00:03:08.080> in<00:03:08.260> two<00:03:08.410> ways<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.489> has<00:03:09.610> a

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
here so it goes in two ways and it has a

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.540 
here so it goes in two ways and it has a
safety<00:03:09.910> latch<00:03:10.570> so<00:03:11.530> this<00:03:11.800> will<00:03:12.010> get<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.340> into

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
safety latch so this will get you into

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.150 
safety latch so this will get you into
the<00:03:12.910> interior<00:03:13.510> of<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.989> bag<00:03:14.140> so<00:03:14.170> let's<00:03:14.800> open

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
the interior of the bag so let's open

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.580 
the interior of the bag so let's open
like<00:03:15.459> that<00:03:15.660> this<00:03:16.660> is<00:03:16.810> also<00:03:16.989> good<00:03:17.350> if<00:03:17.470> you're

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
like that this is also good if you're

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.560 
like that this is also good if you're
just<00:03:17.739> you<00:03:17.890> know<00:03:17.950> walking<00:03:18.370> around<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:19.060> then

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
just you know walking around and then

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.970 
just you know walking around and then
you<00:03:19.660> don't<00:03:19.810> want<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:19.989> keep<00:03:20.140> zipping<00:03:20.680> all<00:03:20.830> the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
you don't want to keep zipping all the

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.130 
you don't want to keep zipping all the
time<00:03:21.220> you<00:03:21.820> can<00:03:21.940> just<00:03:22.090> have<00:03:22.239> this<00:03:22.390> locked<00:03:22.690> in<00:03:22.930> so

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
time you can just have this locked in so

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.380 
time you can just have this locked in so
it<00:03:23.260> keeps<00:03:23.410> your<00:03:23.590> camera<00:03:24.040> inside<00:03:24.340> secure<00:03:24.850> so

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
it keeps your camera inside secure so

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.640 
it keeps your camera inside secure so
then<00:03:25.540> open<00:03:26.080> it<00:03:26.170> up<00:03:26.260> like<00:03:26.380> that

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
then open it up like that

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.440 
then open it up like that
then<00:03:27.310> when<00:03:27.430> you're<00:03:27.580> ready<00:03:27.610> so<00:03:28.060> here's<00:03:28.299> the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
then when you're ready so here's the

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.130 
then when you're ready so here's the
inside<00:03:28.810> of<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.950> bag<00:03:30.450> so<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.570> stick<00:03:31.840> your<00:03:31.959> lens

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
inside of the bag so you stick your lens

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.660 
inside of the bag so you stick your lens
through<00:03:32.380> there<00:03:32.620> and<00:03:32.830> then<00:03:32.950> this<00:03:33.130> is<00:03:33.340> a<00:03:33.370> cool

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
through there and then this is a cool

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.120 
through there and then this is a cool
little<00:03:34.049> stopper<00:03:35.049> I<00:03:35.110> guess<00:03:35.290> it<00:03:35.500> kind<00:03:35.709> of<00:03:35.799> holds

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
little stopper I guess it kind of holds

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.039 
little stopper I guess it kind of holds
it<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.370> stuff<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:36.880> prevent<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.450> camera<00:03:37.900> from

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
it to stuff to prevent the camera from

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.330 
it to stuff to prevent the camera from
shaking<00:03:38.350> around<00:03:38.590> in<00:03:38.980> there<00:03:39.100> it's<00:03:39.220> like<00:03:39.250> a

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
shaking around in there it's like a

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.699 
shaking around in there it's like a
little<00:03:39.400> base<00:03:40.209> there<00:03:40.630> so<00:03:40.959> let<00:03:41.230> me<00:03:41.290> show<00:03:41.470> you<00:03:41.560> I

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
little base there so let me show you I

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:48.270 
little base there so let me show you I
have<00:03:41.920> my<00:03:42.040> camera<00:03:42.459> right<00:03:42.640> now<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:47.500> his<00:03:48.070> next
