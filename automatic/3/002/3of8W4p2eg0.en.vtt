the first two strokes because 99% of

playing great-sounding flam akyüz is

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.000 
playing great-sounding flam akyüz is
perfecting<00:00:51.600> those<00:00:51.719> first<00:00:52.050> two<00:00:52.260> strokes<00:00:52.620> the

perfecting those first two strokes the
rest<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.610> pretty<00:00:53.850> much<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.059> breeze<00:00:54.390> so

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
rest of it is pretty much a breeze so

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.130 
rest of it is pretty much a breeze so
make<00:00:55.590> sure<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.980> every<00:00:56.520> single<00:00:56.730> flam<00:00:57.180> sounds

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
make sure that every single flam sounds

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:10.130 
make sure that every single flam sounds
great<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.739> has<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.280> proper<00:00:59.699> spacing<00:01:09.140> now

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
great and has the proper spacing now

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.890 
great and has the proper spacing now
we'll<00:01:10.710> add<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.920> last<00:01:11.280> three<00:01:11.850> strokes<00:01:12.210> if<00:01:12.510> you

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
we'll add the last three strokes if you

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.960 
we'll add the last three strokes if you
look<00:01:13.110> at<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.890> simply<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> right<00:01:14.640> handed

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
look at it it's simply a right handed

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.899 
look at it it's simply a right handed
upstroke<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.840> left<00:01:16.439> handed<00:01:16.710> tap<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.700> right

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
upstroke a left handed tap and a right

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.880 
upstroke a left handed tap and a right
handed<00:01:18.299> flam<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.680> looks<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:21.890> now

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
handed flam so it looks like this now

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.289 
handed flam so it looks like this now
you<00:01:23.250> don't<00:01:23.400> really<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.850> get<00:01:24.000> too

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
you don't really have to get too

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.789 
you don't really have to get too
detailed<00:01:24.750> into<00:01:25.320> up<00:01:25.979> tap<00:01:26.580> down<00:01:27.060> okay<00:01:27.720> really<00:01:28.409> it

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
detailed into up tap down okay really it

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.710 
detailed into up tap down okay really it
makes<00:01:29.070> sense<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.549> if<00:01:29.670> you're<00:01:29.820> playing<00:01:30.119> to

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
makes sense that if you're playing to

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.749 
makes sense that if you're playing to
soft<00:01:31.079> notes<00:01:31.320> followed<00:01:31.650> by<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> loud<00:01:32.189> note<00:01:32.490> you

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
soft notes followed by a loud note you

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:41.450 
soft notes followed by a loud note you
have<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.090> lift<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.450> right<00:01:33.630> hand<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.950> play

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
have to lift that right hand so play

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.310 
have to lift that right hand so play
that<00:01:41.700> for<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> little<00:01:42.299> bit<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.659> get<00:01:43.110> really

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
that for a little bit and get really

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.590 
that for a little bit and get really
used<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:44.490> kind<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.759> flowing<00:01:45.090> with<00:01:45.450> that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
used to just kind of flowing with that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.170 
used to just kind of flowing with that
right<00:01:45.840> hand<00:01:46.110> then<00:01:46.799> put<00:01:47.130> those<00:01:47.670> two<00:01:47.970> together

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
right hand then put those two together

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.510 
right hand then put those two together
now<00:01:48.810> what<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:48.990> like<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> do<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.950> leave<00:01:50.280> some

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
now what I like to do is just leave some

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.340 
now what I like to do is just leave some
space<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.060> between<00:01:51.240> them<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.140> can

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
space in between them so that I can

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:05.840 
space in between them so that I can
think<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.740> them<00:01:52.890> separately<00:01:53.220> first<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:04.850> then

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
think of them separately first and then

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.969 
think of them separately first and then
finally<00:02:06.360> put<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.079> together<00:02:07.200> without<00:02:07.590> that

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
finally put it together without that

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.180 
finally put it together without that
space

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
space

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:26.440 
space
a<00:02:23.770> different<00:02:24.770> rudiment<00:02:25.190> altogether<00:02:25.760> at<00:02:26.090> this

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
a different rudiment altogether at this

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.300 
a different rudiment altogether at this
point<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:26.900> should<00:02:26.930> stop<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.680> video<00:02:28.010> and

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
point you should stop the video and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.270 
point you should stop the video and
practice<00:02:28.850> your<00:02:29.330> flam<00:02:29.600> EQ<00:02:30.020> and<00:02:30.740> all<00:02:31.010> of<00:02:31.160> those

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
practice your flam EQ and all of those

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.940 
practice your flam EQ and all of those
steps<00:02:31.550> that<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:31.940> talked<00:02:32.240> about<00:02:32.390> stop<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.800> go

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
steps that I talked about stop and go

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.170 
steps that I talked about stop and go
practice

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.869 

okay<00:02:40.810> now<00:02:40.989> that<00:02:41.200> you've<00:02:41.379> perfected<00:02:41.860> your<00:02:42.129> flam

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
okay now that you've perfected your flam

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.580 
okay now that you've perfected your flam
akyuu<00:02:43.239> let's<00:02:43.450> apply<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.900> a<00:02:44.019> rudimental<00:02:44.500> a

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
akyuu let's apply it to a rudimental a

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.920 
akyuu let's apply it to a rudimental a
tune<00:02:44.769> goes<00:02:45.519> without<00:02:45.849> saying<00:02:46.209> that<00:02:46.750> if<00:02:46.840> you

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
tune goes without saying that if you

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.289 
tune goes without saying that if you
can't<00:02:47.170> play<00:02:47.349> great<00:02:47.590> flam<00:02:47.830> accuse<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:49.060> can't

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
can't play great flam accuse you can't

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.059 
can't play great flam accuse you can't
play<00:02:49.450> this<00:02:49.599> rudimental<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.200> tune<00:02:50.409> all<00:02:50.890> right<00:02:50.920> if

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
play this rudimental a tune all right if

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.440 
play this rudimental a tune all right if
you<00:02:51.129> look<00:02:51.250> in<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.489> first<00:02:51.670> two<00:02:51.909> measures<00:02:52.090> all

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
you look in the first two measures all

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.380 
you look in the first two measures all
it<00:02:52.720> is<00:02:52.870> two<00:02:53.620> flam<00:02:53.890> accuse<00:02:54.250> then<00:02:54.849> you<00:02:55.060> can<00:02:55.239> go

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
it is two flam accuse then you can go

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.300 
it is two flam accuse then you can go
measure<00:02:55.810> by<00:02:56.080> measure<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.650> just<00:02:56.799> pick<00:02:56.980> out<00:02:57.129> the

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
measure by measure and just pick out the

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.430 
measure by measure and just pick out the
rudiments<00:02:57.819> and<00:02:57.909> it's<00:02:58.510> pretty<00:02:58.720> simple<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.290> work

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
rudiments and it's pretty simple to work

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.830 
rudiments and it's pretty simple to work
up<00:02:59.680> because<00:03:00.069> you<00:03:00.489> practice<00:03:01.090> your<00:03:01.599> rudiments

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
up because you practice your rudiments

up because you practice your rudiments
let<00:03:02.500> me<00:03:02.620> give<00:03:02.739> you<00:03:02.829> one<00:03:02.980> pointer<00:03:03.370> though<00:03:03.519> I

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
let me give you one pointer though I

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.369 
let me give you one pointer though I
threw<00:03:04.000> in<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.209> trick<00:03:04.510> in<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.780> last<00:03:04.959> couple<00:03:05.230> of

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
threw in a trick in the last couple of

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.470 
threw in a trick in the last couple of
measures<00:03:05.739> that<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.280> lot<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:06.909> students<00:03:07.299> don't

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
measures that a lot of students don't

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.500 
measures that a lot of students don't
catch<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:08.049> playing<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.220> left<00:03:09.519> handed<00:03:09.819> flam<00:03:10.120> tap

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
catch is playing a left handed flam tap

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.630 
catch is playing a left handed flam tap
which<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.440> what<00:03:11.650> most<00:03:11.890> students<00:03:12.310> do<00:03:12.489> is<00:03:12.609> they

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
which is what most students do is they

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.599 
which is what most students do is they
lift<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.269> grace<00:03:13.480> note<00:03:13.750> on<00:03:13.959> that<00:03:13.989> flam<00:03:14.590> tap<00:03:14.890> but

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
lift the grace note on that flam tap but

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.970 
lift the grace note on that flam tap but
then<00:03:15.940> they're<00:03:16.209> all<00:03:16.359> the<00:03:16.480> way<00:03:16.569> up<00:03:16.720> here<00:03:17.140> but

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
then they're all the way up here but

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.309 
then they're all the way up here but
they<00:03:18.099> have<00:03:18.129> to<00:03:18.430> play<00:03:18.609> a<00:03:18.640> soft<00:03:19.030> lamb<00:03:19.329> so<00:03:20.019> you

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
they have to play a soft lamb so you

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.809 
they have to play a soft lamb so you
might<00:03:20.440> have<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.650> take<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.280> last<00:03:21.459> couple<00:03:21.790> of

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
might have to take the last couple of

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.080 
might have to take the last couple of
measures<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.560> few<00:03:23.560> times<00:03:23.859> just<00:03:24.129> to<00:03:24.489> get<00:03:24.670> used<00:03:24.970> to

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
measures a few times just to get used to

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.080 
measures a few times just to get used to
playing<00:03:25.299> a<00:03:25.750> flam<00:03:26.349> tap<00:03:26.709> without<00:03:27.250> lifting<00:03:27.760> the

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
playing a flam tap without lifting the

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.970 
playing a flam tap without lifting the
stick<00:03:28.420> all<00:03:28.599> the<00:03:28.720> way<00:03:28.840> up<00:03:29.019> so<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.590> looks<00:03:29.769> like

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
stick all the way up so it looks like

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:42.360 
stick all the way up so it looks like
this<00:03:35.280> again<00:03:39.959> take<00:03:40.959> it<00:03:40.989> as<00:03:41.230> slow<00:03:41.470> as<00:03:41.769> I<00:03:41.920> need<00:03:42.159> to

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
this again take it as slow as I need to

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.970 
this again take it as slow as I need to
only<00:03:42.700> lift<00:03:43.090> in<00:03:43.239> that<00:03:43.269> right<00:03:43.930> hand<00:03:44.139> up<00:03:44.349> to<00:03:44.590> three

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
only lift in that right hand up to three

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.520 
only lift in that right hand up to three
inches<00:03:45.030> so<00:03:46.030> here's<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:46.780> rudimental<00:03:47.230> a<00:03:47.319> tune

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.939 
lesson so make sure that you take the
amount<00:04:28.510> of<00:04:28.599> time<00:04:28.840> necessary<00:04:29.139> whether<00:04:29.830> it

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
amount of time necessary whether it

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.550 
amount of time necessary whether it
takes<00:04:30.130> you<00:04:30.370> a<00:04:30.400> week<00:04:30.669> two<00:04:31.330> weeks<00:04:31.630> three<00:04:31.840> weeks<00:04:32.349> a

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
month doesn't really matter there's so

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.140 
month doesn't really matter there's so
much<00:04:34.870> goodness<00:04:35.260> in<00:04:35.620> this<00:04:35.800> lesson<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:36.490> we<00:04:36.970> got

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
much goodness in this lesson and we got

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.670 
much goodness in this lesson and we got
to<00:04:37.300> make<00:04:37.449> sure<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:37.810> we<00:04:37.930> get<00:04:38.139> it<00:04:38.289> all<00:04:38.410> down
