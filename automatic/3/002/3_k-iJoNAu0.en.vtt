Leonard<00:00:03.000> Bernstein<00:00:03.629> once<00:00:03.990> said<00:00:04.350> that<00:00:04.640> in

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
Leonard Bernstein once said that in

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.360 
Leonard Bernstein once said that in
order<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.540> achieve<00:00:06.839> great<00:00:07.410> things<00:00:07.440> two<00:00:08.340> things

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
order to achieve great things two things

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.450 
order to achieve great things two things
are<00:00:08.849> needed<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.510> plan<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.440> not<00:00:10.980> quite<00:00:11.280> enough

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
are needed a plan and not quite enough

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.970 
are needed a plan and not quite enough
time<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.809> just<00:00:12.900> think<00:00:13.440> that's<00:00:13.590> brilliant

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
time and I just think that's brilliant

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.790 
time and I just think that's brilliant
because<00:00:14.540> you<00:00:15.540> can<00:00:15.660> always<00:00:15.929> have<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> direction

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
because you can always have a direction

that<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.430> want<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.699> go<00:00:17.880> but<00:00:18.330> it's<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:19.529> amount

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
that you want to go but it's the amount

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.590 
that you want to go but it's the amount
of<00:00:19.859> time<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.130> will<00:00:20.430> really<00:00:20.640> push<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.390> do

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
thing that I like to do is set a really

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.530

long<00:01:16.740> term<00:01:17.040> goal<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.610> then<00:01:17.820> start<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.330> break

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
long term goal and then start to break

long term goal and then start to break
it<00:01:18.689> down<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:20.130> making<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:21.119> know<00:01:21.240> little

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
it down and so making you know little

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.570 
it down and so making you know little
milestones<00:01:21.810> every<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.740> often<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.189> think<00:01:23.400> really

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
milestones every so often I think really

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.929 
milestones every so often I think really
helps<00:01:23.909> keep<00:01:24.150> moving<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.810> motivating<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.939> if

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
helps keep moving and motivating you if

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.149 
helps keep moving and motivating you if
I<00:01:27.180> could<00:01:27.240> give<00:01:27.509> my<00:01:27.720> younger<00:01:28.049> self<00:01:28.290> any<00:01:28.650> advice

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
I could give my younger self any advice

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
I could give my younger self any advice
it<00:01:29.579> would<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.090> not<00:01:31.909> get<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.210> frustrated<00:01:33.570> so

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
it would be to not get so frustrated so

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.850 
it would be to not get so frustrated so
easily<00:01:35.030> it's<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.180> very<00:01:36.420> hard<00:01:36.810> art<00:01:37.140> form<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.740> it

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
easily it's a very hard art form and it

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.280 
easily it's a very hard art form and it
takes<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.520> much<00:01:38.729> work<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.479> dedication<00:01:39.630> that

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
takes so much work and dedication that

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.850 
takes so much work and dedication that
in<00:01:40.920> time<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.790> with<00:01:42.720> hard<00:01:43.079> work<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.409> honest

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
in time and with hard work and honest

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.999 
in time and with hard work and honest
work<00:01:44.390> things<00:01:45.390> will<00:01:45.570> happen<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.619> guess<00:01:46.710> it's

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
work things will happen so I guess it's

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.039 
work things will happen so I guess it's
just<00:01:47.100> taking<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> time<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.030> really<00:01:48.899> being

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
just taking the time and really being

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.289 
just taking the time and really being
patient<00:01:49.530> with<00:01:49.590> your<00:01:49.829> so

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
patient with your so

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.249 
patient with your so
everyone<00:01:52.299> has<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.479> different<00:01:52.659> way<00:01:52.930> of<00:01:52.960> coping

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
everyone has a different way of coping

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.760 
everyone has a different way of coping
with<00:01:53.610> nerves<00:01:54.610> or<00:01:55.030> what<00:01:55.750> you<00:01:55.869> feel<00:01:56.320> like<00:01:56.619> that

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
adrenaline rush before going on stage

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.130 
adrenaline rush before going on stage
for<00:01:59.619> me<00:01:59.799> as<00:02:00.070> soon<00:02:00.130> as<00:02:00.460> I<00:02:00.939> get<00:02:01.180> past<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.899> wings

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
for me as soon as I get past the wings

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.469 
for me as soon as I get past the wings
