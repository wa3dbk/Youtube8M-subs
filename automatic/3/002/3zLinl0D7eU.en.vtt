 They have before us the other 50 meters 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.090
 curve 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.890

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.590
 rock we want to throw out all the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.750
 Martians of that time 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.229

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.229
 in the throat 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:28.369
 now comes a machine gun but the 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.969
 sniper fire hidden behind the 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.860
 statue of the Madonna is incessant 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:36.140
 need to go down while a group 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.060
 of military remains behind the curve for 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.439

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.420
 we join a team of soldiers 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.819
 with them we try to reach the 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.000
 schools orphans stuck in the monastery 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:53.239

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.380
 focus snipers are everywhere every 

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:59.060
 step every crossing can be fatal 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.789
 the echo of the shooting between the houses of 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.739
 stone and throat makes it difficult to understand 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:08.209
 which way the bullets arrive 

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:11.289

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.289

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.010
 a few hundred meters from the hotel 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.010

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.110
 we are inside the monastery of santa tecla 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.690
 we got there by passing through 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.580
 haunted blind streets and now we are 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.379
 here with the nuns I have remained 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.930
 prisoner for three days for three 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:48.420
 days at the mercy of sniffing us too 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.700
 we always slept in this room 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.700
 dug into the rock with the children 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.630
 here you see this scene what scene 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.610
 amazing in the middle of the battles 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.069
 nuns of the fanelli remained prisoners 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.069
 of this of this church they pray 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:18.030
 the atmosphere is very thriller from the paris 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.910
 they arrive now that the parts are being fought 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.709
 or entry to this convent has become the 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.340
 our prison does not go out or not 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.340
 we look out 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.420
 while the nuns sing vespers i 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.050
 military over us 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.810
 they fall into an ambush and we do 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.290
 we find ourselves surrounding ourselves as soon as we do 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.200
 dark 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.040
 we challenge the cycles of al qaida we throw ourselves 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.200
 towards the village down below 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.730
 accompanied by the prayers of the sisters 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.730
 we reach salvation miraculously
