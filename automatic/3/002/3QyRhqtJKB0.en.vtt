00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
together don't lose anything I can see

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.899 
together don't lose anything I can see
there's<00:03:28.709> no<00:03:28.829> rolling<00:03:29.040> on<00:03:29.129> both<00:03:29.310> parts<00:03:29.669> so<00:03:29.790> as

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
there's no rolling on both parts so as

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.460 
there's no rolling on both parts so as
you're<00:03:30.090> spinning<00:03:30.329> you're<00:03:30.599> not<00:03:30.720> just<00:03:30.959> rotating

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
you're spinning you're not just rotating

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.770 
you're spinning you're not just rotating
you<00:03:31.709> know<00:03:31.799> it's<00:03:31.949> sliding<00:03:32.370> around<00:03:32.780> each

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
you know it's sliding around each

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.939 
you know it's sliding around each
connection<00:03:34.229> point<00:03:34.440> has<00:03:34.590> its<00:03:34.769> own<00:03:34.889> knurling<00:03:36.949> so

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:37.949 
connection point has its own knurling so

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.069 
connection point has its own knurling so
take<00:03:38.129> out<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.400> tool<00:03:38.579> you<00:03:38.669> want<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.849> use<00:03:38.989> put<00:03:39.989> it

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
take out the tool you want to use put it

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.080 
take out the tool you want to use put it

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
back together and then just put it in

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.809 
back together and then just put it in
the<00:03:42.180> tip<00:03:42.329> all<00:03:43.319> right<00:03:43.379> now<00:03:43.620> one<00:03:44.190> thing<00:03:44.430> is<00:03:44.609> that

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
the tip all right now one thing is that

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.969 
the tip all right now one thing is that
these<00:03:44.940> will<00:03:45.209> shake<00:03:45.780> out<00:03:45.959> if<00:03:46.379> you<00:03:46.530> really<00:03:46.769> shake
