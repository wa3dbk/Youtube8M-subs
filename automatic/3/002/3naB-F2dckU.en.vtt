00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.880
 hello people mac g4 from mac blog me 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.010
 Welcome you to one 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.230
 new building costs review today i have 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.480
 for you the best lock ultimate 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.340
 termination kit with the big one 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.270
 well-known Danish building manufacturer 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.579
 is compatible 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.400
 the ultimate termination set from the west 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:30.279
 loosens over 900 parts over eleven figures 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.200
 or are eleven figures plus dogs plus 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.360
 various vehicles so yours is in the set 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.890
 some in it and I'm a giant 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.600
 terminator far away i am from all clouds 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.579
 I like that because I know that 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.469
 there is something cool and really cool 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.140
 Best lock also offers terminator 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.059
 I'm still stargate building kits 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.280
 also very interested and yes we are watching 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.219
 what's all there is her you see 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.929
 the big goliath tank the little ones 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.210
 coal armor down and two hunter 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.789
 killer planes the seven normal ones 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.629
 figures plus the 4th 800 terminator 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.769
 some ruins share different weapons 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.640
 and there a whole lot more 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.100
 spare Parts 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.810
 So there is a lot in there and this 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.550
 Construction kits convincing view through the 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.950
 cheap price as at the time of 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.200
 videos cost the kit just under 36 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.390
 euro which is very favorable for the number 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.130
 of sharing that is in it and yes that 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.920
 whole is divided in two years 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.570
 is it out now and this 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.860
 various construction boxes the 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.540
 different vehicles the these 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.520
 contained there's also partly 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.590
 That's why I am completely alone 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.570
 Good things that are wonderful here 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.180
 has divided from the construction sachets ago 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.100
 and yes those are the two were there 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.530
 Below is the instructions are stickers 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.290
 and I have to say far again 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.720
 Over 900,000 in there you already have 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.220
 to build a lot 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.660
 The feeling here of unpacking it is 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.280
 actually quite normal as it is 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.140
 We are used to unpacking our kits 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.360
 the parts come from the typical ones 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.620
 everything feels normal 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.110
 and how you're used to that 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.220
 curious how the characters look and 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.790
 work me a bit through the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.680
 parts through 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.350
 with a bit of a cold I hope that 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.570
 Do not worry, I already have more 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.310
 reviews made halo megaflops for 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.830
 example and I am just more 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.690
 I did that as well 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.550
 interested and that are down here 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.230
 more parts plus just said 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.200
 instructions are also single because 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.180
 there are just individually, the models 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.349
 plus various stickers the whole is 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.629
 just like you used to 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.390
 she would have described in detail so 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:30.269
 already done properly he wanted 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:32.459
 but everything was very good so they were called 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.959
 stickers that are just there for each 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.030
 model is what they still just 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.560
 look a bit more realistic 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.090
 I have just got it yet 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.280
 Any small parts can be found 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.099
 it must still save because the instructions to 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.989
 the ruins that are contained 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.730
 this looks like god panzer yes 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:53.760
 probably the big coal tank has too 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.110
 a personal guide and here I show 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.950
 now the parts like that again 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.349
 a little closer 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.670
 and we have it as normal as you can 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.230
 it used to be the little bag with 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.910
 different modules in it all 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.590
 almost normal for plastic 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.510
 It also sounds like we say that 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.360
 I used to be I think since my 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.280
 second or third year of life with too 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.660
 ottenstein toys and bin 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.110
 today is still very excited 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.079
 from that 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.670
 Here you can see such a small sticker ball 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.920
 that's funny 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.290
 that the characters are really cool 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.030
 made who so today say 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.410
 hair is actually today are 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.239
 made quite big but fit 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.859
 wonderful to each other figures can do so 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.280
 Weapons hold as they - as usual 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.930
 is and these are the parts that are 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.280
 also quite normal which fits wonderfully 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.790
 together there was no construction 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.400
 problems has you that normal 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.520
 he wanted to know that holds it too 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.480
 Yes 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:48.730
 okay then I'll say the figure 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.440
 yes, they all have others too 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.000
 facial expression the poor one can 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.850
 move in the way you are used to 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.440
 The legs head here is also a see 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.510
 all pretty dodgy but it 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.830
 already cool he wanted a whole 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.090
 There are tons of weapons you can do that 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.480
 I really like to decorate 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.820
 actually make cool very good 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.740
 impression looks good you can not 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.780
 I say slow down now 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:18.430
 than build up and show you the times 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:21.250
 make models so that's the vehicle 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.200
 which is there and two terminators 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.420
 The vehicle itself is design 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.770
 maybe retro knows but has enough 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.210
 So you can play there 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.770
 everywhere the figures put it on and 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.080
 I really like that 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.980
 okay, and more, the doors then 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.590
 to go to the farm 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.210
 These are the terminators he wanted 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.310
 But these c filigree are also made 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.950
 can be quite realistic too 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.020
 buy the move and have the move 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.460
 Here is the rest of the whole army 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.170
 man the little hand of the vehicle 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.950
 killer tank the big hunter killer 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.660
 tank 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.720
 the two flying hand of the trowel the 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.280
 figures and just these parts of the wall the 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.510
 still in the foreground are the 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.880
 Small parts construction with weapons 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.160
 he wanted it to provide the entire set 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:04.270
 time out of the survey what is there in it 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:07.230
 is and here again so few small 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:11.320
 close-up of the figures election 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.970
 yes, it's cool and sees here 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.090
 you also the sticker on it 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:19.530
 and now I show you the big one 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.530
 goliath tank is here 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.310
 Of course I can not help but ten 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.240
 turning vehicles scenes 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.500
 imitation scene two of the well that 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.449
 big hand the killer is already 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.760
 really heavy quality so there you have 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:40.960
 to build a lot 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.210
 So I'm really very confident 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.100
 from the best lock terminator stuff 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.960
 It's a very cool seco license 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.460
 toys looks very, very cool 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.810
 as I think for the collector 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.389
 it is also interesting and too 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.010
 Of course I play that, I think 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:54.820
 very well and is definitely 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.590
 recommendable 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.699
 I thank you for ever seeing me 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.710
 Hope you liked it a bit 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:02.430
 until next time all mcveigh of 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.430
