sorry<00:00:03.540> about<00:00:03.689> earlier<00:00:03.810> i<00:00:04.529> just<00:00:05.100> figured<00:00:05.460> out

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
sorry about earlier i just figured out

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.490 
sorry about earlier i just figured out
that<00:00:05.790> i<00:00:05.819> didn't<00:00:06.359> have<00:00:06.480> my<00:00:06.509> sound<00:00:06.960> recording

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
that i didn't have my sound recording

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.520 
that i didn't have my sound recording
and<00:00:07.680> so<00:00:08.639> if<00:00:09.480> i<00:00:09.599> were<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.750> put<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.050> clip<00:00:10.320> up

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
and so if i were to put that clip up

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.990 
and so if i were to put that clip up
then<00:00:10.710> it<00:00:10.830> would<00:00:10.950> just<00:00:10.980> be<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> bunch<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.519> silence

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
then it would just be a bunch of silence

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.730 
then it would just be a bunch of silence
i'm<00:00:12.150> i'm<00:00:12.599> think<00:00:12.870> i<00:00:12.960> might<00:00:13.200> just<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.530> show<00:00:13.710> you
