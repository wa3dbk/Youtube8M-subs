can see not overly clumped as I said
it's<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:55.050> way<00:00:55.260> for<00:00:55.559> me<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.770> do<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> little

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
better job so you can see I just insert

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.250 
better job so you can see I just insert
the<00:00:59.640> thing<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.750> doesn't<00:01:01.699> stick<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> bottom

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
the thing it doesn't stick on the bottom

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.250 
the thing it doesn't stick on the bottom
I'd<00:01:04.260> get<00:01:04.979> all<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> any<00:01:05.400> clumps<00:01:05.790> out

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
I'd get all the any clumps out

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.560 
I'd get all the any clumps out
distribute<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:08.090> as<00:01:09.090> well

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
distribute it as well

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.899 
distribute it as well
now<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.840> tap<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.740> down<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:10.950> again<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.700> my

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
now I tap it down and again this is my

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.109 
now I tap it down and again this is my
technique<00:01:12.360> there's<00:01:12.659> people<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.680> do<00:01:13.830> this

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
orphan expresso started this and works

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.649 
orphan expresso started this and works
really<00:01:18.509> well<00:01:18.750> for<00:01:18.810> me<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.159> me<00:01:20.280> very

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.430 

thing<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:54.000> espresso<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.690> is<00:01:54.900> to<00:01:55.049> show<00:01:55.260> us

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
thing on espresso this is to show us

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.520 
thing on espresso this is to show us
some<00:01:55.650> techniques

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
some techniques

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.140 
some techniques
if<00:01:57.620> you're<00:01:57.770> timing<00:01:58.280> my<00:01:58.430> shot<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:58.910> all<00:01:58.970> this

here
there's<00:02:10.580> my<00:02:10.789> mixture<00:02:11.380> you<00:02:12.380> can<00:02:12.410> see<00:02:12.800> it's<00:02:13.130> got

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
there's my mixture you can see it's got

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.060 
there's my mixture you can see it's got
a<00:02:13.340> pretty<00:02:13.610> good<00:02:13.760> layer<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:14.150> crema<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.830> next

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
a pretty good layer of crema so the next

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.330 
a pretty good layer of crema so the next
utensil<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:16.820> a<00:02:16.850> stirrer<00:02:17.390> that<00:02:17.690> I've<00:02:17.780> made

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
utensil is a stirrer that I've made

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.949 
utensil is a stirrer that I've made
don't<00:02:19.340> care<00:02:19.700> for<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.060> rigor<00:02:20.270> little<00:02:20.600> spoons
