00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.120 
instead of going through the doorway you
can<00:01:24.630> put<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.229> it'd<00:01:25.350> kill<00:01:25.770> people<00:01:26.070> when

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
can put it but it'd kill people when

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.350 
can put it but it'd kill people when
they're<00:01:26.280> guarding<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.670> door<00:01:26.880> claim<00:01:27.210> where

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
they're guarding the door claim where

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.999 
they're guarding the door claim where
the<00:01:27.390> doors<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.470> go<00:01:28.560> through<00:01:28.740> any<00:01:28.890> of

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
the doors you can go through any of

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.010 
the doors you can go through any of
these<00:01:29.070> windows<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.880> either<00:01:30.240> way<00:01:30.509> get

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
these windows so you can either way get

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.330 
these windows so you can either way get
through<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.380> building<00:01:31.799> anyway<00:01:32.100> basically

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
through this building anyway basically

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.620 
through this building anyway basically
besides<00:01:32.790> going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.180> doors<00:01:33.360> which<00:01:33.540> is

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
besides going to the doors which is

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.760 
besides going to the doors which is
great<00:01:33.869> because<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.140> way<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.290> avoid<00:01:34.409> getting

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
great because this way you avoid getting

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.109 
great because this way you avoid getting
claim<00:01:35.009> word<00:01:35.220> or<00:01:35.430> bouncing<00:01:35.790> betty<00:01:35.970> but
