00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.390
 hi to all the boys so to the speaker 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.070
 today I am here not to bring you mine 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.099
 theory but a series of theories 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.170
 concerning the very particular place 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.170
 the ancient shadow begins immediately 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.840
 as I said there was not only one 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.250
 legend concerning this place among the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.550
 players have really created it 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.070
 many and also many creep enough but not 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.680
 I'm here to talk to you today 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.430
 today I am here because I want to tell you about them 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.780
 various legends of the ancient class one 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.390
 of legends now simpler and 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.710
 banal says that rotom since 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.019
 this we can fight to find it on a 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.300
 ancient that you can create 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.009
 illusions to drive away linear 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.490
 visitors and let them escape from that 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:13.679
 abandoned place but it's really like that 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:17.690
 I strongly doubt the theory now 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:21.000
 famous is the one who once in the house 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.450
 lived a little girl is a butler and 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.460
 obviously the rest of the family 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.830
 but one day there was a terrible one 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.560
 fire probably caught by a 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.229
 storm this fire of course 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.710
 he destroyed the house and unfortunately did two 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.039
 victims 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.990
 the child is the butler in fact from 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.750
 then it is said that ghosts continue 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.220
 to turn in the house without stopping even 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.459
 gardenia afraid to enter the ancient 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.590
 chateau another theory even more 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:50.789
 simple simply says that the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.200
 little girl was poisoned by the 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.569
 butler who is taken by guilt 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.080
 committed suicide this could also be 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.819
 logical 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.410
 as we could find an antidote 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.390
 inside one of the baskets 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.129
 from the ancient chateau but it doesn't seem to me 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.879
 the biological one the biological one mi 

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:04.879
 it seems that of the fire 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.380
 what these ghosts are 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.690
 really the victims of the fire but 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.700
 is really poisoned dead 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.310
 or maybe just the butler 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.350
 who is trying to save the child 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.080
 no one knows but there is still a lot 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.930
 particularly if you notice the statue 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.150
 mounted the good this has been shining 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.840
 of its own light but the same state where 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.890
 the villa we can find the pokÃ©mon 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.920
 at the villa there will be little this 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.960
 statue is guarded less than a certain one 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.890
 time of day more than anything else 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.020
 night 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.270
 we could approach it but not there 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.800
 it will be nothing strange 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.480
 this was most likely it is 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.760
 was stolen from the ancient chateau is a 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.710
 brought up to the pokÃ©mon villa so it is 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.930
 likely there is a connection between 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.790
 the two places as maybe those two 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.690
 locked doors can hide 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.810
 something maybe dead bodies of the two 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.810
 victims 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.770
 I leave you these theories according to you 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.300
 what is the most logical 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.230
 let me know with a comment here 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.120
 under 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.920
 we will meet again on my return 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.790
 by teo was to see if the next theory 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.790
 bye Bye
