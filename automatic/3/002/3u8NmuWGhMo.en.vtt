00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
hit find next and it takes us right to

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.010 
hit find next and it takes us right to
it<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.860> right<00:02:18.070> now<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.280> width<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:19.000> set<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.360> 320

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
it so right now the width is set to 320

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.510 
it so right now the width is set to 320
so<00:02:20.680> we're<00:02:20.830> just<00:02:20.860> going<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.130> change<00:02:21.340> them<00:02:21.490> to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
so we're just going to change them to

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.510 
so we're just going to change them to
800<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.630> height<00:02:23.320> is<00:02:23.470> set<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.740> 240<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:24.400> we'll

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
800 and height is set to 240 so we'll

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.060 
800 and height is set to 240 so we'll
just<00:02:24.700> change<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.150> 600<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:25.900> then<00:02:26.770> below

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
just change that to 600 and then below

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.210 
just change that to 600 and then below
that<00:02:27.280> it'll<00:02:28.000> say<00:02:28.300> set<00:02:29.140> this<00:02:29.260> parameter<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.950> 0

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
that it'll say set this parameter to 0

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.130 
that it'll say set this parameter to 0
to<00:02:30.370> disable<00:02:30.580> screen<00:02:31.209> stretch<00:02:31.390> in<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.870> set<00:02:32.050> it

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
to disable screen stretch in and set it

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.840 
to disable screen stretch in and set it
to<00:02:32.260> one<00:02:32.470> if<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:33.070> want<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.430> scale<00:02:33.670> the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
to one if you want it to scale the

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.940 
to one if you want it to scale the
current<00:02:34.120> resolution<00:02:34.380> so<00:02:35.380> we<00:02:35.650> want<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:35.920> to

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
current resolution so we want it to

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.590 
current resolution so we want it to
scale<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.459> current<00:02:36.730> resolution<00:02:37.060> so<00:02:37.450> we'll

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
scale to the current resolution so we'll

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.180 
scale to the current resolution so we'll
set<00:02:37.810> stretch<00:02:38.470> until<00:02:38.680> one<00:02:39.270> so<00:02:40.270> let's<00:02:40.390> save<00:02:40.690> that

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
set stretch until one so let's save that

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.390 
set stretch until one so let's save that
put<00:02:42.190> out<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.959> go<00:02:44.260> back<00:02:44.470> into<00:02:44.680> your<00:02:44.830> web<00:02:45.010> mujin

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
put out and go back into your web mujin

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.050 
put out and go back into your web mujin
there<00:02:46.239> we<00:02:46.360> go<00:02:46.510> we<00:02:47.290> made<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.500> bigger<00:02:47.850> so<00:02:48.850> now<00:02:49.000> we

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
there we go we made it bigger so now we

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.810 
there we go we made it bigger so now we
can<00:02:49.239> play<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.890> it's<00:02:50.890> bigger<00:02:51.130> than<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.670> was

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
can play it and it's bigger than it was

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.050 
can play it and it's bigger than it was
before

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
before

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.930 
before
