when<00:00:05.640> I<00:00:05.730> return<00:00:06.120> RC<00:00:06.600> flying<00:00:06.930> after<00:00:07.200> 25<00:00:07.830> year

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
when I return RC flying after 25 year

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.450 
when I return RC flying after 25 year
layoff<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.760> radios<00:00:09.150> amazed<00:00:09.630> me<00:00:10.190> since<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.309> got

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
layoff the radios amazed me since I got

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.020 
layoff the radios amazed me since I got
to<00:00:11.519> DX<00:00:11.940> 8<00:00:12.210> I've<00:00:12.480> been<00:00:12.660> amazed<00:00:12.990> way<00:00:13.349> more<00:00:14.030> even

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
to DX 8 I've been amazed way more even

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.400 
to DX 8 I've been amazed way more even
better<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.630> has<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.839> lot<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.139> features

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
better is that it has a lot of features

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.939 
better is that it has a lot of features
that<00:00:16.619> we<00:00:16.859> actually<00:00:17.100> use<00:00:18.560> spectrum<00:00:19.560> put<00:00:19.800> all

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
that we actually use spectrum put all

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.650 
that we actually use spectrum put all
the<00:00:20.100> switches<00:00:20.550> where<00:00:20.760> they're<00:00:20.910> easy<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.420> get

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
the switches where they're easy to get

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.720 
the switches where they're easy to get
in<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.170> he<00:00:22.619> give<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.949> bunch<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.369> ways<00:00:23.519> to

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
in and he give you a bunch of ways to

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.080 
in and he give you a bunch of ways to
program<00:00:24.210> each<00:00:24.449> one<00:00:24.750> or<00:00:24.869> two<00:00:24.960> switches<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:26.090> you

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
program each one or two switches and you

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.210 
program each one or two switches and you
can<00:00:27.269> combine<00:00:27.539> some<00:00:28.080> functions<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.740> one<00:00:28.769> switch

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
can combine some functions on one switch

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.440 
can combine some functions on one switch
I<00:00:30.320> love<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.439> three<00:00:31.650> position<00:00:32.160> dual<00:00:32.399> rates<00:00:32.700> but

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
I love the three position dual rates but

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.270 
I love the three position dual rates but
it<00:00:33.570> didn't<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:33.989> having<00:00:34.260> three<00:00:34.500> positions<00:00:35.070> on

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
it didn't like having three positions on

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.660 
it didn't like having three positions on
three<00:00:35.520> different<00:00:35.700> switches<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:37.770> dx8<00:00:38.340> let<00:00:38.550> me

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
three different switches the dx8 let me

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.119 
three different switches the dx8 let me
put<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> elevator<00:00:39.420> aileron<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.170> rudder<00:00:40.530> dual

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
put the elevator aileron and rudder dual

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.799 
put the elevator aileron and rudder dual
rates<00:00:41.309> all<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> rudder<00:00:42.149> switch<00:00:42.570> where

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
rates all on the rudder switch where

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.770 
rates all on the rudder switch where
it's<00:00:42.930> easy<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.290> get<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.239> to<00:00:45.239> do<00:00:45.390> all<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.690> I

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
it's easy to get in and to do all that I

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.779 
it's easy to get in and to do all that I
programming<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.620> use<00:00:46.770> one<00:00:47.100> screen<00:00:47.550> that

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
programming we use one screen that

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.369 
programming we use one screen that
allows<00:00:47.910> us<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.329> alternate<00:00:48.989> between<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
allows us to alternate between the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.650 
allows us to alternate between the
control<00:00:49.860> services<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.700> all<00:00:51.149> three<00:00:51.420> positions

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
control services and all three positions

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.490 
control services and all three positions
on<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.469> switch<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:53.840> love<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> feel<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
on the switch I love the feel of the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.020 
on the switch I love the feel of the
gimbals<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.129> think<00:00:56.340> there's<00:00:56.489> just<00:00:56.730> enough

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
gimbals I think there's just enough

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.389 
gimbals I think there's just enough
spring<00:00:57.390> tension<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.559> ends<00:00:58.829> are<00:00:58.949> nice<00:00:59.100> and

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
spring tension and the ends are nice and

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.650 
spring tension and the ends are nice and
grippy<00:00:59.730> they<00:00:59.969> don't<00:01:00.180> feel<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:00.480> you're

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
grippy they don't feel like you're

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.410 
grippy they don't feel like you're
sliding<00:01:00.899> at<00:01:01.230> all<00:01:01.379> while<00:01:01.620> you're<00:01:01.800> flying<00:01:02.420> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
sliding at all while you're flying and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.670 
sliding at all while you're flying and
if<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.660> don't<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.170> way<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.439> set<00:01:04.650> up

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
if you don't like the way it's set up

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.350 
if you don't like the way it's set up
when<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:04.979> get<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.580> adjust<00:01:05.700> all<00:01:06.150> that

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
when you get it you can adjust all that

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.800 
when you get it you can adjust all that
also<00:01:07.280> you<00:01:08.280> can<00:01:08.310> store<00:01:08.760> setups<00:01:09.210> for<00:01:09.360> up<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.570> 30

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
also you can store setups for up to 30

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.899 
also you can store setups for up to 30
models<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.680> radio<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.369> destroys

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
models on this radio and destroys

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.690 
models on this radio and destroys
between<00:01:12.390> them<00:01:12.979> when<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.100> select<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.520> model

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
between them when you select a model

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.310 
between them when you select a model
that<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.090> already<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.509> programmed<00:01:16.049> into

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
that you already have programmed into

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.289 
that you already have programmed into
the<00:01:16.530> radio<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.189> brings<00:01:17.580> up<00:01:17.790> everything

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
the radio it brings up everything

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.350 
the radio it brings up everything
including<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:19.080> trims<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.830> used<00:01:20.360> when

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
including the trims that you used when

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.120 
including the trims that you used when
you<00:01:21.420> set<00:01:21.720> up<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.930> new<00:01:22.080> model<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.740> first<00:01:22.950> thing

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
you set up a new model the first thing

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.410 
you set up a new model the first thing
you<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.490> choose<00:01:23.759> whether<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.299> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
you do is choose whether it's a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.289 
you do is choose whether it's a
helicopter<00:01:25.110> or<00:01:25.290> an<00:01:25.409> airplane<00:01:26.060> when<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.150> make

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
helicopter or an airplane when you make

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.580 
helicopter or an airplane when you make
that<00:01:27.450> selection<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.080> radio

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
that selection the radio

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.770 
that selection the radio
automatically<00:01:29.189> configures<00:01:29.820> itself<00:01:29.939> for<00:01:30.659> that

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
automatically configures itself for that

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.950 
automatically configures itself for that
basic<00:01:31.259> type<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.590> aircraft<00:01:32.810> something<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.930> I

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
basic type of aircraft something that I

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.140 
basic type of aircraft something that I
continue<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.530> find<00:01:34.799> really<00:01:35.100> handy<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.759> being

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
continue to find really handy is being

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.910 
continue to find really handy is being
able<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.540> choose<00:01:36.750> what<00:01:37.049> kind<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.350> wing<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.710> have

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
able to choose what kind of wing we have

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.130 
able to choose what kind of wing we have
on<00:01:38.159> there<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:39.270> type<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.630> wing<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.930> more

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
on there the type of wing is more

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.440 
on there the type of wing is more

servos<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.460> when<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:53.970> select<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.479> setup<00:01:54.930> I

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
servos and when I select that setup I

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.920 
servos and when I select that setup I
can<00:01:55.710> adjust<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.310> center<00:01:56.640> point<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.180> trim<00:01:57.689> on

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
can adjust the center point and trim on

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.200 
can adjust the center point and trim on
each<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> aileron<00:01:58.920> servo<00:01:59.210> individually

each of the aileron servo individually
that's<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.290> huge<00:02:01.649> help<00:02:01.920> for<00:02:02.280> setting<00:02:02.610> an

very happy with it

very happy with it
this<00:02:26.460> is<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.640> good<00:02:26.820> way<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.030> keep<00:02:27.240> in<00:02:27.390> track<00:02:27.540> of

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
this is a good way to keep in track of

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.210 
this is a good way to keep in track of
what's<00:02:27.930> going<00:02:28.020> on<00:02:28.350> in<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.620> airplane<00:02:28.980> while

what's going on in the airplane while

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.260 
what's going on in the airplane while
you're<00:02:29.490> flying<00:02:29.730> it

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
you're flying it

you're flying it
the<00:02:30.960> only<00:02:31.110> problem<00:02:31.530> I've<00:02:31.620> had<00:02:31.680> with<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.130> dx8

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
the only problem I've had with the dx8

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.520 
the only problem I've had with the dx8
is<00:02:32.850> that<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.240> SD<00:02:33.810> card<00:02:34.140> reader

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
is that the SD card reader

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.580 
is that the SD card reader
it's<00:02:34.770> very<00:02:35.010> finicky<00:02:35.490> about<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.970> cards<00:02:36.590> they

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
it's very finicky about the cards they

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.890 
it's very finicky about the cards they
give<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.980> an<00:02:38.100> SD<00:02:38.400> card<00:02:38.700> with<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.090> radio<00:02:39.450> that

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
give you an SD card with the radio that

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.960 
give you an SD card with the radio that
one<00:02:40.110> didn't<00:02:40.380> work<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.830> had<00:02:41.250> another<00:02:41.520> one<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.850> the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
one didn't work I had another one in the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.940 
one didn't work I had another one in the
office<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.690> one<00:02:42.900> didn't<00:02:43.170> work<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.770> got<00:02:43.890> a

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
office that one didn't work and I got a

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.820 
office that one didn't work and I got a
third<00:02:44.250> one<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.910> one<00:02:45.060> works<00:02:45.240> perfectly

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
third one and that one works perfectly

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.500 
third one and that one works perfectly
it<00:02:46.830> seems<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:47.190> everybody<00:02:47.460> knows<00:02:47.850> about<00:02:48.180> this

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
it seems that everybody knows about this

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.330 
it seems that everybody knows about this
so<00:02:48.750> maybe<00:02:48.930> spectrum<00:02:49.470> has<00:02:49.620> fixed<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:50.040> with<00:02:50.190> the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
so maybe spectrum has fixed it with the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.900 
so maybe spectrum has fixed it with the
newer<00:02:50.490> radios<00:02:50.970> they're<00:02:51.210> manufacturing<00:02:52.020> now<00:02:52.230> a

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
newer radios they're manufacturing now a

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.490 
newer radios they're manufacturing now a
smaller<00:02:53.910> problem<00:02:54.240> with<00:02:54.540> my<00:02:54.690> own<00:02:54.840> making<00:02:55.140> is

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
smaller problem with my own making is

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.140 
smaller problem with my own making is
that<00:02:55.710> I<00:02:55.830> just<00:02:55.890> fly<00:02:56.280> too<00:02:56.340> much<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.090> the

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
that I just fly too much and the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.700 
that I just fly too much and the
original<00:02:57.540> two<00:02:57.720> thousand<00:02:58.140> milliamp<00:02:58.380> pack

original two thousand milliamp pack

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.920 
original two thousand milliamp pack
wasn't<00:02:59.160> cutting<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.610> but<00:03:00.270> spectrum<00:03:00.780> knows

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
wasn't cutting it but spectrum knows

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.510 
wasn't cutting it but spectrum knows
about<00:03:01.230> people<00:03:01.560> like<00:03:01.710> me<00:03:01.740> and<00:03:02.040> he<00:03:02.100> offered<00:03:02.400> this

about people like me and he offered this

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.760 
about people like me and he offered this

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
these radios on a dx8 I just hold this

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.400 
these radios on a dx8 I just hold this
button<00:03:17.550> when<00:03:17.820> I<00:03:17.850> want<00:03:18.090> them<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:18.450> fly<00:03:18.570> and<00:03:18.990> I<00:03:19.260> can

with the DX aid I can control how many
