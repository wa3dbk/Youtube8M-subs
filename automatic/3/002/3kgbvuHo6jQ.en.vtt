biggest device a bigger the file size is

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.170 
biggest device a bigger the file size is
going<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.710> be<00:00:43.800> at<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> end<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.879> I've<00:00:45.030> created

to file open and go ahead and select
your<00:00:56.489> clip<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:58.680> got<00:00:58.890> my<00:00:59.039> clip<00:00:59.280> here<00:00:59.730> I

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
your clip so got my clip here I

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.209 
your clip so got my clip here I
recommend<00:01:01.079> having<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.620> clip<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.010> same

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
recommend having the clip in the same

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.889 
recommend having the clip in the same
size<00:01:02.460> as<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.820> want<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> final<00:01:03.420> image<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.780> be

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
size as you want the final image to be

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.719 
size as you want the final image to be
as<00:01:04.019> well<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.379> think<00:01:04.979> that's<00:01:05.189> really<00:01:05.369> going<00:01:05.610> to

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
as well I think that's really going to

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.910 
as well I think that's really going to
make<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.420> easier<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.260> then<00:01:07.619> go<00:01:07.799> ahead

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
make it easier for you and then go ahead

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.859 
make it easier for you and then go ahead
and<00:01:08.040> wait<00:01:08.460> till<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> renders<00:01:09.119> out<00:01:09.299> all<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
and wait till the renders out all the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.140 
and wait till the renders out all the
frame<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.380> once<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.159> done<00:01:11.340> basically<00:01:11.640> counting

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
frame so once it done basically counting

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.140 
frame so once it done basically counting
the<00:01:12.240> frames<00:01:12.510> here<00:01:12.720> uh<00:01:12.979> just<00:01:13.979> wait<00:01:14.520> until<00:01:14.790> that

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
the frames here uh just wait until that

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.840 
the frames here uh just wait until that
and<00:01:15.950> should<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.040> good<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.369> start<00:01:17.640> actually

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and should be good to start actually

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.359 
and should be good to start actually
creating<00:01:18.509> your<00:01:18.630> gift<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.070> rendering

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
creating your gift so it's on rendering

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.770 
creating your gift so it's on rendering
all<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.700> frames<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:21.150> me<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.479> I've<00:01:21.570> got<00:01:21.750> a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
all the frames for me so I've got a

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.800 
all the frames for me so I've got a
total<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.229> 141<00:01:22.920> frames<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.700> my<00:01:24.000> clip<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.509> four

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
total of 141 frames and my clip is four

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.020 
total of 141 frames and my clip is four
point<00:01:24.990> 23<00:01:25.350> seconds<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.430> i<00:01:26.490> recommend<00:01:26.820> not

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
point 23 seconds so i recommend not

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.450 
point 23 seconds so i recommend not
having<00:01:27.360> more<00:01:27.659> than<00:01:28.020> 250<00:01:28.860> frame<00:01:29.070> simply

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
having more than 250 frame simply

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.609 
having more than 250 frame simply
because<00:01:29.729> that's<00:01:29.970> going<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.509> make<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
because that's going to just make the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.380 
because that's going to just make the
sauce<00:01:31.829> size<00:01:32.100> too<00:01:32.460> big<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.880> post<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
sauce size too big to post on the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.380 
sauce size too big to post on the
Internet<00:01:33.720> itself<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.860> I've<00:01:35.130> got<00:01:35.369> 141<00:01:36.119> frames

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
Internet itself so I've got 141 frames

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.600 
Internet itself so I've got 141 frames
for<00:01:36.630> format<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.500> second<00:01:37.860> clip<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.460> that's

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
for format for second clip so that's

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.010 
for format for second clip so that's
about<00:01:38.729> thirty<00:01:39.060> three<00:01:39.329> frames<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.689> second

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
about thirty three frames a second

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.210 
about thirty three frames a second
that's<00:01:40.110> quite<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> lot<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:40.860> I'm<00:01:41.040> going<00:01:41.189> to

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
that's quite a lot so I'm going to

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.789 
that's quite a lot so I'm going to
reduce<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.820> by<00:01:42.090> fifty<00:01:42.570> percent<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.590> I'm

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
reduce that by fifty percent so I'm

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.280 
reduce that by fifty percent so I'm
gonna<00:01:43.950> basically<00:01:44.479> remove<00:01:45.479> all<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.020> pair

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
gonna basically remove all the pair

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.020 
gonna basically remove all the pair
frames<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.189> all<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> pair<00:01:47.670> or<00:01:47.880> all

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
frames so it can be all the pair or all

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.280 
frames so it can be all the pair or all
the<00:01:48.180> unpaired<00:01:48.570> but<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:48.990> optional

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
the unpaired but this is optional

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.530 
the unpaired but this is optional
obviously<00:01:49.979> but<00:01:50.490> i<00:01:50.549> recommend<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.090> doing<00:01:51.390> it

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
obviously but i recommend you doing it

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.210 
obviously but i recommend you doing it
simply<00:01:52.079> because<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.470> fossa<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.829> going<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.130> be

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
simply because the fossa is going to be

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.760 
simply because the fossa is going to be
waist<00:01:53.579> smaller<00:01:53.700> if<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.119> do<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.659> yeah<00:01:55.530> go

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
waist smaller if you do this so yeah go

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.709 
waist smaller if you do this so yeah go
ahead<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.159> do<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.430> if<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.670> want<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.390> if

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
ahead to do this if you want to and if

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.139 
ahead to do this if you want to and if
not<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.579> if<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.790> want<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.030> do

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
not it's up to you so if you want to do

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.899 
not it's up to you so if you want to do
it<00:02:00.240> simply<00:02:00.869> go<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.049> frame<00:02:01.560> two<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.219> then<00:02:02.640> hold

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
it simply go to frame two and then hold

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.789 
it simply go to frame two and then hold
the<00:02:03.000> command<00:02:03.240> button<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.869> select<00:02:04.439> all<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
the command button and select all the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:29.820 
the command button and select all the
parents<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.490> 4<00:02:05.850> 6<00:02:06.270> 8<00:02:06.450> etc

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.800 

so<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:30.860> got<00:02:31.190> all<00:02:31.400> my<00:02:31.430> frame<00:02:32.030> selected<00:02:32.240> all<00:02:32.660> my

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
so I got all my frame selected all my

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.480 
so I got all my frame selected all my
pair<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.140> frames<00:02:33.440> you're<00:02:33.800> as<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:33.980> can<00:02:34.130> see<00:02:34.310> and

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
pair of frames you're as you can see and

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.060 
pair of frames you're as you can see and
I'm<00:02:35.330> just<00:02:35.540> doing<00:02:35.930> this<00:02:36.080> again<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.560> reduce<00:02:36.890> the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
I'm just doing this again to reduce the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.980 
I'm just doing this again to reduce the
final<00:02:37.520> file<00:02:37.670> size<00:02:37.880> and<00:02:38.090> now<00:02:38.540> once<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:38.870> got

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
final file size and now once you got

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.300 
final file size and now once you got
them<00:02:39.140> all<00:02:39.290> selected<00:02:39.680> simply<00:02:40.130> hit<00:02:40.280> the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
them all selected simply hit the

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.280 
them all selected simply hit the
backspace<00:02:40.580> button<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.510> delete<00:02:41.690> them<00:02:41.930> all<00:02:42.080> and

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
backspace button to delete them all and

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.230 
backspace button to delete them all and
as<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:42.500> can<00:02:42.650> see<00:02:42.680> all<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:43.220> have<00:02:43.340> 71<00:02:43.970> frames

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
as you can see all you have 71 frames

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.300 
as you can see all you have 71 frames
left<00:02:44.510> now<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:45.230> that's<00:02:45.620> definitely<00:02:45.920> going<00:02:46.220> to

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
left now so that's definitely going to

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.090 
left now so that's definitely going to
reduce<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:46.700> file<00:02:46.880> size<00:02:47.080> so<00:02:48.080> now<00:02:48.709> if<00:02:48.980> you

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
reduce the file size so now if you

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.910 
reduce the file size so now if you
render<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:49.520> out<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:50.000> file<00:02:50.959> save<00:02:51.290> as<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:51.770> get

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
render it out a file save as you get

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.260 
render it out a file save as you get
your<00:02:52.070> gif<00:02:52.280> image<00:02:52.550> although<00:02:52.880> it's<00:02:53.000> got<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.180> be

your gif image although it's got to be

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.720 
your gif image although it's got to be
really<00:02:53.660> bad<00:02:53.840> quality<00:02:54.440> trust<00:02:54.770> me<00:02:54.920> it's<00:02:55.610> going

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
but gift so it's going to render out all

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.220 
but gift so it's going to render out all
the<00:03:48.799> frames<00:03:49.130> here<00:03:49.400> this<00:03:50.390> should<00:03:50.600> take<00:03:50.900> really

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
the frames here this should take really

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.530 
the frames here this should take really
long<00:03:51.350> as<00:03:52.280> you<00:03:52.489> can<00:03:52.610> see<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:52.850> goes<00:03:53.000> pretty<00:03:53.180> fast

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
the browser so i've got two browsers

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.880 
the browser so i've got two browsers

open here just to show you that between
every<00:04:04.340> boundary<00:04:04.670> there<00:04:04.970> is<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.090> difference<00:04:05.540> of

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
every boundary there is a difference of

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.220 
every boundary there is a difference of
speed<00:04:06.140> so<00:04:06.880> not<00:04:07.880> i<00:04:08.090> mean<00:04:08.150> not<00:04:08.480> in<00:04:08.630> general<00:04:08.840> but<00:04:09.170> I

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
speed so not i mean not in general but I

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.319 
speed so not i mean not in general but I
mean<00:04:09.440> for<00:04:09.739> gif<00:04:10.070> images<00:04:10.549> I'm<00:04:10.850> talking<00:04:11.209> right

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
mean for gif images I'm talking right

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.050 
mean for gif images I'm talking right
now<00:04:11.480> I'm<00:04:11.840> not<00:04:11.870> going<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.200> go<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.410> everything

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
now I'm not going to go and everything

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.060 
now I'm not going to go and everything
which<00:04:14.060> is<00:04:14.090> related<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:15.140> browsers<00:04:15.560> but<00:04:15.769> I've

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
which is related to browsers but I've

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.469 
which is related to browsers but I've
got<00:04:16.220> my<00:04:16.250> image<00:04:16.609> here<00:04:16.820> so<00:04:17.000> I'm<00:04:17.090> going<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:17.299> throw

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
got my image here so I'm going to throw

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.349 
got my image here so I'm going to throw
it<00:04:17.570> in<00:04:17.690> Firefox<00:04:18.350> right<00:04:18.620> here<00:04:18.859> and<00:04:19.060> as<00:04:20.060> you<00:04:20.209> can

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
it in Firefox right here and as you can

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.840 
it in Firefox right here and as you can
see<00:04:20.390> it<00:04:20.900> just<00:04:21.229> does<00:04:21.979> the<00:04:22.160> animation<00:04:22.640> if<00:04:22.760> i

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
see it just does the animation if i

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.880 
see it just does the animation if i
refresh<00:04:23.120> that<00:04:23.210> you<00:04:23.810> can<00:04:23.960> see<00:04:24.169> there<00:04:24.740> you<00:04:24.860> go

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
refresh that you can see there you go

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.090 
refresh that you can see there you go
and<00:04:25.250> I'll<00:04:25.850> throw<00:04:26.030> that<00:04:26.240> in<00:04:26.510> safari<00:04:27.110> so<00:04:27.979> it's

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
and I'll throw that in safari so it's

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.909 
and I'll throw that in safari so it's
gonna<00:04:28.250> load<00:04:28.460> a<00:04:28.490> bit<00:04:28.729> in<00:04:28.850> Safari<00:04:29.240> and<00:04:29.919> it's

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
gonna load a bit in Safari and it's

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.000 
gonna load a bit in Safari and it's
going<00:04:31.250> pretty<00:04:31.790> slow<00:04:32.290> so<00:04:33.290> maybe<00:04:33.530> that's<00:04:33.830> the

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
going pretty slow so maybe that's the

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.680 
going pretty slow so maybe that's the
first<00:04:34.250> time<00:04:34.460> so<00:04:34.669> it's<00:04:34.850> very<00:04:35.000> fresh<00:04:35.240> as<00:04:35.419> it<00:04:35.450> goes

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
first time so it's very fresh as it goes

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.270 
first time so it's very fresh as it goes
a<00:04:35.720> little<00:04:35.870> bit<00:04:36.050> faster<00:04:36.260> well<00:04:36.950> not<00:04:37.220> really

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
a little bit faster well not really

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.700 
a little bit faster well not really
still<00:04:37.820> goes<00:04:37.970> kind<00:04:38.240> of<00:04:38.330> slow<00:04:38.450> I'm<00:04:38.720> so<00:04:39.229> this<00:04:39.530> is

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
still goes kind of slow I'm so this is

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:40.930 
still goes kind of slow I'm so this is
just<00:04:39.890> to<00:04:40.010> show<00:04:40.070> you<00:04:40.220> that<00:04:40.340> there's<00:04:40.669> a<00:04:40.760> little

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
just to show you that there's a little

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.220 
just to show you that there's a little
bit<00:04:41.180> a<00:04:41.240> little<00:04:41.570> bit<00:04:41.840> difference<00:04:42.680> between<00:04:42.830> all

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
bit a little bit difference between all

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.720 
bit a little bit difference between all
browsers<00:04:43.650> Google<00:04:44.040> Chrome<00:04:44.280> Safari<00:04:44.460> Firefox

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
browsers Google Chrome Safari Firefox

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.650 
browsers Google Chrome Safari Firefox
and<00:04:45.950> I'm<00:04:46.950> not<00:04:47.130> saying<00:04:47.340> that<00:04:47.610> Firefox<00:04:48.540> is

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
and I'm not saying that Firefox is

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.900 
and I'm not saying that Firefox is
better<00:04:48.930> but<00:04:49.470> that's<00:04:49.860> just<00:04:49.980> my<00:04:50.190> opinion<00:04:50.220> but<00:04:50.580> in

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
better but that's just my opinion but in

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.850 
better but that's just my opinion but in
this<00:04:51.060> case<00:04:51.300> and<00:04:51.630> forgives<00:04:52.110> images<00:04:52.500> at<00:04:52.620> least

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
this case and forgives images at least

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.580 
this case and forgives images at least
Firefox<00:04:53.790> does<00:04:54.000> a<00:04:54.030> better<00:04:54.360> job<00:04:54.510> and<00:04:54.900> speed<00:04:55.140> so

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
Firefox does a better job and speed so

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.530 
Firefox does a better job and speed so
if<00:04:55.770> you<00:04:55.890> want<00:04:56.070> your<00:04:56.160> image<00:04:56.370> to<00:04:56.520> loop<00:04:56.970> around<00:04:57.120> so

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
if you want your image to loop around so

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.660 
if you want your image to loop around so
when<00:04:57.810> it<00:04:57.930> comes<00:04:58.080> to<00:04:58.290> an<00:04:58.380> end<00:04:58.560> it<00:04:58.980> just<00:04:59.190> restarts

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
when it comes to an end it just restarts

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.880 
when it comes to an end it just restarts
go<00:05:00.180> ahead<00:05:00.480> and<00:05:00.840> go<00:05:00.960> back<00:05:01.170> to<00:05:01.380> get<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:01.830> other

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
go ahead and go back to get the other

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.970 
go ahead and go back to get the other
carbon<00:05:02.460> go<00:05:02.880> to<00:05:03.030> options<00:05:03.630> loop<00:05:04.260> and<00:05:04.500> here<00:05:04.860> you

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
carbon go to options loop and here you

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.480 
carbon go to options loop and here you
have<00:05:05.010> the<00:05:05.430> few<00:05:06.090> options<00:05:06.480> forever<00:05:07.440> or<00:05:07.800> a

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
have the few options forever or a

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.400 
have the few options forever or a
certain<00:05:08.880> amount<00:05:09.210> of<00:05:09.360> time<00:05:09.540> so<00:05:10.140> I'm<00:05:10.200> going<00:05:10.380> to

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
certain amount of time so I'm going to

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.680 
certain amount of time so I'm going to
just<00:05:10.620> do<00:05:10.740> forever<00:05:11.100> and<00:05:11.220> go<00:05:11.880> ahead<00:05:12.120> and<00:05:12.360> save<00:05:12.660> it

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
just do forever and go ahead and save it

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.590 
just do forever and go ahead and save it
again<00:05:13.400> so<00:05:14.400> there<00:05:14.550> you<00:05:14.640> go<00:05:14.700> I've<00:05:14.910> got<00:05:14.940> also<00:05:15.480> an

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
again so there you go I've got also an

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.360 
again so there you go I've got also an
image<00:05:15.840> that<00:05:15.870> loops<00:05:16.290> around<00:05:16.440> now<00:05:16.770> so<00:05:17.220> I'm<00:05:17.310> going

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
image that loops around now so I'm going

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.600 
image that loops around now so I'm going
to<00:05:17.490> put<00:05:17.700> that<00:05:17.730> in<00:05:18.000> Firefox<00:05:18.480> and<00:05:19.280> as<00:05:20.280> you<00:05:20.400> see

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
to put that in Firefox and as you see

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.400 
to put that in Firefox and as you see
when<00:05:20.940> it<00:05:21.060> comes<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.420> an<00:05:21.510> end<00:05:21.630> it<00:05:21.900> just<00:05:21.930> starts

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
when it comes to an end it just starts

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.080 
when it comes to an end it just starts
over<00:05:22.680> again<00:05:22.710> so<00:05:23.070> let<00:05:23.220> me<00:05:23.340> do<00:05:23.550> that<00:05:23.700> as<00:05:23.910> one

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
over again so let me do that as one

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.140 
over again so let me do that as one
Safari<00:05:24.590> so<00:05:25.590> it<00:05:26.010> works<00:05:26.220> in<00:05:26.430> all<00:05:26.520> browsers<00:05:26.760> the

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
Safari so it works in all browsers the

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.070 
Safari so it works in all browsers the
looping<00:05:27.510> around<00:05:27.600> always<00:05:27.930> works<00:05:29.330> so<00:05:30.330> that's<00:05:30.840> it

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
looping around always works so that's it

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.930 
looping around always works so that's it
for<00:05:31.110> how<00:05:31.710> to<00:05:31.770> make<00:05:32.100> your<00:05:32.250> own<00:05:32.310> gifts<00:05:32.700> image

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
for how to make your own gifts image

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.870 
for how to make your own gifts image
right<00:05:33.360> here<00:05:33.390> my<00:05:33.810> image<00:05:34.200> became<00:05:34.710> I<00:05:35.160> think<00:05:35.520> about

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
right here my image became I think about

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.690 
right here my image became I think about
two<00:05:36.420> or<00:05:36.780> five<00:05:37.410> megabytes<00:05:37.890> that's<00:05:38.190> quite<00:05:38.430> a<00:05:38.460> lot

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
two or five megabytes that's quite a lot

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.610 
two or five megabytes that's quite a lot
to<00:05:38.850> be<00:05:38.970> honest<00:05:39.300> to<00:05:40.020> put<00:05:40.230> on<00:05:40.350> a<00:05:40.380> website

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
to be honest to put on a website

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.710 
to be honest to put on a website
obviously<00:05:41.550> it's<00:05:41.700> quite<00:05:41.940> a<00:05:41.970> big<00:05:42.180> image<00:05:42.450> so<00:05:42.600> if

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
obviously it's quite a big image so if

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.760

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
probably going to be a little square

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.720 
probably going to be a little square
really<00:05:45.930> going<00:05:46.110> to<00:05:46.200> change<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.650> file<00:05:47.160> size<00:05:47.400> but

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:47.730 
really going to change the file size but

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.720 
really going to change the file size but
this<00:05:48.510> one<00:05:48.660> is<00:05:48.780> pretty<00:05:48.960> big<00:05:49.200> I<00:05:49.550> hope<00:05:50.550> this
