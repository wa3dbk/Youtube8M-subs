00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.580
 speaks guys welcome more in 

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.350
 pc gamer budget here channel 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.730
 so this time I 'm doing a pc 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.070
 three thousand reais gamer 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.410
 remembering that I do the researches of this 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.760
 way they are seeing the lowest price I 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.830
 I get a good tip here for those who live 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.230
 in rio de janeiro and in the mall people 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.090
 there's this list of ikea stores for me 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.619
 are reliable beauty 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.900
 Let's go to the components I chose to 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.940
 this machine and with the first component 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.660
 People have our CPU 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.579
 I chose a 4544 30 that is already from the new 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.710
 line Intel processors in 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.230
 fourth generation it has four nuclei 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.170
 22 nanometer frequency photo 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.290
 3.0-liter turbocharger and its turbo boost will 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.890
 to 3.2 cash he has six mega cash 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:53.129
 smart intel and 84 watt tdp 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.270
 his socket is lg at 1150 on the screen 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.160
 You can follow more 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.200
 Specifications, I'll keep talking a lot. 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.230
 on the other specifications 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.910
 the average price I found was 560 reais 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.250
 So, as usual, I'm going to put 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.740
 Right there, the calculator, and you 're there. 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.479
 560 reais we go to the motherboard 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.750
 the chosen motherboard is a model of the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.750
 gigabyte is agehab 85 m of 3h 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.430
 the lg of h which is the socket is 11 50 already 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.650
 that our processor is also one of 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.010
 50 is supported in case until the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.350
 i7 processors the chipset is the 85th 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.210
 intel memory she can stand up to 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.740
 32GB of memory and these memories 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.689
 edition of r 3,600 or 1,333 win are 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.119
 six sata doors and four of them 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.119
 it's 16 gigabytes per second it's coming 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.490
 with 3.0 usb front connector on it 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.530
 gigabit in the images are 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.560
 connections on the back of the motherboard 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.119
 you can see that it has hd mdv and window 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.070
 has two babies 3.0 and four more ex 2.0 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.740
 remembering that the ideal for the 5 is you 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.200
 put the chipset b 85 the average price 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.259
 I thought it was 309 reais from ours. 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.360
 calculator in 869 let's go to memory 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.759
 the memory that will choose the model 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.070
 corsan are seeing on the screen this world 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.530
 said 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.050
 It's kind of crazy everyday place of 1600 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.020
 megahair and it has 4 gb of size each 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.930
 front of each pixel 172 are already doing 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.810
 The accounts we have are at 1213 c'mon. 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.600
 pro hd or hd that i chose is the seagate 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.580
 barracuda as is already common here on the channel 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.470
 always chose this hd i choose one 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.390
 terabyte of HD and that's enough 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.020
 to save our games he already 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.630
 up to 6 gb per second so you already 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.070
 will have a better performance average price 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.900
 I found him for two hundred and twenty. 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.790
 five reais and now we are going to talk a 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.470
 little about cabinet in the cabinet that the 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.380
 brand choice cooler master 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.300
 the model is the silence that is 51 miller and 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.489
 silence because he has a 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.350
 what is interesting 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.790
 for who wants to make video is because there 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.510
 you do not have that noise coming from 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.760
 computer 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.130
 the type of his edict and he has many 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.790
 spaces for fans have a very 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.950
 good 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.930
 has three external bases and seven bars 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.570
 internal and front panel of the people 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.019
 has a zero point sbt and one more ex bb 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.180
 2.0 microphones chop and plus sd 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.340
 How are you playing there in that picture? 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.100
 Montage of him is perfect It's very cool 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.750
 even its assembly that it provides and 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.910
 you can see there in the back is the 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.640
 sound insulation and this part of the 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.040
 there it is very smooth, in fact it is 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.170
 a door that you can open to 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.959
 give more ventilation the average price I 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.480
 I found him out there was 7 75 reais a 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.489
 Well priced, it 's an office that's 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.010
 very good will provide an assembly 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.500
 ideal also and not this calculator to 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.880
 people are in 1603 still missing the plaque 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.920
 and the source 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.959
 the guys like everyone else already and the channel already 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.760
 they should know you have a computer 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.980
 that runs most games with a good 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.810
 higher investment quality has to be 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.730
 done on video card 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.209
 So for this in this machine I chose 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.970
 a gtx 770 it will provide people with 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.620
 play 4 derby with a very high fps 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.480
 How are you going to see a slide that I'm going to 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.860
 pass at the end of the video and then 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.380
 other games also with a good 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.310
 quality and excellent frame rate 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.410
 per second 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.420
 There you are seeing the Payne model. 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.310
 Because it is cheaper, I put this 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.169
 model among other models where 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.550
 are also at a nice price and you know that 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.680
 I have seen that the models 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.739
 but stop only the nanny and the rotac 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.740
 let's go to the characteristics of gtx 770 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.430
 base clock is 1,046 mhz then 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.920
 1,085 megahair bushel of xadres she 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.860
 has 1536 color whore 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.330
 this model has 2 GB of memory 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.150
 gddr5 already enough to defeat 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.970
 our games bed and her touch is 7 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.180
 thousand and 10 mega hair or 7 gigs 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.430
 the memory interface is 256 bit and the 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.740
 ttp that the maximum energy consumption of 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.800
 230 watts as you can see in this 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.720
 image there she owns two of a vehicle 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.670
 display port and an hdmi 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.900
 in this other image you can see 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.880
 other features 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.390
 using this program called 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.460
 god '' and this model I found for 1,235 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.540
 an average price over the internet and 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.580
 Lowest price 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.530
 remembering that lower price and is not always 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.550
 the best price at its lowest price is the 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.370
 price I found here on the river of 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:16.090
 January in sight so today it has arrived in 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:18.160
 2008 and 48 real back source I'm going to talk 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.380
 a little bit now about the source 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.240
 but let's talk about the source many of you 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.150
 You will be surprised that I have chosen 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.450
 a being a being x 500 watts will not even talk 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.150
 but you 're putting more gtx 7070 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.700
 with some x500 because I'm doing it 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.440
 I recently read an article that 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.390
 currently computers are not 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.270
 asking more than 500 watts of power 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.340
 without overclocking without using a 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.919
 second video card or some knock 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.660
 more and I realized that seeing a 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:50.530
 video of a guy who set up a 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:53.140
 computer with a gtx 780 tiê and put 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.700
 at cx 500 watts I was surprised though 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.210
 It was true he was using a 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.050
 i7 processor with a 780 their to 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.700
 who wants to see 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.710
 I put in the description I put in the 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.540
 my fan page then norm contained because 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.130
 I'm always posting these videos. 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.290
 different in my fan page 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.690
 Look there in the video description and go there 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:13.270
 in facebook gives a tidy reminding that 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.190
 to use cx 500 watts on this pc you 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.470
 will not be able to overclock 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.140
 very high and for the future under 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.919
 also if you want to put 17 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.690
 Unlocked, you'll also have to 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:25.990
 put another source for those who stay with 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.240
 some fear puts the cx 600 watts or 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.490
 so put a gtx 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.590
 the 50 vacancies that will catch good in 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.259
 ipc then we go to the characteristics of 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.240
 ccx 500 watts in it has seal 80plus 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:39.300
 bronze this means that it will have 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.280
 an efficiency above 83% for those who do not 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.280
 know your 80 plus works the following 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.550
 way it has 80 plus which is efficiency 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:51.810
 above 80% have the brass which is above 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:55.410
 83% have silver that is over 86% have the 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:58.620
 gold that is over 89 percent and 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.759
 still has platinum which is above 92% 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.590
 efficiency 

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:04.050
 then maybe you can see the connectors 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.639
 that she owns and does not keep talking about her 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.319
 has profiles and active 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:09.659
 I found it with an average price 

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:11.759
 of 200 reais and thus closes our 

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:13.919
 amount in 3 thousand and forty-eight reais and 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:16.830
 now a novelty in this video style 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:19.110
 is to put and that the pc will run at the end of 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.569
 video I made a little table that way I 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.530
 I got the average of the species from most 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:23.940
 reviews I saw 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.280
 of course, this is only to serve as a 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.560
 base there is not the exact that you will have 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.539
 there is already a base that I put a 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.250
 margin of error from 3 up and three to 

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:34.139
 down as you are seeing in this 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:38.550
 battlefield table she'll be running in 

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:40.979
 average 60 fps at ultra in full hd 10 4 

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:43.680
 will run an average of 65 ahead with the 

00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:46.830
 second to another also in full hd and
