00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.400
 today we are going to make this little glass of milk and 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.490
 some cookies with plasticine look how 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.139
 they look delicious, let's start here in 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.530
 toys for children we are going to do these 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.230
 cookies look do not insert a txakoli or 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.870
 dark chocolate I also have these mini 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.150
 obviously I will try to do them first 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.750
 let's make the milk we take a little 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.580
 of plasticine we crush a bit of 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.660
 theme I walk a little down not very 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:38.020
 strong because if it would break nation 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.020
 and you have the finished glass of milk 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.670
 Now let's make cookies milÃ¡n 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.840
 I spoke the plasticine on the table and 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.970
 then cut out since I have a cutter 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.380
 of cookies with that figure and I 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.950
 happened to make these cookies with 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.950
 clay 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.280
 the play dough I'm using is from 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.650
 coffee color but in brown or brown coffee 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.200
 clarito as you see on the screen I have the 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.180
 another brown that is the darkest but not 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.190
 it would look good for these cookies already 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.690
 trimmed the two parts the top one and 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.530
 the bottom one now I only have the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.400
 center 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.009
 which is the chocolate now I take envelops 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.840
 pressed and cut and so we already have what 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.420
 it's the chocolate with the center part 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.030
 and I'm going to place it in the middle of the two 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.490
 cookies in this way 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.700
 to go forming the cookie 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.250
 milan and today dignified but pity 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.900
 that you can not eat the cookie 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.650
 has been perfect like that of the 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.170
 We are going to put it here and go to 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.920
 keep working making another 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.290
 cookie 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.840
 but let's make a mini cookie 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.929
 a little bit 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.310
 and then with a lid any lid that 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:07.859
 have or cover something of capital lehman 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.370
 let's cut two black circles for 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:13.800
 do the mini now these are both 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.379
 parts that more outskirts and then we're going to 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.220
 cut the white part that we're going to 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.220
 put him in the middle 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.030
 I'm going to remove the excess plasticine 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.320
 around so it does not get in the way and so 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.320
 half of us 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.030
 but no 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.849
 you can crush with your fingers those 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.819
 edges that are imperfect to go 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.849
 giving the shape and so it looks perfect and 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.090
 we put it on top of the other cookie or 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:54.269
 the other black circle that we did then 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.799
 we take the other one and put it on top and 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.569
 now the 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:03.439
 Orio cookie that looks delicious 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.310
 We will not keep giving me the way 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.840
 I'm perfect 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.230
 I'm going to put it on a plate so the 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.810
 can see how it is and thus be able 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.599
 better appreciate what we have truly done 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.689
 that look like if they were real they 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:21.959
 they look so delicious, you can also 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:24.840
 let it dry for one or two days and so 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.489
 to play with them with your dolls or 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.219

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.150

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.760
