00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.560

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.560

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.500
 years of age and since 4 months ago 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.660
 part of the choir of the children singers of 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.850
 vienna in austria where he now makes his 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.850
 life and so will be the next 4 years 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.570
 I have two hours daily 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.710
 On Saturdays I have 3,000 free times 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.239
 I can go play basketball soccer 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.829
 volleyball we also have a pool if 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.460
 shopping a bicycle 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:50.160
 like like the very big palace then 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.050
 a palace seats among the 100 children 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.150
 while Ivan fulfills his dream in a 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.160
 palace of vienna in mexico in classrooms 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.450
 much more modest other 100 children 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.450
 they also live the dream 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.970
 they are the members of the new 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.860
 symphonic orchestra hope aztec 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.260
 tepito that was created just six ago 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.210
 months and in such a short time these guys 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.950
 have transformed those concerns 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.950
 age-appropriate art 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.960
 whenever I'm playing it 's something like 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.730
 visit the sky because when you already 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.790
 you know all your scores and everything 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.610
 you really enjoy playing and you smile and what 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.710
 you enjoy and it's a feeling that you do not 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.600
 it can be destroyed until you feel it 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.180
 I think it's a great opportunity to 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.360
 all because I do not have the opportunity 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.160
 to pay for classes and for me it's very nice 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.860
 to be able to come here to take direct classes 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.780
 at first I do not even know how 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.150
 they are called instruments 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.119
 they arrive simply because 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.130
 curiosity but as passes 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.619
 time and they are integrated and go 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.560
 doing the first job the first 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.070
 musical work because they start to motivate 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.020
 very much and it is the result that 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:13.890
 you are very applied truth yes I like 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:18.959
 a lot and I feel emotion and feeling 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.060
 then try to give people something they 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.830
 live in tepito considered as one of 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.200
 the most insecure neighborhoods in the city 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.750
 from Mexico but right there these young people 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.520
 between 7 and 18 years old looking to make 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.100
 story grow as great beings 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.510
 human and especially a day not very 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.510
 distant live of music 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.950
 I did not want to come but they forced me 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.890
 and then I loved it I got here by 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.470
 half of my equal cousins I've been 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.180
 forced to come here 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.939
 but it is 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.989
 happy that they forced me because it's 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.989
 fun to be here 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.270
 as you will see the size does not matter in the 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.580
 symphonic orchestra hope aztec this 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.950
 Little girl of only 10 years faces 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.960
 before these huge kettledrums that I think 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.240
 They are taller than her but it does not matter 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.750
 here the important thing is the love of 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.750
 music 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.220
 I arrived this 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.410
 it did not catch my attention and then later 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.120
 I said percussions 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.780
 but it's a very big instrument 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:50.630
 How many days a week do you practice? 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.670
 practical every day two hours 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.950
 from his short experience to our 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.210
 child singer of vienna mexican advises 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.640
 the guys from the hope orchestra 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.570
 Aztec so that as he does not stop 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.570
 pursue your dreams 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.560
 if they like to sing they keep doing it 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.659
 until they have a chance I think 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.750
 that more than all that is the taste and that 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:18.269
 gives it to you then if I eat those children 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.000
 who like to follow it, are going to 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.359
 keep doing because they want to buy 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.359
 we are 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.190
 until news
