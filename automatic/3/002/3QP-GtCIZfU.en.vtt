the same guy I got him from it with that
they<00:00:25.730> threw<00:00:25.940> in<00:00:26.120> a<00:00:26.210> little<00:00:26.800> flash<00:00:27.850> stand<00:00:28.850> so

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
they threw in a little flash stand so

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.270 
they threw in a little flash stand so
which<00:00:30.020> is<00:00:30.050> kind<00:00:30.320> of<00:00:30.350> useful<00:00:30.530> since<00:00:30.830> this<00:00:31.070> is

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:31.280 
which is kind of useful since this is

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.740 
which is kind of useful since this is
actually<00:00:31.700> has<00:00:31.820> a<00:00:31.850> hot<00:00:32.029> shoe<00:00:32.180> mount<00:00:32.300> so<00:00:32.629> you're

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
actually has a hot shoe mount so you're

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.869 
actually has a hot shoe mount so you're
going<00:00:32.840> to<00:00:32.899> need<00:00:33.170> this<00:00:33.320> in<00:00:33.500> order<00:00:33.559> to<00:00:33.829> to<00:00:34.579> set<00:00:34.760> it

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
going to need this in order to to set it

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.950 
going to need this in order to to set it
on<00:00:34.969> something<00:00:34.999> and<00:00:35.480> also<00:00:36.109> to<00:00:36.199> mount<00:00:36.469> it<00:00:36.679> to<00:00:36.710> a

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
on something and also to mount it to a

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.009 
on something and also to mount it to a
light<00:00:38.960> stand<00:00:39.730> if<00:00:40.730> you<00:00:40.879> don't<00:00:41.030> have<00:00:41.179> a<00:00:41.210> flash

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
light stand if you don't have a flash

Kelvin<00:00:48.739> temperature<00:00:48.859> I<00:00:50.289> have<00:00:51.289> to<00:00:51.409> differ<00:00:51.620> with

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
Kelvin temperature I have to differ with

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.860 
Kelvin temperature I have to differ with
that<00:00:52.010> I<00:00:52.219> would<00:00:52.429> have<00:00:52.489> to<00:00:52.640> say<00:00:52.670> it's<00:00:52.969> about<00:00:53.059> 5000

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
that I would have to say it's about 5000

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.459 
that I would have to say it's about 5000
k<00:00:54.819> it's<00:00:55.819> gonna<00:00:55.969> have<00:00:56.120> a<00:00:56.149> green<00:00:56.420> spike<00:00:56.719> so

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
k it's gonna have a green spike so

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:58.719 
k it's gonna have a green spike so
you're<00:00:57.649> going<00:00:57.739> to<00:00:57.800> want<00:00:57.889> to<00:00:58.069> use<00:00:58.129> some<00:00:58.460> minus

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
you're going to want to use some minus

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.079 
you're going to want to use some minus
screen<00:00:59.030> or<00:00:59.479> a<00:00:59.539> magenta<00:01:00.549> it<00:01:01.549> actually<00:01:01.760> comes

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
screen or a magenta it actually comes

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.509 
screen or a magenta it actually comes
with<00:01:02.239> some<00:01:02.420> filters<00:01:03.129> one<00:01:04.129> of<00:01:04.250> them<00:01:04.339> is<00:01:04.370> a

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
with some filters one of them is a

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.370 
with some filters one of them is a
magenta<00:01:04.909> filter<00:01:05.210> which<00:01:05.659> I<00:01:05.840> haven't<00:01:06.140> tested

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
magenta filter which I haven't tested

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.140 
magenta filter which I haven't tested
yet<00:01:06.620> so<00:01:07.010> because<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:07.520> first<00:01:07.700> one<00:01:07.760> I<00:01:07.880> order

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
yet so because the first one I order

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.970 
yet so because the first one I order
didn't<00:01:08.420> have<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.720> magenta<00:01:09.110> filter<00:01:09.380> so<00:01:09.620> I'm<00:01:09.860> up

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
didn't have the magenta filter so I'm up

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.760 
didn't have the magenta filter so I'm up
I<00:01:10.280> guess<00:01:10.910> they<00:01:11.900> forgot<00:01:12.050> to<00:01:12.230> put<00:01:12.470> it<00:01:12.500> in<00:01:12.650> there

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
I guess they forgot to put it in there

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.340 
I guess they forgot to put it in there
which<00:01:13.670> is<00:01:13.790> fine<00:01:14.000> by<00:01:14.180> me<00:01:14.330> because<00:01:14.510> I've<00:01:14.780> got<00:01:14.990> my

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
which is fine by me because I've got my

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.070 
which is fine by me because I've got my
own-<00:01:15.650> green<00:01:15.980> so<00:01:16.450> but<00:01:17.450> i'll<00:01:17.540> check<00:01:17.750> that<00:01:17.930> later

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
own- green so but i'll check that later

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.110 
own- green so but i'll check that later
on<00:01:18.230> and<00:01:18.620> see<00:01:18.710> how<00:01:18.890> well<00:01:19.040> that<00:01:19.070> works<00:01:19.340> also<00:01:19.760> it

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
on and see how well that works also it

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.510 
on and see how well that works also it
comes<00:01:20.240> with<00:01:20.360> a<00:01:20.450> CTO<00:01:20.900> filter<00:01:21.320> as<00:01:21.500> well<00:01:21.530> this<00:01:22.280> is

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
comes with a CTO filter as well this is

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.040 
comes with a CTO filter as well this is
pretty<00:01:22.850> much<00:01:22.940> a<00:01:23.060> piece<00:01:23.210> of<00:01:23.270> garbage<00:01:23.480> so<00:01:23.810> i

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
pretty much a piece of garbage so i

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.550 
pretty much a piece of garbage so i
would<00:01:24.290> just<00:01:24.440> throw<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:25.280> thing<00:01:25.400> out<00:01:26.410> it<00:01:27.410> does

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
would just throw that thing out it does

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.790 
would just throw that thing out it does
have<00:01:27.710> a<00:01:27.770> diffusion<00:01:28.310> bit<00:01:28.730> on<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:28.940> front<00:01:29.150> here

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
have a diffusion bit on the front here

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.760 
have a diffusion bit on the front here
which<00:01:31.420> doesn't<00:01:32.420> really<00:01:32.480> do<00:01:32.720> a<00:01:32.750> whole<00:01:32.840> lot<00:01:32.960> but

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
which doesn't really do a whole lot but

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.310 
which doesn't really do a whole lot but
i<00:01:34.040> use<00:01:34.370> it<00:01:34.550> to<00:01:34.670> hold<00:01:34.820> in<00:01:35.060> filters<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:35.960> i<00:01:35.990> can<00:01:36.200> use

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
i use it to hold in filters so i can use

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.680 
i use it to hold in filters so i can use
it<00:01:36.470> to<00:01:36.620> slide<00:01:37.430> your<00:01:37.580> other<00:01:37.700> filtration<00:01:38.570> in

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
it to slide your other filtration in

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.470 
it to slide your other filtration in
there<00:01:39.190> it's<00:01:40.190> plastic<00:01:40.610> construction<00:01:40.760> so<00:01:41.300> don't

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
there it's plastic construction so don't

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.110 
there it's plastic construction so don't
drop<00:01:41.690> the<00:01:41.810> thing<00:01:41.960> because<00:01:42.230> it<00:01:42.350> will<00:01:42.440> break<00:01:43.120> but

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
drop the thing because it will break but

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.400 
drop the thing because it will break but
does<00:01:44.240> have<00:01:44.330> a<00:01:44.390> lot<00:01:44.510> of<00:01:44.570> power<00:01:44.780> options<00:01:45.230> here

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
does have a lot of power options here

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.380 
does have a lot of power options here
you've<00:01:45.890> got<00:01:45.920> double<00:01:46.760> a<00:01:46.850> batteries<00:01:47.210> that<00:01:47.360> you

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
you've got double a batteries that you

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.260 
you've got double a batteries that you
can<00:01:47.570> in<00:01:48.350> there<00:01:48.530> it<00:01:48.740> takes<00:01:48.920> six<00:01:49.700> of<00:01:49.820> those<00:01:49.970> and

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
can in there it takes six of those and

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.320 
can in there it takes six of those and
then<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:50.840> can<00:01:50.960> lock<00:01:51.140> that<00:01:51.200> in<00:01:51.560> with<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:51.800> little

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
then you can lock that in with a little

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.040 
then you can lock that in with a little
little<00:01:53.330> clap<00:01:53.660> clasp<00:01:54.170> here<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:54.710> it<00:01:54.800> pops<00:01:55.100> in

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
little clap clasp here that it pops in

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.690 
little clap clasp here that it pops in
also<00:01:57.050> you<00:01:57.620> can<00:01:57.770> use<00:01:57.800> some<00:01:58.040> aftermarket

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
also you can use some aftermarket

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.060 
also you can use some aftermarket
batteries<00:01:59.330> or<00:01:59.510> just<00:01:59.720> simple<00:01:59.930> batteries<00:02:00.890> get

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
batteries or just simple batteries get

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.310 
batteries or just simple batteries get
laying<00:02:01.250> around<00:02:01.490> this<00:02:01.610> is<00:02:01.760> here<00:02:01.940> is<00:02:02.060> an<00:02:02.180> MP<00:02:02.510> f550

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
laying around this is here is an MP f550

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.010 
laying around this is here is an MP f550
aftermarket<00:02:04.100> battery<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:05.510> just<00:02:05.750> pops

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
aftermarket battery and it just pops

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.580 
aftermarket battery and it just pops
right<00:02:06.170> in<00:02:06.380> there

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.800 

and<00:02:10.679> or<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.610> can<00:02:11.730> also<00:02:11.879> use<00:02:12.030> this<00:02:12.330> adapter

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
and or you can also use this adapter

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.839 
and or you can also use this adapter
right<00:02:12.930> here<00:02:13.170> as<00:02:13.260> well<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.830> this<00:02:14.280> will<00:02:14.459> let<00:02:14.640> you

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
right here as well and this will let you

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.690 
right here as well and this will let you
use<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.769> Panasonic<00:02:16.769> and<00:02:16.950> I've<00:02:17.160> got<00:02:17.310> one<00:02:17.459> here

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
use a Panasonic and I've got one here

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.190 
use a Panasonic and I've got one here
with<00:02:17.849> a<00:02:17.879> panasonic<00:02:18.780> already<00:02:19.110> on<00:02:21.019> it's<00:02:22.019> got<00:02:22.170> a

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
with a panasonic already on it's got a

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.780 
with a panasonic already on it's got a
built-in<00:02:22.560> battery<00:02:22.800> tester<00:02:23.310> which<00:02:23.459> i<00:02:23.580> think<00:02:23.640> is

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
built-in battery tester which i think is

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.449 
built-in battery tester which i think is
pretty<00:02:23.970> useful<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.290> does<00:02:25.470> it's<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:25.980> far<00:02:26.220> my

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
pretty useful and it does it's so far my

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.369 
pretty useful and it does it's so far my
testing<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.420> seems<00:02:27.629> to<00:02:27.810> be<00:02:27.930> pretty<00:02:28.140> accurate

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
testing it seems to be pretty accurate

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.070 
testing it seems to be pretty accurate
so<00:02:29.220> i'm<00:02:29.580> showing<00:02:30.090> two<00:02:30.269> bars<00:02:30.480> in<00:02:30.660> this<00:02:30.780> battery

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
so i'm showing two bars in this battery

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.320 
so i'm showing two bars in this battery
here<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.489> of<00:02:32.489> course<00:02:32.700> this<00:02:32.819> thing's<00:02:33.030> dimmable

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
here and of course this thing's dimmable

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.910 
here and of course this thing's dimmable
so<00:02:33.629> i<00:02:33.660> think<00:02:33.840> that's<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.140> great<00:02:34.260> thing<00:02:34.470> too<00:02:34.680> so

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
so i think that's a great thing too so

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.979 
so i think that's a great thing too so
you<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.040> actually<00:02:35.390> get<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.450> lot<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.870> light

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
you can actually get a lot of the light

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.869 
you can actually get a lot of the light
output<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:39.950> dim<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.069> as<00:02:41.220> well<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.610> need<00:02:41.760> to

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
output and dim it as well you need to

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.229 
output and dim it as well you need to
reduce<00:02:42.269> it<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.690> little<00:02:42.900> bit<00:02:43.760> you'll<00:02:44.760> see<00:02:44.970> here

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
reduce it a little bit you'll see here

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.420 
reduce it a little bit you'll see here
that<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:46.650> ends<00:02:46.860> up<00:02:46.950> being<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.190> little<00:02:47.310> bit

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
that it ends up being a little bit

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.699 
that it ends up being a little bit
spotty<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.239> you're<00:02:48.959> not<00:02:49.049> going<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.260> be<00:02:49.410> using

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
spotty so you're not going to be using

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.850 
spotty so you're not going to be using
this<00:02:49.950> as<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:51.750> know<00:02:51.840> as<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.019> broad<00:02:52.290> fill<00:02:52.620> light

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
this as a you know as a broad fill light

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.289 
this as a you know as a broad fill light
not<00:02:53.849> by<00:02:54.000> itself<00:02:54.269> at<00:02:54.480> least<00:02:55.400> but<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.610> can<00:02:56.760> scott

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
not by itself at least but you can scott

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:58.850 
not by itself at least but you can scott
still<00:02:57.599> it's<00:02:57.750> got<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.930> lot<00:02:58.079> of<00:02:58.140> really<00:02:58.379> good<00:02:58.500> uses

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
still it's got a lot of really good uses

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.270 
still it's got a lot of really good uses
for<00:02:59.690> and<00:03:00.690> i<00:03:01.379> think<00:03:01.590> that's<00:03:01.739> pretty<00:03:01.920> much<00:03:02.099> all

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
for and i think that's pretty much all

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.920 
for and i think that's pretty much all
the<00:03:02.400> major<00:03:02.579> features<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.569> hot<00:03:03.720> shoe

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
the major features the the hot shoe

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.890 
the major features the the hot shoe
mounts<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.260> bit<00:03:04.410> flimsy<00:03:04.860> so<00:03:05.069> i<00:03:05.099> would<00:03:05.370> recommend

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
mounts a bit flimsy so i would recommend

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.000 
mounts a bit flimsy so i would recommend
either<00:03:06.900> trying<00:03:07.319> to<00:03:07.379> come<00:03:07.560> up<00:03:07.590> with<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:07.860> better

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
either trying to come up with a better

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.559 
either trying to come up with a better
solution<00:03:08.310> for<00:03:08.790> this<00:03:08.879> and<00:03:09.150> does<00:03:09.269> have<00:03:09.420> some

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
solution for this and does have some

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.680 
solution for this and does have some
screws<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:10.079> can<00:03:10.230> remove<00:03:10.470> this<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:11.730> haven't

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
screws you can remove this I haven't

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.940 
screws you can remove this I haven't
figured<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:12.959> out<00:03:13.049> yet<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:13.349> if<00:03:13.560> anybody<00:03:13.860> has

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
figured that out yet so if anybody has

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.770 
figured that out yet so if anybody has
any<00:03:13.980> ideas<00:03:14.400> please<00:03:14.730> leave<00:03:15.239> me<00:03:15.329> a<00:03:15.359> comment<00:03:15.540> let

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
any ideas please leave me a comment let

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.870 
any ideas please leave me a comment let
me<00:03:15.810> know<00:03:15.920> would<00:03:16.920> love<00:03:17.069> to<00:03:17.190> hear<00:03:17.310> about<00:03:17.340> I'd

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
me know would love to hear about I'd

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.970 
me know would love to hear about I'd
love<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.180> hear<00:03:18.269> your<00:03:18.329> ideas<00:03:18.799> but<00:03:19.799> in<00:03:19.889> the

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
love to hear your ideas but in the

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.920 
love to hear your ideas but in the
meantime<00:03:20.130> I<00:03:20.400> would<00:03:20.609> probably<00:03:20.790> recommend<00:03:21.209> not

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
meantime I would probably recommend not

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.530 
meantime I would probably recommend not
relying<00:03:22.620> on<00:03:22.769> this<00:03:22.889> too<00:03:23.100> much<00:03:23.220> because<00:03:23.540> you

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
relying on this too much because you

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.229 
relying on this too much because you
know<00:03:24.630> this<00:03:24.780> thing<00:03:24.989> is<00:03:25.019> kind<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.739> flimsy<00:03:25.980> so<00:03:26.430> and

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
know this thing is kind of flimsy so and

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.000 
know this thing is kind of flimsy so and
it<00:03:27.359> doesn't<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.870> mean<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.440> got<00:03:28.590> these<00:03:28.680> things

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
it doesn't I mean I got these things

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.009 
it doesn't I mean I got these things
crank<00:03:29.670> down<00:03:29.849> and<00:03:30.120> I<00:03:30.299> can<00:03:30.480> still<00:03:30.660> move<00:03:30.870> it

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
crank down and I can still move it

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.410 
crank down and I can still move it
pretty<00:03:31.319> easily<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:31.739> if<00:03:32.730> you're<00:03:32.910> gonna<00:03:33.000> do<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.269> I

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
pretty easily so if you're gonna do it I

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.420 
pretty easily so if you're gonna do it I
would<00:03:33.540> probably<00:03:33.630> recommend<00:03:34.019> keeping<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.280> in<00:03:35.370> a

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
would probably recommend keeping it in a

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.009 
would probably recommend keeping it in a
position<00:03:35.670> somewhat<00:03:36.209> like<00:03:36.329> that<00:03:36.540> just<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:36.900> that

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
position somewhat like that just so that

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.759 
position somewhat like that just so that
doesn't<00:03:37.349> have<00:03:37.829> a<00:03:37.859> tendency<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.400> move<00:03:38.760> as<00:03:38.880> much

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
doesn't have a tendency to move as much

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.319

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
I like to just throw about a quarter to

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.819 
I like to just throw about a quarter to
three<00:03:59.940> eighths<00:04:00.389> minus<00:04:00.750> screen<00:04:00.989> it<00:04:01.500> seems<00:04:01.769> to

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
three eighths minus screen it seems to

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.009 
three eighths minus screen it seems to
do<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:01.980> trick<00:04:02.099> a<00:04:02.489> quarter<00:04:03.150> see<00:04:03.450> maybe<00:04:03.720> just<00:04:03.900> a

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
do the trick a quarter see maybe just a

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.949 
do the trick a quarter see maybe just a
little<00:04:04.139> just<00:04:04.709> a<00:04:04.859> little<00:04:04.889> bit<00:04:05.720> slight<00:04:06.720> green

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
little just a little bit slight green

little just a little bit slight green
edge<00:04:07.169> to<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:08.540> I<00:04:09.560> did<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.590> half<00:04:10.859> is<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:11.130> only

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
edge to it and I did a half is I only

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.610 
edge to it and I did a half is I only
have<00:04:11.579> quarter-<00:04:12.450> screen<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:12.930> I<00:04:12.959> double<00:04:13.410> it<00:04:13.470> up

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
have quarter- screen so I double it up

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.770 
have quarter- screen so I double it up
and<00:04:13.799> did<00:04:13.889> a<00:04:13.919> half<00:04:14.190> and<00:04:14.519> a<00:04:15.120> half<00:04:15.329> seemed<00:04:15.569> to<00:04:15.660> be

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
and did a half and a half seemed to be

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.060 
and did a half and a half seemed to be
just<00:04:15.810> a<00:04:15.989> little<00:04:16.019> too<00:04:16.229> much<00:04:16.530> so<00:04:16.799> I<00:04:16.829> would

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
just a little too much so I would

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.009 
just a little too much so I would
probably<00:04:17.370> recommend<00:04:17.609> just<00:04:18.299> you<00:04:18.719> know<00:04:18.780> by<00:04:18.989> a

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
probably recommend just you know by a

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.529 
probably recommend just you know by a
sheet<00:04:19.289> of<00:04:19.380> this<00:04:19.530> stuff<00:04:19.769> you<00:04:20.370> know<00:04:20.459> at<00:04:20.579> 18<00:04:20.969> minus

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
sheet of this stuff you know at 18 minus

sheet of this stuff you know at 18 minus

green

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.680 
green
just<00:04:22.920> you<00:04:23.160> know<00:04:23.190> put<00:04:23.520> two<00:04:24.030> or<00:04:24.150> three<00:04:24.270> pieces<00:04:24.480> in

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
just you know put two or three pieces in

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.270 
just you know put two or three pieces in
there<00:04:24.810> and<00:04:25.320> see<00:04:25.530> what<00:04:25.650> that<00:04:25.740> does<00:04:25.920> for<00:04:25.950> you

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
there and see what that does for you

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.740 
there and see what that does for you
also<00:04:27.180> I<00:04:27.420> have<00:04:28.170> a<00:04:28.200> tendency<00:04:28.410> to<00:04:28.560> balance<00:04:29.010> to<00:04:29.750> the

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
also I have a tendency to balance to the

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.810 
also I have a tendency to balance to the
daylight<00:04:31.080> setting<00:04:31.380> on<00:04:31.530> my<00:04:31.620> camera<00:04:31.740> here<00:04:32.280> so<00:04:32.460> if

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
daylight setting on my camera here so if

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.330 
daylight setting on my camera here so if
you're<00:04:32.970> balancing<00:04:33.420> 250<00:04:33.840> 200<00:04:34.320> which<00:04:34.860> is<00:04:35.040> what

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
you're balancing 250 200 which is what

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.700 
you're balancing 250 200 which is what
my<00:04:35.520> day<00:04:35.580> let<00:04:35.850> setting<00:04:36.120> is<00:04:36.210> on<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.450> t2i<00:04:36.870> then

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
my day let setting is on the t2i then

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.900 
my day let setting is on the t2i then
you're<00:04:38.100> going<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.250> probably<00:04:38.460> want<00:04:38.700> to<00:04:38.790> be

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
you're going to probably want to be

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.930 
you're going to probably want to be
using<00:04:39.300> about<00:04:39.660> 18<00:04:40.020> CTB<00:04:40.590> that<00:04:41.430> seemed<00:04:41.700> to<00:04:41.730> do<00:04:41.910> the

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
using about 18 CTB that seemed to do the

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.120 
using about 18 CTB that seemed to do the
trick<00:04:42.030> got<00:04:42.750> me<00:04:42.870> right<00:04:43.020> up<00:04:43.080> there<00:04:43.320> perfect<00:04:43.770> if

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
trick got me right up there perfect if

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.200 
trick got me right up there perfect if
you're<00:04:44.250> going<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.400> go<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.550> little<00:04:44.760> higher<00:04:44.940> than

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
you're going to go a little higher than

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.000 
you're going to go a little higher than
that<00:04:45.330> if<00:04:45.690> you<00:04:45.870> want<00:04:46.020> to<00:04:46.080> go<00:04:46.170> balance<00:04:46.530> up<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.740> 50

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
that if you want to go balance up to 50

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.730 
that if you want to go balance up to 50
400<00:04:47.610> or<00:04:47.850> if<00:04:47.910> you're<00:04:48.000> going<00:04:48.150> to<00:04:48.240> 55<00:04:48.750> or<00:04:49.200> 56<00:04:49.410> or

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
400 or if you're going to 55 or 56 or

400 or if you're going to 55 or 56 or
whatever<00:04:49.980> well<00:04:50.580> then<00:04:50.730> here<00:04:51.420> on<00:04:51.540> your<00:04:51.630> own

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
whatever well then here on your own

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.480 
whatever well then here on your own
because<00:04:51.960> I<00:04:52.140> don't<00:04:52.290> I<00:04:52.500> don't<00:04:52.800> know<00:04:53.070> what<00:04:53.370> those

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
because I don't I don't know what those

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.490 
because I don't I don't know what those
would<00:04:53.640> be<00:04:53.760> well<00:04:54.750> actually<00:04:54.870> I'd<00:04:55.110> probably<00:04:55.290> do

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
would be well actually I'd probably do

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.700 
would be well actually I'd probably do
the<00:04:55.530> seer<00:04:56.430> I<00:04:56.730> had<00:04:57.030> it<00:04:57.180> my<00:04:57.510> cheat<00:04:57.780> sheet<00:04:57.810> here<00:04:58.020> we

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
the seer I had it my cheat sheet here we

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.659 
the seer I had it my cheat sheet here we
ended<00:04:58.919> up<00:04:59.040> at<00:04:59.250> a<00:05:00.530> quarter<00:05:01.530> CTB<00:05:02.040> got<00:05:02.280> me<00:05:02.400> up<00:05:02.520> to

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
ended up at a quarter CTB got me up to

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.210 
ended up at a quarter CTB got me up to
about<00:05:02.760> 50<00:05:03.060> or<00:05:03.120> 500<00:05:03.270> k<00:05:03.630> so<00:05:03.930> so<00:05:04.740> they're<00:05:04.890> heaven

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
about 50 or 500 k so so they're heaven

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.400 
about 50 or 500 k so so they're heaven
so<00:05:05.580> if<00:05:05.700> you're<00:05:05.790> trying<00:05:05.940> to<00:05:06.060> get<00:05:06.240> so<00:05:06.540> 52<00:05:06.960> just

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
so if you're trying to get so 52 just

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.760 
so if you're trying to get so 52 just
use<00:05:07.590> a<00:05:07.620> a<00:05:08.190> one-eighth<00:05:09.120> CTB<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.050> if<00:05:10.470> you<00:05:10.560> want

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
use a a one-eighth CTB and if you want

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.340 
use a a one-eighth CTB and if you want
to<00:05:11.310> get<00:05:11.430> all<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.640> way<00:05:11.730> up<00:05:11.850> then<00:05:12.060> 250<00:05:12.570> 500<00:05:12.900> k

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
to get all the way up then 250 500 k

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.320 
to get all the way up then 250 500 k
then<00:05:13.650> you<00:05:13.950> can<00:05:14.070> use<00:05:14.280> a<00:05:14.310> quarter<00:05:14.910> CTB<00:05:17.150> that<00:05:18.150> is

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
then you can use a quarter CTB that is

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.780 
then you can use a quarter CTB that is
pretty<00:05:18.600> much<00:05:18.780> it<00:05:18.840> so<00:05:19.080> I<00:05:19.560> will<00:05:20.490> leave<00:05:20.580> it<00:05:20.730> at

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
pretty much it so I will leave it at

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.580 
pretty much it so I will leave it at
that<00:05:20.960> overall<00:05:21.960> I<00:05:21.990> think<00:05:22.110> this<00:05:22.320> is<00:05:22.380> a<00:05:22.440> really

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
that overall I think this is a really

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.050 
that overall I think this is a really
