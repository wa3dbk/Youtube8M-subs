00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hello my dear ones to one 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.330
 new video from me today is about 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.130
 my dearest summer tail her 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.080
 Of course, everyone on the beach 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.759
 or take to the lake and me 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.330
 would say I wish you a lot 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.520
 fun fall video in the first hack it goes 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.910
 around the strawberry resp 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.820
 around the green of the strawberry who knows that 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.400
 not the strawberries so tasty but always 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.289
 cut off this annoying green stuff 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.970
 and if you do it then it will 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.980
 really to cut it off 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.570
 then there is still a lot of strawberry 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.710
 on the green and that's what you really want 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.110
 avoid 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.790
 and there is a very simple one 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.910
 trick you just take one 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.219
 straw best a very firm 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.000
 and a strawberry and pics from below 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.670
 up 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.500
 the straw through the strawberry and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.690
 if you are lucky you will meet immediately 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.420
 the middle and cologne the stream quasi 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.820
 Immediately press out and then you have 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.820
 a perfectly made strawberry 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.489
 O 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.390
 in the next rear, it's about a small one 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.640
 refreshment resp 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.770
 They just make us nice ice cubes 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.140
 even and we have the strawberries straight 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.880
 so nice of the green have freed use 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.030
 Let's just keep going now 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.580
 first cut into pieces and 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.010
 then I put them in a bar or 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.570
 that's now been a ice form the 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.369
 I had left but you could 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.830
 Of course, as a dice shape take 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.900
 or everything she has at home and there 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.670
 into it you lead your strawberries and 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.670
 it fills up the water 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.040
 then you give that for about 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.650
 one and a half hours in the fridge 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.240
 you then super nice ice cubes with yours 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.830
 strawberries of course you can too 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.140
 other fruits in there 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.210
 and unfortunately it does not come and how 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.340
 it presented to me but the meaning counts 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.380
 and I just do it in mine 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.750
 sparkling water and it is a bit 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.370
 refreshing it cools and you have the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.740
 delicious strawberry fritters because drinne 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.980
 and yes I would say leave it to you 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.980
 taste 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.220
 my next stern is a watermelon 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.150
 to portion correctly 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.709
 who does not know this eternal one 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.780
 little pieces and these funny ships 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.879
 which you cut off and at the end you have 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.310
 but everything in the face depends on that 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.750
 easy to escape, halve yours 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.120
 Watermelon just like me 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.940
 she turns around 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.790
 and then you just start from the outside 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:24.549
 simply the melon inside 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.549
 to divide again into equal pieces 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.760
 if you did that once you did it 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.760
 and do the same again 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:55.810
 and now you can just do yours 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.560
 bite-sized pieces of the watermelon 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.560
 pull out 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.629
 the next hack is probably the most 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.690
 the hack is shown here on youtube 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:10.269
 and it's about the famous one 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.519
 hiding sun milk or trenches 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.260
 possibility for the beach for his 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.479
 hang those to his keys and for 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.919
 small money but I think that's the case 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.079
 I have often been shown that 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.810
 meanwhile everyone has the price where he what 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.370
 has to find and yes, that's one 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.410
 cool story but I still have 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.720
 another trick and that for the 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.639
 moms under us have it easy 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.280
 because you always have a pampers with you 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.550
 I hide our things 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.320
 mostly in a diaper and roll it 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.090
 then just put it together again and let it go 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.610
 they are lying there and now let's say 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.610
 honestly what the cloud is a pampers 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.470
 stands 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.310
 The last tail is a hack you with 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.750
 can do all fruits like you 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.690
 I need since I now have my 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.580
 Strawberries taken and a piece of melon 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.440
 it works best with fruits 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.220
 so much water is included 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.540
 melon strawberries trust something like that and that 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.200
 Now I just do it in the freezer 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.390
 and let it in for about 40 to 50 minutes 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.790
 the freezer and then you have one 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.830
 super tasty snack very refreshing 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.260
 and in any case very healthy yes you 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.730
 love that was my five dearest now 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.290
 summer hacks i hope that you guys 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.900
 We liked it the next time 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.650
