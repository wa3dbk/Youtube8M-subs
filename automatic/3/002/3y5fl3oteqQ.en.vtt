work<00:02:06.110> in<00:02:06.350> spiral<00:02:06.890> routes<00:02:07.190> I<00:02:07.640> will<00:02:07.940> work<00:02:08.179> this

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
work in spiral routes I will work this

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.650 
work in spiral routes I will work this
joining<00:02:10.940> round<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:16.190> then<00:02:16.370> we<00:02:16.550> start<00:02:16.940> with<00:02:17.600> a

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
joining round and then we start with a

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
joining round and then we start with a
decrease<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.730> from<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.209> second<00:02:23.870> row<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.620> will

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
decrease so from the second row I will

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.160 
decrease so from the second row I will
go<00:02:25.070> only<00:02:25.310> through<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.880> front<00:02:26.239> loop<00:02:26.540> do<00:02:27.080> you

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
go only through the front loop do you

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.120 
go only through the front loop do you
have<00:02:27.410> my<00:02:27.620> pattern<00:02:28.070> again<00:02:29.320> first<00:02:30.320> decrease<00:02:30.800> and

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
have my pattern again first decrease and

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.410 
have my pattern again first decrease and
I<00:02:31.220> will<00:02:31.459> continue<00:02:32.060> with<00:02:32.270> single<00:02:32.450> crochets<00:02:34.420> to

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
I will continue with single crochets to

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.009 
I will continue with single crochets to
the<00:02:35.570> end<00:02:35.720> of<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.020> row<00:02:37.299> which<00:02:38.299> one<00:02:38.660> here

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
the end of the row which one here

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.009 
the end of the row which one here
gan-chan<00:02:39.350> wanted<00:02:40.160> my<00:02:40.310> work<00:02:40.519> and<00:02:40.880> continue<00:02:41.630> in

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
gan-chan wanted my work and continue in

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.050 
gan-chan wanted my work and continue in
single<00:02:42.410> crochet<00:02:42.739> and<00:02:43.070> single<00:02:43.400> crochets<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:43.940> I

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
single crochet and single crochets and I

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.250 
single crochet and single crochets and I
will<00:02:44.239> alternate<00:02:45.220> between<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.880> row<00:02:47.230> with<00:02:48.230> a

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
will alternate between a row with a

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.820 
will alternate between a row with a
decrease<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:50.150> row<00:02:50.500> without<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.739> decrease<00:02:53.830> it

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
decrease and a row without a decrease it

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.030 
decrease and a row without a decrease it
will<00:02:55.130> look<00:02:55.280> like<00:02:55.489> this<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:59.720> you<00:02:59.780> will<00:03:00.080> get<00:03:00.410> this

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
will look like this so you will get this

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.120 
will look like this so you will get this
curve<00:03:01.459> so<00:03:01.970> you<00:03:02.030> have<00:03:02.269> always<00:03:02.920> row<00:03:03.920> with

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
curve so you have always row with

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.650 
curve so you have always row with
decrease<00:03:04.670> row<00:03:05.269> without<00:03:05.450> decrease<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:06.380> so<00:03:06.560> on

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
decrease row without decrease and so on

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.030 
decrease row without decrease and so on
and<00:03:08.660> if<00:03:09.380> you<00:03:09.560> want<00:03:09.590> sleeve<00:03:10.310> is<00:03:11.120> thick<00:03:11.510> enough

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
and if you want sleeve is thick enough

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.800 
and if you want sleeve is thick enough
then<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.190> can<00:03:13.430> stop<00:03:13.820> decreasing<00:03:14.660> and

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
then you can stop decreasing and

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.110 
then you can stop decreasing and
continue<00:03:15.560> crocheting<00:03:16.160> single<00:03:16.640> crochets<00:03:17.000> and

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
continue crocheting single crochets and

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.720 
continue crocheting single crochets and
rows<00:03:17.269> without<00:03:17.570> decreasing<00:03:18.019> and<00:03:18.590> then<00:03:18.860> we'll

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
rows without decreasing and then we'll

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.220 
rows without decreasing and then we'll
meet<00:03:20.000> again<00:03:20.150> at<00:03:20.750> this<00:03:21.170> point<00:03:22.450> my<00:03:23.450> sleep<00:03:23.750> is<00:03:23.780> now

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
meet again at this point my sleep is now

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.990 
meet again at this point my sleep is now
long<00:03:24.799> enough

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000
