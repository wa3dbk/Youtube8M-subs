the<00:01:49.600> system<00:01:50.200> logo<00:01:50.619> or<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.369> certain<00:01:52.119> edition

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
the system logo or the certain edition

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.569 
the system logo or the certain edition
for<00:01:52.840> Windows<00:01:53.109> 8<00:01:53.409> it's<00:01:53.979> not<00:01:54.130> really<00:01:54.310> going<00:01:54.520> to

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
for Windows 8 it's not really going to

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.580 
for Windows 8 it's not really going to
happen<00:01:54.729> if<00:01:55.030> you<00:01:55.270> go<00:01:55.390> over<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:56.020> control

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
happen if you go over to the control

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.649 
happen if you go over to the control
panel<00:01:56.619> you<00:01:57.189> can<00:01:57.340> see<00:01:57.579> that<00:01:57.609> the<00:01:57.969> forefront<00:01:58.450> of

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
panel you can see that the forefront of

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.359 
panel you can see that the forefront of
the<00:01:58.810> control<00:01:59.140> panel<00:01:59.500> has<00:01:59.649> been<00:01:59.890> changed<00:02:00.280> as

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
the control panel has been changed as

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.099 
the control panel has been changed as
well<00:02:00.399> but<00:02:00.789> if<00:02:00.909> you<00:02:00.969> go<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.390> larger<00:02:01.899> icons

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:02.109 
well but if you go to the larger icons

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:04.469 
well but if you go to the larger icons
in<00:02:02.829> the<00:02:02.950> category<00:02:03.399> view<00:02:03.640> you<00:02:03.939> will<00:02:04.090> see<00:02:04.299> that

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
in the category view you will see that

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.630 
in the category view you will see that
there's<00:02:04.750> only<00:02:04.990> been<00:02:05.259> a<00:02:05.500> few<00:02:05.590> changes<00:02:05.829> made<00:02:06.460> and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
there's only been a few changes made and

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.330 
there's only been a few changes made and
the<00:02:07.000> all<00:02:07.390> control<00:02:07.929> panel<00:02:08.200> items<00:02:08.500> back<00:02:08.979> over

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
the all control panel items back over

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.640 
the all control panel items back over
here<00:02:09.550> to<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.880> title<00:02:10.390> bar<00:02:10.570> or<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:10.899> active<00:02:11.410> bar

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
here to the title bar or the active bar

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.530 
here to the title bar or the active bar
you<00:02:12.130> can<00:02:12.280> see<00:02:12.490> that<00:02:12.700> they<00:02:12.820> minimize<00:02:13.210> maximize

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
you can see that they minimize maximize

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.090 
you can see that they minimize maximize
in<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.200> close<00:02:14.440> buttons<00:02:14.830> they<00:02:15.010> just<00:02:15.310> have<00:02:15.490> that

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
in the close buttons they just have that

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.120 
in the close buttons they just have that
you<00:02:16.160> know<00:02:16.220> that<00:02:16.430> settle<00:02:17.000> minimize<00:02:17.450> simplistic

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
you know that settle minimize simplistic

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.590 
you know that settle minimize simplistic
aspect<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.610> I<00:02:19.820> guess<00:02:20.000> that's<00:02:20.120> exactly

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
aspect to it and I guess that's exactly

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.510 
aspect to it and I guess that's exactly
what<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:21.110> creator<00:02:21.620> for<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.070> simplistic

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
what that creator for the simplistic

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.720 
what that creator for the simplistic
theme<00:02:22.880> is<00:02:23.210> going<00:02:23.780> for<00:02:24.070> native<00:02:25.070> applications

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
theme is going for native applications

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.850 
theme is going for native applications
like<00:02:25.970> Internet<00:02:26.450> Explorer<00:02:26.930> they<00:02:27.260> have<00:02:27.530> their

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
like Internet Explorer they have their

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.640 
like Internet Explorer they have their
regular<00:02:28.520> theme<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.240> scroll<00:02:29.720> bar<00:02:29.930> is<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.230> same

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
regular theme the scroll bar is the same

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.760 
regular theme the scroll bar is the same
as<00:02:30.920> ever<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.760> transparency<00:02:32.540> on<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.230> Internet

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
as ever the transparency on the Internet

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.620 
as ever the transparency on the Internet
Explorer<00:02:34.160> seems<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.850> be<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.270> lot<00:02:35.600> more

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
Explorer seems to be a lot more

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.300 
Explorer seems to be a lot more
transparent<00:02:36.350> than<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:36.590> would<00:02:36.710> normally<00:02:36.740> find

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
transparent than you would normally find

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.090 
transparent than you would normally find
so<00:02:37.700> that's<00:02:37.880> pretty<00:02:38.120> cool<00:02:38.210> and<00:02:38.800> explorers<00:02:39.800> just

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
so that's pretty cool and explorers just

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.370 
so that's pretty cool and explorers just
like<00:02:40.310> similarly<00:02:41.210> different<00:02:41.840> than<00:02:42.080> anything

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
like similarly different than anything

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.430 
like similarly different than anything
else<00:02:42.680> if<00:02:42.920> we<00:02:43.310> were<00:02:43.520> to<00:02:43.640> go<00:02:43.790> over<00:02:44.210> to<00:02:44.240> let's<00:02:45.200> say

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
else if we were to go over to let's say

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.830 
else if we were to go over to let's say
for<00:02:45.650> example<00:02:45.710> notepad<00:02:46.580> or<00:02:46.880> text<00:02:47.240> document<00:02:47.690> you

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
for example notepad or text document you

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.810 
for example notepad or text document you
can<00:02:47.900> see<00:02:48.170> that<00:02:48.380> there<00:02:48.620> are<00:02:48.800> no<00:02:49.250> funny<00:02:49.580> things

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
can see that there are no funny things

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.310 
can see that there are no funny things
with<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.120> text<00:02:50.480> document<00:02:50.600> with<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.050> whole

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
background being blocked it's just white

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.150 
background being blocked it's just white
as<00:02:53.240> you<00:02:53.420> would<00:02:53.540> normally<00:02:53.750> have<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.350> and<00:02:54.500> the
