00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.129 
suddenly just had a growth spurt and are
just<00:04:57.070> lively<00:04:57.669> and<00:04:57.820> active<00:04:58.000> they<00:04:58.720> get<00:04:58.870> a<00:04:58.900> pour

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
just lively and active they get a pour

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:00.719 
just lively and active they get a pour
off<00:04:59.289> of<00:04:59.500> fresh<00:04:59.710> raw<00:04:59.919> milk<00:05:00.130> every<00:05:00.400> day<00:05:00.430> in<00:05:00.639> their

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
off of fresh raw milk every day in their

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.640 
off of fresh raw milk every day in their
feed<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:01.060> they<00:05:01.300> love<00:05:01.630> it<00:05:01.660> they<00:05:01.900> consume<00:05:02.350> it<00:05:02.500> I

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
feed and they love it they consume it I

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.870 
feed and they love it they consume it I
honestly<00:05:03.100> think<00:05:03.810> that<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:06.070> eggs<00:05:06.250> we're

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
honestly think that the eggs we're

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.420 
honestly think that the eggs we're
getting<00:05:07.210> it<00:05:07.389> it's<00:05:07.870> 95<00:05:08.560> degrees<00:05:08.590> here<00:05:09.190> you

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
getting it it's 95 degrees here you

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.230 
getting it it's 95 degrees here you
would<00:05:09.580> think<00:05:09.610> that<00:05:09.880> we<00:05:09.970> would<00:05:10.060> be<00:05:10.150> getting

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
would think that we would be getting

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.969 
would think that we would be getting
less<00:05:10.570> eggs<00:05:10.900> technically<00:05:11.380> we<00:05:11.500> should<00:05:11.770> be

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
less eggs technically we should be

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.580 
less eggs technically we should be
probably<00:05:12.280> and<00:05:12.699> maybe<00:05:12.789> we<00:05:13.060> still<00:05:13.270> will<00:05:13.590> but

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
probably and maybe we still will but

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.020 
probably and maybe we still will but
we're<00:05:14.740> getting<00:05:15.010> an<00:05:15.099> average<00:05:15.250> of<00:05:15.490> three<00:05:15.729> dozen

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
we're getting an average of three dozen

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.140 
we're getting an average of three dozen
eggs<00:05:16.210> a<00:05:16.389> day<00:05:16.419> still<00:05:17.169> and<00:05:17.620> so<00:05:18.250> I<00:05:18.460> just<00:05:18.789> think

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
eggs a day still and so I just think

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.189 
eggs a day still and so I just think
that's<00:05:19.330> not<00:05:19.479> a<00:05:19.570> coincidence

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
that's not a coincidence

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.620 
that's not a coincidence
so<00:05:20.349> do<00:05:21.039> your<00:05:21.190> homework<00:05:21.430> as<00:05:21.820> always<00:05:22.449> just

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
so do your homework as always just

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.939 
so do your homework as always just
because<00:05:22.930> some<00:05:23.080> other<00:05:23.169> home<00:05:23.440> said<00:05:23.680> or<00:05:23.800> does

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
because some other home said or does

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:25.110 
because some other home said or does
something<00:05:24.310> doesn't<00:05:24.460> mean<00:05:24.639> that<00:05:24.759> necessarily

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
something doesn't mean that necessarily

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.939 
something doesn't mean that necessarily
you<00:05:25.389> should<00:05:25.690> you<00:05:25.870> should<00:05:25.900> do<00:05:26.229> what<00:05:26.440> you<00:05:26.650> value

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
you should you should do what you value

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.909 
you should you should do what you value
for<00:05:27.550> your<00:05:27.760> homestead<00:05:28.240> if<00:05:28.419> it's<00:05:28.539> bees<00:05:28.919> go

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
for your homestead if it's bees go

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.580 
for your homestead if it's bees go
investigate<00:05:30.490> that<00:05:30.729> if<00:05:31.270> it's<00:05:31.720> keeping<00:05:32.110> goats

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
investigate that if it's keeping goats

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.650 
investigate that if it's keeping goats
instead<00:05:33.099> of<00:05:33.190> a<00:05:33.250> you<00:05:33.580> know<00:05:33.610> a<00:05:33.699> dairy<00:05:33.970> cow<00:05:34.060> maybe

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
instead of a you know a dairy cow maybe

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.870 
instead of a you know a dairy cow maybe
you<00:05:34.810> would<00:05:34.960> prefer<00:05:35.289> that<00:05:35.320> I<00:05:35.740> can<00:05:36.010> see<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.400> the

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
you would prefer that I can see the the

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.029 
you would prefer that I can see the the
trade-off<00:05:37.479> in<00:05:37.690> terms<00:05:37.900> of<00:05:38.050> size<00:05:38.320> and<00:05:38.770> feed

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
trade-off in terms of size and feed

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.310 
trade-off in terms of size and feed
maybe<00:05:39.729> you<00:05:39.880> should<00:05:40.030> go<00:05:40.120> that<00:05:40.360> route<00:05:40.570> but<00:05:40.930> if

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
maybe you should go that route but if

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.779 
maybe you should go that route but if
you're<00:05:41.440> asking<00:05:41.770> me<00:05:41.830> personally<00:05:42.520> if<00:05:42.639> you're
