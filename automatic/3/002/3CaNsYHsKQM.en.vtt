achalasia<00:00:01.480> is<00:00:01.870> a<00:00:01.990> disorder<00:00:02.440> of<00:00:02.620> swallowing<00:00:03.280> it

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:03.669 
achalasia is a disorder of swallowing it

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:05.370 
achalasia is a disorder of swallowing it
involves<00:00:04.390> one<00:00:04.630> of<00:00:04.689> the<00:00:04.809> muscles<00:00:05.170> in<00:00:05.290> the

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:05.380 
involves one of the muscles in the

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.099 
involves one of the muscles in the
esophagus<00:00:05.680> in<00:00:06.189> the<00:00:06.819> normal<00:00:07.240> human<00:00:07.540> esophagus

esophagus in the normal human esophagus

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.169 
esophagus in the normal human esophagus
there's<00:00:08.320> a<00:00:08.380> valve<00:00:08.710> that's<00:00:09.070> made<00:00:09.549> of<00:00:09.669> a<00:00:09.790> muscle

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:10.179 
there's a valve that's made of a muscle

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.390 
there's a valve that's made of a muscle
right<00:00:10.839> where<00:00:11.049> the<00:00:11.200> esophagus<00:00:11.950> joins<00:00:12.190> the

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
right where the esophagus joins the

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.699 
right where the esophagus joins the
stomach<00:00:12.790> and<00:00:12.969> when<00:00:13.450> a<00:00:13.480> patient<00:00:13.929> swallows<00:00:14.469> and

food to pass into the stomach in
patients<00:00:21.910> with<00:00:21.939> achalasia<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:23.470> muscle<00:00:24.340> is

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
patients with achalasia this muscle is

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.599 
patients with achalasia this muscle is
hypertonic<00:00:25.720> or<00:00:26.109> it's<00:00:26.230> always<00:00:26.650> contracted<00:00:27.460> and

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609 
hypertonic or it's always contracted and

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.599 
hypertonic or it's always contracted and
it<00:00:28.000> will<00:00:28.240> not<00:00:28.449> relax<00:00:28.779> properly<00:00:29.470> the<00:00:30.039> result<00:00:30.429> is

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
it will not relax properly the result is

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.520 
it will not relax properly the result is
that<00:00:30.880> when<00:00:31.000> patients<00:00:31.390> swallow<00:00:31.689> the<00:00:32.320> food

that when patients swallow the food

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.650 
that when patients swallow the food
moves<00:00:32.740> down<00:00:32.950> their<00:00:33.130> esophagus<00:00:33.400> and<00:00:33.850> it<00:00:34.000> stops

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
moves down their esophagus and it stops

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.810 
moves down their esophagus and it stops
it<00:00:35.080> does<00:00:35.830> not<00:00:35.980> enter<00:00:36.280> the<00:00:36.370> stomach<00:00:36.730> and

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
it does not enter the stomach and

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.140 
it does not enter the stomach and
there's<00:00:37.630> an<00:00:37.720> obstruction<00:00:37.840> there<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:39.790> caused

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
there's an obstruction there this caused

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.630 
there's an obstruction there this caused
the<00:00:40.180> patient<00:00:40.780> a<00:00:41.320> lot<00:00:41.710> of<00:00:41.830> distress<00:00:42.220> it<00:00:42.430> can<00:00:42.550> be

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
the patient a lot of distress it can be

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.790 
the patient a lot of distress it can be
very<00:00:42.850> painful<00:00:43.120> it<00:00:44.080> can<00:00:44.140> cause<00:00:44.380> the<00:00:44.530> food<00:00:44.650> to

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
very painful it can cause the food to

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.800 
very painful it can cause the food to
come<00:00:44.830> back<00:00:45.160> up<00:00:45.190> it<00:00:46.030> also<00:00:46.180> causes<00:00:46.570> the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.810 
come back up it also causes the

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.660 
come back up it also causes the
esophagus<00:00:47.290> to<00:00:47.440> gradually<00:00:47.980> enlarge<00:00:48.400> and

esophagus to gradually enlarge and
become<00:00:48.970> more<00:00:49.000> and<00:00:49.360> more<00:00:50.760> dysfunctional<00:00:51.960> there

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
become more and more dysfunctional there

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.420 
become more and more dysfunctional there
has<00:00:53.050> been<00:00:53.080> an<00:00:53.320> operation<00:00:53.860> for<00:00:53.890> this<00:00:54.160> for<00:00:54.400> a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
has been an operation for this for a

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.610 
has been an operation for this for a
very<00:00:54.550> long<00:00:54.790> time<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:55.450> and<00:00:56.020> the<00:00:56.200> results<00:00:56.560> have

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
very long time and and the results have

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.770 
very long time and and the results have
been<00:00:56.710> excellent<00:00:57.400> but<00:00:57.730> in<00:00:58.210> general<00:00:58.480> it's

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
been excellent but in general it's

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.920 
been excellent but in general it's
required<00:00:59.500> that<00:00:59.700> the<00:01:00.700> chest<00:01:01.000> be<00:01:01.150> opened<00:01:01.570> for<00:01:01.780> it

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
required that the chest be opened for it

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.049 
required that the chest be opened for it
and<00:01:02.200> you<00:01:02.680> have<00:01:02.800> to<00:01:02.890> spread<00:01:03.220> the<00:01:03.370> ribs<00:01:03.610> make<00:01:03.940> him

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
and you have to spread the ribs make him

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.179 
and you have to spread the ribs make him
incision<00:01:04.330> on<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:04.420> side<00:01:04.629> spread<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.109> ribs<00:01:05.320> and

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
incision on the side spread the ribs and

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.669 
incision on the side spread the ribs and
that's<00:01:06.340> hard<00:01:06.609> on<00:01:06.759> the<00:01:06.820> patients<00:01:07.270> and<00:01:07.420> so<00:01:08.350> a<00:01:08.380> lot

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:08.679 
that's hard on the patients and so a lot

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:10.830 
that's hard on the patients and so a lot
of<00:01:08.710> patients<00:01:09.100> weren't<00:01:09.789> referred<00:01:10.240> for<00:01:10.450> didn't

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
of patients weren't referred for didn't

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.330 
of patients weren't referred for didn't
do<00:01:11.079> or<00:01:11.229> weren't<00:01:11.590> willing<00:01:11.710> to<00:01:11.859> go<00:01:12.039> through<00:01:12.310> all

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
do or weren't willing to go through all

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.910 
do or weren't willing to go through all
that<00:01:12.609> now<00:01:13.539> what<00:01:13.929> we<00:01:14.049> were<00:01:14.109> able<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.320> do<00:01:14.530> using

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
that now what we were able to do using

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.569 
that now what we were able to do using
the<00:01:15.039> robotic<00:01:15.340> system<00:01:15.999> is<00:01:16.149> we<00:01:16.689> make<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:18.070> put<00:01:18.460> in

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
the robotic system is we make we put in

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.719 
the robotic system is we make we put in
camera<00:01:19.390> and<00:01:19.539> two<00:01:19.689> little<00:01:19.840> tiny<00:01:20.289> holes<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:21.700> the

left and right arms of the surgical

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.410 
left and right arms of the surgical
robot<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.530> we<00:01:23.649> can<00:01:23.920> find<00:01:24.670> this<00:01:24.789> muscle<00:01:25.240> and

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
robot and we can find this muscle and

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.349 
robot and we can find this muscle and
split<00:01:26.200> every<00:01:26.679> single<00:01:27.159> fiber<00:01:27.460> surgically<00:01:28.240> I

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359 
split every single fiber surgically I

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.649 
split every single fiber surgically I
remember<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.899> last<00:01:29.429> patient<00:01:30.429> I<00:01:30.700> did<00:01:30.880> he<00:01:31.390> told

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
remember the last patient I did he told

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.380 
remember the last patient I did he told
me<00:01:31.749> that<00:01:32.009> he<00:01:33.009> had<00:01:33.039> no<00:01:33.460> pain<00:01:33.729> from<00:01:33.999> this<00:01:34.149> the

me that he had no pain from this the

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.779 
me that he had no pain from this the
next<00:01:34.600> day<00:01:34.719> he<00:01:34.810> said<00:01:34.960> I<00:01:34.990> don't<00:01:35.259> you<00:01:35.710> know<00:01:35.740> I<00:01:35.829> have

that's not everybody but you know

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.450 
that's not everybody but you know
certainly<00:01:44.170> we<00:01:44.439> have<00:01:44.590> had<00:01:44.770> patients<00:01:44.920> that<00:01:45.280> have

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
certainly we have had patients that have

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.999 
certainly we have had patients that have
absolutely<00:01:46.149> no<00:01:46.659> pain<00:01:46.899> following<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.679> procedure

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
absolutely no pain following a procedure

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.980 
absolutely no pain following a procedure
like<00:01:48.100> this<00:01:48.249> they're<00:01:48.880> able<00:01:48.969> to<00:01:49.149> avoid<00:01:49.389> the<00:01:49.539> ICU

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
like this they're able to avoid the ICU
