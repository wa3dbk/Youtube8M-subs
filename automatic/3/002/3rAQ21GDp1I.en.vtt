00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.390
 Hello dear video listeners 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.650
 listeners followers 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:13.889
 vlogue today will tell you about 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.869
 one very important nuance in principle he 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.410
 enters the notion of how to set up correctly 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.090
 closet 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.330
 and in general any wardrobe is not even a wardrobe 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.269
 tuned in principle only one 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.210
 in a wonderful way 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:36.350
 but in principle you now see the closet well 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:42.719
 it can be said that the cabinet would like 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:45.660
 set up, I will explain to you how it is 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.050
 such special adjustment legs 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.910
 non-metallic very thick fasten 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:58.710
 not under the bottom and in principle, well, how 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:02.960
 laid two times three 4 5 6 6 8 there is 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.960
 long cabinet can be both 12 and 14 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.860
 the through hole is made in principle 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.210
 it can be done under 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.040
 under the rail this is a closet opening set up 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.060
 good moor not to gap here 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.619
 hole rail on it basically 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.960
 put the rail 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.659
 on this verst, well, that is to say 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.229
 completely through the hole this wardrobe closet 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.900
 configured exactly so that he stood as 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.390
 laid in the horizon that is completely 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.210
 over the horizon it is very important and for that 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:42.470
 so that the shelves are not skewed 1 and plus 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.960
 I worked smoothly sliding system 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:50.240
 sliding system and so in principle 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.450
 the sliding system did not leave that is 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.920
 in various old structures there are 9 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.060
 floor of Khrushchev 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:02.360
 there were very bad floors if 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.340
 legs do not in principle adjust 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.680
 virtually impossible it is allowed 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.360
 lining will be well, you know the same 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.030
 last century on lining hut nism 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:16.340
 no serious conversation at all 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.730
 such legs are generally normal cabinets 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.660
 normal manufacturers always put and 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.160
 this allows you to properly configure the cabinet 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.420
 fine adjust cabinet on the horizon 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.170
 especially if we are talking about 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.930
 unprepared chambers even in 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.660
 there are some trained in the floors 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:40.130
 small misses and these legs unequivocally 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.810
 save so do not regret say so 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.120
 penny those 100 200 hryvnia 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.750
 put these adjustments 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.299
 legs into the platform turns your 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.840
 the future of any cabinet, whether hinged 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:58.280
 whether, in principle, has no sliding 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:04.340
 values ​​ie these legs will allow you 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:08.500
 quality in the horizon to customize your 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:11.680
 wardrobe or wardrobe especially for 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:16.099
 rooms with unprepared palana 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.260
 just you some ordinary floor there and you 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.870
 want to make yourself a wardrobe put 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.299
 order return this option necessarily 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.670
 order yourself because there have been cases 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.959
 when 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:32.180
 Generally in one place the floor is collapsed and 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.099
 I had to twist the legs very 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.739
 strong 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:39.650
 happened even twisted on three and even 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.530
 four centimeters that is roughly speaking 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.900
 the cabinet rose from one side to 3 by 4 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.360
 centimeters thus we did 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.680
 normal horizon if this is not 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:55.099
 make everything be twisted twisted 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.930
 the system can move out in principle with 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.610
 the stopper probably will not move out but only 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.049
 you have to remove it from 100 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:06.349
 she will continue to move out shorter here 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:09.790
 such in principle here are the nuances 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:13.130
 very important nuance on the wardrobes is 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.910
 adjusting legs or how to 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.329
 to set 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.780
 wardrobe so thank you for your attention with you 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:23.380
 was from furniture proxy 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.380
 Dnipropetrovsk and bye
