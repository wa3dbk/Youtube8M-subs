00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:07.390
 the nintendo 64 everybody knows more 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.210
 nintendo 64 dynamic says that as the 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.980
 most speak nintendo 64 de well 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.030
 most of you must have never heard 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.419
 Talk about it there 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.449
 announced in 1995 nintendo 64 baby only 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:21.880
 was leaving in December of 1999 almost 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.829
 year 2000, it can even be considered a 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.480
 accessory but for some it is also 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.399
 a console but what it really is 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.409
 important to mention about him is that he 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:31.179
 was such a failure that it never arrived 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:33.520
 to the United States or Europe 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.950
 nintendo 64 's fits behind 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.960
 of nintendo 64 and thereby increase its 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.790
 storage capacity and up to 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.130
 can improve the texture of some 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.290
 games and change the speed of the game 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.570
 also that the interesting thing is that he 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.160
 he could only play games for him 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.440
 that is a person with the next game of the 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.660
 nintendo 64 baby could not play 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.910
 usually on nintendo 64 without this 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.160
 accessory there is a legal curiosity to 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.930
 mention is that they do not understand the 4d of was 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.239
 announced before the launch of the 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.940
 Nintendo 64 and that it has access to 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.609
 internet is limited but has nintendo 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.409
 64 and detained your game library as well 

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:09.219
 small but during its 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.079
 development 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:12.909
 many games were proposed for him 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.520
 but in the end it ended up being 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.219
 released very few games are about 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.560
 these games we're going to talk about in this video 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:23.619
 beginning with fc 0 x is space a kit that 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.170
 comes in fact it is not a game and if a 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.039
 them in the form of a floppy disk or 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.139
 this business 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.359
 well this one dispenses a kit like yours 

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:34.659
 itself says it is an expansion for the 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:37.569
 nintendo 64 and 0x game giving to the game 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.450
 12 new tracks new songs 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:42.039
 the car editor and track editor 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.560
 with this the diversity of the game increases 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.389
 enough with the track editor for 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.819
 undo many clues that advertised the 

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:49.509
 game or the tool was half bad 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.929
 made 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.670
 do not respect kit be a bad thing is 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.619
 because it was not very well planned 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.869
 according to the critics for nintendo 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.149
 64 gb were released four games of the 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.029
 mario but did not play more like super 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.459
 mario bros super mario 64 and sim games 

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:08.650
 paint and these bullshit almost the mario 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.180
 paint and both boat gaming tables 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.960
 were released are from the franchise mario 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.000
 Arts 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.000
 the first launched was the highest expenditure 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.920
 studio 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.350
 something much but very much like 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.600
 mario paint and even use a similar mouse 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.370
 to the one of May it hangs but after the game 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.590
 was basically just a distraction to 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.600
 you draw and tals but it was 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.310
 create short animations from 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.260
 drawings and in the game you could 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.850
 explore a place called us beyond 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.740
 where you could take pictures of 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.350
 animals that inhabited the second 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.209
 mario artist is the talent studio where 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.400
 nor did you create characters that would be 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.430
 movie stars so having several 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.410
 scenarios to explore in the event 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.489
 but the interesting thing about this game is 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.860
 because the characters are very 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.959
 similar to miss and so can be 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.090
 consider that this is a prototype of the 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.190
 mc's and for those who do not know me are the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.459
 characters you use in the u ie 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.440
 good third communication kit and good 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.390
 This game is good to see. 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.730
 I myself did not quite understand what it is. 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.500
 This game is clear in Japanese but 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.570
 that's not why I understood it, it 's because 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.120
 nor some sites know right direction 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.220
 this game but from what I understood and 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.739
 criticism that I read the game is 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.780
 basically the joining of the other two 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.549
 where in case you could draw in 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.980
 scenarios and even create 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.230
 Good characters the fourth and last game 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.360
 released from the mario arts is the pole with the 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.420
 in this player could create 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.850
 3d objects add speech to them and 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.590
 also paint them and during the game you 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.019
 could play mini-games totally 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.510
 similar to the wario franchise he finally 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.540
 all mario artist's games had to 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.060
 same basis was to make a drawing or to do 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.760
 a character put on the stage was just 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.980
 for momentary fun even good another 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.410
 game released for nintendo 64 bd is the 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.510
 January dosh where in this game you are 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.870
 a yellow giant that most seems to be 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.250
 kind of slow jerk but 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.170
 This way I 'm talking it seems like 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.239
 The game is bad but it is not a game 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.350
 very entertaining and your criticism until 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.030
 that are positive 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.160
 The story of the game is that during the game 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.900
 You all have to help the people of 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.940
 different villages so that they 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.670
 be happy that the happier the 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.989
 people get older than xii is 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.850
 basically this 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.130
 but a cool thing to mention is that 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.530
 then you already release chin which is a 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.370
 kind of a demon god a destruction 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.810
 or the opposite of the game shin 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.729
 with it you have to do the opposite 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.070
 You also have to make people 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:33.419
 I am sad that I think it should be 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.419
 be more fun playing with it 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.150
 after a short time this game was 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.830
 released was an expansion for him that is 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.570
 which today in the shin fall naughty I 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.710
 I do not know how to actually say that after 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.910
 the guys who did not know either 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.130
 say that but finally 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.660
 although it is very different he is 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.090
 an expansion of the Xingu game and 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.310
 jairo adding to the game the style 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.050
 completely new that does not really have 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.360
 nothing to do with the original game another one 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.940
 game released for 64 of nintendo was 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.190
 the simcity 64 that previously it would be 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.320
 normally released for nintendo 64 but 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.360
 How was it at the end of his life that he decided there? 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.550
 let's risk the nintendo 64 de benÃ© 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.340
 this game was well criticized but not 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.320
 avenged for only cedi nintendo 64 de 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.060
 that few people had it looks like 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.500
 much with the other franchise games 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.840
 suicide having charts 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.120
 pretty good players age 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.010
 and with zoom and 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.660
 first person things your games 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.150
 old had not was a game very much 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.310
 complete single problem of himself was 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.740
 get out for the nintendo 64 gb that 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.150
 few people had personal 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.010
 Now let's talk a little about Japan. 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.840
 provoked future 6 4 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.490
 the last game released for nintendo 64 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.470
 for now you must be thinking 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.090
 were shortening it is not okay 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.400
 talking all the nintendo 64 games of 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.410
 Bene no I'm not talking about all 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.690
 games are just nine nintendo 64 games 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.250
 gb that were released and this game of 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.889
 golf does not have much to talk about because 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.229
 it's just a normal golf game because 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.940
 it was released for nintendo 64 and me 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.889
 I do not know, I think it was only released. 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.050
 for Nintendo 64 and why it has to 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.970
 make your own character and 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.729
 save them and it was also possible to use 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.530
 your clothes and use the tacos too 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.120

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.669
