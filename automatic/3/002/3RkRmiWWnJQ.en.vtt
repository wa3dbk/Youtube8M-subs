00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.700
 hi all the boys are in Italy 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.910
 android jam and today I want to explain how 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.610
 install a rom on android 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.460
 I make this video because I know many 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.730
 of you have had problems for 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.420
 regarding the installation and I would like 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.760
 explain in detail how to do it 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.330
 and I will use this video in a general way 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.789
 so when a rom comes out vi 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.150
 I will list the video regarding 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.150
 installation 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.530
 I apologize first of all because I am not 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.559
 recording the device but I had gods 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.450
 problems and I will put images on you 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.750
 illustrative to make you understand the best 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.750
 possible 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.710
 now we will first have to turn off the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.510
 our device 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.149
 now we are left to enter recovery 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.420
 that reward a combination of keys 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.969
 ie home volume up and key 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.430
 ignition expect the device 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.090
 it emits a vibration and we release the three 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.119
 buttons 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.479
 after which the phone server will restart 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.840
 automatically in recovery there 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.060
 we will find ourselves in front of this interface 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.960
 we will have to choose wipe data factory 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.990
 reset 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.900
 after which wipe cash and after that 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.390
 bring us in advanced and choose wipe 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.340
 dalvik cache 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.759
 now we will have to choose the install item 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.689
 zip on sd card or install a file 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.780
 zip through the sd card we will find a menu 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.939
 where there will be folders we will have to 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.460
 choose the folder we have 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.579
 saved our Rome or our file 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.920
 for example download 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:50.700
 then we just have to give him the okay 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.649
 to flash and wait now there 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.020
 all that remains is to choose the item reboot 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.750
 system now and you're done 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.729
 I want to warn everyone that the first start 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.350
 it will be very slow so not 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.369
 worry if it stays for a while 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.320
 time in the boot even for today 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.569
