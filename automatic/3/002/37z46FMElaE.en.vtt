00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello friends welcome another day more to 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.429
 my kitchen space today the dish that 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.679
 I have prepared it is caramelized bazaar 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.269
 lemon this is a dish that if you do not have 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.860
 much better time that you do not 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.560
 because it will take us at least 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.539
 four hours to do the ingredients 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.020
 what we need for this dish are the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.020
 following 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:29.550
 a kilo of pork loin uncut 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.960
 50 grams of sugar 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.960
 a whole lemon 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.940
 a pinch of rosemary 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.980
 175 milliliters of white wine 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:48.670
 5 tablespoons of lemon strainer 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.079
 and a spoonful of good brandy we're going to 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.210
 start with the making of this 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.129
 dish first thing we have to do 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.320
 to make this dish is to put it to 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.960
 marinate for two hours do that 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.330
 let's take the meat logo and let's go 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.090
 with a small knife make him small 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.630
 indentations 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.600
 in a way and in these cracks we're going 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:14.940
 to fill with rosemary 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:18.570
 and so throughout the spine 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.950
 until we see that it is practically 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.950
 full of rosemary 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.200
 once we have finished and do the 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.850
 slits to the spine we fix the how 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.310
 it remains as it is full of indentations today 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.420
 other than rosemary we passed it to a 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:39.950
 pan we invest the wine 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:43.070
 in this way and we take a bit more 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.580
 from rosemary 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.990
 finish 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.810
 perth 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.700
 Now we 're going to let it marinate for 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.909
 two hours turning it around once in 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.810
 when so that it takes well the taste of 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.939
 he came and we'll leave him a couple of hours 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.600
 well, it's been almost two hours this 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.869
 take here 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.700
 mariana 12 one hour and 45 minutes so 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.700
 what we are going to do next is 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.580
 preheat the oven 230 degrees during 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.959
 about a quarter of an hour 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.030
 once we see that the oven is already 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.180
 hot let's proceed to take out the 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.849
 meat 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.960
 let's see how it is already marinated and what 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:30.490
 let's do is drain the good 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:34.120
 in this way and we are going to put it in a 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.770
 source for oven as well and we're going to reserve 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.480
 the marinade because if we are going to use it 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.760
 later 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.760
 then let's take this source 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:50.630
 and we insert it into the oven 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.120
 perfect and we're going to leave it for 15 minutes 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.710
 once it's been 15 minutes since 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.720
 that we have introduced the meat in the 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.870
 oven let's pick up and lower the 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.900
 temperature to 180 degrees and we're going to 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.760
 leave half an hour more has already passed half 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.730
 hour and we have taken the roast out of the oven 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.310
 Now what we are going to do is that with the 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.300
 marinated we have booked before we go 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.620
 to fix above this form 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.620
 we are going to throw it 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.090
 yes 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.210
 and we throw everything 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.910
 perfect and now let's take salt and 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.480
 pepper to taste 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.480
 A) Yes 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.930
 and the pepper 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:54.000
 and we will pick up and we will introduce the 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.890
 source another hour more in the oven 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.690
 It's been almost an hour since 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.300
 we measured the roast in the oven what 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:05.400
 let's do now is to create a mix 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:08.690
 with the sugar the 5 tablespoons of lemon 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.430
 and a teaspoon of brandy 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.430
 thus 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:19.250
 Now let's mix everything until a 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.590
 continuation with the mixture that we have 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.070
 created with the sugar the lemon and the rand 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.370
 and we are going to sprinkle over the past of 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.940
 this form 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.940
 A) Yes 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.870
 and we're going to put everything back in the 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.630
 oven and we're going to spray it every 10 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.320
 minutes until we see that the released 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.290
 take a golden color and in the belly is left 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.150
 caramelized we have the oven removed 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.430
 of the oven we set as it is already everything is 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.590
 says caramelized then it is ready 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.750
 to serve we take it and we pass it to a 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.849
 separate dish where we are going to proceed to 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.429
 cut it into small slices 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.499
 after removing the meat we observed that 

00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:04.689
 the sauce has been left with some fat 

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:06.999
 for this we go to take a 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:08.800
 skimmer and go withdrawing the little to 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:10.749
 little until he wants to wash to 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.270
 What we are going to do next is 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:16.899
 take the lemon and slice it very 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.569
 thin to surround the plate where we are going to 

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:21.879
