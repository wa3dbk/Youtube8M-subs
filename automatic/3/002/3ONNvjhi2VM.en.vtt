EBI<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.679> know<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.980> tanks<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.759> same

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
EBI you know the tanks the same

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.790 
EBI you know the tanks the same
substrates<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.960> little<00:00:16.139> bit<00:00:16.230> different<00:00:16.650> light

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
substrates a little bit different light

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.120 
substrates a little bit different light
fixture<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.430> same<00:00:18.289> the<00:00:19.289> substrate<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
fixture is the same the substrate is the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.240 
fixture is the same the substrate is the
same<00:00:20.369> it's<00:00:20.580> just<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.789> different<00:00:21.060> size<00:00:22.220> so<00:00:23.220> I

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
same it's just a different size so I

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.179 
same it's just a different size so I
opted<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.330> go<00:00:24.390> for<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:25.010> shrimp

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
opted to go for the shrimp

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.620 
opted to go for the shrimp
EBI<00:00:26.430> one<00:00:26.789> because<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.359> little<00:00:27.539> bit

EBI one because it's a little bit

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.140 
EBI one because it's a little bit
smaller<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.140> easier<00:00:28.230> for<00:00:28.380> any<00:00:28.650> plant<00:00:29.000> but<00:00:30.000> big

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
smaller and easier for any plant but big

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.889 
smaller and easier for any plant but big
goofy<00:00:30.539> dumb<00:00:30.720> hands<00:00:32.059> yeah<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:33.360> one<00:00:33.570> is

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
bit of brown diatoms because this one is

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.350 
bit of brown diatoms because this one is
actually<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.350> brand<00:01:25.650> new<00:01:25.920> tank<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.820> silica

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
actually a brand new tank so the silica

will clear up soon shortly King betas in
there<00:01:34.130> here's<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.250> anubius<00:01:35.640> greenstone<00:01:36.119> tank

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.179 

tiny<00:01:39.810> bit<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.140> algae<00:01:40.439> growing<00:01:40.680> on<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> green

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
tiny bit of algae growing on the green

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.469 
tiny bit of algae growing on the green
stone<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.670> actually<00:01:41.880> kind<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.210> makes<00:01:42.360> it

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
stone and it actually kind of makes it

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.969 
stone and it actually kind of makes it
pop<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.840> makes<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.079> look<00:01:43.200> even<00:01:43.409> greener<00:01:43.439> which

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
pop it makes it look even greener which

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.560 
pop it makes it look even greener which
is<00:01:44.070> cool<00:01:44.509> and<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.630> got<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> ton<00:01:46.140> more<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
is cool and I got a ton more of the

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.940 
is cool and I got a ton more of the
anubias<00:01:48.570> nana<00:01:48.720> petit<00:01:49.320> which<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.619> actually

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
anubias nana petit which is actually

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.950 
anubias nana petit which is actually
just<00:01:49.979> floating<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.729> here<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.750> make<00:01:51.930> sure

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
just floating in here just to make sure

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.569 
just floating in here just to make sure
just<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.380> get<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> little<00:01:52.619> bit<00:01:52.860> more<00:01:52.950> roots<00:01:53.250> and

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
just to get a little bit more roots and

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.749 
just to get a little bit more roots and
then<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.820> added<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.450> ton<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:56.250> little<00:01:56.549> bit

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
then I added a ton of it so a little bit

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.880 
then I added a ton of it so a little bit
of<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.000> will<00:01:57.240> melt<00:01:57.570> when<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.140> add<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.439> you

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
of it will melt when you add it to you

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.929 
of it will melt when you add it to you
know<00:01:59.009> when<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.189> switch<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.729> pretty

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
know when you switch it pretty

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.270 
know when you switch it pretty
dramatically<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:01.110> tank<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.829> bought<00:02:02.130> it

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
dramatically the tank that I bought it

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.039 
dramatically the tank that I bought it
out<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.460> had<00:02:02.880> been<00:02:03.030> set<00:02:03.299> up<00:02:03.329> for<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.630> really<00:02:03.930> long

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
out of had been set up for a really long

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.490 
out of had been set up for a really long
time<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.549> pH<00:02:05.880> was<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.450> at<00:02:06.630> 7<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.350> this

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
time so the pH was just at 7 and this

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.830 
time so the pH was just at 7 and this
one's<00:02:07.740> pretty<00:02:07.829> low<00:02:08.190> for<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.599> cherry<00:02:09.599> strength

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
one's pretty low for the cherry strength

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.390 
one's pretty low for the cherry strength
and<00:02:09.989> stuff<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.530> little<00:02:10.739> bit<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.099> melted

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
and stuff so a little bit of it melted

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.710 
and stuff so a little bit of it melted
which<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.640> fine<00:02:11.879> but

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
which is fine but

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.720 
which is fine but
just<00:02:12.930> trim<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.170> off<00:02:13.320> and<00:02:13.770> then<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:13.920> got<00:02:14.130> roots

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
just trim that off and then I got roots

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.920 
just trim that off and then I got roots
are<00:02:14.850> going<00:02:14.970> good<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.300> I'm<00:02:15.390> gonna<00:02:15.480> plant<00:02:15.750> that

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
are going good so I'm gonna plant that

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.960 
are going good so I'm gonna plant that
in<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.230> actually<00:02:16.500> make<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.830> into<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.100> movie

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
in and actually make that into a movie

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.900 
in and actually make that into a movie
anubias<00:02:18.480> nana<00:02:18.780> petit<00:02:19.410> carpet<00:02:19.920> which<00:02:20.670> i<00:02:20.820> think

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
anubias nana petit carpet which i think

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.830 
anubias nana petit carpet which i think
will<00:02:21.150> look<00:02:21.300> dope

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
will look dope

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
will look dope
I'm<00:02:22.020> actually<00:02:22.140> gonna<00:02:22.350> do<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.650> tonight

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
I'm actually gonna do that tonight

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.060 
I'm actually gonna do that tonight
because<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.400> have<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.610> do<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.730> water<00:02:23.910> change<00:02:24.030> so

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
because I have to do a water change so

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.520 
because I have to do a water change so
I'm<00:02:26.070> gonna<00:02:26.190> plus<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.610> out<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.410> that'll<00:02:28.410> be

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
I'm gonna plus that out and that'll be

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.100 
I'm gonna plus that out and that'll be
easy<00:02:28.710> peasy<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:31.140> other<00:02:31.260> nanos<00:02:32.780> are<00:02:33.780> looking

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
easy peasy the other nanos are looking

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.790 
easy peasy the other nanos are looking
like<00:02:34.230> this

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
like this

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.830 
like this
let<00:02:35.130> me<00:02:35.250> doing<00:02:35.520> quick<00:02:35.700> water<00:02:35.910> change<00:02:36.240> you<00:02:36.720> can

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
let me doing quick water change you can

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.270 
let me doing quick water change you can
see<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.650> what<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:37.800> normally<00:02:37.890> do

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
see like this is what I normally do

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.670 
see like this is what I normally do
water<00:02:38.490> change<00:02:38.790> when<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.000> get<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:40.110> little<00:02:40.530> bit

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
water change when I get to a little bit

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.830 
water change when I get to a little bit
over<00:02:40.790> basically<00:02:41.790> like<00:02:42.090> an<00:02:42.210> inch<00:02:42.420> from<00:02:42.810> where

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
over basically like an inch from where

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.470 
over basically like an inch from where
the<00:02:43.710> regular<00:02:44.100> level<00:02:44.400> that's<00:02:44.970> when<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.360> know

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
the regular level that's when I know

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.560 
the regular level that's when I know
I'll<00:02:45.990> fill<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.560> gallon<00:02:47.120> then<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.150> pull<00:02:48.390> out<00:02:48.420> a

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
I'll fill a gallon then I pull out a

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.720 
I'll fill a gallon then I pull out a
gallon<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:48.930> I'll<00:02:49.140> put<00:02:49.260> in<00:02:49.410> a<00:02:49.470> gallon<00:02:49.770> see

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
gallon that I'll put in a gallon see

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.010 
gallon that I'll put in a gallon see
what<00:02:50.820> I'm<00:02:50.880> saying<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:51.330> I'll<00:02:51.480> actually<00:02:51.600> take

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
what I'm saying so I'll actually take

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.480 
what I'm saying so I'll actually take
out<00:02:52.200> one<00:02:52.380> gallon<00:02:52.740> without<00:02:53.010> having<00:02:53.370> only

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
out one gallon without having only

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.600 
out one gallon without having only
turned<00:02:53.730> off<00:02:53.850> my<00:02:54.030> filters<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.630> all<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.870> crap

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
turned off my filters and all that crap

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.740 
turned off my filters and all that crap
which<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:56.670> actually<00:02:56.910> surprisingly<00:02:57.030> easy<00:02:57.660> to

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
which is actually surprisingly easy to

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.510 
which is actually surprisingly easy to
do<00:02:57.990> because<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.320> only<00:02:58.530> need<00:02:58.680> two<00:02:58.860> buckets<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.430> do

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
do because I only need two buckets to do

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.840 
do because I only need two buckets to do
that<00:03:00.080> and<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.200> just<00:03:01.230> fill<00:03:01.770> them<00:03:01.950> up<00:03:02.100> all<00:03:02.490> three

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
that and I just fill them up all three

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.690 
that and I just fill them up all three
of<00:03:02.940> them<00:03:03.650> drain<00:03:04.650> them<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.220> then<00:03:05.310> fill<00:03:05.610> them

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
of them drain them and then fill them

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.610 
of them drain them and then fill them
back<00:03:05.820> up<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:08.940> do<00:03:09.660> that<00:03:09.900> like<00:03:10.110> about

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
back up so and I do that like about

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.470 
back up so and I do that like about
every<00:03:10.830> week<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.280> half<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:12.030> be<00:03:12.150> honest

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
every week and a half to be honest

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.600 
every week and a half to be honest
probably<00:03:13.320> should<00:03:13.740> do<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:13.860> gallon<00:03:14.250> every<00:03:14.370> week

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
probably should do a gallon every week

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.820 
probably should do a gallon every week
but<00:03:14.910> uh<00:03:15.230> it's<00:03:16.230> more<00:03:16.290> like<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.500> week<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:16.739> a<00:03:16.800> half

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
but uh it's more like a week and a half

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.970 
but uh it's more like a week and a half
so<00:03:17.340> sometimes<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.120> get<00:03:18.270> lazy<00:03:18.709> but<00:03:19.709> anyhow

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
so sometimes I get lazy but anyhow

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.670 
so sometimes I get lazy but anyhow
there's<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.760> Alba<00:03:21.450> nanos<00:03:21.750> know<00:03:22.140> what's<00:03:22.440> going

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
there's the Alba nanos know what's going

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.420 
there's the Alba nanos know what's going
on<00:03:22.739> with<00:03:22.920> those<00:03:23.420> later
