00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 we welcome after a hard cross-country 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.820
 Anna and Lisa Hahner here father here 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.650
 That was maybe in Frankfurt 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.809
 highlight until now the career of 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.250
 enroll your deal in front of the hall 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.230
 watch and then on the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.660
 sister , both best performances are waiting for him 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.689
 that was a very emotional one 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.519
 moment as you after 42 kilometers then 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.769
 the last 200 meters on the red 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.599
 carpet as the festhalle runs and 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.470
 really you have heard from the outside 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.480
 The whole audience just screams 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.040
 goosebumps feeling pure and then as 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.690
 then flows into the hall 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.260
 is then in the first joint 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.840
 marathon both turns it was already 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.640
 unbelievable what those seconds like that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.710
 serviced by the head than you have you 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.820
 your time guest helped her 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.739
 saw that a bit quavered 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.390
 seen how looked at the 30 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.690
 because if you never know exactly when 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.480
 exactly the field he reaches 330 ps 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.070
 Exactly so one reads then already on the 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.480
 seen and it was still one 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.370
 22 in front 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.530
 but I knew because I myself 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.180
 walked it there's a whole 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.590
 piece is up to then and then I have 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.080
 stop as more targeted matters 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.720
 his comes and then yes 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.940
 after 2 30 17 also over the finish line with 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.690
 new best performance and that was just then 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:23.350
 sometimes in a great moment if you then 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.910
 just over 230 is the first time 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.260
 a little sad or you can 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.180
 also because you already know it 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.200
 just over 230 is running so 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.650
 maybe that's a good one too 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.750
 character 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.370
 he definitely has one goal for everyone 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.480
 next marathon of course that's just one 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.010
 brand that you want to crack but gives 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.590
 still many possibilities especially then 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.360
 next year and I think of everyone 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.220
 fall super satisfied a new best time 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.400
 run if now you always hear 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.330
 the problems of anna in advance but 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.220
 I think here it was not synonymous 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.900
 perhaps smoothly 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.250
 so the smaller problems closer to that 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.040
 marathon comes something 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.300
 problematic 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.869
 So I already filled up well 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.380
 has been 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.910
 but before the start, a few things now 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.160
 push there were a few problems though 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.619
 one just has a mega out 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.710
 So can having a super day caught 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.270
 and he absolutely rocked frankfurt 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.100
 Now you have a lot about the alternative 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.000
 trading is what's rolling on 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.770
 maybe that's what it has brought 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.760
 spare some other runners 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.350
 maybe not so I have that 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.520
 but lost thread in the other runner 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.390
 not so pronounced 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.950
 So yes, I think you should 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.020
 the problem is that many are on the bike 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.490
 and then at the next day 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.680
 have run heavy legs and say 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.090
 I also do not like anything so it's clear 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.670
 The body has to go to the wheel 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.440
 get used to training but if you can do that 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.240
 the body starts regularly 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.100
 Cycling is also used to dennis that 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.400
 I think a great way around 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.230
 simply from scheidhauer longer 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.330
 to be able to train without stopping 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.040
 necessarily the muscles and long 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.360
 especially strong to speak to me 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.730
 has brought a lot and we will 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.320
 it continues to be strengthened in training 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.570
 you can install that a bit too 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.220
 to couple that you only ride then 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.900
 runs or aqua job then runs or 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.940
 did you have to have tried something 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.720
 i read on or that perfectly the 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.720
 coach left 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.980
 These new methods are coupled out of training 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.840
 we did not do that one 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.390
 after the bike then immediately continues to run 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.560
 we are therefore already in a day of 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.630
 safety for example in the morning rad 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.650
 I did not run like that 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.990
 directly into each other 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.390
 but Thomas Doll of always the 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.110
 training is one of them 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.380
 triathlon trainer license from therefore could 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.150
 me then on the wheel already good 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.800
 write out training sessions so that 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.630
 I was not just on the bike around 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.550
 to move my legs but also around 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.370
 really to train but stairs up 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.950
 It did not have to run anymore 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.660
 Apartment on the third floor that sucks 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.600
 ours when he is already jumping up there 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.980
 we are not so fast 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.040
 Now you have started with the 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.600
 marathon career always a sister 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.950
 that's what others do on the bike 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.450
 you run together 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.910
 it will look like it in the future 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.380
 better so you have a lot of fun 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.000
 harming the whole thing together 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.100
 Preparation to be made together 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.530
 to get up tomorrow and get together 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.380
 it will be done safely 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.090
 more often, but she likes to give 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.160
 again marathons of only 1 starts 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.780
 yes I've known a marathon of 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.100
 Started together again next year 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.710
 I heard that in Zurich 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.240
 an em where you even if you are with 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.490
 ulrike mash also some years ago 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.410
 has also been able to run in front 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.650
 is that and there are already goals in the 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.110
 back of the head where you say topp 85 medal 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.490
 So placement moderately, I'm doing myself 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.100
 no thoughts at all 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.419
 that's up to the trainer to estimate how 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.770
 can run fast but it is up 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.009
 every case 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.629
 a goal that one in zurich times the 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.449
 first international championships 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:50.309
 can walk together 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.650
 you have just spoken 

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:54.719
 Renato can ears new coach 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.009
 I had longer with him yesterday 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:57.719
 it is also a conversation led 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.309
 his charisma is a bit like that 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:01.289
 simply as an athlete so far so far 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:02.339
 brings you ahead because you believe in things 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.559
 to which you may have been completely before 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:06.270
 in any case believed that 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:08.629
 if you have any problems or 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.580
 at the weekend the training fails 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:13.439
 said problem then wins one 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.059
 story told by matt record holder 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:17.699
 over 3000 obstacle or from that 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:19.229
 marathon world champion had that 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.560
 the same and made us this way and that 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:24.270
 and that was even better so it 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.009
 is crazy what a dead man 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.249
 know and motivate then tremendously 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:32.759
 then fits almost renato hannover to run 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:34.770
 to sky perfectly into the picture he knows great 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.749
 so it 's almost like that 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.599
 constellation with chéritrainer rené 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:40.249
 hannover thomas takes care of us locally and 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:41.959
 we 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:44.809
 stand together the running shoes that is 

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:48.109
 Great he said yes yesterday 

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:49.219
 I predicted 228 renato and me 

00:05:48.109 --> 00:05:51.349
 I did not tell you what before 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:54.619
 After that, he said in the spring 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:58.159
 then under 227 should not be a problem 

00:05:54.619 --> 00:06:01.669
 his words were his words yes I believe you 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:04.599
 must always have big goals and that 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:07.939
 motivates naturally and spontaneously and 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:09.589
 we look first again runs and 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:11.419
 then the planning will be for next 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:14.179
 year and we are looking forward to it 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:16.039
 when it does turn and now 

00:06:14.179 --> 00:06:17.659
 first holiday or rather a 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.449
 Cyclist holiday somewhere in the mountains 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:21.619
 he really vacation I believe there can 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:23.899
 you do not sit still 

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:25.789
 the legs become nervous on the second day 

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:28.219
 we want to do something alternative then 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:29.839
 Cross-country skiing in winter and now 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:32.569
 Here are just a few sports out 

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:34.369
 but it will make you pretty cold 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:36.589
 Do you want to go to the 

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:38.269
 langlaufskiern yes but against cold 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:39.739
 we do not have anything so you can fit 

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:43.519
 then put on gloves 

00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:45.079
 cap and the faster you move 

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:46.909
 the warmer it gets when we get there 

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:49.789
 just neat then gas again 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:51.379
 Do you have to go where we were now 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:52.399
 already twice on the feldberg there it has 

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:53.959
 We liked it very much 

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:54.639
 let's see maybe it works 

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:56.120
 again 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:57.919
 on the feldberg 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.720
 then good luck and I am 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:02.560
 looking forward to next year, we too 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.560
 plaque
