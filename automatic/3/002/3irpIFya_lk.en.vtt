want to show you the whole process in a
one<00:00:16.560> go<00:00:16.859> because<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.550> in<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.880> process<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.330> also

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
one go because I in the process I also

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.660 
one go because I in the process I also
have<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> need<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.140> shut<00:00:19.529> down<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:20.010> PC<00:00:20.490> and

recorder<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.720> simple<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.320> got<00:00:31.529> the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
recorder so the simple of got the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.220 
recorder so the simple of got the
process<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.880> bias<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.600> 8<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.079> 8.1

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
process of going to bias in 8 and 8.1

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.119 
process of going to bias in 8 and 8.1
it's<00:00:35.070> pretty<00:00:35.579> simple<00:00:36.149> normally<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.170> 8<00:00:37.440> or<00:00:37.739> 8.1

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
it's pretty simple normally in 8 or 8.1

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.690 
it's pretty simple normally in 8 or 8.1
you<00:00:38.910> go<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.120> bias<00:00:39.540> from<00:00:40.079> into<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.070> first<00:00:41.489> you

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
you go to bias from into the first you

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.090 
you go to bias from into the first you
have<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.969> go<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> right<00:00:42.390> side<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.100> then

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
have to go to the right side and then

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.040 
have to go to the right side and then
right<00:00:44.670> side<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:45.000> your<00:00:45.030> monitor<00:00:45.510> then<00:00:45.750> go<00:00:45.989> to

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
use 8 or 8.1 you will also see as I have

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.680 
use 8 or 8.1 you will also see as I have
shown<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.550> earlier<00:02:42.580> that<00:02:43.060> there<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:43.570> an

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
shown you earlier that there is an

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.100 
shown you earlier that there is an

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
option that UEFI firmware settings that

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.130 
option that UEFI firmware settings that
I<00:02:47.170> also<00:02:47.500> don't<00:02:47.890> have<00:02:48.160> in<00:02:48.400> my<00:02:48.430> laptop<00:02:49.140> see

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
I also don't have in my laptop see

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.080 
I also don't have in my laptop see
there's<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.620> lab<00:02:50.800> in<00:02:51.400> my<00:02:51.550> laptop<00:02:51.760> that

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
there's the lab in my laptop that

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.410 
there's the lab in my laptop that
setting<00:02:52.660> is<00:02:52.750> missing<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.070> that's<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.880> problem

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
setting is missing so that's the problem

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.290 
setting is missing so that's the problem
why<00:02:56.020> do<00:02:56.080> we<00:02:56.410> need<00:02:56.920> that<00:02:57.160> to<00:02:57.490> go<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.700> bias<00:02:58.030> so

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
why do we need that to go to bias so

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.600 
why do we need that to go to bias so
some<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.870> software's<00:02:59.470> we<00:02:59.890> actually<00:03:00.400> need

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
some of the software's we actually need

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.290 
some of the software's we actually need
to<00:03:00.880> enable<00:03:01.650> visual<00:03:02.650> technology<00:03:03.340> or<00:03:03.550> what<00:03:04.120> we

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
to enable visual technology or what we

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.890 
to enable visual technology or what we
can<00:03:04.480> also<00:03:04.690> call<00:03:05.020> VTX<00:03:06.030> for<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.240> we<00:03:07.420> need<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.780> go

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
can also call VTX for that we need to go

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.580 
can also call VTX for that we need to go
to<00:03:07.960> bias<00:03:08.350> but<00:03:09.070> from<00:03:09.370> this<00:03:09.610> kind<00:03:10.060> of<00:03:10.180> hardware

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
to bias but from this kind of hardware

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.710 
to bias but from this kind of hardware
some<00:03:11.590> most<00:03:12.130> of<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.430> Lenovo's<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.240> some<00:03:13.540> of

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
some most of the Lenovo's and some of

some most of the Lenovo's and some of
HP's<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:14.380> somewhat<00:03:14.860> some<00:03:15.490> laptops<00:03:15.760> then<00:03:16.210> we

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
HP's and somewhat some laptops then we

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.480 
HP's and somewhat some laptops then we
can<00:03:16.600> we<00:03:16.780> don't<00:03:16.990> have<00:03:17.260> this<00:03:17.440> option<00:03:17.740> in<00:03:18.220> the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
can we don't have this option in the

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.170 
can we don't have this option in the
Advanced<00:03:19.090> Options<00:03:20.070> option<00:03:21.070> so<00:03:21.280> what<00:03:21.790> are<00:03:22.000> we

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
Advanced Options option so what are we

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.530 
Advanced Options option so what are we
going<00:03:22.420> to<00:03:22.540> do<00:03:22.660> in<00:03:22.870> this<00:03:23.170> case<00:03:23.560> in<00:03:23.890> this<00:03:24.540> this

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
going to do in this case in this this

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.870 
going to do in this case in this this
particular<00:03:26.110> cases<00:03:26.380> this<00:03:26.800> hardware's<00:03:27.430> has<00:03:27.850> a

it<00:05:26.150> but<00:05:26.659> just<00:05:26.990> to<00:05:27.169> show<00:05:27.409> you<00:05:27.789> see<00:05:28.789> here<00:05:29.210> is<00:05:29.330> the

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
it but just to show you see here is the

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.809 
it but just to show you see here is the
your<00:05:30.169> adapter<00:05:30.589> most<00:05:30.800> of<00:05:30.919> the<00:05:31.009> laptops<00:05:31.460> now<00:05:31.669> it

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:31.819 
your adapter most of the laptops now it

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:35.890 
your adapter most of the laptops now it
is<00:05:31.969> the<00:05:33.069> the<00:05:34.069> laptop<00:05:34.400> come<00:05:34.639> disabled<00:05:35.270> in<00:05:35.449> the

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
is the the laptop come disabled in the

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.459 
is the the laptop come disabled in the
VT<00:05:36.229> of<00:05:36.349> VTX<00:05:36.860> so<00:05:37.550> we<00:05:37.819> have<00:05:38.000> to<00:05:38.120> enable<00:05:38.569> it<00:05:38.719> to<00:05:38.750> use

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:39.469 
VT of VTX so we have to enable it to use

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:41.890 
VT of VTX so we have to enable it to use
for<00:05:39.889> example<00:05:40.520> for<00:05:40.789> the<00:05:41.120> latest<00:05:41.479> android

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
for example for the latest android

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.930 
for example for the latest android
studio<00:05:42.199> to<00:05:42.560> run<00:05:42.710> the<00:05:42.919> understood<00:05:43.400> you<00:05:43.550> to<00:05:43.580> run

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
studio to run the understood you to run

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.730 
studio to run the understood you to run
the<00:05:44.060> emulator<00:05:44.270> in<00:05:44.690> Android<00:05:45.050> studio<00:05:45.080> you<00:05:45.500> need

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
the emulator in Android studio you need

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.550 
the emulator in Android studio you need
to<00:05:45.949> enable<00:05:46.550> via<00:05:47.240> virtual<00:05:47.539> virtual<00:05:48.319> technology

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
to enable via virtual virtual technology

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.459 
to enable via virtual virtual technology
so<00:05:49.310> this<00:05:49.550> this<00:05:50.389> is<00:05:50.569> how<00:05:50.750> you<00:05:50.810> enable<00:05:51.199> the

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:51.469 
so this this is how you enable the

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:53.950 
so this this is how you enable the
virtual<00:05:51.830> technology<00:05:52.370> virtual<00:05:53.330> technology<00:05:53.509> or
