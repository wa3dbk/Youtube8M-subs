00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
and I use I use a different pistol for

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.420 
and I use I use a different pistol for
every<00:02:19.630> class<00:02:19.810> but<00:02:20.140> with<00:02:20.350> this<00:02:20.500> DSR<00:02:21.070> it's<00:02:21.340> a

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
every class but with this DSR it's a

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.940 
every class but with this DSR it's a
pack<00:02:21.670> weapon<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:23.260> don't<00:02:23.410> get<00:02:23.530> many<00:02:23.590> hit

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
pack weapon you don't get many hit

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.530 
pack weapon you don't get many hit
markers<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:26.710> tac-45<00:02:27.190> when<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.210> do<00:02:28.360> get<00:02:28.450> a

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
markers and the tac-45 when you do get a

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.360 
markers and the tac-45 when you do get a
hitmarker<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.200> essentially<00:02:29.650> one<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.130> kills

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
hitmarker and essentially one it kills

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.830 
hitmarker and essentially one it kills
them<00:02:30.520> so<00:02:30.730> if<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:30.910> get<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.090> hitmarker<00:02:31.240> across

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
them so if you get a hitmarker across

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.160 
them so if you get a hitmarker across
the<00:02:31.990> map<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.590> shoot<00:02:32.770> that<00:02:32.950> with<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.160> tac-45

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
the map you shoot that with the tac-45

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.720 
the map you shoot that with the tac-45
you<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.410> essentially<00:02:35.830> guarantee<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.550> kill

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
you you essentially guarantee to kill

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.320 
you you essentially guarantee to kill
