like these buttons over here and this is
actually<00:05:00.010> going<00:05:00.280> to<00:05:00.340> be<00:05:00.430> used<00:05:00.850> on<00:05:01.150> my<00:05:01.330> pc<00:05:01.930> more

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
actually going to be used on my pc more

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.060 
actually going to be used on my pc more
than<00:05:03.100> my<00:05:03.250> xbox<00:05:03.669> 360<00:05:05.850> just<00:05:06.850> flip<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.300> this<00:05:07.479> way

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
than my xbox 360 just flip it this way

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.790 
than my xbox 360 just flip it this way
to<00:05:09.070> bring<00:05:09.310> it<00:05:09.430> back<00:05:09.610> you<00:05:10.530> flip<00:05:11.530> it<00:05:11.650> the<00:05:11.710> other

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
to bring it back you flip it the other

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.909 
to bring it back you flip it the other
way<00:05:11.979> once<00:05:12.400> again<00:05:12.550> i'll<00:05:12.790> show<00:05:12.910> you<00:05:13.000> again<00:05:13.919> flip

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
way once again i'll show you again flip

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.320 
way once again i'll show you again flip
this<00:05:15.130> this<00:05:15.400> way<00:05:15.639> since<00:05:16.030> it<00:05:16.210> looks

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
this this way since it looks

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.930 
this this way since it looks
three-dimensional<00:05:16.720> right<00:05:17.320> there<00:05:17.530> right<00:05:17.940> and

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
three-dimensional right there right and

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.219 
three-dimensional right there right and
you<00:05:19.090> flip<00:05:19.419> it<00:05:19.449> up<00:05:19.800> then<00:05:20.800> it<00:05:20.919> has<00:05:21.070> the<00:05:21.250> borders

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
you flip it up then it has the borders

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:27.540 
you flip it up then it has the borders
okay<00:05:23.229> so<00:05:25.290> and<00:05:26.290> i<00:05:26.740> guess<00:05:26.919> that's<00:05:27.130> pretty<00:05:27.280> much

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
okay so and i guess that's pretty much

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.540 
okay so and i guess that's pretty much
it<00:05:27.880> for<00:05:28.090> the<00:05:28.360> unboxing<00:05:29.340> nothing<00:05:30.340> spectacular

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
it for the unboxing nothing spectacular

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.030 
it for the unboxing nothing spectacular
like<00:05:31.510> i<00:05:31.630> said<00:05:31.690> i<00:05:31.900> guess<00:05:32.320> this<00:05:32.470> is<00:05:32.680> they<00:05:32.860> say

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
like i said i guess this is they say

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.670 
like i said i guess this is they say
