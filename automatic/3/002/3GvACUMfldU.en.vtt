00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.849
 the textual here rayman the 33 in the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:13.500
 ww map of zombies in the 85 the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:17.279
 custom map good let's see is a map 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.220
 the smallest I've seen I think the most 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.070
 quick to record is to say and I've 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.230
 downloaded expressly to tell us 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.730
 would like you to download these maps or 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.410
 be that they approach us to download many 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.410
 more and that there would be 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.429
 this new one is not erasing until 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.429
 weather 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.539
 the style but how many people leave here 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.650
 You have to run because you do not remember 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.810
 top points 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.680
 if you like this, they are customized maps 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.680
 of color 25 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.360
 bum 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.619
 It's the time I've arrived the most 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.360
 no no day 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.370
 I think we repeat it, let's play 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.920
 other than these items are very small 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.350
 they are very fat now if we get 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.070
 get to 3 minutes 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.070
 played 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.660
 to see how much the good box costs 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.660
 perfect 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.500
 from the www 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.090
 they are not made like maps 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.530
 original clear those are already made 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.530
 by activision 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.100
 I also have six of those but the best 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:04.590
 would be 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:06.600
 the best thing would be to record in recording these 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.030
 maps that you 've never seen them before 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.570
 seen people and would be very good 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.570
 record them 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.460
 but the bad thing is that you're running out of 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.460
 ammunition 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.820
 you give me the gun shit 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.840
 this is the match game program that 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.000
 he has to touch me 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.420
 stage to put if as it is something if not 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.420
 can leave 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.090
 we have here 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.130
 that morning he liked more 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.730
 how is the ship here punch if not 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.730
 may l 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.870
 goodbye uncle but it's tiny this day 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:50.390
 in the perfect recurring is the best 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.390
 be honest 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.860
 if we are in it 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.389
 in those good minutes let's breathe 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.389
 breathe a little with this 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:12.360
 the effects are also beautiful 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:15.890
 those maps to find out why when 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.890
 he launched quite 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:42.619
 but no no no no 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.550
 my god 3 minutes 16 seconds let's go 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.550
 we go 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.830
 well it's already like I'm going to record now 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.960
 same others so I hope that I have 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.640
 liked if you want more beautiful tell me in 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.470
 the comments 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.310
 and well I know that is not fulfilling 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.050
 ok the schedule but 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.180
 I'm going to go back to that video since we're 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.070
 in summer in summer there are days that 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.920
 I want nothing to record and another 10 that 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:17.390
 times a lot like for example today and I'm going to 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:22.310
 to be recording something up to the time and 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:25.610
 good nothing until good bye the two 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:28.790
 guys here there are more than 33 and well then 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:31.850
 I'm here in a bonus clip of the previous 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.680
 video and good is a part in which you 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.630
 he wants to show that he killed with the fire 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.340
 learned to open that open the door is 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:42.900
 giving the a efe 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:45.630
 well it was not that difficult to improve 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:48.080
 at minute 4 so I already had it 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.080
 improved 

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:54.479
 it's so much easier that we're going 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.050
