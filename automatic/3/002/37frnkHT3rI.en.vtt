was a great season for me what is the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.020 
was a great season for me what is the
tension<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.609> were<00:00:56.699> right<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
tension like you were right in the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.250 
tension like you were right in the
middle<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.359> last<00:00:57.600> year<00:00:57.780> at<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> end<00:00:58.230> of

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
middle of that last year at the end of

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.660

the<00:00:58.350> race<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.620> Seattle<00:00:59.010> say<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.190> mean<00:00:59.370> what<00:00:59.550> is

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the race in Seattle say I mean what is

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.099 
the race in Seattle say I mean what is
the<00:00:59.789> tension<00:01:00.120> like<00:01:00.269> when<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> championship<00:01:00.989> is

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
the tension like when a championship is

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.689 
the tension like when a championship is
on<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.230> line<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.590> series<00:01:01.890> seems<00:01:02.579> pretty

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
on the line in this series seems pretty

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.759 
on the line in this series seems pretty
intense<00:01:03.059> yeah<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.230> don't<00:01:04.379> think<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.739> really

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
intense yeah I don't think it really

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.410 
intense yeah I don't think it really
matters<00:01:05.010> it's<00:01:05.520> like<00:01:05.670> once<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.970> put<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> helmet

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
matters it's like once you put a helmet

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.050 
matters it's like once you put a helmet
on<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.690> the<00:01:07.410> instinct<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.250> racer<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:08.910> kind

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
on and the instinct of a racer just kind

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.660 
on and the instinct of a racer just kind
of<00:01:09.120> comes<00:01:09.330> out<00:01:09.570> you're<00:01:09.810> battling<00:01:10.230> and<00:01:10.670> you're

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
of comes out you're battling and you're

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.120 
of comes out you're battling and you're
in<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.910> moment<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:13.320> don't<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.680> time<00:01:13.950> to

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
in the moment and you don't have time to

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.070 
in the moment and you don't have time to
think<00:01:14.160> like<00:01:14.550> I<00:01:14.700> don't<00:01:14.970> know<00:01:15.150> about<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.660> Chism

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
think like I don't know about like Chism

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.420 
think like I don't know about like Chism
if<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.320> had<00:01:16.410> time<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.650> think<00:01:16.800> but<00:01:17.250> when<00:01:17.370> you're

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
if you had time to think but when you're

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.730 
if you had time to think but when you're
racing<00:01:17.760> you<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:18.810> kind<00:01:19.050> of<00:01:19.110> like<00:01:19.560> going

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
instinct like I said before and it's

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.190 
instinct like I said before and it's
just<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.990> reaction<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.750> that's<00:01:24.750> what's<00:01:24.990> great
