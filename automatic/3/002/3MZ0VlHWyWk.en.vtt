00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
mainly arises it's probably going to say

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.250 
mainly arises it's probably going to say
like<00:00:44.570> your<00:00:45.570> Java<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.379> not<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:47.190> compatible<00:00:48.260> you

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
like your Java is not it compatible you

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.760 
like your Java is not it compatible you
need<00:00:49.410> Java<00:00:49.770> 6<00:00:50.300> well

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
need Java 6 well

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.520 
need Java 6 well
that<00:00:52.770> necessarily<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.579> not<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.239> hard<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.930> fix

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
that necessarily is not that hard to fix

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.170 
that necessarily is not that hard to fix

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.200 
all you have to do is you have to find
the<00:00:57.690> Java<00:00:58.850> 10.6<00:00:59.850> or<00:01:00.500> 1.6<00:01:01.500> Java<00:01:01.949> 1.6<00:01:02.760> which<00:01:03.030> I'll

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the Java 10.6 or 1.6 Java 1.6 which I'll

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.100 
the Java 10.6 or 1.6 Java 1.6 which I'll
put<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.629> link<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.409> description<00:01:05.869> this<00:01:06.869> is

put this link in the description this is

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.200 
put this link in the description this is
really<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.890> hardest<00:01:08.369> part<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.790> pretty<00:01:09.030> much

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
really the hardest part is pretty much

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.140 
really the hardest part is pretty much
finding<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:10.580> you<00:01:11.580> got<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.760> find<00:01:11.970> this

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
finding this you got to find this

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.600 
finding this you got to find this
download<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.110> then<00:01:13.740> when<00:01:14.250> you're<00:01:14.400> done

with that you have to type this little
string<00:01:20.060> into<00:01:21.060> your<00:01:22.729> into<00:01:24.350> terminal<00:01:25.350> terminal

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
string into your into terminal terminal

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.359 
string into your into terminal terminal
is<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.580> need<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.820> use<00:01:26.850> make<00:01:27.630> sure<00:01:27.869> that

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
description and so pretty much what

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.319 
description and so pretty much what
you're<00:01:44.159> going<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.310> do<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.579> when<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.850> type<00:01:45.060> this

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
you're going to do is when you type this

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.520 
you're going to do is when you type this
into<00:01:46.850> terminal<00:01:47.850> which<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.299> find<00:01:48.780> conveniently

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
into terminal which I find conveniently

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.190 
into terminal which I find conveniently
right<00:01:50.009> here<00:01:51.979> you<00:01:52.979> type<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.280> code<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.720> thingy

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
right here you type that code the thingy

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.620 
right here you type that code the thingy
into<00:01:55.829> terminal<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.820> then<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.869> launch<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
into terminal and then you launch it and

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.499 
into terminal and then you launch it and
it<00:02:00.630> should<00:02:00.930> launch<00:02:01.369> without<00:02:02.369> because<00:02:03.299> Mon

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
it should launch without because Mon

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.350 
it should launch without because Mon
