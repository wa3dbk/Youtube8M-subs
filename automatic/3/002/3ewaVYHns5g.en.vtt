well<00:00:44.760> with<00:00:45.360> bungees<00:00:45.780> twitch<00:00:46.049> reveal<00:00:46.409> I<00:00:46.559> think

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
well with bungees twitch reveal I think

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.380 
well with bungees twitch reveal I think
we<00:00:46.920> can<00:00:47.040> pretty<00:00:47.220> much<00:00:47.339> confirm<00:00:47.909> it<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.239> going

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
we can pretty much confirm it is going

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.689 
we can pretty much confirm it is going
to<00:00:48.449> be<00:00:48.479> taking<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.989> same<00:00:49.229> exact<00:00:49.620> path<00:00:49.920> as<00:00:50.159> the

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
to be taking the same exact path as the

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.969 
to be taking the same exact path as the
necro<00:00:51.089> chasm<00:00:51.540> so<00:00:51.720> I<00:00:51.930> went<00:00:52.409> back<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.830> watched

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:52.979

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:54.829 
necro chasm so I went back and watched
the<00:00:53.220> twitch<00:00:53.430> reveal<00:00:53.790> and<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.150> pause<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.690> video

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
space and one thing caught my eye that

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.990 
space and one thing caught my eye that
is<00:01:01.290> the<00:01:01.440> fact<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.799> there's<00:01:02.040> a<00:01:02.129> legendary

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
is the fact that there's a legendary

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.119 
is the fact that there's a legendary
strangers<00:01:03.570> rifle<00:01:03.960> sitting<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.470> their<00:01:04.860> vault

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
strangers rifle sitting in their vault

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.430 
strangers rifle sitting in their vault
right<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> top<00:01:06.000> row<00:01:06.299> people<00:01:07.020> might<00:01:07.200> try<00:01:07.409> to

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
right in the top row people might try to

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.050 
right in the top row people might try to
argue<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.190> is<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.490> different<00:01:08.909> weapon

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
argue that this is a different weapon

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.940 
argue that this is a different weapon
but<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.780> don't<00:01:10.140> think<00:01:10.290> bungees<00:01:10.680> going<00:01:10.890> to

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
but I don't think bungees going to

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.580 
but I don't think bungees going to
rescan<00:01:11.460> such<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.970> unique<00:01:12.510> looking<00:01:13.110> weapon<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
rescan such a unique looking weapon the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.530 
rescan such a unique looking weapon the
only<00:01:13.619> other<00:01:14.070> weapon<00:01:14.490> looks<00:01:14.790> even<00:01:15.210> close<00:01:15.510> to

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
only other weapon looks even close to

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.660 
only other weapon looks even close to
the<00:01:15.840> strangers<00:01:16.230> rifle<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.220> fate<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.460> all

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
the strangers rifle is the fate of all

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.640 
the strangers rifle is the fate of all
fools<00:01:17.940> which<00:01:18.300> is<00:01:18.480> another<00:01:18.930> exotic<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.620> I

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
fools which is another exotic so I

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.950 
fools which is another exotic so I
highly<00:01:20.010> doubt<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.940> case<00:01:21.120> so<00:01:21.720> I'm

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
highly doubt that is the case so I'm

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.150
