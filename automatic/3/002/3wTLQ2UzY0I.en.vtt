00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
the character in the story and and I

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.009 
the character in the story and and I

to see you know you've record something

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.189 
to see you know you've record something
ahead<00:04:37.880> of<00:04:38.030> time<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:38.389> then<00:04:38.479> it<00:04:38.570> ended<00:04:38.810> up<00:04:38.960> that

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
ahead of time and then it ended up that

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.260 
ahead of time and then it ended up that
that<00:04:39.349> was<00:04:39.500> actually<00:04:39.800> a<00:04:39.830> close-up<00:04:40.340> and<00:04:41.030> so
