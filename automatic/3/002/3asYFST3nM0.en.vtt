the flash in the direct flash position

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.410 
the flash in the direct flash position
you'll<00:01:03.739> notice<00:01:04.070> that<00:01:04.250> this<00:01:04.430> diffusion

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
you'll notice that this diffusion

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.840 
you'll notice that this diffusion
surface<00:01:05.960> is<00:01:06.140> roughly<00:01:06.799> six<00:01:07.310> or<00:01:07.490> eight<00:01:07.580> times

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
surface is roughly six or eight times

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.550 
surface is roughly six or eight times
the<00:01:08.119> size<00:01:08.330> of<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.570> flash<00:01:08.780> head<00:01:08.990> itself<00:01:09.350> and

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
the size of the flash head itself and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.080 
the size of the flash head itself and
that's<00:01:09.619> what<00:01:09.860> something<00:01:10.220> is<00:01:10.310> like<00:01:10.549> you'll

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
that's what something is like you'll

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.310 
that's what something is like you'll
also<00:01:11.270> notice<00:01:11.600> that<00:01:11.720> it's<00:01:11.960> center-weighted

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
also notice that it's center-weighted

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.950 
also notice that it's center-weighted
for<00:01:13.130> more<00:01:13.280> even<00:01:13.610> illumination<00:01:14.090> we<00:01:14.690> can't

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
for more even illumination we can't

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.480 
for more even illumination we can't
amplify<00:01:15.440> the<00:01:15.500> light<00:01:15.710> around<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.010> perimeter

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
amplify the light around the perimeter

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.490 
amplify the light around the perimeter
so<00:01:16.700> we<00:01:16.820> hold<00:01:17.030> back<00:01:17.180> some<00:01:17.420> light<00:01:17.600> in<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:18.290> center

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
so we hold back some light in the center

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.429 
so we hold back some light in the center
to<00:01:18.830> help<00:01:18.979> illuminate<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.520> soft<00:01:19.760> hotspot<00:01:20.689> you'll

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
to help illuminate a soft hotspot you'll

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.350 
to help illuminate a soft hotspot you'll
also<00:01:21.590> notice<00:01:21.950> that<00:01:22.040> it's<00:01:22.280> not<00:01:22.460> just<00:01:22.700> out<00:01:22.850> it's

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
also notice that it's not just out it's

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.700 
also notice that it's not just out it's
not<00:01:23.510> just<00:01:23.570> out<00:01:23.869> so<00:01:24.049> that<00:01:24.229> it<00:01:24.350> doesn't

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
not just out so that it doesn't

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.530 
not just out so that it doesn't
interfere<00:01:24.799> with<00:01:25.220> either<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.150> autofocus

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
interfere with either the autofocus

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.140 
interfere with either the autofocus
assist<00:01:27.080> or<00:01:27.290> exposure<00:01:28.130> control<00:01:28.580> on<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:28.939> flash

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
assist or exposure control on the flash

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.230 
assist or exposure control on the flash
itself<00:01:29.740> we<00:01:30.740> also<00:01:30.920> make<00:01:31.369> several<00:01:31.909> other<00:01:32.060> models

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
itself we also make several other models

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.149 
itself we also make several other models
we<00:01:32.509> have<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:32.750> softbox<00:01:33.170> three<00:01:33.560> that's<00:01:33.770> roughly

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
we have the softbox three that's roughly

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.399 
we have the softbox three that's roughly
twice<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.490> size<00:01:34.880> of<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.270> original<00:01:35.720> softbox

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
twice the size of the original softbox

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.020 
twice the size of the original softbox
so<00:01:36.740> it's<00:01:36.890> going<00:01:37.009> to<00:01:37.130> produce<00:01:37.280> softer<00:01:37.790> chefs

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
so it's going to produce softer chefs

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.330 
so it's going to produce softer chefs
it's<00:01:38.750> also<00:01:39.049> center-weighted<00:01:39.680> but<00:01:40.189> you'll

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
it's also center-weighted but you'll

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.399 
it's also center-weighted but you'll
notice<00:01:40.549> it<00:01:41.030> is<00:01:41.060> not<00:01:41.210> notched<00:01:41.630> out<00:01:41.869> so<00:01:42.110> it<00:01:42.229> would

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
notice it is not notched out so it would

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:43.679 
notice it is not notched out so it would
interfere<00:01:42.650> you're<00:01:42.920> likely<00:01:43.310> with<00:01:43.520> the

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
interfere you're likely with the

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.450 
interfere you're likely with the
autofocus<00:01:44.689> assist<00:01:45.229> we<00:01:45.710> also<00:01:45.860> make<00:01:46.159> a<00:01:46.189> mini

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
autofocus assist we also make a mini

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.490 
autofocus assist we also make a mini
softbox<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.210> mini<00:01:47.390> softbox<00:01:47.900> is<00:01:48.079> so<00:01:48.259> small

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
softbox the mini softbox is so small

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.990 
softbox the mini softbox is so small
that<00:01:48.560> it<00:01:48.950> doesn't<00:01:49.310> interfere<00:01:49.400> with<00:01:49.700> those

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
that it doesn't interfere with those

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.880 
that it doesn't interfere with those
automatic<00:01:50.420> features<00:01:50.750> won't<00:01:51.439> be<00:01:51.619> quite<00:01:51.860> as

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
automatic features won't be quite as

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.370 
automatic features won't be quite as
soft<00:01:52.220> as<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:52.520> softbox<00:01:52.909> itself<00:01:53.420> but<00:01:53.630> still<00:01:53.780> the

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
soft as the softbox itself but still the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.050 
soft as the softbox itself but still the
mini<00:01:54.560> softbox<00:01:55.070> is<00:01:55.250> roughly<00:01:55.549> two<00:01:55.820> or<00:01:55.909> three

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
mini softbox is roughly two or three

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.490 
mini softbox is roughly two or three
times<00:01:56.329> the<00:01:56.479> size<00:01:56.540> of<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.960> flash<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:57.320> that's

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
times the size of the flash so that's

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.649 
times the size of the flash so that's
what<00:01:57.680> softens<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.189> shadows<00:01:58.579> people<00:01:59.360> often

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
what softens the shadows people often

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.210 
what softens the shadows people often
ask<00:01:59.810> me<00:01:59.930> say<00:02:00.200> which<00:02:00.470> one's<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.829> best<00:02:01.040> which

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
ask me say which one's the best which

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.130 
ask me say which one's the best which
one<00:02:01.430> should<00:02:01.640> I<00:02:01.729> use<00:02:01.759> well<00:02:02.540> obviously<00:02:02.689> there's

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
one should I use well obviously there's

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.359 
one should I use well obviously there's
slightly<00:02:03.470> different<00:02:03.770> application

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
slightly different application

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.249 
slightly different application
essentially<00:02:05.180> if<00:02:05.390> you're<00:02:05.689> going<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:05.930> be<00:02:05.990> using

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
essentially if you're going to be using

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.749 
essentially if you're going to be using
the<00:02:06.320> softbox<00:02:06.710> three<00:02:07.070> you<00:02:07.340> can<00:02:07.490> use<00:02:07.640> it

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
the softbox three you can use it

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.419 
the softbox three you can use it
off-camera<00:02:08.239> on<00:02:08.599> camera<00:02:09.349> you<00:02:09.679> know<00:02:09.799> for<00:02:10.069> a<00:02:10.099> lot

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
off-camera on camera you know for a lot

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.039 
off-camera on camera you know for a lot
of<00:02:10.579> different<00:02:10.879> situations<00:02:11.029> it's<00:02:11.659> going<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:11.959> be

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
of different situations it's going to be

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.349 
of different situations it's going to be
the<00:02:12.169> softest<00:02:12.559> they're<00:02:13.069> ready<00:02:13.459> many<00:02:13.760> softbox

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:14.359 
the softest they're ready many softbox

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:16.309 
the softest they're ready many softbox
is<00:02:14.599> going<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.900> be<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.019> most<00:02:15.139> convenient

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
is going to be the most convenient

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.630 
is going to be the most convenient
but<00:02:16.409> isn't<00:02:16.530> gonna<00:02:16.709> be<00:02:16.859> nearly<00:02:17.069> as<00:02:17.219> soft<00:02:17.430> as<00:02:17.609> the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
but isn't gonna be nearly as soft as the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.729 
but isn't gonna be nearly as soft as the
larger<00:02:18.030> ones<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.870> original<00:02:19.230> softbox

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
larger ones and the original softbox

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.860 
larger ones and the original softbox
something<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:20.489> between<00:02:20.579> but<00:02:21.359> essentially<00:02:21.749> the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
something in between but essentially the

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.839 
something in between but essentially the
key<00:02:22.079> is<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.590> select<00:02:22.859> the<00:02:23.010> right<00:02:23.249> tool<00:02:23.489> for<00:02:23.790> the

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
key is to select the right tool for the

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.030 
key is to select the right tool for the
job
