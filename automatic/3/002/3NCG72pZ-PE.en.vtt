00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
work and be fun so I'm curious for this

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.600 
work and be fun so I'm curious for this
game<00:02:27.390> just<00:02:27.630> because<00:02:28.010> in<00:02:29.010> terms<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.370> like<00:02:29.490> an

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
game just because in terms of like an

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.270 
game just because in terms of like an
experimentation<00:02:30.270> type<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.170> deal<00:02:31.350> that<00:02:32.250> I

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
experimentation type of deal that I

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.390 
experimentation type of deal that I
think<00:02:32.610> could<00:02:32.700> be<00:02:32.790> pretty<00:02:32.940> sweet<00:02:33.270> if<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.960> works

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
think could be pretty sweet if it works

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.800 
think could be pretty sweet if it works
probably<00:02:35.400> won't<00:02:35.520> but<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:36.360> those<00:02:36.540> are<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.690> big

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
probably won't but so those are the big

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.960 
probably won't but so those are the big

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
I think they do have a leg up on Sony of

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.450

course<00:04:55.229> hardware-wise<00:04:55.770> I'm<00:04:56.160> still<00:04:56.370> a<00:04:56.400> little

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
course hardware-wise I'm still a little

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.300 
course hardware-wise I'm still a little
more<00:04:56.790> into<00:04:57.030> the<00:04:57.120> ps4<00:04:57.360> but<00:04:58.020> launch<00:04:58.889> titles

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
more into the ps4 but launch titles

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.129 
more into the ps4 but launch titles
sound<00:04:59.610> pretty<00:04:59.880> awesome<00:05:00.270> for<00:05:00.389> xbox<00:05:00.750> month<00:05:00.990> but

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
sound pretty awesome for xbox month but

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:02.600 
sound pretty awesome for xbox month but
