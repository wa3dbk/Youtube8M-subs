Joanie Dewey on this table how is that

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.370 
Joanie Dewey on this table how is that
not<00:00:17.490> too<00:00:17.640> bad<00:00:17.820> getting<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.330> facelift<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
not too bad getting a facelift is the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.050 
not too bad getting a facelift is the
same<00:00:19.619> as<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.010> for<00:00:20.310> most<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.730> do<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.000> I

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
same as it is for most to do it I

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.820 
same as it is for most to do it I
thought<00:00:21.240> if<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.510> could<00:00:21.660> do<00:00:21.810> something<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.289> make

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
thought if I could do something to make

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.820

it look like how I feel on the inside

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.050 
it look like how I feel on the inside
maybe<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.949> could<00:00:26.070> hang<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.550> use<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.910> few

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
maybe I could hang on to that use a few

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.710 
maybe I could hang on to that use a few
more<00:00:27.210> years<00:00:28.820> but<00:00:29.820> Joanie<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.269> taking<00:00:30.630> a

associated with a traditional cutting
type<00:00:56.129> procedure<00:00:56.309> there<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.180> no<00:00:57.420> cutting<00:00:57.750> with

type procedure there is no cutting with

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.990 
type procedure there is no cutting with
a<00:00:58.079> laser<00:00:58.379> lift<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.039> few<00:00:59.309> tiny<00:00:59.640> holes

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
a laser lift just a few tiny holes

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.119 
a laser lift just a few tiny holes
because<00:01:00.719> these<00:01:00.870> holes<00:01:01.109> are<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.440> small<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
because these holes are so small the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.380 
because these holes are so small the
body<00:01:02.309> will<00:01:02.550> pretty<00:01:02.699> much<00:01:02.789> heal<00:01:03.120> them<00:01:03.270> up

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
body will pretty much heal them up

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.000 
body will pretty much heal them up
overnight<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.080> there's<00:01:04.260> really<00:01:04.350> no<00:01:04.559> need<00:01:04.769> for

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
overnight so there's really no need for

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.010 
overnight so there's really no need for
any<00:01:05.100> stitching<00:01:05.580> which<00:01:05.970> means<00:01:06.210> virtually<00:01:06.750> no

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
any stitching which means virtually no

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.320 
any stitching which means virtually no
visible<00:01:07.619> scarring<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.340> recovery<00:01:08.850> measured

visible scarring and recovery measured
in<00:01:09.570> days<00:01:09.840> rather<00:01:10.350> than<00:01:10.619> weeks<00:01:10.860> our<00:01:11.369> patients

in days rather than weeks our patients

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.940 
in days rather than weeks our patients
can<00:01:12.030> literally<00:01:12.330> drive<00:01:13.080> themselves<00:01:13.619> here<00:01:13.799> then

was<00:01:28.320> walking<00:01:28.619> around<00:01:28.890> looking<00:01:29.040> like<00:01:29.220> that

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
was walking around looking like that

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.109
