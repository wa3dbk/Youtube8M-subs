00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 they can be sergio we are not in bots 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.370
 random and let's see a pretty mode 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.860
 cool for the 1.6 point 4 we go down more 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.380
 several versions I like it is 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.240
 demonstrating I like it a lot because we see 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.010
 more than different versions and it's 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.150
 pretty white because I know that many do not 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.980
 you use the last one at 1.7 1.8 for example 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.350
 or the 1.7 point day for which a 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.359
 lots of bikes by the way of this but 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.369
 as I know there are many I think you use 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.120
 these versions then let's see this 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.360
 once for the 1.6 point 4 that we 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.940
 allows to repair tools the question 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.760
 is that now we have this here the tulle 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.340
 load from the tool magazine 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.260
 it would be done with or 4 am bills as 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.680
 are damaged that does not equal four 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.790
 diamonds and an iron block and you see 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.620
 A) Yes 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.620
 this pileup that is very good 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.800
 and it's very good and it's also that we're going to 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.800
 prove it 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.719
 out thanks 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.850
 let's try it like this 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.310
 to spend a little bit for example the shovel 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.750
 this wood to see if now that the 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.960
 we have spent we have to place 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.119
 here, as you can see, the bar is very 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.440
 ok but I would like it to be more expensive 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.580
 that is, that recharges a little 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.870
 going pretty fast, let's try it with 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.870
 the way at least super fast 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.790
 let's see if we can see how the bar rises 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.210
 from here there is pretty white 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.440
 the issue is that of course you have 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.110
 enchanted tools and there are the 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.700
 put here is already and you are not going to 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.950
 to spend then would also be great to leave a 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.150
 little clearer to no good this 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.520
 it's because we're placing the 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.620
 blocks because I do not know why but more 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.960
 solution to place them as they were but 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.670
 it would be good to cost a lot more for 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.580
 that because you have with the tools 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.540
 with this is infinite tools 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.790
 Now let's try now with a 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.240
 diamond for example there is that is 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.170
 reloaded 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.170
 let's get 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.239
 that we put ourselves a shovel I think 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.370
 I 'm here on this island and I'm going to 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.370
 spend it will see how this left 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.340
 peeled but well let's see what this 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.109
 It's a tad like that for pooch I know if 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.849
 it recovers or if it takes a long time 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.849
 recover it like this 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.880
 I want to see if it takes a long time for the diamond 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.610
 or not good if it depends on the uses or 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.580
 it just repairs it just as much by 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:50.420
 one hundred means 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.420
 a little bit more they do not give their impression 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.890
 if this one is taking longer, it 's cool 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.250
 ok I'll install the show tough ability 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:04.260
 egg is to see it well and the question is 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:09.269
 I have what you see has a thousand 87 uses 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:12.480
 yes what we have here a ratico and 330 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.920
 that now has a thousand 94 is increasing 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.230
 but I get the impression that it increases 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.959
 more when it is more negative which 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.730
 would be if it's like this is great we're going to 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.060
 try the parts because it 's that 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.340
 of the past before because it increases very 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.739
 little dose is because it has many 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.950
 clear uses with simply by the 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.430
 material that is made 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:39.240
 this is 50 and it has to be that for the 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:42.140
 number of uses are very good 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.140
 let's do that 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.270
 48 I did not want it 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.640
 has 48 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.410
 Now he has 51 fingers and it seems that 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.720
 increases everything equal 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.570
 I would molar that for example diamond 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.390
 will take more in 100 10 seconds as 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.820
 better gives you 100 uses we are going to put you 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.530
 I do not know if in 10 seconds they made you 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.370
 uses that in diamond in 100 seconds you 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:14.920
 they have 50 for example because if not 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.260
 as it is very very over power 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.380
 he's very cool again I want to try 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.260
 now it is if it works with the armor that 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.090
 I do not think so 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.950
 but good just in case now then what 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.480
 let's try but as you can see the 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.240
 This pileup is really cool, so let's go 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.020
 try because I have the helmet 53 of 56 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.610
 for example 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.630
 it costs me to remove leather armor 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.180
 53 of 56 see 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.060
 and repairs also the armor as 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.640
 I say they are very good and it's cool that you 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.670
 repair the things monomotor follows is 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.970
 true that you need 4 diamonds and 4 am 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.100
 bills and one block of iron for each 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.630
 that is fine so well but of course 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.430
 we are talking about a point arriving 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.810
 in that we have enchanted armors that 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.969
 are we go the best is touch 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.529
 79 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:07.529
 because I'm seeing that no no 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.830
 is 79 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.860
 low tone that maybe the front but 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:20.449
 well what I'm seeing is that it repairs 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.059
 and there comes a point where we have to 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.529
 the armor too good where is it 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:27.699
 I would like it to be even more expensive 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:27.699
 I pose but good 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:35.139
 179 if it has stayed this has 73 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.270
 that for the king 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.240
 then the chest is not on the helmet yes 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.479
 he has repaired it 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:48.670
 from the front I see that no 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:51.160
 73 this new repair either and these 63 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.200
 let's put it there closed by the helmet 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.320
 has been repaired and the other does not seem that 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.750
 be any point 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.220
 no no 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.460
 I can not put another here 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.980
 and put on the bib and we're doing 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.870
 tests 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.030
 63 do not operate the repaired helmet not what 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.430
 try to the best is that the helmet does not 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.630
 should and is a vessel can be the 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.150
 question is that it works also going to 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.790
 repair armor tools is 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.950
 a bit weird how it works but 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.840
 Mods tools also works 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.950
 with other modes which may be 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.230
 pretty cool 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.180
 look that now the repaired vale follows 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:31.440
 we just have to wait for it 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.440
 that seems to take longer 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.820
 Okay, this is too much, I believe you 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.140
 I think I say that because that's why a 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.790
 point of which you have diamond 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.969
 enchanted diamond armor and things 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.549
 A) Yes 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:46.099
 then there is still a moment in the 

00:06:43.549 --> 00:06:48.259
 that this is too good but good 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:49.550
 neither repairs very quickly that's what 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:52.100
 mola 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.210
 it takes a while even the shovel 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.640
 diamond for example takes quite 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.930
 it governs because it has many uses but 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.490
 well, it's pretty cool but good 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.130
 this since there is macrismo is quite 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.800
 cool this repairman bad for here 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:09.730
 I do not know how the answer but cool 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:14.060
 Pretty uncle is quite more expensive 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:18.520
 but the description is for the 1.6 point 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.520
 4 if it is made up as usual 

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.290
 bye
