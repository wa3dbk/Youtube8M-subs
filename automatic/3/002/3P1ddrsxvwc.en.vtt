going to be like this and I say you just
practice<00:01:36.930> practice<00:01:37.140> moving<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.950> should<00:01:38.159> start

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
practice practice moving I should start

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.120 
practice practice moving I should start
off<00:01:38.490> moving<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:39.030> little<00:01:39.210> slow<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.439> then<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.920> can

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.260 
off moving a little slow so then you can
get<00:01:41.460> down<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.880> rotation<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:43.079> it

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
get down the rotation of it

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.669 
get down the rotation of it
and<00:01:45.049> while<00:01:45.859> you're<00:01:45.890> doing<00:01:46.039> it<00:01:46.509> can't<00:01:47.530> be<00:01:48.530> like

practicing and pretty it's pretty easy

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.600 
practicing and pretty it's pretty easy
once<00:02:10.009> you<00:02:10.280> get<00:02:10.549> it<00:02:10.759> but<00:02:11.629> then<00:02:12.220> you<00:02:13.220> shouldn't

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
once you get it but then you shouldn't

have<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.819> practice<00:02:14.180> on<00:02:14.330> balance<00:02:15.519> on<00:02:16.519> your

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
have to practice on balance on your

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.550 
have to practice on balance on your
balance<00:02:17.060> and<00:02:17.239> keeping<00:02:17.599> it<00:02:17.690> centered<00:02:18.260> enough

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
balance and keeping it centered enough

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.670 
balance and keeping it centered enough
to<00:02:19.010> do<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.370> shove<00:02:19.579> it<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.630> pretty<00:02:21.140> much<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:21.349> on

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
to do the shove it and pretty much it on

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.270 
to do the shove it and pretty much it on
the<00:02:21.829> trick<00:02:22.269> it's<00:02:23.410> not<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.470> hard<00:02:24.829> when<00:02:25.130> you

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
the trick it's not that hard when you

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.350 
the trick it's not that hard when you
bet<00:02:25.459> it<00:02:25.610> really<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:26.150> really<00:02:26.180> isn't<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:28.360> just

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
bet it really it really isn't and just

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.470
