00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
of an orange eat owned red so I just

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.000 
of an orange eat owned red so I just
thought<00:04:58.630> I'd<00:04:58.690> go<00:04:58.930> for<00:04:59.110> a<00:04:59.200> classic<00:04:59.590> red<00:04:59.800> today

thought I'd go for a classic red today

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.280 
thought I'd go for a classic red today
and<00:05:00.430> I'm<00:05:00.610> just<00:05:00.760> basically<00:05:00.820> /<00:05:01.480> not<00:05:01.690> on<00:05:01.810> bit<00:05:02.110> by

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
and I'm just basically / not on bit by

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.260 
and I'm just basically / not on bit by
bit<00:05:02.500> try<00:05:02.800> not<00:05:03.010> to<00:05:03.130> make<00:05:03.250> any<00:05:03.430> mistakes<00:05:04.000> I

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
bit try not to make any mistakes I

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.420 
bit try not to make any mistakes I
decided<00:05:05.170> to<00:05:05.320> not<00:05:05.470> use<00:05:05.500> lip<00:05:05.800> liner<00:05:06.010> because<00:05:06.220> I

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
decided to not use lip liner because I

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.400 
decided to not use lip liner because I
couldn't<00:05:06.700> find<00:05:06.940> mine<00:05:07.240> and<00:05:07.540> so<00:05:08.170> yeah<00:05:08.260> I<00:05:08.290> would

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
couldn't find mine and so yeah I would

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.900 
couldn't find mine and so yeah I would
probably<00:05:08.860> recommend<00:05:09.130> using<00:05:09.460> lip<00:05:09.700> funny

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
probably recommend using lip funny

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.610 
probably recommend using lip funny
because<00:05:10.090> it<00:05:10.270> makes<00:05:10.420> it<00:05:10.600> a<00:05:10.660> little<00:05:10.840> bit<00:05:11.110> easier

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.860

Kylie Jenner makeup looks because they

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.140 
Kylie Jenner makeup looks because they
are<00:05:22.810> not<00:05:22.840> good<00:05:23.350> for<00:05:23.530> my<00:05:23.650> self<00:05:23.950> confidence<00:05:24.250> when

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
are not good for my self confidence when

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.790 
are not good for my self confidence when
I<00:05:25.180> look<00:05:25.420> back<00:05:25.450> at<00:05:25.780> these<00:05:25.900> shots<00:05:26.140> and<00:05:26.380> reels<00:05:26.590> I

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
I look back at these shots and reels I

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.010 
I look back at these shots and reels I
just<00:05:27.070> don't<00:05:27.490> look<00:05:27.820> good<00:05:28.120> compared<00:05:28.690> to<00:05:28.840> what

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
just don't look good compared to what

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.680 
just don't look good compared to what
they<00:05:29.170> look<00:05:29.380> like<00:05:29.410> yes<00:05:30.280> this<00:05:30.490> is<00:05:30.610> a<00:05:30.640> look<00:05:30.910> and<00:05:31.150> I

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
they look like yes this is a look and I

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.420 
they look like yes this is a look and I
think<00:05:31.750> it's<00:05:32.110> a<00:05:32.200> really<00:05:32.410> pretty<00:05:32.710> look<00:05:33.130> and<00:05:33.310> it's

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
think it's a really pretty look and it's

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.350 
think it's a really pretty look and it's
a<00:05:33.490> little<00:05:33.670> bit<00:05:33.760> different<00:05:34.060> to<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.210> 10

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
a little bit different to the 10

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.730 
a little bit different to the 10
normally<00:05:34.810> wear<00:05:34.930> so<00:05:35.080> it's<00:05:35.200> nice<00:05:35.380> to<00:05:35.560> see
