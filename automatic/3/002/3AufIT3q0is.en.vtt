00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
they're all the same on each side what

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.630 
they're all the same on each side what
there's<00:01:52.429> only<00:01:52.520> like<00:01:54.039> they're<00:01:55.039> like<00:01:55.250> both<00:01:55.489> the

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
there's only like they're like both the

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.800 
there's only like they're like both the
same<00:01:55.819> on<00:01:55.970> each<00:01:56.090> side<00:01:57.039> we<00:01:58.039> got<00:01:58.189> these

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
same on each side we got these

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.620 
same on each side we got these
air-to-surface<00:01:59.810> missiles<00:02:01.209> another<00:02:02.209> one<00:02:02.450> over

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
air-to-surface missiles another one over

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.609 
air-to-surface missiles another one over
here<00:02:02.750> uh<00:02:04.179> this<00:02:05.179> is<00:02:05.239> also<00:02:05.719> this<00:02:06.049> is<00:02:06.140> also<00:02:06.170> an

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
here uh this is also this is also an

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.740 
here uh this is also this is also an
error<00:02:06.829> surface<00:02:07.069> missile<00:02:07.579> except<00:02:08.360> slightly

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
error surface missile except slightly

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.420 
error surface missile except slightly
more<00:02:09.110> powerful<00:02:10.120> this<00:02:11.120> one<00:02:11.329> over<00:02:11.540> here<00:02:11.569> is<00:02:12.019> an

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
more powerful this one over here is an

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.330 
more powerful this one over here is an
air-to-air<00:02:13.430> missile<00:02:14.079> and<00:02:15.079> this<00:02:15.829> is<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:15.980> harp

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
air-to-air missile and this is a harp

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.690 
air-to-air missile and this is a harp
this<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.239> a<00:02:17.450> harpoon<00:02:18.110> EMP<00:02:18.799> missile<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.340> will

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
this is a harpoon EMP missile I will

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.930 
this is a harpoon EMP missile I will
show<00:02:19.819> you<00:02:19.910> how<00:02:19.940> that<00:02:20.030> works<00:02:20.180> basically<00:02:21.940> this

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
show you how that works basically this

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.620 
show you how that works basically this
great<00:02:23.329> piece<00:02:23.599> detaches<00:02:24.530> with<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:24.860> missile

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
great piece detaches with the missile

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.720 
great piece detaches with the missile
basically<00:02:26.630> it<00:02:26.930> this<00:02:27.350> great<00:02:28.310> piece<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.549> like<00:02:28.700> a

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
basically it this great piece is like a

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.990 
basically it this great piece is like a
device<00:02:29.329> and<00:02:29.780> EMP<00:02:30.079> device<00:02:30.440> that<00:02:30.769> can<00:02:34.000> trends

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
device and EMP device that can trends

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000 
device and EMP device that can trends
transmit<00:02:35.959> EMP<00:02:36.500> electrons<00:02:37.160> are<00:02:38.079> from<00:02:39.079> through

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
transmit EMP electrons are from through

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.849 
transmit EMP electrons are from through
the<00:02:40.299> metal<00:02:41.299> harpoon<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.319> jet<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:42.709> it's

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
the metal harpoon to the jet that it's

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.190 
the metal harpoon to the jet that it's
supposed<00:02:43.069> to<00:02:43.160> destroy<00:02:43.599> basically<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:44.780> rocket

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
supposed to destroy basically the rocket

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.140 
supposed to destroy basically the rocket
its<00:02:45.410> rocket<00:02:46.010> propelled<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:46.639> it<00:02:46.760> goes<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.120> fast

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
its rocket propelled so it goes so fast

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.030 
its rocket propelled so it goes so fast
it<00:02:47.690> sticks<00:02:47.989> on<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.290> jet<00:02:48.500> that's<00:02:48.680> supposed<00:02:48.950> to

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
it sticks on the jet that's supposed to

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.830 
it sticks on the jet that's supposed to
destroy<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:50.019> then<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:52.459> device<00:02:52.840> transmits

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
destroy and then the device transmits

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.870 
destroy and then the device transmits
electrons<00:02:54.590> EMP<00:02:55.130> electrons<00:02:55.579> through<00:02:55.760> the

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
electrons EMP electrons through the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.210 
electrons EMP electrons through the
metal<00:02:56.030> harpoon<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.930> then<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:57.829> gets<00:02:57.950> onto

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
metal harpoon and then that gets onto

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.159 
metal harpoon and then that gets onto
the<00:02:58.310> plane<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:58.819> then<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.060> plane<00:02:59.359> the<00:02:59.900> enemy

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.169 
the plane and then the plane the enemy

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.580 
the plane and then the plane the enemy
plane<00:03:00.440> eventually<00:03:01.040> crashes<00:03:02.260> I'll<00:03:03.260> just<00:03:03.410> put

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
plane eventually crashes I'll just put
