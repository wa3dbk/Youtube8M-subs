00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
it's too late because we got to do is

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:09.449 
it's too late because we got to do is
cool<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.460> birds<00:02:00.670> now<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:09.160> biggest

justification<00:02:10.450> for<00:02:10.540> shooting<00:02:10.959> and<00:02:11.350> that

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
justification for shooting and that

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.800 
justification for shooting and that
certainly<00:02:12.040> for<00:02:12.190> my<00:02:12.310> generation<00:02:12.700> is<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.630> fact

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
certainly for my generation is the fact

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.840 
certainly for my generation is the fact
that<00:02:13.959> we<00:02:14.049> can<00:02:14.200> potentially<00:02:14.680> feed<00:02:15.070> people<00:02:15.549> feed

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
that we can potentially feed people feed

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.660 
that we can potentially feed people feed
the<00:02:16.000> nation<00:02:16.350> at<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.410> reduced<00:02:17.799> price<00:02:17.980> compared

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
the nation at a reduced price compared

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.340 
the nation at a reduced price compared
to<00:02:18.820> other<00:02:19.829> other<00:02:20.829> sources<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.400> meat<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:23.110> all

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
to other other sources of meat and all

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.810 
to other other sources of meat and all
the<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.769> all<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:23.950> ethics<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.310> go<00:02:24.489> with<00:02:24.670> it

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
the and all the ethics that go with it

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.460 
the and all the ethics that go with it
so<00:02:27.060> every<00:02:28.060> shooter<00:02:28.390> has<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:28.630> responsibility

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
so every shooter has a responsibility

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.300 
so every shooter has a responsibility
and<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:34.180> good<00:02:34.420> quality<00:02:34.920> because<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.040> next

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
and is of good quality because the next

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.100 
and is of good quality because the next
generation<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.790> people<00:02:37.030> eat<00:02:37.209> game<00:02:37.420> don't<00:02:37.900> want

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110
