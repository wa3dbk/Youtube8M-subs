00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:03.550
 grandson 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.460
 our 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.340
 Paulo 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.479
 O 

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:11.989
 O 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:15.039
 O 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:19.500
 major changes in personnel it is important to assess the traits of the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.150
 face 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.920
 a personality and even the little contours of each client 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.020
 tenth transformation made by the morning police hairdresser based 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.020
 on the principles of visagism 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.790
 let's see what a more relaxed look and attitude was 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.769
 face mirror and the contour of the face because 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.470
 inner lines of farce 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.740
 Who do you have money for? 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.890
 And what can we do with our hair to appreciate these lines? 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.970
 so you can understand a little if you have a straight line at the rear 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.100
 of the goal 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.190
 tilted chin on the head 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.440
 so it passes a much more dynamic image in the face format that is the 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.420
 external part 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.430
 now the inner part of the goal of the palace in the image a little more romantic 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.430
 and even a little more delicate and this leads to a childishness 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.920
 in the sense of 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.620
 it seems much more nobody 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.070
 so when you stop responding in the lines of your pocket you get very 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.430
 more girls 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.640
 when you draw your hair 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.640
 shows much more of his vision of much more dynamism 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.770
 everything needs to lose 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.110
 with fred greeting 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.960
 you're actually being divided into getting two people half hair 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.190
 half the losses 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.440
 so whats the coolest we can take deco has had three 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.360
 proportions your action just for you to everyone 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.460
 like a very tall person if hair color too short 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.100
 it gets shorter than head 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.990
 who has and does not give the height if it gets more hairy that runs was also 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.440
 disproportionate 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.440
 the golden tones very close to their skin a modest fall 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.730
 so I understand that it proposes a change in coloration 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.700
 when you get a 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.540
 more dark near the skin I predict background to pm predicting more life I do not think 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.709
 have to take the lenses ships for this is a little that country 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.459
 and gives a few more bright months companies 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.010
 but not so much darken or comment to lighten but make them stay 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.519
 more luminous 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.580
 the heart work begins 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.580
 selic reduction teams 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.340
 then comes strong edging the straight sets the marking length 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:43.189
 to give move layers get out of jail if I count on your hair no 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.399
 bachelet to zero degree if had life does not conquer 45 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:48.939
 here it is busy 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.159
 I even stopped teaching higher education 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.049
 and here in the name of his superiors they have cut even higher that way 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.859
 the captain is marked I got a peaked 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.539
 very defined 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:04.759
 but as I'm creating a tilt to the central part the base dollar fall 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:07.979
 and then I get procon public 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.899
 at the time that I'm tall 

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:12.899
 the layers management sequence 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:23.359
 already the left-hand side chosen by the client already create at the time of France 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:26.289
 not that 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:27.909
 at the moment 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.039
 and leaves the girl really there is the camera entered 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:34.039
 I would like to value 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.439
 when we split the wheelchair 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.029
 can you see here? 

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:42.339
 if she stays with the family on that side 

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:45.869
 she gets a very interesting little projection the nose and eyes 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.479
 if she stays with the family for that side 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:53.099
 she gained an ally that the candidate reviewing the proposal is no longer a 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.309
 a little more serious 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:55.689
 as she asked me 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:59.029
 to be with a more relaxed but irreverent image 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:02.029
 so let's work with the fringe to this side 

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:07.529
 to finish inside the most nodded 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.599
 Then came the proposal 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.359
 I lived with the image and nothing. 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.359
 We value it as I said from the beginning of this left side of it. 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.259
 we work 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.470
 if they are being a bit deep and making the nuances gain more 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:27.030
 brightness 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.280
 all the work that was done within the visagism 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.280
 prada and what image behavior 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:38.460
 So 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.659
 we 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.659
 our 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.389
 O 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.090
 O 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.130
 O
