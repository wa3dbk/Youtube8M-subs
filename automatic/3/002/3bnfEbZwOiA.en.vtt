and<00:00:06.210> they've<00:00:06.839> basically<00:00:07.519> identified<00:00:09.200> six<00:00:10.309> new

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
and they've basically identified six new

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.920 
response to coffee and believe it or not
that<00:00:19.170> actually<00:00:19.230> brings<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.070> total<00:00:20.250> number<00:00:20.930> to

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
that actually brings the total number to

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.609 
that actually brings the total number to
eight<00:00:22.289> known<00:00:22.890> genetic<00:00:23.550> variations<00:00:24.619> related

eight known genetic variations related
to<00:00:25.769> coffee<00:00:26.010> intake<00:00:26.930> which<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.080> really

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
to coffee intake which is really

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.759 
to coffee intake which is really
interesting<00:00:28.560> we're<00:00:29.279> changing<00:00:29.789> our<00:00:29.970> code

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
interesting we're changing our code

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.740 
interesting we're changing our code
because<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> coffee<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.460> drink<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.300> what

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
because of the coffee we drink so what

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.069 
because of the coffee we drink so what
does<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:33.960> mean<00:00:34.380> well<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.460> basically

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
does this mean well it basically

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.880 
does this mean well it basically
explains<00:00:37.079> why<00:00:37.770> some<00:00:38.730> people<00:00:39.059> need<00:00:39.930> multiple

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
explains why some people need multiple

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.790 
explains why some people need multiple
cups<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.370> coffee<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.940> get<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.270> buzzy

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
cups of coffee to get that buzzy

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.740 
cups of coffee to get that buzzy
productive<00:00:43.800> feeling<00:00:44.250> while<00:00:45.000> other<00:00:45.239> people

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
productive feeling while other people

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.990 
productive feeling while other people
really<00:00:46.559> don't<00:00:46.829> need<00:00:46.920> any<00:00:47.129> coffee<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.670> get<00:00:47.820> that

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
really don't need any coffee to get that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.090 
really don't need any coffee to get that
feeling<00:00:48.300> or<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.989> few<00:00:49.200> sips<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.649> coffee<00:00:49.860> to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
feeling or just a few sips of coffee to

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.130 
feeling or just a few sips of coffee to
get<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.430> feeling<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.270> basically<00:00:51.750> what<00:00:52.020> we've

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
get that feeling so basically what we've

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.830 
get that feeling so basically what we've
discovered<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.250> some<00:00:53.940> people<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.600> a

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
discovered is that some people have a

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.729 
discovered is that some people have a
genetic<00:00:55.590> predisposition<00:00:57.379> to<00:00:58.379> coffee

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
genetic predisposition to coffee

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.139 
genetic predisposition to coffee
addiction<00:01:00.050> now<00:01:01.050> understand<00:01:01.890> those<00:01:02.640> are<00:01:02.850> my

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
addiction now understand those are my

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.509 
addiction now understand those are my
words<00:01:03.510> ok<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.500> article<00:01:04.890> lays<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.220> out<00:01:05.339> in

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
words ok the article lays it out in

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.090 
words ok the article lays it out in
different<00:01:05.909> language<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:07.140> that's<00:01:07.290> definitely

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
different language but that's definitely

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.520 
different language but that's definitely
what<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.880> got<00:01:09.180> out<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.900> some<00:01:10.140> people

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
what I got out of it that some people

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.800 
what I got out of it that some people
have<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.860> genetic<00:01:11.310> predisposition<00:01:12.090> to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
have this genetic predisposition to

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.940 
have this genetic predisposition to
coffee<00:01:13.020> addiction<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> study<00:01:15.000> involved

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
coffee addiction so the study involved

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.100 
coffee addiction so the study involved
120,000<00:01:16.950> coffee<00:01:17.220> drinkers<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.150> an<00:01:18.720> analysis

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
120,000 coffee drinkers and an analysis

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.060 
120,000 coffee drinkers and an analysis
of<00:01:19.560> 2.5<00:01:20.340> million<00:01:20.939> genetic<00:01:21.900> variations<00:01:22.530> so

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
of 2.5 million genetic variations so

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.219 
of 2.5 million genetic variations so
this<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.369> as<00:01:23.520> thorough<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.330> study<00:01:24.810> as<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.080> can

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
this is as thorough a study as you can

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.179 
this is as thorough a study as you can
possibly<00:01:25.710> get<00:01:26.150> but<00:01:27.290> why<00:01:28.290> are<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:28.680> even<00:01:28.890> talking

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
possibly get but why are we even talking

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.319 
possibly get but why are we even talking
about<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.430> why<00:01:29.579> are<00:01:29.640> we<00:01:29.790> bringing<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.180> up

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
about this why are we bringing it up

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.530 
about this why are we bringing it up
because<00:01:31.200> here's<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.770> takeaway<00:01:32.150> to<00:01:33.150> me<00:01:33.329> this

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
because here's the takeaway to me this

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.569 
because here's the takeaway to me this
has<00:01:33.720> more<00:01:33.990> implications<00:01:34.470> about<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
has more implications about the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.340 
has more implications about the
possibility<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.990> reality

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
possibility that this is the reality

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.270 
possibility that this is the reality
with<00:01:38.189> other<00:01:38.659> drugs<00:01:39.740> you<00:01:40.740> know<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.009> always

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
with other drugs you know you always

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.910 
with other drugs you know you always
heard<00:01:41.610> people<00:01:41.759> say<00:01:41.970> oh<00:01:42.000> yeah<00:01:42.590> alcoholism<00:01:43.590> is

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
heard people say oh yeah alcoholism is

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.280 
heard people say oh yeah alcoholism is
genetic<00:01:44.310> or<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:45.450> know<00:01:45.570> something<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.170> that

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
genetic or you know something to that

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.590 
genetic or you know something to that
effect<00:01:46.590> with<00:01:46.770> addiction<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.909> may<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.240> true

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
effect with addiction that may be true

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.810 
effect with addiction that may be true
that<00:01:48.869> may<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.619> true<00:01:49.920> maybe<00:01:50.130> at<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> time<00:01:50.610> when

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
that may be true maybe at the time when

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.100 
that may be true maybe at the time when
people<00:01:50.850> were<00:01:51.180> saying<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.750> past<00:01:51.960> they

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
people were saying that in the past they

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.450 
people were saying that in the past they
didn't<00:01:52.290> have<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> evidence<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.979> support<00:01:53.130> it

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
didn't have the evidence to support it

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.120 
didn't have the evidence to support it
but<00:01:53.610> we're<00:01:53.790> kind<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.149> working<00:01:54.329> towards<00:01:54.780> that

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
but we're kind of working towards that

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.620 
but we're kind of working towards that
you<00:01:56.130> know<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.759> be<00:01:56.850> clear<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.090> has<00:01:57.450> not

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
you know and to be clear that has not

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.569 
you know and to be clear that has not
been<00:01:57.780> proven<00:01:58.079> okay<00:01:58.770> unless<00:01:59.100> there's<00:01:59.430> some

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
been proven okay unless there's some

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.980 
been proven okay unless there's some
research<00:01:59.880> that<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.149> didn't<00:02:00.479> stumble<00:02:00.840> across

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
research that I didn't stumble across

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.420 
research that I didn't stumble across
and<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.380> didn't<00:02:01.649> see<00:02:01.770> before<00:02:01.890> doing<00:02:02.250> this

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
and I didn't see before doing this

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.300 
and I didn't see before doing this
segment<00:02:02.670> but<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:04.110> wouldn't<00:02:04.469> be<00:02:04.590> surprising<00:02:05.070> if

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
segment but it wouldn't be surprising if

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.580 
segment but it wouldn't be surprising if
that's<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.670> case<00:02:05.850> ok<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.990> look<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.380> leads

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
that's the case ok and look this leads

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.669 
that's the case ok and look this leads
