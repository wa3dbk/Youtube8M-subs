microphone demo you guys are probably
aware<00:00:07.350> can<00:00:07.680> see<00:00:07.799> my<00:00:07.890> other<00:00:07.980> videos<00:00:08.069> that<00:00:08.309> I've

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
been using this little month it's called

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.650 
been using this little month it's called
the<00:00:10.110> CAD<00:00:10.320> 12<00:00:10.730> what<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:11.849> does<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.210> it's<00:00:12.389> it's

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
the CAD 12 what it does is it's it's

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.780 
the CAD 12 what it does is it's it's
just<00:00:12.809> like<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> really<00:00:13.290> cheap<00:00:13.590> Mike<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:14.190> mean

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
just like a really cheap Mike I mean

just like a really cheap Mike I mean
really<00:00:14.820> cheap<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.660> used<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.470> speak<00:00:16.710> into<00:00:16.890> abuse

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
really cheap I used to speak into abuse

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.580 
really cheap I used to speak into abuse
it<00:00:17.550> on<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.789> amp<00:00:18.000> but<00:00:18.810> when<00:00:18.960> use<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.230> on<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.410> amp

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
it on the amp but when use it on the amp

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.070 
it on the amp but when use it on the amp
it<00:00:19.800> really<00:00:20.039> modifies<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.730> tone<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.930> makes

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
it really modifies the tone and it makes

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.009 
it really modifies the tone and it makes
me<00:00:22.170> sound<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.890> lot<00:00:23.100> worse<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.640> say<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.970> least

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
me sound a lot worse to say the least

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.210 
me sound a lot worse to say the least
like<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.439> tone<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.859> get<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
like the the tone that you get in the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.099 
like the the tone that you get in the
recording<00:00:26.670> doesn't<00:00:27.029> sound<00:00:27.269> really<00:00:27.779> anything

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109
