00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.270
 it was President Chávez who initiated the attention during the debate 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.779
 everything comes thanks to the nationalization of the recovery of the city 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.689
 modification of the hydrocarbons law 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.689
 we are talking about social cohesion 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:17.229
 let's start with a presidential cohesion 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.630
 we question all of us together 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.640
 under a new economic model 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.279
 the privatizations auction 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.939
 from a point of view 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.289
 the city is talking about bolivia is not any solution 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.210
 of orders 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.930
 that we make a cohesion presidency something cohesion of presidents 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.970
 based on the new economic model 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.390
 neoliberal things 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.470
 they their way of cooperation 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.930
 a cooperation within the reach of the united states 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.470
 if it is with conditioning 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.130
 which is privatization other privatization companies of the natural suteco 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.429
 dear presidents 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.370
 basic services such as drinking water 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.460
 to sing and adduced the phone the energy can not continue to be of 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.120
 private business 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.280
 can not be in own goal and hands of the private sector 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.180
 the controversy was for aznar 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.890
 active combat against discrimination against marginalization 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.990
 against any glimpse 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.990
 d likewise 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.320
 it can only provoke you regularize and they are red 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.110
 between xerez 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.430
 nowhere 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.740
 from the earth 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.360
 highlights exemptions or risks 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.620
 before 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.690
 our different colors 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.360
 by the way much more attractive 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.740
 as a gender 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.130
 as it is evident 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.690
 'I do' want to say that 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.410
 part one part 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.410
 important ideas 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.860
 change of the world 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.980
 no longer in what affects 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.980
 to economic development and the theories of capital accumulation 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.890
 As always, economic theories have debatable points 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.639
 but there is no doubt 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.539
 that from the point of view of the history of the civilization of 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:14.789
 ideas 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.789
 a lot of the best ideas 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.979
 about the human condition 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.979
 on the rights and dignity of all on equality 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.859
 on the condemnation of absolutism 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.599
 of domination 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.620
 about the word and the right to speak all citizens 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.469
 is it so 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.339
 in ideas that emanate 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:39.649
 of the French Revolution 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:42.269
 in European territory 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.269
 and that is just a historical circumstance 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.919
 up to european marset carlos 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:57.409
 until Carlos Marx the European 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.719
 there reservations 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:01.879
 not enough 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.809
 we must mobilize 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.809
 nationalize by renationalize 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.480
 the production of certain goods or services is that the public sector with 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.159
 the private sector 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.219
 it is not an end 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.219
 does not guarantee anything 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:23.839
 as a theory 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:26.279
 or as an ideological recipe 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:29.639
 but before the intervention is that we have been going 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.639
 the political passion is shaken 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:37.929
 a group of politicians 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:40.929
 I think we should not fall into error 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:44.249
 of minimizing external factors 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:47.109
 because to be 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.120
 won our story and not even the history of doing 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.120
 200 years 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:56.849
 not the most recent history here we are in chile 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.249
 here there was a president elected by the Chilean people 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.369
 as a project 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:07.369
 peaceful democratic 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.879
 you know what I mean but I'm going to name it 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.409
 Salvador Allende 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.249
 it was President Chávez who initiated the attention during the debate 

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:18.370
 I am also responding to an attack 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.329
 of this man 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.609
 of walking around the world 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.250
 saying that I am a danger to latin america 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.860
 I wanted Latin America 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.860
 and that one day in Caracas he visited me 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:32.400
 you know that jose maria aznar 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.379
 I already said it and I repeat that man is a fascist 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:38.620
 the former Aznar president was elected 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.900
 for the Spanish 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.900
 and I demand 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.509
 I demand that respect for a reason besides 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.389
 Well do not shut up 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.389
 now the guard will attack him he had time for that to be so 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.300
 respect here 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.300
 there may be 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.759
 the controversy was for aznar 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:19.999
 Spanish bonus 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.550
 sorry 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.630
 project people who get pontona by zones 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:37.079
 interrupted the intervention when they do not get pension funds 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.439
 today Spain we have an intervention 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:42.770
 I have an intervention on hand 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.919
 so I can not help having another 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.819
 understandable freedom of expression 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:49.849
 it already sounded couple of fact of speaking it does not make sense that he pointed 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:55.360
 st do not get me temple 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.360
 clear that everything 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:02.770
 maybe less than your minute 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.089
 to respond with a phrase 

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:06.960
 of an infinity 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.749
 of an infinite man of this earth 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:11.379
 to the shoemaker president with all
