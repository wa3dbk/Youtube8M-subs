00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
gonna find that at well I think what

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.740 
gonna find that at well I think what
really<00:02:36.100> sets<00:02:36.460> Southwest<00:02:36.880> Airlines<00:02:37.150> apart<00:02:37.510> is

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
really sets Southwest Airlines apart is

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.260 
really sets Southwest Airlines apart is
just<00:02:38.050> how<00:02:38.560> we<00:02:38.620> take<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.670> customer<00:02:40.090> into

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
just how we take the customer into

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.090 
just how we take the customer into
account<00:02:40.569> in<00:02:40.690> everything<00:02:41.110> we<00:02:41.200> do<00:02:41.410> yeah<00:02:41.710> I<00:02:41.740> think

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
account in everything we do yeah I think

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.220 
account in everything we do yeah I think
we<00:02:42.220> just<00:02:42.370> said<00:02:42.640> pretty<00:02:42.880> much<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.480> golden<00:02:44.020> rule

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
we just said pretty much the golden rule

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.650 
we just said pretty much the golden rule
of<00:02:44.260> treating<00:02:44.740> everybody<00:02:45.010> like<00:02:45.490> you<00:02:46.180> like<00:02:46.480> to

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
of treating everybody like you like to

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.300 
of treating everybody like you like to
be<00:02:46.780> treated<00:02:46.990> is

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
be treated is

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.949 
be treated is
the<00:02:48.490> main<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:49.030> main<00:02:49.060> rule<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.630> we<00:02:49.750> like<00:02:49.930> to

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
the main the main rule that we like to

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.170 
the main the main rule that we like to
live<00:02:50.260> by<00:02:50.410> at<00:02:50.530> Southwest<00:02:51.069> and<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.610> think<00:02:52.030> that

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.699 
live by at Southwest and I think that
that<00:02:52.330> goes<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.600> long<00:02:52.840> way<00:02:53.050> we're<00:02:53.410> all<00:02:53.500> in<00:02:53.650> it

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.699 
together and you know one's job is too
important<00:02:57.130> that<00:02:57.700> they<00:02:58.209> can't<00:02:58.450> pick<00:02:59.350> up<00:02:59.470> trash

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
important that they can't pick up trash
