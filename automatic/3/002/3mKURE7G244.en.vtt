Queen and the wizard but it seems like
she<00:03:07.350> did<00:03:07.560> not<00:03:07.650> really<00:03:07.920> like<00:03:08.070> her<00:03:08.310> oh<00:03:08.520> but<00:03:09.120> it

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
she did not really like her oh but it

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.780 
she did not really like her oh but it
looks<00:03:09.420> like<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.630> good<00:03:09.989> rate<00:03:10.200> again<00:03:10.560> um<00:03:10.830> he<00:03:11.250> does

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
looks like a good rate again um he does

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.280 
looks like a good rate again um he does
get<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.120> three<00:03:12.360> started<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.810> does<00:03:12.930> help<00:03:13.170> us

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
get the three started and does help us

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.400 
get the three started and does help us
win<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.620> war<00:03:13.650> we<00:03:14.580> did<00:03:14.760> win<00:03:14.940> by<00:03:15.120> two<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.660> that

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
win the war we did win by two and that

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.840 
win the war we did win by two and that
is<00:03:16.560> probably<00:03:16.739> one<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.220> Rays<00:03:17.370> that<00:03:17.580> helped

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
is probably one of the Rays that helped

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.390 
is probably one of the Rays that helped
out<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.030> lot<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:18.769> again<00:03:19.769> I<00:03:19.799> don't<00:03:19.980> know<00:03:20.130> what<00:03:20.280> to

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
out a lot so again I don't know what to

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.100 
out a lot so again I don't know what to
say<00:03:20.430> about<00:03:20.670> this<00:03:20.820> but<00:03:21.269> lately<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.780> archer

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110

Queens<00:03:22.380> AI<00:03:22.560> has<00:03:22.920> been<00:03:23.100> worse<00:03:23.340> than<00:03:23.580> what<00:03:23.730> they

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
Queens AI has been worse than what they

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.729 
Queens AI has been worse than what they
claimed<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.360> be<00:03:24.480> they<00:03:25.320> did<00:03:25.530> say<00:03:25.709> they

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
claimed it to be they did say they

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.710 
claimed it to be they did say they
improved<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.549> guess<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:27.060> improved<00:03:27.330> by<00:03:27.540> her

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
improved it I guess the improved by her

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.440 
improved it I guess the improved by her
not<00:03:27.959> attacking<00:03:28.440> walls<00:03:28.650> at<00:03:28.830> all<00:03:29.010> but<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:30.209> fact

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
not attacking walls at all but the fact

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.940 
not attacking walls at all but the fact
that<00:03:30.540> she<00:03:30.660> had<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:30.989> walk<00:03:31.140> all<00:03:31.380> through<00:03:31.769> those

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
that she had to walk all through those

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.250 
that she had to walk all through those
defenses<00:03:32.580> could<00:03:32.760> have<00:03:32.850> cost<00:03:33.030> dt<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:34.049> raid

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
defenses could have cost dt the raid

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.960 
defenses could have cost dt the raid
especially<00:03:35.190> those<00:03:35.400> defenses<00:03:35.880> started

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
especially those defenses started

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.090 
especially those defenses started
targeting<00:03:36.360> her<00:03:36.900> instead<00:03:37.350> of<00:03:37.410> anything<00:03:37.920> else

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
targeting her instead of anything else

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.949 
targeting her instead of anything else
