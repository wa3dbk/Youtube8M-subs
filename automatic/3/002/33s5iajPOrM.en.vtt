00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.170
 or 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.500
 here is the third stage 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.550
 the final floor he forgave our bullet 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.350
 of course of course most successfully participate in this 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.720
 here we are hooked as it turned out 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.480
 prizes and here's a catalyst that was 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.750
 on the eve he broke in many many 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.629
 Many of us have a student our plans 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.840
 worked the only thing of course 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.210
 I would like to catch more more Close 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.729
 but Sergei caught 4,200 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.970
 this pike didnâ€™t really reach 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:02.129
 the biggest fish of this one 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.629
 the third stage but still I can 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.370
 I think the result we are satisfied and 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.140
 it so happened this time 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.960
 almost all the fish that went to 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.299
 offset it caught Sergey turned out 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.070
 that let us in syzran there throat me 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.460
 here from Karl to him we do all the same 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.840
 kind of thing could I do too much 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.840
 less is that the test does not go 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.280
 naturally our viewers will 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.800
 be interested in whether there were some top 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.030
 secret why are you planets one by one 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.770
 day i think no secret here 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.250
 First and not catch athlete his id 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.100
 the team today is more fortunate for me right away 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.810
 no more cossacks evgeny commutator 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.290
 tour 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.299
 caught fish so it is pretty and 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.180
 unpredictable we all did right 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.890
 tactics drawn up correctly we did not go 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.050
 far as we see 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.860
 many of the same type from there came from not very 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.770
 good results 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.100
 we caught not far walk kilometers 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.490
 from the start moved on the intended. 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.800
 how you collected your fish i believe that 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.080
 maybe if you were successful to 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.840
 in the clean jumped on this course elevator 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.710
 the owl and the velvet they are great they are taller 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.770
 all praise 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.140
 what this and sneakers and general tournament 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.680
 This quota was given, they will feel it 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.230
 the glyph was also really stronger with 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.950
 the rest of us were butting tight enough 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.720
 in general, our results 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.630
 those who are a little higher are 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.120
 second third fourth place but with 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.630
 this scenario could not have been today 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.569
 get around 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.840
 we turned out so how to get I think 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.180
 that everything went very well 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.780
 complain i think we tell them 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.510
 Well done almost all their chances we 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.310
 used them not so much 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.110
 thank you for getting another bonus here 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.950
 This bitch on 4 200 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.560
 as it turned out that we did not think you 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.810
 thought that bonuses would be bigger than balakovo 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.750
 we thought that they would bring a eight 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.660
 Semerochku well-to-be affected cataclysm 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.790
 yesterday after all he crushed the most 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.500
 interesting and yesterday when that's the whole 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.500
 history of weather pressure 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:31.470
 some were like bites 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.130
 grazing small gnarled things only 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.620
 so weak and so unobtrusive 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.560
 that on the verge of sensations you can say so 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.720
 even more I want to mention this 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.360
 big pike you caught it 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.780
 swam away like dead she didn't do any 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.120
 jerking though hooked over the edge of the lips and gave 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.070
 easy to get yourself a landing net 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.530
 this is what it says about the risotto that fish 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.930
 even on a snapping she was inactive on 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.940
 I felt very bad so I 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.330
 I think that the result that we 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:07.010
 showed good but eat she circled and 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.010
 called so we caught her 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.880
 and
