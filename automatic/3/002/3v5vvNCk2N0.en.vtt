00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 welcome to the channel alinka lps and 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.529
 since quite a long time ago many 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.790
 asked me to make a video review 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.559
 present which was seen in 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.769
 some episodes of our secret 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.360
 I finally decided to do it and not 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.150
 just due to the fact that if requests 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.580
 come to me very often and in very 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.609
 I would like more 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.890
 tell you what are the leaks minus and 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.810
 plus and and you are probably pretty now 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.750
 intrigued and because what generally 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.950
 there may be downsides to the standers however they 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.860
 is there so go well here and on 6 points 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.360
 as we all know standing in the world of lps 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.940
 very popular 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.730
 if so, and sells them very much for big 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.860
 amount and if they exchange something in exchange 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.070
 ask for pretty and rare under sho 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.440
 peaks or a few ordinary poets 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.379
 Well what I want to say I ordered this 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.570
 line on ibei for 900 somewhere rubles 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.949
 not at all expensive for this line 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.620
 considering what 's rare 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.809
 but when she came to me and understood that 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.880
 that it does not fit at all home 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.689
 the heroine of my new series which i 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.299
 I 'll tell you at the end of the video as you see 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.790
 she has such a pretty faded 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.150
 appearance that I do not really smile 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.710
 and so actually some disadvantages in facing 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.080
 it will probably sound now 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.540
 a little silly but if you bought yourself 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.689
 parking for some lps area and 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.460
 more you have no such poets like 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.000
 if spaniels 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.460
 or the same standup then you will have to 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.430
 buy some bearings because 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.880
 100 boxes not very suitable for others 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.520
 to the poets 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.610
 that is what I want to say give me 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.380
 granddaughter and move away put next such 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.600
 here's a cat 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.810
 as you see I can not say at all 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.460
 It is different because we stand points 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.520
 more so natural 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.189
 and this is a pink cat bright and they are quite 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.049
 each other do not fit that is starting 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.250
 would not use them in one 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.890
 tv series or 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.700
 for the series I chose this cat fan 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.140
 characters 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.000
 because someone figure it looks u 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.320
 I have such huge eyes and all of her 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.190
 some pretty little 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.520
 and so with your burn and in general it is still 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.310
 I hope that I understood but the second minus 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.100
 This is something that they often fall off for 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.040
 I have never had such a tail 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.800
 Generally my first pack but some 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.440
 my girlfriends and just friends to me 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.380
 told how they stood off 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.170
 tail so they're pretty sad too 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.300
 history but if you care well 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.459
 her kite stand her everything will be in 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.520
 okay nothing will fall off and the paint will not 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:52.110
 will come off of course if you do not use it 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.450
 in some horror tv series because 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.790
 when you throw poets and pour them 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.130
 red paint they are a little spoiled 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.820
 I must say, well, now let's go to 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.280
 pros now this thing we can take 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.320
 both plus and minus are very 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.080
 stands out against the background of other sho 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.600
 peaks have a very bright appearance and they 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.150
 very beautiful and they have such a shape 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.980
 smooth you can not say permissible 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.620
 bearings from the new collection 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.350
 and as I said, the standup is very very 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.470
 often use vampire serials can 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.820
 say what's worth pretty 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.739
 photogenic 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.140
 because sometimes it happens when we 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.900
 we take some bearings then not 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.910
 it turns out crooked and with risers so not 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.780
 there will be at least frames with photos all 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.640
 equals look great 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.690
 I answer you and now I let you 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.910
 I will tell about the most 100 boxes the remaining points 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.720
 like many other such politicians 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:55.140
 there is a red magnetic magnet what 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:00.840
 it means that there is a carriage and very 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:03.750
 cool this kitty has a blush it 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.700
 hardly noticeable on camera but if so 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.000
 look then this blush is pretty 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.220
 bright eyes 100 boxes shreds 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.410
 brown or yellowish 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.090
 that is, on the edges they are brown in 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.949
 middle yellow 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.720
 everything is like a gel not just we explain 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.570
 Now language is woven because I 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.570
 I really want to sleep I have this video at night 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:28.199
 rented here is what's going on outside our window 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.270
 already almost completely dark well and I think 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.979
 the fact that nothing more interesting can no longer 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.860
 tell about this line 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.900
 so let's we move our own 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.660
 on the series for which I have this line 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.630
 I bought I can start shooting the series 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.240
 right now but with simple shoots 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.419
 or i can shoot lost after two 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.229
 of the month of the nose under the tent world with two 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:54.060
 standing 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:55.530
 and one Kohler and this is quite complicated 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.260
 choice because I would like to quickly 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.560
 start your series but on the other hand 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.940
 I want to experience this cool shoot 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.250
 please write your opinion in 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.760
 comments how should i shoot this 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.669
 series as soon as possible by us simple poets or 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.320
 two months later but you are cool 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.720
 very strange now my thought 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.729
 I formulated I hope that you 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.320

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.750
 bigagashenki in general because many 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.150
 turn off the vision at the moment when 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.460
 I say I hope you enjoyed this video
