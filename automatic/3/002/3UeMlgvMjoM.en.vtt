00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
they've been having a lot of like

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.939 
they've been having a lot of like
business<00:00:51.960> dealings<00:00:52.379> they've<00:00:52.590> been<00:00:52.710> meeting

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
business dealings they've been meeting

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.540 
business dealings they've been meeting
up<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.399> lot<00:00:53.579> THQ<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:55.440> kind<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.920> dire<00:00:56.100> straits

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
up a lot THQ is kind of in dire straits

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.569 
up a lot THQ is kind of in dire straits
Marvel<00:00:57.000> has<00:00:57.149> plenty<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.109> money<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.649> blow<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.309> I

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
Marvel has plenty of money to blow so I

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.740 
Marvel has plenty of money to blow so I
think<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.149> would<00:01:00.210> actually<00:01:00.359> be<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.690> pretty

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
think that it would actually be a pretty

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.410 
think that it would actually be a pretty
good<00:01:01.190> pair<00:01:02.190> up<00:01:02.399> if<00:01:02.730> they<00:01:02.910> were<00:01:02.969> able<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.270> do

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
good pair up if they were able to do

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.939 
good pair up if they were able to do
that<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.750> make<00:01:03.930> video<00:01:04.199> games<00:01:04.229> in<00:01:04.619> house

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
that and make video games in house

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.969 
that and make video games in house
through<00:01:05.339> THQ<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.240> mean<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.530> people<00:01:07.680> who<00:01:07.890> are

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
through THQ I mean the people who are

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.350 
through THQ I mean the people who are
going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.310> playing<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.760> would<00:01:08.939> kind<00:01:09.299> of

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
going to be playing it would kind of

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.969 
going to be playing it would kind of
know<00:01:09.510> what<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.689> expect<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.439> would<00:01:10.530> give<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> lot

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
know what to expect it would give a lot

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.830 
know what to expect it would give a lot
of<00:01:11.040> consistency<00:01:11.850> which<00:01:12.060> would<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.330> good<00:01:12.540> I

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
of consistency which would be good I

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.590 
of consistency which would be good I
think<00:01:13.110> if<00:01:13.229> Marvel<00:01:13.650> knew<00:01:13.830> how<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.250> utilize<00:01:14.850> THQ

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
think if Marvel knew how to utilize THQ

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.810 
think if Marvel knew how to utilize THQ
in<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.990> really<00:01:16.320> good<00:01:16.500> efficient<00:01:17.009> way<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.460> would

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
in a really good efficient way it would

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.850 
in a really good efficient way it would
be<00:01:17.939> totally<00:01:18.390> worth<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.170> remember<00:01:19.710> that

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
be totally worth it and remember that

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.090 
be totally worth it and remember that
Disney<00:01:20.250> owns<00:01:20.280> marvel<00:01:20.900> which<00:01:21.900> if<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.770> panned

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
Disney owns marvel which if this panned

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.420 
Disney owns marvel which if this panned
out<00:01:23.280> would<00:01:23.850> own<00:01:24.119> THQ<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.229> would<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.590> lots<00:01:26.189> of

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
out would own THQ so it would be lots of

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.120 
out would own THQ so it would be lots of
lots<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.360> happening<00:01:28.290> yeah<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.650> think<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
lots of this happening yeah I think that

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.410 
lots of this happening yeah I think that
it<00:01:29.220> would<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.369> good<00:01:29.640> i<00:01:29.700> think<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.210> would

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
it would be good i think that that would

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.210 
it would be good i think that that would
be<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.570> good<00:01:30.810> partnership<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.740> my<00:01:31.890> favorite

be a good partnership so my favorite

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.890 
be a good partnership so my favorite
piece<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.400> news<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:32.970> Namco<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.509> actually

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
piece of news is that Namco is actually

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.410 
piece of news is that Namco is actually
learning<00:01:34.170> from<00:01:34.979> Capcom<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.700> decided<00:01:36.180> that

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
learning from Capcom and decided that

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.050

that<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.799> unlock<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.369> mean<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.970> seems<00:01:42.329> like<00:01:42.420> a

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
that you unlock I mean this seems like a

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.300 
that you unlock I mean this seems like a
no-brainer<00:01:42.750> but<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.619> really<00:01:43.799> not<00:01:44.070> ever

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
no-brainer but it's really not ever

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.830 
no-brainer but it's really not ever
