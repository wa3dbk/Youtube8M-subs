all alloy rims these series are gold
anodized<00:00:36.149> alloy<00:00:36.750> wheels<00:00:37.170> we've<00:00:38.070> got<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.969> two

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
anodized alloy wheels we've got the two

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.310 
anodized alloy wheels we've got the two
different<00:00:39.360> sizes<00:00:39.510> because<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.930> obviously

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
different sizes because you obviously

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.380 
different sizes because you obviously
your<00:00:40.620> front<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.100> your<00:00:41.219> rear<00:00:41.250> are<00:00:42.000> different

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
your front and your rear are different

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.720 
your front and your rear are different
width<00:00:42.539> wheels<00:00:42.809> now<00:00:43.350> these<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.920> width<00:00:44.100> matches

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
width wheels now these the width matches

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.490 
width wheels now these the width matches
the<00:00:44.910> stock<00:00:45.210> wheels<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.079> you'll<00:00:46.199> be<00:00:46.320> able<00:00:46.379> to

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
the stock wheels so you'll be able to

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.170 
the stock wheels so you'll be able to
use<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.770> stock<00:00:46.980> tires<00:00:47.280> or<00:00:47.640> any<00:00:47.820> other<00:00:47.940> tires
