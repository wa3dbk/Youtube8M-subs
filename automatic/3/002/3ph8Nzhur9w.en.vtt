the cube but outside the sphere refer to
this<00:00:33.989> example<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.680> apply<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.040> following

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
this example and apply the following

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.509 
this example and apply the following
steps<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.059> your<00:00:36.270> own<00:00:36.420> geometry<00:00:37.190> since<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.429> are

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519 
steps to your own geometry since we are

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:40.819 
steps to your own geometry since we are
making<00:00:38.730> an<00:00:38.969> unstructured<00:00:39.390> block<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.559> first

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
making an unstructured block the first

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.069 
making an unstructured block the first
step<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.489> click<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:41.820> unstructured<00:00:42.449> on<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
step is to click on unstructured on the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.119 
step is to click on unstructured on the
toolbar<00:00:44.000> before<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.030> create<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.570> block<00:00:46.129> notice

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
be picking domains to make a block let's

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.079 
be picking domains to make a block let's
turn<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.629> domains<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:56.249> that<00:00:56.429> we<00:00:56.550> are<00:00:56.670> only<00:00:56.879> able

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
turn on domains so that we are only able

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.200 
turn on domains so that we are only able
to<00:00:57.449> select<00:00:57.989> domains<00:00:58.440> now<00:00:59.429> we<00:00:59.489> need<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.969> create

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
to select domains now we need to create

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.110 
to select domains now we need to create
a<00:01:00.359> special<00:01:00.870> block<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:02.219> assemble<00:01:02.820> blocks

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
a special block the assemble blocks

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.140 
a special block the assemble blocks
command<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.230> toolbar<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:05.610> be<00:01:05.730> used<00:01:05.970> to

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
command on the toolbar can be used to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.090 
command on the toolbar can be used to
quickly<00:01:06.360> generate<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:07.020> block<00:01:07.380> if<00:01:07.650> there<00:01:07.950> is

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
quickly generate a block if there is

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.940 
quickly generate a block if there is
only<00:01:08.370> a<00:01:08.520> single<00:01:08.850> face<00:01:09.270> but<00:01:10.200> because<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:10.770> have

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
only a single face but because we have

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.770 
only a single face but because we have
more<00:01:11.220> than<00:01:11.280> one<00:01:11.579> face<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.119> our<00:01:12.210> block<00:01:12.509> a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
more than one face in our block a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.319 
more than one face in our block a
special<00:01:13.380> block<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.770> required<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:15.090> go<00:01:15.270> to

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
special block is required so go to

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
create assemble special block we need to

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.190 
create assemble special block we need to
start<00:01:20.579> by<00:01:20.729> creating<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.210> first<00:01:21.509> face<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
start by creating the first face of the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.469 
start by creating the first face of the
block<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:23.130> first<00:01:23.369> phase<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.969> this<00:01:24.090> kind<00:01:24.360> of

six Green domains notice that after I
select<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.289> first<00:01:34.469> domain<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
select the first domain that the

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.399 
select the first domain that the
boundaries<00:01:36.149> of<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.390> domain<00:01:36.689> are<00:01:36.840> highlighted

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
boundaries of the domain are highlighted

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.889 
boundaries of the domain are highlighted
in<00:01:37.500> orange<00:01:37.789> when<00:01:38.789> I<00:01:38.820> select<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.450> second

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
in orange when I select the second

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.139 
in orange when I select the second
domain<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.920> highlighting<00:01:41.430> moves<00:01:41.670> outward

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
domain the highlighting moves outward

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.270 
domain the highlighting moves outward
from<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.719> selected<00:01:43.140> domains<00:01:43.500> boundaries<00:01:44.070> and

from the selected domains boundaries and
so<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.270> when<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.479> select<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.079> third<00:01:46.289> domain

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
so on when I select the third domain

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.520 
so on when I select the third domain
this<00:01:47.909> means<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.450> face<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.899> still<00:01:49.079> open

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
this means that the face is still open

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.039 
this means that the face is still open
the<00:01:49.979> face<00:01:50.219> becomes<00:01:50.490> closed<00:01:51.119> when<00:01:51.450> all<00:01:51.630> orange

the face becomes closed when all orange

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.770 
the face becomes closed when all orange

an easier way of selecting the domains

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.200 
an easier way of selecting the domains
of<00:02:04.320> your<00:02:04.439> face<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:05.039> to<00:02:05.369> select<00:02:05.729> one<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.030> the
