00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
think that this was 1399 so that'll just

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.520 
think that this was 1399 so that'll just
be<00:01:38.850> something<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.630> know<00:01:39.780> special<00:01:40.080> that<00:01:40.410> will

be something you know special that will
have<00:01:40.740> will<00:01:40.950> probably<00:01:41.370> actually<00:01:41.550> have<00:01:41.820> this

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060

were two of them I think for like 3 99
maybe<00:02:00.480> something<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.080> that<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.980> this<00:02:02.820> would

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
maybe something like that so this would

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.670 
maybe something like that so this would
be<00:02:03.000> something<00:02:03.270> easy<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.780> for<00:02:04.200> me<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.380> make<00:02:04.530> for

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
good and then this is another thing that

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.380

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.170 
was another thing that he saw and he
thought<00:02:27.069> it<00:02:27.219> just<00:02:27.310> looked<00:02:27.430> interesting<00:02:28.000> we've

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
thought it just looked interesting we've

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.849 
thought it just looked interesting we've
never<00:02:28.329> had<00:02:28.540> chicken<00:02:28.930> breakfast<00:02:29.319> sausage<00:02:29.680> and

as you can see it was only 299 which was

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.170 
as you can see it was only 299 which was
a<00:02:31.989> pretty<00:02:32.230> good<00:02:32.319> price<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:33.370> we<00:02:33.700> got<00:02:33.879> some<00:02:34.090> of

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
a pretty good price so we got some of

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.899 
a pretty good price so we got some of
that<00:02:34.299> to<00:02:34.540> try<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:35.230> was<00:02:36.099> completely<00:02:36.459> out<00:02:36.670> of

ground beef so I picked up some of the
organic<00:02:39.219> ground<00:02:39.519> beef<00:02:39.819> that<00:02:40.269> they<00:02:40.450> had<00:02:40.659> and<00:02:40.930> it

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
organic ground beef that they had and it

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.589 
organic ground beef that they had and it
is<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.200> little<00:02:41.439> bit<00:02:41.590> more<00:02:41.769> expensive<00:02:42.010> than

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
is a little bit more expensive than

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.879 
is a little bit more expensive than
costco<00:02:43.599> or<00:02:43.989> aldi<00:02:44.379> where<00:02:44.530> i<00:02:44.560> can<00:02:44.680> get<00:02:44.739> it<00:02:44.859> for

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
costco or aldi where i can get it for

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.849 
costco or aldi where i can get it for
699<00:02:45.489> but<00:02:45.879> that's<00:02:46.420> only<00:02:46.599> 50<00:02:47.260> sounds<00:02:47.500> different

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
699 but that's only 50 sounds different

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.830 
699 but that's only 50 sounds different
so<00:02:48.010> it's<00:02:48.159> not<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.370> big<00:02:48.459> deal<00:02:48.579> in<00:02:48.879> weight<00:02:49.329> is<00:02:49.689> that

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
so it's not a big deal in weight is that

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.909 
so it's not a big deal in weight is that

strawberry they also have one that has
coconut<00:05:42.160> I<00:05:42.370> think<00:05:42.640> it's<00:05:42.760> Apple<00:05:43.090> coconut<00:05:43.419> but<00:05:43.990> i

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
coconut I think it's Apple coconut but i

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.600 
coconut I think it's Apple coconut but i
don't<00:05:44.260> really<00:05:44.350> like<00:05:44.500> coconut<00:05:45.130> so<00:05:45.340> i<00:05:45.370> just

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
don't really like coconut so i just

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.909 
don't really like coconut so i just
decided<00:05:45.730> to<00:05:46.120> try<00:05:46.300> these<00:05:46.360> two<00:05:46.780> and<00:05:47.050> the<00:05:47.680> really

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
decided to try these two and the really

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.409 
decided to try these two and the really
cool<00:05:48.040> thing<00:05:48.220> about<00:05:48.340> these<00:05:48.580> is<00:05:48.640> they<00:05:49.390> are

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
cool thing about these is they are

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.150 
cool thing about these is they are
literally<00:05:50.020> just<00:05:50.200> two<00:05:50.410> ingredients<00:05:50.560> it's

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
literally just two ingredients it's

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.530 
literally just two ingredients it's
apple<00:05:51.520> and<00:05:51.640> strawberry<00:05:51.700> and<00:05:52.150> apple<00:05:52.419> and

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
apple and strawberry and apple and

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.360 
apple and strawberry and apple and
banana<00:05:52.780> so<00:05:53.530> i<00:05:53.560> think<00:05:53.680> that<00:05:53.919> that<00:05:54.010> is

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
banana so i think that that is

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.680 
banana so i think that that is
everything<00:05:54.820> i'm<00:05:54.940> looking<00:05:55.240> to<00:05:55.360> make<00:05:55.510> sure<00:05:55.660> I

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
everything i'm looking to make sure I

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.000 
everything i'm looking to make sure I
didn't<00:05:55.900> forget<00:05:55.930> anything<00:05:56.260> and<00:05:56.590> I<00:05:56.710> think<00:05:56.919> that

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
didn't forget anything and I think that

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.320 
didn't forget anything and I think that
that<00:05:57.040> covers<00:05:57.430> everything<00:05:57.700> that<00:05:57.970> I<00:05:58.030> got<00:05:58.210> at

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330
