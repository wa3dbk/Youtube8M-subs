trend has continued but the world has

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.460 
trend has continued but the world has
evolved<00:00:30.000> over<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.269> last<00:00:30.330> 25<00:00:30.960> years<00:00:30.990> and

evolved over the last 25 years and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.600 
evolved over the last 25 years and
definitely<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> lighting<00:00:32.160> industry<00:00:32.399> in

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
definitely the lighting industry in

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.520 
definitely the lighting industry in
particular<00:00:33.020> one<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> things<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.440> course

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
particular one of the things of course

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.410 
particular one of the things of course
which<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.829> come<00:00:35.040> into<00:00:35.250> play<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.790> use<00:00:36.180> of

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
which is come into play is the use of

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.520 
which is come into play is the use of
LED<00:00:36.989> technology<00:00:37.399> so<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> variety<00:00:39.000> of

Whelan has done with this particular

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.690 
Whelan has done with this particular
product<00:01:18.570> are<00:01:18.840> two<00:01:19.259> things<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:20.220> they<00:01:20.400> have

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
product are two things one they have

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.080 
product are two things one they have
reduced<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.189> size<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.670> unit<00:01:23.909> I'm<00:01:24.000> going

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
reduced the size of the unit I'm going

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.550 
reduced the size of the unit I'm going
to<00:01:24.180> create<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.390> step<00:01:24.630> behind<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.140> counter

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
to create a step behind this counter

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.499 
to create a step behind this counter
here<00:01:25.710> I'm<00:01:25.770> gonna<00:01:25.860> take<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.040> quick<00:01:26.189> look<00:01:26.430> as<00:01:26.759> you

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
here I'm gonna take a quick look as you

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.830 
here I'm gonna take a quick look as you
can<00:01:27.720> see<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.920> reduced<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.909> depth<00:01:30.600> of

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
can see they have reduced the depth of

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.359 
can see they have reduced the depth of
the<00:01:30.960> unit<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.409> what<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.530> mean<00:01:31.740> by<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.250> this

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
the unit and what I mean by that is this

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.880 
the unit and what I mean by that is this
with<00:01:32.820> all<00:01:33.090> LED<00:01:33.600> products<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.500> heat

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
with all LED products you have heat

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.399 
with all LED products you have heat
generation<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:36.600> fact<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.380> very

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
generation and in fact it's a very

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.170

important<00:01:38.189> factor<00:01:38.549> when<00:01:38.729> you're<00:01:38.909> choosing

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
important factor when you're choosing

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.170 
important factor when you're choosing
LED<00:01:39.810> product<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.890> make<00:01:41.070> sure<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
LED product is to make sure that the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.940 
LED product is to make sure that the
heat<00:01:42.390> generation<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.259> occurs<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
heat generation that occurs with the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.300 
heat generation that occurs with the
diode<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:45.079> truly<00:01:46.079> dissipated<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.860> proper

holding in my hand here from Whelan

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.050 
holding in my hand here from Whelan
there's<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.570> very<00:01:52.110> serious<00:01:52.530> heatsink<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
there's a very serious heatsink on the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.999 
there's a very serious heatsink on the
back<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.479> unit<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.899> fact<00:01:55.110> obviously<00:01:55.770> you

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
back of this unit in fact obviously you

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.190 
back of this unit in fact obviously you
can't<00:01:56.219> tell<00:01:56.640> looking<00:01:57.060> at<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> screen<00:01:57.570> but<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
can't tell looking at the screen but the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.810 
can't tell looking at the screen but the
unit<00:01:58.500> has<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> certain<00:01:59.189> amount<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.549> weight<00:01:59.790> in

course on the website to give you size
dimension<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.200> weight<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.159> forth<00:02:05.430> but

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
dimension and weight and so forth but

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.150 
dimension and weight and so forth but
again<00:02:06.270> heatsink<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.290> important<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:07.890> Whelan

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
again heatsink is important and Whelan

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.410 
again heatsink is important and Whelan
has<00:02:08.280> definitely<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> really<00:02:09.000> nice<00:02:09.179> job

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
has definitely and a really nice job

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.240 
has definitely and a really nice job
with<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.750> unit<00:02:10.080> another<00:02:10.619> thing<00:02:10.770> too<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.129> I'm

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
with this unit another thing too is I'm

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.860 
with this unit another thing too is I'm
going<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.400> turn<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.730> sideways<00:02:12.030> here

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
going to turn it sideways here

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.960 
going to turn it sideways here
or<00:02:13.140> point<00:02:13.409> towards<00:02:13.680> camera<00:02:13.860> two<00:02:14.159> you<00:02:14.670> can<00:02:14.940> see

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
or point towards camera two you can see

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.589 
or point towards camera two you can see
here<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.620> width<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.879> unit<00:02:17.909> really

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
here that the width of the unit really

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.630 
here that the width of the unit really
is<00:02:18.840> nice<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.200> tight<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:19.709> it's<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.340> nice

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
is nice and tight so it's a nice

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.600 
is nice and tight so it's a nice
sandwich<00:02:21.269> if<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.900> can<00:02:22.049> use<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.409> word<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:23.040> a

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
sandwich if I can use that word of a

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.309 
sandwich if I can use that word of a
light<00:02:23.819> so<00:02:24.330> when<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.599> mount<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.019> on<00:02:25.290> the

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
light so when you mount this on the

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.500 
light so when you mount this on the
bodywork<00:02:25.830> you're<00:02:26.580> going<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.849> have<00:02:27.030> very

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
bodywork you're going to have very

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.270 
bodywork you're going to have very
little<00:02:27.720> protrusion<00:02:28.379> of<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.560> light<00:02:28.890> itself

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
little protrusion of the light itself

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.250 
little protrusion of the light itself
another<00:02:30.000> thing<00:02:30.150> too<00:02:30.360> about<00:02:30.599> this<00:02:30.840> will<00:02:31.049> swing

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
another thing too about this will swing

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.869 
another thing too about this will swing
it<00:02:31.379> this<00:02:31.440> way<00:02:31.620> here<00:02:31.829> you<00:02:31.860> can<00:02:32.069> see<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.430> diodes

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
it this way here you can see the diodes

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.660 
it this way here you can see the diodes
in<00:02:33.209> here<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:33.720> these<00:02:34.440> diodes<00:02:34.980> have<00:02:35.220> been<00:02:35.400> set

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
in here and these diodes have been set

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.430 
in here and these diodes have been set
up<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:35.940> such<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.209> way<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:37.019> they<00:02:37.140> will<00:02:37.230> project

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
up in such a way that they will project

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.580 
up in such a way that they will project
the<00:02:37.829> light<00:02:38.010> downwards<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:38.970> out<00:02:39.329> so<00:02:40.019> the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
the light downwards and out so the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.080 
the light downwards and out so the
objective<00:02:41.069> being<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.549> if<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.700> was<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.909> hold

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
objective being that if I was to hold

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.630 
objective being that if I was to hold
this<00:02:42.209> light<00:02:42.480> directly<00:02:42.989> at<00:02:43.409> you<00:02:43.829> it<00:02:44.310> wouldn't

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
this light directly at you it wouldn't

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.339 
this light directly at you it wouldn't
be<00:02:44.790> so<00:02:45.000> much<00:02:45.060> you're<00:02:45.359> getting<00:02:45.480> head-on<00:02:46.319> view

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
be so much you're getting head-on view

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.990 
be so much you're getting head-on view
because<00:02:46.950> with<00:02:47.099> scene<00:02:47.310> lighting<00:02:47.700> it's

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
because with scene lighting it's

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.670 
because with scene lighting it's
designed<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.480> be<00:02:48.599> mounted<00:02:48.989> up<00:02:49.109> in<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.500> air

and you will see how bright this gets in

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.229 
and you will see how bright this gets in
the<00:03:41.849> studio<00:03:44.180> okay<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.780> is<00:03:46.349> so<00:03:46.799> bright<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:48.060> can

I'm going to now point this correctly up
at<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:55.949> camera<00:03:56.389> and<00:03:57.389> we're<00:03:57.840> probably<00:03:57.959> gonna

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
at the camera and we're probably gonna

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.809 
at the camera and we're probably gonna
lose<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.530> in<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.620> second<00:03:58.919> but<00:03:59.010> there<00:03:59.160> we<00:03:59.250> go<00:03:59.370> you

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
lose it in a second but there we go you
