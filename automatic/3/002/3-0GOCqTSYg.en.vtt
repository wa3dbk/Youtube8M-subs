grow<00:02:53.280> an<00:02:53.400> angle<00:02:53.790> there's<00:02:54.510> like<00:02:54.690> one<00:02:54.959> of<00:02:55.080> those

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
grow an angle there's like one of those

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.600 
grow an angle there's like one of those
manufacturer<00:02:56.220> lying<00:02:59.180> type<00:03:00.180> of<00:03:00.390> Papes<00:03:01.020> so<00:03:01.739> if

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
manufacturer lying type of Papes so if

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.220 
manufacturer lying type of Papes so if
that<00:03:02.790> doesn't<00:03:03.120> have<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:03.900> means<00:03:04.050> it's

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
that doesn't have that that means it's

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.729 
that doesn't have that that means it's
not<00:03:04.380> sealed<00:03:04.860> correctly<00:03:06.200> it's<00:03:07.200> probably<00:03:07.680> a

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
not sealed correctly it's probably a

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.330 
not sealed correctly it's probably a
fake<00:03:08.989> nothing<00:03:09.989> I<00:03:10.080> look<00:03:10.290> for<00:03:10.560> also<00:03:10.770> is<00:03:11.010> the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
fake nothing I look for also is the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.510 
fake nothing I look for also is the
integrity<00:03:11.820> of<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.360> tape<00:03:12.600> in<00:03:12.840> general<00:03:13.430> if<00:03:14.430> you

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
integrity of the tape in general if you

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.380 
integrity of the tape in general if you
look<00:03:14.550> at<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.910> edge<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.959> can<00:03:16.620> tell<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.390> these

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
look at the edge you can tell that these

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.670 
look at the edge you can tell that these
particular<00:03:19.140> ones<00:03:19.350> are<00:03:19.709> sealed<00:03:20.220> perfectly

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
particular ones are sealed perfectly

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.870 
particular ones are sealed perfectly
although<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.890> has<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.430> know<00:03:23.459> there's<00:03:23.670> they've

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
although it has you know there's they've

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.220 
although it has you know there's they've
been<00:03:24.000> stored<00:03:24.299> really<00:03:24.540> well<00:03:24.690> this<00:03:24.930> one<00:03:25.080> has<00:03:25.200> a

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
been stored really well this one has a

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.860 
been stored really well this one has a
slight<00:03:25.620> lift<00:03:25.980> but<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:27.030> can't<00:03:27.299> occur<00:03:27.420> because

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
slight lift but that can't occur because

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.229 
slight lift but that can't occur because
of<00:03:28.170> storage<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.890> just<00:03:29.250> handling<00:03:29.730> over<00:03:30.000> time

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
of storage and just handling over time

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.289 
of storage and just handling over time
but<00:03:31.049> these<00:03:31.170> are<00:03:31.410> just<00:03:31.860> beautiful<00:03:32.120> starters<00:03:33.120> so

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
but these are just beautiful starters so

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.470 
but these are just beautiful starters so
they're<00:03:33.510> acquired<00:03:33.900> by<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.260> private<00:03:34.799> collector

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
they're acquired by a private collector

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.130 
they're acquired by a private collector
and<00:03:36.590> they<00:03:37.590> are<00:03:37.830> most<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.790> these<00:03:38.880> are<00:03:39.030> sold<00:03:39.390> and

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
and they are most of these are sold and

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.539 
and they are most of these are sold and
will<00:03:40.590> be<00:03:40.709> shipped<00:03:40.980> out<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.780> our<00:03:42.780> friend<00:03:43.549> who

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
will be shipped out to our friend who

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.750 
will be shipped out to our friend who
purchased<00:03:44.910> them<00:03:45.620> so<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:47.160> other<00:03:47.310> difference

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
purchased them so the other difference

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.370 
purchased them so the other difference
is<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:48.000> Alpha<00:03:48.420> starter<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:48.840> don't<00:03:49.049> have<00:03:49.170> one

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
is the Alpha starter I don't have one

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.810 
is the Alpha starter I don't have one
with<00:03:49.500> me<00:03:49.739> today<00:03:50.390> but<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.600> Alpha<00:03:51.930> starter<00:03:52.410> is

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
with me today but the Alpha starter is

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.490 
with me today but the Alpha starter is
actually<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:54.510> serial<00:03:54.989> number<00:03:55.290> is

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
actually the serial number is

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.270 
actually the serial number is
non-existent<00:03:56.280> it's<00:03:56.519> blank<00:03:58.010> so<00:03:59.010> that's

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
non-existent it's blank so that's

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.050 
non-existent it's blank so that's
another<00:03:59.519> distinguish<00:04:00.500> part<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:01.620> it<00:04:01.940> of<00:04:02.940> the

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
another distinguish part of it of the

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.319 
another distinguish part of it of the
earlier<00:04:03.570> sets<00:04:04.070> so<00:04:05.070> in<00:04:05.820> our<00:04:05.880> next<00:04:06.030> segment

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
earlier sets so in our next segment

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.060 
earlier sets so in our next segment
we're<00:04:06.720> gonna<00:04:06.810> talk<00:04:07.140> about<00:04:07.320> we're<00:04:07.890> actually

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
we're gonna talk about we're actually

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.560 
we're gonna talk about we're actually
gonna<00:04:08.280> open<00:04:08.549> one<00:04:08.700> of<00:04:08.790> these<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:08.970> see<00:04:09.360> what<00:04:09.480> we

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
gonna open one of these and see what we

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.520 
gonna open one of these and see what we
get

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
get

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.270 
get
pardon<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.370> camera<00:04:12.150> situation<00:04:12.959> but<00:04:13.650> when<00:04:14.190> we

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
pardon the camera situation but when we

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.009 
pardon the camera situation but when we
opened<00:04:14.640> these<00:04:14.730> let's<00:04:15.000> see<00:04:15.360> if<00:04:15.450> we<00:04:15.600> you<00:04:15.959> know

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
opened these let's see if we you know

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.530 
opened these let's see if we you know
we're<00:04:16.109> gonna<00:04:16.200> open<00:04:16.320> one<00:04:16.680> today<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.340> if<00:04:18.239> we<00:04:18.390> get

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
we're gonna open one today and if we get

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.270 
we're gonna open one today and if we get
lucky<00:04:18.720> we'll<00:04:19.109> get<00:04:19.229> one<00:04:19.380> of<00:04:19.410> these<00:04:19.530> power<00:04:19.919> 9

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
lucky we'll get one of these power 9

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.260 
lucky we'll get one of these power 9
cards<00:04:21.049> there<00:04:22.049> should<00:04:22.289> be<00:04:22.320> three<00:04:22.470> rares<00:04:23.160> out<00:04:23.640> of

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
cards there should be three rares out of

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.600 
cards there should be three rares out of
the<00:04:26.270> beta<00:04:26.990> set<00:04:27.320> I<00:04:27.530> believe<00:04:27.650> there's<00:04:28.250> three

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
the beta set I believe there's three

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.480 
the beta set I believe there's three
hundred<00:04:28.880> and<00:04:29.030> seven<00:04:29.600> cars<00:04:29.840> or<00:04:30.020> eight<00:04:30.110> carts

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
hundred and seven cars or eight carts

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.740 
hundred and seven cars or eight carts
and<00:04:31.490> then<00:04:31.639> there's<00:04:31.880> like<00:04:32.030> a<00:04:32.090> hundred<00:04:32.330> and

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
and then there's like a hundred and

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.129 
and then there's like a hundred and
nineteen<00:04:33.110> rares<00:04:33.380> and<00:04:33.560> whatnot<00:04:34.160> so<00:04:34.930> you<00:04:35.930> get

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
nineteen rares and whatnot so you get

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.460 
nineteen rares and whatnot so you get
ten<00:04:36.740> starter<00:04:37.340> decks<00:04:37.550> per<00:04:38.510> starter<00:04:38.960> deck<00:04:39.200> box

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
ten starter decks per starter deck box

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:47.409 
ten starter decks per starter deck box
and<00:04:42.070> you<00:04:43.070> basically<00:04:43.310> will<00:04:44.260> have<00:04:45.260> a<00:04:45.980> a<00:04:46.400> bonus<00:04:47.300> a

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
and you basically will have a a bonus a

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.540 
and you basically will have a a bonus a
third<00:04:47.690> chance<00:04:48.080> about<00:04:48.440> less<00:04:49.130> a<00:04:49.160> little<00:04:49.430> bit

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
third chance about less a little bit

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.610 
third chance about less a little bit
less<00:04:49.700> than<00:04:49.820> a<00:04:49.910> third<00:04:50.150> almost<00:04:50.840> a<00:04:51.020> fourth<00:04:51.350> chance

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
less than a third almost a fourth chance

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.580 
less than a third almost a fourth chance
of<00:04:51.889> getting<00:04:52.250> a<00:04:52.430> Black<00:04:53.090> Lotus<00:04:53.389> but<00:04:54.290> this<00:04:54.410> one's

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
of getting a Black Lotus but this one's

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.360 
of getting a Black Lotus but this one's
an<00:04:54.710> alpha<00:04:55.100> also<00:04:55.880> some<00:04:56.570> of<00:04:57.410> these<00:04:57.650> are<00:04:57.979> actually

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
an alpha also some of these are actually

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.520 
an alpha also some of these are actually
some<00:05:01.370> of<00:05:01.400> these<00:05:01.490> decks<00:05:01.790> may<00:05:02.150> also<00:05:02.330> be<00:05:02.960> alpha

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
some of these decks may also be alpha

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.120 
some of these decks may also be alpha
cards<00:05:03.860> so<00:05:04.669> there<00:05:04.820> could<00:05:04.970> be<00:05:05.000> a<00:05:05.120> possibility<00:05:06.130> so

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
cards so there could be a possibility so

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.650 
cards so there could be a possibility so
let's<00:05:07.310> see<00:05:07.400> what<00:05:07.520> we<00:05:07.610> get<00:05:07.760> and<00:05:08.000> thanks<00:05:08.510> for

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660
