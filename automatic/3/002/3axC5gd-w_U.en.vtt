00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
fact that it straightened so quickly uh

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.249 
fact that it straightened so quickly uh
it<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.399> very<00:01:59.729> high<00:02:00.030> heat<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.689> there's<00:02:01.020> no

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
it is a very high heat and there's no

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.260 
it is a very high heat and there's no
heat<00:02:01.530> setting<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:02.040> this<00:02:02.280> which<00:02:02.909> some<00:02:03.149> people

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
heat setting on this which some people

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.940 
heat setting on this which some people
may<00:02:03.600> not<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.079> doesn't<00:02:04.530> bother<00:02:04.740> me

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
may not like it doesn't bother me

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.130 
may not like it doesn't bother me
because<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.430> probably<00:02:05.759> would<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.270> put<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.630> on

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
because I probably would have put it on

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.410 
because I probably would have put it on
highest<00:02:07.560> heat<00:02:07.770> setting<00:02:08.160> anyway<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:09.330> because

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
highest heat setting anyway just because

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.330 
highest heat setting anyway just because
that<00:02:09.780> way<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.170> only<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.979> go<00:02:11.130> over<00:02:11.310> your

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
that way you only have to go over your

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.059 
that way you only have to go over your
hair<00:02:11.610> once<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:14.090> not<00:02:15.090> three<00:02:15.360> or<00:02:15.480> four<00:02:15.660> times

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
hair once and not three or four times

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.670 
hair once and not three or four times
now<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.550> don't<00:02:17.850> wash<00:02:18.060> my<00:02:18.300> hair<00:02:18.569> every<00:02:19.050> day<00:02:19.080> so<00:02:19.650> I

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
now I don't wash my hair every day so I

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.800 
now I don't wash my hair every day so I
don't<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.700> know<00:02:20.760> every<00:02:21.000> time<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.240> wash<00:02:21.420> my<00:02:21.660> hair

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
don't you know every time I wash my hair

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.120 
don't you know every time I wash my hair
I<00:02:21.870> generally<00:02:22.350> straighten<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.860> which<00:02:22.980> is

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
I generally straighten it which is

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.350 
I generally straighten it which is
usually<00:02:23.520> about<00:02:23.670> three<00:02:23.790> times<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.390> week<00:02:26.360> the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
usually about three times a week the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.930 
usually about three times a week the
other<00:02:27.480> thing<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.990> i<00:02:28.380> like<00:02:28.680> when<00:02:29.520> i<00:02:29.550> use<00:02:29.790> this

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
other thing that i like when i use this

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.910 
other thing that i like when i use this
straightener<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:30.900> seems<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.530> my<00:02:31.680> hair

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
straightener is it seems that my hair

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.400 
straightener is it seems that my hair
stays<00:02:32.550> straighter<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.660> know<00:02:33.780> on<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.230> days

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
stays straighter you know on the days

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.059 
stays straighter you know on the days
and<00:02:34.650> i<00:02:34.709> don't<00:02:34.920> wash<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:36.470> like<00:02:37.470> i<00:02:37.590> said<00:02:37.650> i<00:02:37.830> have

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
and i don't wash it like i said i have

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.030 
and i don't wash it like i said i have
really<00:02:38.340> fine<00:02:38.700> naturally<00:02:39.660> curly<00:02:40.020> hair<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:40.410> any

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
really fine naturally curly hair and any

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.430 
really fine naturally curly hair and any
type<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.340> humidity<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.239> usually<00:02:42.959> makes<00:02:43.110> it

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
type of humidity it usually makes it

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.610 
type of humidity it usually makes it
curl<00:02:43.890> up<00:02:43.920> again<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.780> i<00:02:45.780> notice<00:02:46.080> with<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:46.350> one

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.449 
curl up again and i notice with this one
i<00:02:46.830> don't<00:02:47.640> know<00:02:47.760> why<00:02:47.910> but<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:49.320> generally<00:02:49.709> stays

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
i don't know why but it generally stays

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.550 
i don't know why but it generally stays
fairly<00:02:50.850> straight<00:02:51.360> on<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.959> days<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.140> i<00:02:52.380> don't

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
fairly straight on the days that i don't

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.190 
fairly straight on the days that i don't
wash<00:02:52.709> it<00:02:52.739> so<00:02:53.550> that's<00:02:54.330> just<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.780> little<00:02:55.019> add-on

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
wash it so that's just a little add-on

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.259 
wash it so that's just a little add-on
to<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.650> other<00:02:55.860> video<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.700> know<00:02:56.820> I<00:02:56.850> realized

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
to the other video you know I realized

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.150 
to the other video you know I realized
after<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.660> fact<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:58.019> I<00:02:58.140> said<00:02:58.709> I<00:02:58.739> liked<00:02:59.010> it

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
after the fact that I said I liked it

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.140 
after the fact that I said I liked it
but<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.340> didn't<00:02:59.610> really<00:02:59.640> say<00:03:00.000> why<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:01.430> yes<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.700> if

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
but I didn't really say why and yes I if

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.300 
but I didn't really say why and yes I if
you<00:03:03.600> if<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.140> can<00:03:04.290> afford<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.830> it's<00:03:05.100> an

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
you if you can afford it it's an

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.539 
you if you can afford it it's an
investment<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:07.100> I<00:03:08.209> really<00:03:09.209> like<00:03:09.390> this<00:03:09.600> but

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
investment and I really like this but

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.630 
investment and I really like this but

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140
