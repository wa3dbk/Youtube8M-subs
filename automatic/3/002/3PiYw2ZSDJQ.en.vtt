00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
attracted to and basically I wanted to

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.960 
attracted to and basically I wanted to
talk<00:03:22.690> about<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.320> notion<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.010> pining<00:03:24.760> for<00:03:24.940> a

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
talk about the notion of pining for a

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.270 
talk about the notion of pining for a
woman<00:03:25.239> because<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:26.350> think<00:03:26.980> it's<00:03:27.070> fair<00:03:27.220> to

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
woman because I think it's fair to

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.890 
woman because I think it's fair to
assume<00:03:27.459> that<00:03:27.730> we've<00:03:28.000> all<00:03:28.180> been<00:03:28.420> there<00:03:28.450> there's

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900

people that are attractive I mean it

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.470 
people that are attractive I mean it
sounds<00:04:10.510> kind<00:04:10.780> of<00:04:10.810> repetitive<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:11.890> do<00:04:12.400> but<00:04:13.269> I

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
sounds kind of repetitive and do but I

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.539 
sounds kind of repetitive and do but I
think<00:04:13.780> it's<00:04:13.900> important<00:04:14.320> to<00:04:14.380> to<00:04:14.799> be<00:04:14.980> realistic

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
you want and that's just how it is it's

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.550 
you want and that's just how it is it's
a<00:04:29.979> little<00:04:30.069> unfair<00:04:30.330> but<00:04:31.330> it's<00:04:31.780> how<00:04:31.960> life<00:04:32.020> works

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
a little unfair but it's how life works

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.320 
a little unfair but it's how life works
I<00:04:32.860> mean<00:04:33.009> like<00:04:33.190> if<00:04:33.370> you're<00:04:33.520> you're<00:04:33.970> smart

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
you're going to succeed in in situations

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.029 
you're going to succeed in in situations
where<00:04:36.849> intelligence<00:04:37.210> matters<00:04:38.050> and<00:04:38.470> I<00:04:38.919> think

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
where intelligence matters and I think

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.580 
where intelligence matters and I think
in<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.280> same<00:04:39.400> applies<00:04:39.759> for<00:04:40.199> being<00:04:41.199> attracted

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
in the same applies for being attracted

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.839 
in the same applies for being attracted
to<00:04:41.620> somebody<00:04:41.770> else<00:04:41.979> if<00:04:42.130> you're<00:04:42.280> attractive

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
to somebody else if you're attractive

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.999 
to somebody else if you're attractive
it's<00:04:43.060> going<00:04:43.180> to<00:04:43.210> be<00:04:43.360> much<00:04:44.229> easier<00:04:44.500> for<00:04:44.770> you<00:04:44.919> to

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
it's going to be much easier for you to

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.550 
it's going to be much easier for you to
find<00:04:45.069> somebody<00:04:45.720> but<00:04:46.720> of<00:04:46.840> course<00:04:46.870> you<00:04:47.319> have<00:04:47.440> to

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
find somebody but of course you have to

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.589 
find somebody but of course you have to
be<00:04:47.650> realistic<00:04:47.979> with<00:04:48.340> how<00:04:48.970> attractive<00:04:49.449> you<00:04:49.479> are

be realistic with how attractive you are

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.150 
be realistic with how attractive you are
as<00:04:49.750> a<00:04:49.810> person<00:04:49.870> if<00:04:50.289> you<00:04:50.440> if<00:04:50.710> you're<00:04:50.860> just<00:04:51.009> a

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
as a person if you if you're just a

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.189 
as a person if you if you're just a
normal<00:04:51.400> Joe<00:04:51.789> I'm<00:04:52.479> not<00:04:52.630> saying<00:04:52.840> you're<00:04:52.990> like

think<00:04:56.710> arises<00:04:57.310> with<00:04:57.460> this<00:04:57.639> whole<00:04:57.849> notion<00:04:58.090> of

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
think arises with this whole notion of

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.749 
think arises with this whole notion of

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
my brain could understand why she was so

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.129 
my brain could understand why she was so
nervous<00:06:50.790> like<00:06:51.060> she<00:06:51.210> was<00:06:51.360> saying<00:06:51.510> really<00:06:51.810> weird

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
things and it didn't occur to me because

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.640 
things and it didn't occur to me because
my<00:06:56.070> mind<00:06:56.250> has<00:06:56.430> been<00:06:56.550> so<00:06:56.729> centered<00:06:57.180> around

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
my mind has been so centered around

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.990 
my mind has been so centered around
getting<00:06:58.650> my<00:06:58.770> life<00:06:59.040> to<00:06:59.400> where<00:06:59.550> it<00:06:59.639> needs<00:06:59.699> to<00:06:59.910> be

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
getting my life to where it needs to be

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.879 
getting my life to where it needs to be
ie<00:07:00.770> work<00:07:01.770> and<00:07:02.720> you<00:07:03.720> know<00:07:03.750> money<00:07:04.050> situations<00:07:04.710> so

ie work and you know money situations so

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:06.409 
ie work and you know money situations so
