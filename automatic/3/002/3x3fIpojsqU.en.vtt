00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.610
 the market for windows 8 tablets is starting 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.620
 finally a little bit of steam 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.360
 and there is now a reasonable range of windows 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.740
 8 and rt tablet in different 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.969
 price categories 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.560
 many of which were the first modern 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.630
 quite expensive but luckily come now 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.300
 also some cheaper models 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.380
 ec for example w510 new ones already reviewed 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.060
 we found that okay 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.369
 but it plagued by many buks 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.390
 and asus now comes with this vivotab 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.210
 smart 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.669
 10.1 inches inside as 8 and atom cpu and 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.669
 a price tag of 499 euros 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.250
 please hold it ad smart then 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.010
 stands out immediately 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.660
 why this tablet costs 499 euros and 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.329
 why other tablet with similar 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.039
 hardwell can cost 900 euros 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.730
 housing is not the same 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.960
 level 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.059
 it is made of a matte black 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.409
 plastic and looks neat but 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.549
 well to say that it is very very sturdy 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.010
 to the touch 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:03.629
 no that's not the back which is 14 if you 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.909
 put a bit of pressure and hear ours 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.229
 you even crack a little 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.360
 he would n't fall apart 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.009
 while you use it but for 500 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.930
 euro really expects something better 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.740
 build quality and have enough tablet in it 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.860
 this price range 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.539
 that are firmly assembled in the housing 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.670
 fortunately feels nice in one 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.740
 tablet light with a weight of 576 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.390
 gram also great in the hand and a little further 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.429
 What stands out is that he leaves on late through one 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.420
 micro usb port and that is for phones 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:29.520
 of course very normal 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.050
 but with 10 inch tablet we often see that 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.819
 very large plugs 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.590
 So the advantage is that you use the tablet 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.509
 can easily charge as the original 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.310
 charger or that you quickly get one 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.619
 micro usb charger someone else can borrow 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.360
 you can also use that micro-usb port 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.979
 to connect things like 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.970
 an external drive or a keyboard 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.349
 a mouse 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.209
 but then you do need a gradient cable 

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:50.670
 and that delivers asus 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.349
 not many other manufacturers 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.119
 for example agree there either who do that 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:55.709
 well and as far as we are concerned such a thing is allowed 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.479
 gradient with every tablet actually 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.250
 standard in the box are different 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.590
 you just have very little to such 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.300
 small usb port the easiest way 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.440
 to get files on that smart 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.450
 maybe via the micro 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.429
 sd card reader though you still have 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.080
 a separate card reader with computer required 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.080
 for that little memory card 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.540
 luckily enough on that vivotab 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.879
 smart because he it 64 i go 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.290
 storage capacity that just is n't nearly 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.879
 all available to the user 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.560
 because windows has it all 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.629
 with the recovery partition that is kind 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.120
 business et cetera therefore ultimately remains 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.799
 about 30 lie about but still with 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.599
 30 most people have to 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.209
 can really cope 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.189
 the atom uses 2760 processes that are used here 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.989
 is more than fast enough for the 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:46.840
 windows 8 interface and the new windows 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.400
 8 apps run smoothly but if you like 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.810
 switches back to the classic desktop 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.239
 then you notice a lot of atom processor 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.470
 is not really powerhouse 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.700
 so in theory you can do thousands 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.530
 existing minus programs and joop 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.060
 but in practice it is 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.470
 better to spend as much time as possible in the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.450
 new windows 8 interface through 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.459
 for the malawian programs 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.810
 they don't run very fast and are 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.349
 of course not made for operation 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.349
 with a touchscreen 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.239
 the screen is of the level that we 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.980
 expect with a tablet like this he 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.410
 has good viewing angles excellent brightness 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.669
 white balance is pretty good and what 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.680
 just to emphasize but for the is 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:22.359
 the high contrast white is therefore nicely clear 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.609
 but at the same time the screen can 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.840
 still show deep black 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.970
 the color yes production that is not 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.739
 completely true to nature but that is with 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.599
 almost all tablets in this price range 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.040
 would stand and we can not be so heavy 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.540
 to 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.609
 asus does not have much software 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.620
 Done in an exciting way , some apps are alive 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.750
 but real added value no that offer 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.909
 she not she is blond streaming the music 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.190
 app mettre and your name is weird 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.780
 set vibe from center but yes that is 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.489
 actually superfluous because you also have xbox 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.650
 music built in and also turns on 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.690
 music streaming which was handy 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.729
 is an app that is simply churned and 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.290
 pretty detailed explains how the 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:58.239
 soft interface inside 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.979
 each other and that has been met for people 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.840
 and twenty eight certainly worked 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:03.430
 no unnecessary luxury 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.720
 in the field of battery life horn 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.940
 vivotab smart it in proportion to 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.680
 others windows tablets don't really do much 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.560
 tender it compared to for example 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.359
 the ecb 15 goes those 45 minutes less 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.209
 long in browsing gets one 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:18.099
 windows rt-tablet that score considerably better 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.780
 with the film tests and with each other 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:21.760
 difference is a lot smaller 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.740
 you can film continuously for almost eight hours 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.950
 see if that smart's battery runs out 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.950
 is 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.910
 we are happy that we now have something 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.520
 cheaper windows 8 tablet 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.110
 because we think they are 800 to 900 euros 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.090
 really not worth it 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.650
 you notice to that smart or that vivotab 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.730
 made real concessions at this price point 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.440
 must become 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.910
 the screen is also a but 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.900
 not excellent, the same goes for it 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.510
 the battery life 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.100
 the speed and build quality now 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.290
 compare with other windows 8 and also 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.630
 windows rt-tablet does the vivotab smart 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.160
 it's not bad but really isn't 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.160
 where this tablet excels
