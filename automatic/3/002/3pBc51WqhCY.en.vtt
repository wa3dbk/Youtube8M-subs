from<00:02:28.430> anything<00:02:28.670> I've<00:02:28.880> seen<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.600> can<00:02:29.720> attack

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959

in three directions left center and
right<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:32.209> is<00:02:32.360> because<00:02:32.630> enemy<00:02:32.959> defenses<00:02:33.380> can

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
right this is because enemy defenses can

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.740 
right this is because enemy defenses can
also<00:02:33.739> be<00:02:34.010> actively<00:02:34.430> set<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:35.090> left<00:02:35.360> center<00:02:35.720> or

also be actively set to left center or

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.360 
also be actively set to left center or
right<00:02:35.959> you<00:02:36.410> will<00:02:36.590> want<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.769> attack<00:02:37.040> enemies

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
right you will want to attack enemies

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.130 
right you will want to attack enemies
where<00:02:37.580> their<00:02:37.730> defense<00:02:37.970> is<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.239> lowest<00:02:38.600> during

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
where their defense is the lowest during

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.420 
where their defense is the lowest during
a<00:02:39.200> battle<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.590> enemy<00:02:39.860> may<00:02:39.980> switch<00:02:40.220> their

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
a battle the enemy may switch their

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.979

throwing in gore and sexuality and an

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.820 
throwing in gore and sexuality and an
attempt<00:04:47.780> to<00:04:47.810> make<00:04:48.020> the<00:04:48.140> game<00:04:48.320> appeal<00:04:48.620> to<00:04:48.740> an

older audience feels forced and

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.180 
older audience feels forced and
unnecessary<00:04:50.900> I<00:04:51.169> understand<00:04:51.620> why<00:04:51.710> they<00:04:51.860> did<00:04:51.890> it

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
unnecessary I understand why they did it

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.740 
unnecessary I understand why they did it
but<00:04:52.430> I<00:04:52.669> personally<00:04:52.970> don't<00:04:53.150> think<00:04:53.330> they<00:04:53.539> added

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
but I personally don't think they added

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.060 
but I personally don't think they added
anything<00:04:54.169> to<00:04:54.289> the<00:04:54.470> game<00:04:54.620> and<00:04:54.919> they<00:04:54.979> were

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
anything to the game and they were

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.380 
anything to the game and they were
actually<00:04:55.340> more<00:04:55.460> off-putting<00:04:55.700> than<00:04:56.150> anything

game without spending money but the

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.300 
game without spending money but the
combat<00:05:06.229> alone<00:05:06.440> makes<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:06.740> game<00:05:06.890> worth<00:05:07.039> a<00:05:07.100> try

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
combat alone makes the game worth a try

combat alone makes the game worth a try
and<00:05:07.550> if<00:05:07.940> interesting<00:05:08.390> combat<00:05:08.780> isn't<00:05:08.930> really
