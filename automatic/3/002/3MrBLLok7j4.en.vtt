for about five minutes we were in a bit
of<00:00:50.010> Darkness<00:00:50.460> when<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.090> landed<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989

brownouts the wave offs that the other
helicopters<00:00:54.510> kind<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.809> made<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> little<00:00:55.500> bit<00:00:55.590> of

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
helicopters kind of made a little bit of

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.560 
helicopters kind of made a little bit of
chaos<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.219> because<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.210> soldiers

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
chaos but because of the the soldiers

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.779 
chaos but because of the the soldiers
training<00:00:57.899> they<00:00:58.559> actually<00:00:59.070> got<00:00:59.219> into<00:00:59.489> all<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
training they actually got into all the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.400 
training they actually got into all the
positions<00:01:00.210> as<00:01:00.359> planned<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.199> worked<00:01:01.350> out

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
positions as planned so it worked out

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.480 
positions as planned so it worked out
quite<00:01:01.469> effectively

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.490 
quite effectively

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.030 
quite effectively
they<00:01:04.000> were<00:01:04.060> very<00:01:04.330> tactical<00:01:04.960> and<00:01:05.350> we<00:01:05.680> heard<00:01:05.890> him

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
they were very tactical and we heard him

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.440 
they were very tactical and we heard him
for<00:01:06.190> about<00:01:06.340> ten<00:01:06.580> minutes<00:01:06.730> but<00:01:07.120> we<00:01:07.180> didn't<00:01:07.390> know

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
for about ten minutes but we didn't know

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.170 
for about ten minutes but we didn't know
when<00:01:07.630> they<00:01:07.750> were<00:01:07.780> arriving<00:01:08.170> and<00:01:09.030> heart<00:01:10.030> rates

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
when they were arriving and heart rates

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.720 
when they were arriving and heart rates
were<00:01:10.360> rising<00:01:10.570> people<00:01:11.470> were<00:01:11.590> getting<00:01:12.190> excited

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
were rising people were getting excited

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:15.730 
as a role player I tried very hard to

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.320 
as a role player I tried very hard to
pretend<00:01:16.390> that<00:01:16.510> I<00:01:16.630> was<00:01:16.930> in<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:18.220> role<00:01:18.460> of<00:01:18.490> an<00:01:18.760> HVT

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
the element of surprise and aggression

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.150 
the element of surprise and aggression
was<00:01:22.060> probably<00:01:22.900> the<00:01:23.110> most<00:01:23.290> scariest<00:01:23.650> part<00:01:24.010> of

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
was probably the most scariest part of

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.190 
was probably the most scariest part of
it<00:01:24.340> because<00:01:24.700> they<00:01:24.910> came<00:01:25.120> in<00:01:25.330> they<00:01:25.600> were<00:01:25.630> get

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
establishing where we were and then

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.770 
establishing where we were and then

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
actual assault so that we could conduct

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.090 
actual assault so that we could conduct
risky<00:01:49.180> operation<00:01:49.600> but<00:01:49.750> it<00:01:50.470> went<00:01:50.680> smoothly

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
risky operation but it went smoothly

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.490 
risky operation but it went smoothly
we<00:01:51.640> had<00:01:51.760> secured<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.630> high-value<00:01:52.900> target<00:01:53.440> in

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
we had secured the high-value target in

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.050 
we had secured the high-value target in
a<00:01:53.560> very<00:01:54.100> very<00:01:54.340> quick<00:01:54.460> amount<00:01:54.640> of<00:01:54.760> time<00:01:54.820> which

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
a very very quick amount of time which

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.670 
a very very quick amount of time which
is<00:01:55.210> our<00:01:55.330> primary<00:01:55.630> goal<00:01:55.810> and<00:01:56.170> then<00:01:56.440> we<00:01:56.619> were

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
is our primary goal and then we were

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.130 
is our primary goal and then we were
able<00:01:56.800> to<00:01:57.000> get<00:01:58.000> a<00:01:58.030> grip<00:01:58.270> of<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.900> high-value

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
able to get a grip of the high-value

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.540 
able to get a grip of the high-value
target<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.650> get<00:01:59.740> them<00:01:59.890> to<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.190> extraction

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
target and get them to the extraction

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.980 
target and get them to the extraction
point<00:02:00.820> and<00:02:00.850> get<00:02:01.000> them<00:02:01.119> on<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.330> helicopter<00:02:01.930> and

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
point and get them on the helicopter and

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.820 
point and get them on the helicopter and
get<00:02:02.140> them<00:02:02.260> out<00:02:02.350> of<00:02:02.380> there<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.810> best<00:02:05.260> part

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
get them out of there the best part

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.529 
get them out of there the best part
about<00:02:05.860> that<00:02:06.190> whole<00:02:06.369> scenario<00:02:06.520> is<00:02:06.910> that<00:02:06.940> three

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
about that whole scenario is that three

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.630 
about that whole scenario is that three
RCR<00:02:07.960> trains<00:02:08.649> for<00:02:08.860> flexibility<00:02:09.429> and<00:02:09.520> that's

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
RCR trains for flexibility and that's

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.790 
RCR trains for flexibility and that's
actually<00:02:10.060> what<00:02:10.270> happened<00:02:10.539> once<00:02:11.470> we<00:02:11.590> got<00:02:11.680> on

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
actually what happened once we got on

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.320 
actually what happened once we got on
the<00:02:11.860> ground<00:02:11.890> we<00:02:12.580> weren't<00:02:12.760> in<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:12.940> positions

we<00:02:13.480> were<00:02:13.600> supposed<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.930> be<00:02:14.050> in<00:02:14.080> but<00:02:14.290> because<00:02:14.560> of

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
we were supposed to be in but because of

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.280 
we were supposed to be in but because of
the<00:02:14.890> soldiers<00:02:15.250> individual<00:02:16.170> flexibility<00:02:17.170> and

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
the soldiers individual flexibility and

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
initiative they were able to get to and

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.100

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
secure their sectors of fire quickly we

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.140 
secure their sectors of fire quickly we
expected<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.170> have<00:02:23.320> both<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.500> half<00:02:24.160> hour<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.730> 45
