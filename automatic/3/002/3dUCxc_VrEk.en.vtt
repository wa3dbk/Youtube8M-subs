something that I didn't really catch

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:04.910 
something that I didn't really catch
when<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.140> initially

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
when I initially

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.010 
when I initially
you<00:02:04.979> tit<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.970> how<00:02:06.210> similar<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.960> to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
you tit and that is how similar it is to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.710 
you tit and that is how similar it is to
make<00:02:07.799> up<00:02:07.979> geeks<00:02:08.220> Vegas<00:02:08.819> lights<00:02:09.090> palette<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.599> on

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.130 
to take a quick sec to open them up
really<00:02:11.790> show<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.150> side<00:02:12.420> by<00:02:12.630> side<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.110> you

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
really show you a side by side so you

can see you know if you if you're

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.760 
can see you know if you if you're
pulling<00:02:15.300> from<00:02:15.450> memory<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.200> both<00:02:16.410> are<00:02:16.650> very

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
pulling from memory the both are very

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.300 
pulling from memory the both are very
warm<00:02:17.220> tone<00:02:17.550> gold<00:02:18.090> themed<00:02:18.989> palace<00:02:19.680> obviously

warm tone gold themed palace obviously

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.070 
warm tone gold themed palace obviously
but<00:02:20.580> side<00:02:20.970> by<00:02:21.120> side<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.660> see<00:02:21.690> there<00:02:22.050> are

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
but side by side you can see there are

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.590 
but side by side you can see there are
very<00:02:22.500> distinct<00:02:22.890> differences<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:24.180> specific

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
very distinct differences the specific

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.300 
very distinct differences the specific
question<00:02:24.930> was<00:02:25.110> can<00:02:25.440> you<00:02:25.500> recreate<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.280> look

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
question was can you recreate the look

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.949 
question was can you recreate the look
that<00:02:26.489> I<00:02:26.730> had<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.270> review<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.930> I

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
that I had in that review and that I

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.380 
that I had in that review and that I
later<00:02:28.230> did<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.440> tutorial<00:02:28.620> on<00:02:29.040> using<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.819> Vegas

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
later did a tutorial on using the Vegas

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.660 
later did a tutorial on using the Vegas
lights<00:02:30.630> palette<00:02:31.050> no<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.739> don't<00:02:32.160> think<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.459> can

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
lights palette no I don't think you can

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.509 
lights palette no I don't think you can
I<00:02:32.940> try<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.300> do<00:02:33.750> as<00:02:34.080> best<00:02:34.650> as<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:34.950> could<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
I try to do as best as I could in the

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.100 
I try to do as best as I could in the
look<00:02:35.670> I'm<00:02:35.790> wearing<00:02:36.030> today<00:02:36.060> using<00:02:36.690> only<00:02:36.870> the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
look I'm wearing today using only the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.900 
look I'm wearing today using only the
vaguest<00:02:37.230> lights<00:02:37.620> palette<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.580> have<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.880> say

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
vaguest lights palette and I have to say

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.210 
vaguest lights palette and I have to say
that<00:02:39.030> these<00:02:39.300> are<00:02:39.569> overwhelmingly<00:02:40.319> warmer<00:02:41.040> and

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
that these are overwhelmingly warmer and

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.650 
that these are overwhelmingly warmer and
as<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.370> result<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.880> think<00:02:42.060> they<00:02:42.180> might<00:02:42.360> flatter

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
as a result I think they might flatter

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.830 
as a result I think they might flatter
less<00:02:43.500> skin<00:02:44.160> tones<00:02:44.430> than<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.060> unzip<00:02:45.420> gold<00:02:45.660> if

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
less skin tones than the unzip gold if

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.479 
less skin tones than the unzip gold if
you<00:02:45.930> love<00:02:46.230> gold<00:02:46.470> shadows<00:02:46.890> but<00:02:47.040> are<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.190> little

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
you love gold shadows but are a little

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.520 
you love gold shadows but are a little
too<00:02:47.760> worried<00:02:48.090> about<00:02:48.330> getting<00:02:48.690> them<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.319> lean

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
too worried about getting them that lean

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.229 
too worried about getting them that lean
way<00:02:49.980> too<00:02:50.040> warm<00:02:50.489> for<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.940> like<00:02:51.090> your

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
way too warm for you you like your

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.390 
way too warm for you you like your
cooler<00:02:51.569> neutral<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.290> would<00:02:52.769> stick<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.220> the

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
cooler neutral I would stick to the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.110 
cooler neutral I would stick to the
lorac<00:02:53.790> unzipped<00:02:54.000> gold<00:02:54.959> but<00:02:55.769> this<00:02:56.670> palette

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
lorac unzipped gold but this palette

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.509 
lorac unzipped gold but this palette
definitely<00:02:57.690> rather<00:02:58.080> than<00:02:58.290> having<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:58.890> kind

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
definitely rather than having this kind

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.789 
definitely rather than having this kind
of<00:02:59.670> peachy<00:03:00.120> pink<00:03:00.390> with<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.780> gold<00:03:01.049> shimmer<00:03:01.260> you

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
of peachy pink with a gold shimmer you

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.530 
of peachy pink with a gold shimmer you
get<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:01.980> straight-up<00:03:02.280> orange<00:03:02.910> with<00:03:03.209> a<00:03:03.239> gold

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
get a straight-up orange with a gold

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.479 
get a straight-up orange with a gold
shipper<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:03.989> then<00:03:04.290> this<00:03:04.470> yellow<00:03:04.860> gold<00:03:05.160> and

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
shipper and then this yellow gold and

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.250 
shipper and then this yellow gold and
then<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.610> gorgeous<00:03:06.030> maroon<00:03:06.390> shade<00:03:06.630> here<00:03:06.959> so

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
then a gorgeous maroon shade here so

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.319 
then a gorgeous maroon shade here so
both<00:03:07.799> palettes<00:03:08.250> have<00:03:08.430> their<00:03:08.640> merits<00:03:08.850> but<00:03:09.180> to

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
both palettes have their merits but to

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.240 
both palettes have their merits but to
answer<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.720> particular<00:03:09.870> question<00:03:10.220> no<00:03:11.220> I

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
answer that particular question no I

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.530 
answer that particular question no I
don't<00:03:11.579> think<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.760> can<00:03:11.880> recreate<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.510> look

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
don't think you can recreate the look

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.410 
don't think you can recreate the look
that<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.900> specifically<00:03:13.500> created<00:03:13.829> or<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:15.060> don't

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
that I specifically created or I don't

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.509 
that I specifically created or I don't
think<00:03:15.570> there<00:03:15.780> are<00:03:15.810> any<00:03:16.079> duplicate<00:03:16.799> duplicates

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
think there are any duplicate duplicates

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.640 
think there are any duplicate duplicates
but<00:03:17.910> between<00:03:18.239> these<00:03:18.540> two<00:03:18.690> pallets<00:03:19.109> but<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.470> was

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
but between these two pallets but it was

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.050 
but between these two pallets but it was
something<00:03:19.859> I<00:03:20.040> wanted<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.310> point<00:03:20.489> out<00:03:20.670> because

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
something I wanted to point out because

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.199 
something I wanted to point out because
they<00:03:21.450> are<00:03:21.630> very<00:03:21.769> similar<00:03:22.769> in<00:03:22.980> theme<00:03:23.519> next<00:03:24.090> up

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
they are very similar in theme next up

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.759 
they are very similar in theme next up
is<00:03:24.390> not<00:03:24.600> so<00:03:24.750> much<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:24.959> question<00:03:24.989> but<00:03:25.410> actually<00:03:25.709> a

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
is not so much a question but actually a

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.610 
is not so much a question but actually a
comment<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.340> someone<00:03:26.730> left<00:03:26.970> on<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.810> review

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620

that<00:03:38.370> really<00:03:38.640> does<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.090> two<00:03:39.269> in<00:03:39.420> one<00:03:39.600> because

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
that really does the two in one because

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.630 
that really does the two in one because
in<00:03:40.140> this<00:03:40.500> review<00:03:40.709> video<00:03:41.070> I<00:03:41.130> mentioned<00:03:41.310> that

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
in this review video I mentioned that

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.670 
in this review video I mentioned that
once<00:03:41.880> you<00:03:42.030> use<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.540> fibers<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.200> mascara

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
once you use the fibers and the mascara

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.080 
once you use the fibers and the mascara
back<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.130> forth<00:03:44.310> back<00:03:44.579> and<00:03:44.609> forth<00:03:44.790> like

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
back and forth back and forth like

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.300 
back and forth back and forth like
you're<00:03:45.239> supposed<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:46.200> fibers<00:03:46.380> get<00:03:47.040> it's

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
you're supposed to the fibers get it's

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.800 
you're supposed to the fibers get it's
inevitable<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.819> they<00:03:48.030> will<00:03:48.209> get<00:03:48.420> into<00:03:48.630> your

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
inevitable that they will get into your

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.780 
inevitable that they will get into your
mascara<00:03:49.230> formula<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:49.920> so<00:03:50.040> if<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.459> want<00:03:50.700> to

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
mascara formula and so if you want to

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.880 
mascara formula and so if you want to
ever<00:03:51.000> use<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:51.450> alone<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.380> have<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.590> formula

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
ever use this alone you have a formula

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.009 
ever use this alone you have a formula
that<00:03:53.040> naturally<00:03:53.819> extends<00:03:54.390> if<00:03:54.480> you<00:03:54.569> don't<00:03:54.810> want

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
that naturally extends if you don't want

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.539 
that naturally extends if you don't want
to<00:03:55.140> go<00:03:55.260> through<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.530> three-step<00:03:56.250> process

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
to go through the three-step process

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.550 
to go through the three-step process
someone<00:03:57.540> then<00:03:57.690> brought<00:03:57.930> up<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.290> fact<00:03:58.319> that

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
someone then brought up the fact that

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.500 
someone then brought up the fact that
there<00:03:58.799> is<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:59.250> false<00:03:59.519> fiber<00:03:59.760> mascara<00:04:00.000> with

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
there is this false fiber mascara with

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.720 
there is this false fiber mascara with
those<00:04:00.630> fibers<00:04:01.079> already<00:04:01.530> inside<00:04:02.010> much<00:04:02.519> like

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
those fibers already inside much like

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:03.979 
those fibers already inside much like
you<00:04:02.850> get<00:04:03.030> when<00:04:03.150> you<00:04:03.239> buy<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.450> two<00:04:03.720> together

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
you get when you buy the two together

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.080 
you get when you buy the two together
and<00:04:04.380> I<00:04:04.680> totally<00:04:04.980> forgot<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.639> have<00:04:05.850> tried

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
and I totally forgot that I have tried

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.610 
and I totally forgot that I have tried
this<00:04:06.150> and<00:04:06.420> actually<00:04:06.600> really<00:04:07.139> really<00:04:07.290> like

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
this and actually really really like

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.080 
this and actually really really like
this<00:04:07.650> mascara

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
this mascara

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.660 
this mascara
and<00:04:09.180> what<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:09.900> ultimately<00:04:10.470> concluded<00:04:10.980> in<00:04:11.310> this

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
and what I ultimately concluded in this

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.059 
and what I ultimately concluded in this
this<00:04:12.120> extensions<00:04:12.780> video<00:04:13.050> is<00:04:13.260> that<00:04:13.440> I<00:04:13.620> love<00:04:13.950> the

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
this extensions video is that I love the

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.440 
this extensions video is that I love the
effect<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.489> gave<00:04:14.610> my<00:04:14.790> lashes<00:04:15.090> but<00:04:15.390> I

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
effect it gave my lashes but I

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.199 
effect it gave my lashes but I
personally<00:04:15.870> found<00:04:16.139> it<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.440> be<00:04:16.470> more

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
personally found it to be more

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.099 
personally found it to be more
volumizing<00:04:18.209> than<00:04:18.389> lengthening<00:04:18.930> which

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
volumizing than lengthening which

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.420 
volumizing than lengthening which
lengthening<00:04:19.680> is<00:04:19.799> really<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.100> claim<00:04:20.400> that

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
lengthening is really the claim that

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.150 
lengthening is really the claim that
they<00:04:20.970> made<00:04:21.419> with<00:04:21.600> this<00:04:21.810> this<00:04:22.680> however<00:04:22.919> the

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
they made with this this however the

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.070 
they made with this this however the
l'oreal<00:04:23.520> mascara<00:04:23.970> i<00:04:24.150> found<00:04:24.540> was<00:04:24.720> way<00:04:25.050> more

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
l'oreal mascara i found was way more

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.110 
l'oreal mascara i found was way more
lengthening<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:26.040> fibers<00:04:26.400> are<00:04:26.550> a<00:04:26.580> lot<00:04:26.790> thinner

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
lengthening the fibers are a lot thinner

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.000 
lengthening the fibers are a lot thinner
a<00:04:27.360> lot<00:04:27.600> shorter<00:04:28.080> they're<00:04:28.229> just<00:04:28.380> more<00:04:28.530> subtle

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
a lot shorter they're just more subtle

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.909 
a lot shorter they're just more subtle
overall<00:04:29.430> and<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:30.389> wands<00:04:30.840> themselves<00:04:31.770> are

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
overall and the wands themselves are

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.980 
overall and the wands themselves are
very<00:04:32.100> different<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.850> physicians<00:04:33.330> formula<00:04:33.600> is

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
very different the physicians formula is

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.439 
very different the physicians formula is
thicker<00:04:34.350> curved<00:04:34.919> has<00:04:35.520> more<00:04:35.760> dense<00:04:35.970> fibers

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
thicker curved has more dense fibers

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
pallets together they are very very

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.969 
pallets together they are very very
similar<00:05:33.930> so<00:05:33.960> it<00:05:34.229> was<00:05:34.380> kind<00:05:34.590> of<00:05:34.650> an<00:05:34.770> interesting

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
similar so it was kind of an interesting

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
comparison to draw and so I thought I'd

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:38.990 
comparison to draw and so I thought I'd
just<00:05:37.320> talk<00:05:37.680> about<00:05:37.950> it<00:05:38.099> here<00:05:38.400> just<00:05:38.789> to<00:05:38.849> cut

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
just talk about it here just to cut

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.820 
just talk about it here just to cut
right<00:05:39.120> to<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:39.300> chase<00:05:39.389> no<00:05:40.080> I<00:05:40.110> don't<00:05:40.560> think<00:05:40.620> the

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
right to the chase no I don't think the

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.200 
right to the chase no I don't think the
two<00:05:41.070> are<00:05:41.099> similar<00:05:41.610> I<00:05:41.639> think<00:05:41.700> you<00:05:41.910> can<00:05:42.060> have

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
two are similar I think you can have

here however i think the formulas are
very<00:06:15.120> different<00:06:15.389> i<00:06:15.690> personally<00:06:15.990> actually

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
very different i personally actually

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.080 
very different i personally actually
like<00:06:16.800> the<00:06:16.979> covergirl<00:06:17.370> quads<00:06:17.820> formula

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
like the covergirl quads formula

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.840 
like the covergirl quads formula
that's<00:06:19.360> not<00:06:19.510> to<00:06:19.600> say<00:06:19.750> that<00:06:19.780> the<00:06:19.960> bhcosmetics

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
that's not to say that the bhcosmetics

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
that's not to say that the bhcosmetics
formulation<00:06:21.850> is<00:06:22.000> bad<00:06:22.240> at<00:06:22.419> all<00:06:22.540> but<00:06:22.810> the

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
formulation is bad at all but the

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.480 
formulation is bad at all but the
powders<00:06:23.199> are<00:06:23.320> a<00:06:23.350> little<00:06:23.500> less<00:06:23.710> finely<00:06:24.220> milled

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
powders are a little less finely milled

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.980 
powders are a little less finely milled
there<00:06:24.850> is<00:06:24.970> definitely<00:06:25.360> a<00:06:25.449> little<00:06:25.690> bit<00:06:25.780> more<00:06:25.930> of

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
there is definitely a little bit more of

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.870 
there is definitely a little bit more of
a<00:06:26.050> texture<00:06:26.410> to<00:06:26.650> them<00:06:26.740> than<00:06:26.980> there<00:06:27.130> is<00:06:27.160> the<00:06:27.580> new

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
a texture to them than there is the new

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.909 
a texture to them than there is the new
covergirl<00:06:28.300> formula<00:06:29.050> but<00:06:29.290> I<00:06:29.350> actually<00:06:29.560> did<00:06:29.830> a

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 
covergirl formula but I actually did a

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.100 
covergirl formula but I actually did a
tutorial<00:06:30.070> using<00:06:30.610> this<00:06:30.699> palette<00:06:30.940> and<00:06:31.240> it<00:06:31.570> they

tutorial using this palette and it they

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.409 
tutorial using this palette and it they
perform<00:06:32.560> just<00:06:33.250> as<00:06:33.430> beautifully<00:06:33.910> as<00:06:33.940> the

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 
perform just as beautifully as the

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:36.420 
perform just as beautifully as the
covergirl<00:06:34.840> which<00:06:35.169> I<00:06:35.380> also<00:06:35.530> did<00:06:35.800> a<00:06:35.830> tutorial<00:06:36.010> up
