00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
Tikrit higher than 30 Hertz and they all

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.270 
Tikrit higher than 30 Hertz and they all
need<00:01:54.689> time<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.140> collect<00:01:55.320> data<00:01:55.560> from<00:01:56.070> these

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
need time to collect data from these

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.399 
need time to collect data from these
servers<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.000> then<00:01:57.659> decide<00:01:58.020> how<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.259> proceed

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
servers and then decide how to proceed

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.280 
servers and then decide how to proceed
at<00:01:59.070> these<00:01:59.310> high-tech<00:01:59.759> rates<00:02:00.210> do<00:02:00.659> have<00:02:00.689> quite<00:02:01.229> a

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
at these high-tech rates do have quite a

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.380 
at these high-tech rates do have quite a
significant<00:02:01.890> performance<00:02:02.040> impact<00:02:02.700> now<00:02:03.360> I

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
significant performance impact now I

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.940 
significant performance impact now I
have<00:02:03.570> already<00:02:04.020> been<00:02:04.170> talking<00:02:04.530> about<00:02:04.649> higher

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
have already been talking about higher

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.950 
have already been talking about higher
rates<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.460> my<00:02:05.549> previous<00:02:05.880> videos<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.600> what<00:02:06.930> a

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
rates in my previous videos and what a

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.050 
rates in my previous videos and what a
setback<00:02:07.229> then<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:08.129> see<00:02:08.399> two<00:02:08.580> possible

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
setback then is that I see two possible

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.639 
setback then is that I see two possible
options<00:02:09.179> how<00:02:09.539> they<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:10.020> included<00:02:10.289> in

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
options how they can be included in

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.400 
options how they can be included in
battlefield<00:02:11.099> 4<00:02:11.160> or<00:02:11.580> any

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
battlefield 4 or any

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.370 
battlefield 4 or any
game<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:13.310> first<00:02:13.550> one<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:13.760> that<00:02:14.210> in<00:02:14.600> order<00:02:15.140> to

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
game the first one is that in order to

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.930 
game the first one is that in order to
avoid<00:02:15.710> that<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.070> game's<00:02:16.280> over<00:02:16.430> providers

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
avoid that the game's over providers

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.460 
avoid that the game's over providers
freaked<00:02:17.210> out<00:02:17.360> because<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.930> servers<00:02:18.260> need<00:02:18.440> a

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
freaked out because the servers need a

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.290 
freaked out because the servers need a
lot<00:02:18.680> more<00:02:18.710> resources<00:02:19.250> due<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.120> higher

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
lot more resources due to the higher

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.600 
lot more resources due to the higher
rate<00:02:20.600> is<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:21.650> simply<00:02:21.860> link<00:02:22.280> the

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
rate is that you simply link the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.730 
rate is that you simply link the
simulation<00:02:23.360> rate<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.900> amount<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.320> service

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
simulation rate to the amount of service

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.680 
simulation rate to the amount of service
lots<00:02:24.980> this<00:02:25.880> means<00:02:26.120> that<00:02:26.210> if<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.480> have

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
lots this means that if you have

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.380 
lots this means that if you have
something<00:02:26.960> like<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.410> 32<00:02:28.130> player<00:02:28.370> server<00:02:28.730> then

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
something like a 32 player server then

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.630 
something like a 32 player server then
it<00:02:29.690> will<00:02:29.840> run<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.050> simulation<00:02:30.470> rate<00:02:31.010> of<00:02:31.160> 60

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
it will run a simulation rate of 60

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.910 
it will run a simulation rate of 60
Hertz<00:02:31.880> but<00:02:32.540> if<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:32.810> want<00:02:33.020> more<00:02:33.350> players<00:02:33.770> on

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
Hertz but if you want more players on

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.560 
Hertz but if you want more players on
your<00:02:33.950> server<00:02:34.310> then<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:34.850> will<00:02:34.970> return<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.510> a

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
your server then it will return to a

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.800 
your server then it will return to a
simulation<00:02:36.170> rate<00:02:36.320> of<00:02:36.500> 30<00:02:37.070> Hertz<00:02:37.400> and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
simulation rate of 30 Hertz and

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.540 
simulation rate of 30 Hertz and
something<00:02:38.810> like<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.110> 8<00:02:39.470> slot<00:02:39.740> server<00:02:40.010> could<00:02:40.310> run

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
something like a 8 slot server could run

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.210 
something like a 8 slot server could run
at<00:02:40.810> 120<00:02:41.810> hertz<00:02:41.990> so<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.650> tick<00:02:42.830> rate<00:02:43.040> would<00:02:43.160> be

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
at 120 hertz so the tick rate would be

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.920 
at 120 hertz so the tick rate would be
selected<00:02:43.760> based<00:02:43.910> on<00:02:44.210> the<00:02:44.330> amount<00:02:44.510> of<00:02:44.720> players

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
selected based on the amount of players

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.470 
selected based on the amount of players
that<00:02:45.110> can<00:02:45.500> join<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:46.010> server<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:47.240> avoid

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
that can join the server and to avoid

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.570 
that can join the server and to avoid
any<00:02:47.590> misunderstanding<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.950> numbers<00:02:49.340> that<00:02:49.370> i

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
any misunderstanding the numbers that i

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.690 
any misunderstanding the numbers that i
just<00:02:49.880> used<00:02:50.150> here<00:02:50.450> are<00:02:50.600> just<00:02:50.990> examples<00:02:51.700> the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
just used here are just examples the

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.060 
just used here are just examples the
second<00:02:53.060> option<00:02:53.210> is<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:54.440> developers

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
second option is that the developers

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.640 
second option is that the developers
exposed<00:02:55.520> a<00:02:55.730> new<00:02:55.970> server<00:02:56.390> config<00:02:56.750> option<00:02:57.110> for

exposed a new server config option for
the<00:02:57.800> game<00:02:57.980> server<00:02:58.220> providers<00:02:58.790> this<00:02:59.570> means

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
the game server providers this means

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.110 
the game server providers this means
that<00:02:59.930> if<00:03:00.050> I<00:03:00.320> want<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.650> get<00:03:00.800> a<00:03:00.860> 64<00:03:01.550> player<00:03:01.760> server

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
that if I want to get a 64 player server

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.600 
that if I want to get a 64 player server
that<00:03:02.390> runs<00:03:02.420> at<00:03:02.840> 60<00:03:03.260> Hertz<00:03:03.470> then<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.100> can<00:03:04.310> order

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
that runs at 60 Hertz then I can order

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.060 
that runs at 60 Hertz then I can order
that<00:03:04.970> from<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.750> games<00:03:05.990> of<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.230> provider<00:03:06.620> as<00:03:06.890> an

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
that from the games of a provider as an

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.130 
that from the games of a provider as an
option<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:08.300> games<00:03:08.570> have<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:08.750> provider

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
option and the games have a provider

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.960 
option and the games have a provider
billed<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:09.560> charged<00:03:09.860> me<00:03:10.040> extra<00:03:10.070> because<00:03:10.760> he

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
billed and charged me extra because he

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.970 
billed and charged me extra because he
has<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.150> use<00:03:11.450> more<00:03:11.690> powerful<00:03:12.110> hardware<00:03:12.500> to

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
has to use more powerful hardware to

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.640 
has to use more powerful hardware to
give<00:03:13.160> me<00:03:13.340> those<00:03:13.490> 60<00:03:14.060> Hertz<00:03:14.300> so<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.230> developers

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
give me those 60 Hertz so the developers

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.870 
give me those 60 Hertz so the developers
have<00:03:15.800> just<00:03:16.070> allowed<00:03:16.340> about<00:03:16.610> lafitte

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
have just allowed about lafitte

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.910 
have just allowed about lafitte
franchise<00:03:17.360> to<00:03:17.510> make<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.690> massive<00:03:18.050> leap<00:03:18.440> forward

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.720 
in its evolution and this change will
certainly<00:03:21.500> also<00:03:21.830> be<00:03:22.100> good<00:03:22.250> for<00:03:22.490> all<00:03:22.700> the
