00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:06.080
 ah 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:10.160
 hello friends and super sweethearts of 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.410
 home I'm going here in egypt those that 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.570
 want is an amusement park but 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.760
 Well, I do not want to entertain you so much 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.039
 here in quality I only want 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.550
 leave them with this response from the 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.289
 cookies again 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.519
 we will need a cup of pecan nuts 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:33.230
 half a cup of sugar glass 2 cups 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:35.989
 wheat flour syrup for the whole one 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.350
 scoop of vanilla essence one 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:42.199
 butter cup that we're going to have 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.199
 melted half cream cheese and 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.420
 a half teaspoon of salt first 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.390
 What are we going to do? 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.579
 so I put all my melted butter 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.489
 and I put the half cup of icing sugar 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.010
 to incorporate perfectly and once 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.010
 having this I'm going to put one of the 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.990
 cups of wheat flour so it's 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.630
 we're practically going to see it as an atole 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.810
 it's once I finish doing this 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.930
 process that is as if it already thickened a 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.170
 little bit better I'm going to take the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.820
 vanilla trickle even friend friend 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.030
 that you have maybe a 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.860
 processor you can do without any 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.940
 order but since I do not have I do it 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.100
 so after this I added the nut 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.770
 the half cream cheese bar and the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.100
 another remaining cup of wheat flour 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.550
 then I will incorporate 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.650
 perfectly 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.450
 until they obviously integrate very 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.970
 well the ingredients I occupy my hands 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:47.650
 They are already clean because I do not want you 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:50.200
 know and believe me look now 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.720
 leaving our pill I put him 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.420
 even a little pin there the average 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.760
 teaspoon of salt you can do before 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.890
 I tell you if you have a processor is 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.570
 better obviously there is no order 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.060
 but I do it like that since I like it 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.910
 do it like that and look then I'm already mm 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.220
 that's how I'm going to cover it for an hour 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.330
 He spent that time 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.170
 even as you can see it is a little bit 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.380
 firmer 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.330
 and then the best thing is to do the 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.030
 little balls can even be a little bit 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.970
 more planet the cookies you can make 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.020
 Heart shapes but these are little kisses 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.239
 is not a few kisses and delicious 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.260

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.340
 classic walnut kisses 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.020

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.510

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.550
 I 'm not going to sprinkle them with icing sugar 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.850
 350 degree way to the oven 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.160

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.390

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:32.210
