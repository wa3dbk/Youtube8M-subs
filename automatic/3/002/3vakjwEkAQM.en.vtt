00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 [Music] 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.330
 and his friend if we continue with a song 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.280
 very interesting name lambada 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:22.400
 then we have the following 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:32.060
 number 17 15 13 12 17 15 13 12 10 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:34.630
 we repeat 10 13 12 and 8 10 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.630
 3 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.660
 that's the first sentence and it should sound like that 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.220
 [Music] 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.760
 and you know we continue with the second sentence 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.690
 we have 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:03.329
 the number 15 three times one two three 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.739
 13 and 6 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.750
 ah 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.750
 6 10 and 17 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.329
 15 13 6 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:27.869
 10 13 12 10 10 8 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.869
 8 10 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.100
 then the second sentence of that is nothing 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:32.100
 A) Yes 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.340
 the second phrase to sound like that 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.100
 for me 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.069
 [Music] 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.930
 this and we continue with the third and 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.930
 Last phrase 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:10.890
 this phrase is very easy says 5 and the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:13.910
 number 10 three times if you repeat 5 and the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.910
 number 10 three times 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.140
 follow number 8 and number 13 three 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:26.740
 times 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:30.780
 it repeats 8 and the number 13 three times 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.780
 and that third sentence of sounding like that 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.110
 well now let's put the three sentences together 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.110
 and that will be the following 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.550
 for more 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.390
 [Music] 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.390
 for me 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.830
 for me 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.580
 Let's see 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.209

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.209

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:41.619
