00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.070
 the land where we are born marks us 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.070
 we already the grape 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.010
 the grapes with which we make wine 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.790
 a strain is born from a plant 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.730
 vitis vinifera 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.620
 this strain for example is tempranillo la 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.230
 variety of red more planted in Spain 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.610
 the vintner is the one who takes care of the vine 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.770
 since it is planted until it 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.660
 vintage acceptance is pranillo 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.530
 will develop one way or another according to 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.530
 the site that is planted 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.140
 this is due to the accumulated land is 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.140
 adapt to this terrain 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.590
 but it will also depend on the weather and 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.260
 environmental conditions variety of 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.700
 grape plus terrain plus climate the sum of 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.350
 these three elements form what 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.350
 we call terra or terroir 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.370
 here we have the strains of some of the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.630
 most famous varieties a kind of 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.630
 catalog of the best grapes 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.310
 let's start with the reds 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.550
 cabernet sauvignon a classic of origin 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.920
 French results in a red wine 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.229
 intense aromatic with a certain aroma 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.340
 green pepper goes perfect with a good 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.340
 steak or stew 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.790
 again tempranillo the variety that 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.530
 dominates the rioja is an off-road you 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.780
 withstands temperature changes without 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.790
 problem the tempranillo wine can be 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.269
 consume young but aging earns 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.269
 very much 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.640
 the pine noire is called the lady of 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.920
 the black grapes because it is very sensitive 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.540
 to the attack of fungi when here 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.790
 come out the granites will have to be encouraged 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.629
 that's why pines noire are wines 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.629
 very quoted 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.889
 to the anger the cane wants a lot of sun 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.349
 and that squeezes the heat your wine is 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:06.989
 intense deep comes to earth already 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:11.090
 minerals with a mature cheese or some 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.090
 slices of jerky will triumph 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.800
 we go for the whites the grape that 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.230
 controls the world is undoubtedly the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:25.380
 chardonnay variety other off-road 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.380
 produces a very fruity and aromatic wine 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.850
 the risling grape comes from alsace if 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.010
 we want a young white will be dry and 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.300
 aromatic and if we let it age be 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.300
 fruity and more complex 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.410
 and let's finish with the one that woods tram and nerd 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.290
 of German origin this goes more 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.110
 cold climates that the tempered the wine 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.690
 with gewÃ¼rztraminer it 's rather dry already 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.840
 it gives me a taste like the issys try it 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.840
 with a portion of smoked or sushi 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.840
 brutal 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.599
 well I often review that sin 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.150
 Now you know a little more closely 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:26.069
 different types of grapes and this without having 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.979
 seen a single grain I'm a kind of 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:31.680
 resources you already know we'll see you in the 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:36.379
 next chapter where we will end up with 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.379
 some myths about wine goodbye
