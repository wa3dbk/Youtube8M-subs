00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
this guy's career no way was an

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.680 
this guy's career no way was an
incredible<00:05:32.560> crossover<00:05:33.280> as<00:05:33.790> he<00:05:34.060> rose<00:05:34.300> up<00:05:34.330> in

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
incredible crossover as he rose up in

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.600 
incredible crossover as he rose up in
the<00:05:34.810> Bay<00:05:34.960> Area<00:05:34.990> was<00:05:35.680> a<00:05:35.710> key<00:05:36.040> star<00:05:36.400> for

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
Strikeforce I think the peak of his

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.260 
Strikeforce I think the peak of his
career<00:05:38.680> was<00:05:38.919> the<00:05:38.950> Frank<00:05:39.280> Shamrock<00:05:39.520> fight<00:05:40.030> that

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
career was the Frank Shamrock fight that

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.630 
career was the Frank Shamrock fight that
was<00:05:40.419> a<00:05:40.450> massive<00:05:41.169> fight<00:05:41.440> that<00:05:41.860> Strikeforce<00:05:42.400> put
