00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.920 
280 degrees you're ready to take it off
the<00:01:51.979> heat<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.550> I<00:01:52.820> actually<00:01:53.030> like<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.539> port<00:01:53.780> in

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
the heat and I actually like the port in

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.810 
the heat and I actually like the port in
the<00:01:54.080> Pyrex<00:01:54.530> container<00:01:54.740> again<00:01:55.190> because<00:01:55.640> it's

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
the Pyrex container again because it's

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.999 
the Pyrex container again because it's
easier<00:01:56.180> to<00:01:56.240> pour<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.899> after<00:01:57.649> that<00:01:57.800> you're

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
easier to pour and after that you're

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.260 
easier to pour and after that you're
just<00:01:58.220> gonna<00:01:58.310> go<00:01:58.490> ahead<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:58.759> pour<00:01:59.000> it<00:01:59.149> into

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
just gonna go ahead and pour it into

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.889 
just gonna go ahead and pour it into
your<00:01:59.390> molds<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:01.330> after<00:02:02.330> you<00:02:02.450> pour<00:02:02.660> it<00:02:02.780> into

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
your molds and after you pour it into

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.480 
your molds and after you pour it into
your<00:02:03.050> molds<00:02:03.470> I<00:02:03.560> saw<00:02:03.950> that<00:02:04.100> there<00:02:04.280> were<00:02:04.399> like
