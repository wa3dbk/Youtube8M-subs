00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
actually I have got sort of this corner

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.999 
actually I have got sort of this corner
moving<00:01:49.619> around<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.180> direction<00:01:52.009> while

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
moving around in this direction while

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.770 
moving around in this direction while
we're<00:01:53.159> really<00:01:53.310> doing<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.299> heating<00:01:54.509> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
we're really doing is just heating the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.679 
we're really doing is just heating the
edge<00:01:54.899> up<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.439> then<00:01:55.680> pots<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:57.329> I've<00:01:57.479> sort

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
edge up and then pots in and I've sort

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.969 
edge up and then pots in and I've sort
of<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.840> flat<00:01:58.229> blade<00:01:59.600> in<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:01.259> about<00:02:01.469> sort<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.770> this

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
of a flat blade in to about sort of this

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.609 
of a flat blade in to about sort of this
distance<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.969> covering<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.540> border<00:02:03.930> where

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
distance just covering the border where

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.319 
distance just covering the border where
the<00:02:04.740> adhesive<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.640> they're<00:02:06.000> just<00:02:06.149> moving

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
the adhesive is and they're just moving

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.029 
the adhesive is and they're just moving
it<00:02:06.600> along<00:02:06.689> maybe<00:02:07.020> twisting<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.590> well<00:02:07.740> to

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
it along maybe twisting it well to

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.130 
it along maybe twisting it well to
separate<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.819> just<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.539> get<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> screen<00:02:09.989> to

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
separate it just to get the screen to

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.210 
separate it just to get the screen to
come<00:02:10.349> up<00:02:10.470> away<00:02:10.619> from<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.979> frame

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
come up away from the frame

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.670 
come up away from the frame
once<00:02:12.700> we've<00:02:12.880> done<00:02:12.910> that<00:02:13.060> then<00:02:13.810> we'll<00:02:14.350> have

there's the flex cable firing that we
just<00:03:36.190> need<00:03:36.370> to<00:03:36.519> sort<00:03:36.730> of<00:03:36.790> flip<00:03:37.000> under<00:03:37.510> and

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
just need to sort of flip under and

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.009 
just need to sort of flip under and
connect<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:39.330> top<00:03:40.330> of<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.540> mainboard

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
connect to the top of the mainboard

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.570 
connect to the top of the mainboard

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
we'll get that done and then all we're

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.070 
we'll get that done and then all we're
doing<00:03:42.820> next<00:03:42.910> is<00:03:43.180> clipping<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:43.600> back<00:03:43.750> into<00:03:43.900> the

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
doing next is clipping it back into the

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.580 
doing next is clipping it back into the
case

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590
