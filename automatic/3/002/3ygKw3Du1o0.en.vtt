00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.549 
building this mini 250 size quadcopter
that<00:00:11.519> we<00:00:11.610> just<00:00:11.730> got<00:00:11.910> from<00:00:12.150> banggood.com<00:00:12.559> so

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
that we just got from banggood.com so

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.950 
that we just got from banggood.com so
let's<00:00:13.740> jump<00:00:14.009> in<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.400> get<00:00:14.549> started<00:00:14.960> after

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
let's jump in and get started after

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.420 
let's jump in and get started after
taking<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.529> quick<00:00:16.740> look<00:00:16.770> at<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.100> instructions

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
taking a quick look at the instructions

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.130 
taking a quick look at the instructions
it<00:00:18.150> looks<00:00:18.330> like<00:00:18.420> we're<00:00:18.570> going<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.720> have<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.960> put

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
it looks like we're going to have to put

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.179 
it looks like we're going to have to put
together<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.740> lower<00:00:20.580> frame<00:00:20.910> first<00:00:22.010> so<00:00:23.010> let<00:00:23.160> me

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
together the lower frame first so let me

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.310 
together the lower frame first so let me
get<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.490> esc<00:00:23.970> soldered<00:00:24.420> up<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.689> soldered

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320

came<00:00:51.989> with<00:00:52.050> these<00:00:52.320> other<00:00:52.530> little<00:00:52.829> connectors

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
came with these other little connectors

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.610 
came with these other little connectors
here<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.789> don't<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> female<00:00:55.079> side<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
here I don't have the female side of the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.049 
here I don't have the female side of the
connector<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.219> left<00:00:56.489> them<00:00:56.670> off<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
connector so I left them off the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.270 
connector so I left them off the
distribution<00:00:57.420> board<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.590> they're<00:00:58.859> there<00:00:59.100> so

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
distribution board but they're there so

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.220 
distribution board but they're there so
you<00:00:59.340> can<00:00:59.489> also<00:00:59.640> tap<00:01:00.000> into<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.329> 12<00:01:00.570> volt<00:01:00.629> for

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
you can also tap into the 12 volt for

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.630 
you can also tap into the 12 volt for
anything<00:01:01.410> else<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.920> want<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.160> add<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.460> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
anything else that you want to add on to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.390 
anything else that you want to add on to
it<00:01:03.199> example<00:01:04.199> maybe<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.769> want<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.040> add<00:01:05.189> your
