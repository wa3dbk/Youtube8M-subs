so welcome back to Mirabelle this update

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.730 
so welcome back to Mirabelle this update
of<00:00:08.549> FTV<00:00:08.969> one<00:00:09.330> i'll<00:00:09.660> give<00:00:09.930> you<00:00:10.080> really

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
of FTV one i'll give you really

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.109 
of FTV one i'll give you really
information<00:00:10.980> what's<00:00:11.490> happening<00:00:11.879> we're

00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:12.119 
information what's happening we're

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:14.119 
information what's happening we're
actually<00:00:12.330> doing<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.900> really<00:00:13.440> last<00:00:13.740> system

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:14.129 
actually doing is really last system

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.189 
actually doing is really last system
checks<00:00:14.369> getting<00:00:15.119> ready<00:00:15.270> to<00:00:15.510> prepare<00:00:15.990> for

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
checks getting ready to prepare for

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.470 
checks getting ready to prepare for
flight<00:00:16.670> so<00:00:17.670> really<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:17.970> i<00:00:18.029> want<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.210> explain

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
flight so really what i want to explain

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.069 
flight so really what i want to explain
to<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.619> actual<00:00:19.769> condition<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.609> FTD<00:00:21.060> 1<00:00:21.269> it's

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:22.079 
to is the actual condition of FTD 1 it's

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.679 
to is the actual condition of FTD 1 it's
not<00:00:22.320> just<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.859> normal<00:00:23.160> aircraft<00:00:23.480> inside<00:00:24.480> we

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
not just a normal aircraft inside we

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.779 
not just a normal aircraft inside we
have<00:00:24.839> a<00:00:24.869> lot<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.470> flight<00:00:25.710> test<00:00:25.919> equipment

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
have a lot of a flight test equipment

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.419 
have a lot of a flight test equipment
and<00:00:26.880> Instrumentation<00:00:27.529> very<00:00:28.529> high<00:00:28.710> technology

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
and Instrumentation very high technology

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.069 
and Instrumentation very high technology
some<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.089> may<00:00:30.239> imagine<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:30.869> very

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
some of you may imagine it's very

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.540 
some of you may imagine it's very
comfortable<00:00:31.560> inside<00:00:31.739> actually<00:00:32.160> it's<00:00:32.369> very

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
comfortable inside actually it's very

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.420 
comfortable inside actually it's very
basic<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:33.600> meant<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.020> be<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.290> really<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> very

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
basic it's meant to be a really a very

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.220 
basic it's meant to be a really a very
efficient<00:00:35.910> working<00:00:36.300> station

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
efficient working station

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.750 
efficient working station
of<00:00:37.620> course<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.980> aircraft<00:00:38.310> will<00:00:38.460> go<00:00:38.550> through

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
of course the aircraft will go through

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.370 
of course the aircraft will go through
very<00:00:38.940> extreme<00:00:39.270> maneuvers<00:00:39.720> during<00:00:39.990> the<00:00:40.170> flight

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
very extreme maneuvers during the flight

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.650 
very extreme maneuvers during the flight
testing<00:00:40.830> so<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.370> can<00:00:41.580> see<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.760> really<00:00:42.330> tight

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
testing so you can see a really tight

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.440 
testing so you can see a really tight
down<00:00:42.870> kind<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.560> military<00:00:43.830> type

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
down kind of like a military type

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.360 
down kind of like a military type
operation<00:00:45.450> inside<00:00:45.840> you'll<00:00:46.710> also<00:00:46.830> see<00:00:47.100> all<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
operation inside you'll also see all the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.000 
operation inside you'll also see all the
stuff<00:00:47.610> that's<00:00:47.790> orange<00:00:48.300> inside<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.840> aircraft

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
stuff that's orange inside the aircraft

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.930 
stuff that's orange inside the aircraft
that's<00:00:50.010> not<00:00:50.250> actually<00:00:50.460> because<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
that's not actually because the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.840 
that's not actually because the
engineers<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.390> bad<00:00:51.600> color<00:00:51.900> of<00:00:52.370> color<00:00:53.370> case

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
engineers have bad color of color case

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.760 
engineers have bad color of color case
or<00:00:54.150> probably<00:00:54.960> they<00:00:55.080> do<00:00:55.140> by<00:00:55.380> the<00:00:55.440> way<00:00:55.530> but

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
or probably they do by the way but

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.950 
or probably they do by the way but
anyway<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.490> real<00:00:56.640> reason<00:00:57.060> is<00:00:57.240> to<00:00:57.810> really

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
anyway the real reason is to really

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.480 
anyway the real reason is to really
differentiate<00:00:58.740> what<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.100> actually<00:00:59.460> a

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
differentiate what is actually a

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.520 
differentiate what is actually a
production<00:01:00.000> part<00:01:00.240> and<00:01:00.450> what<00:01:01.080> is<00:01:01.200> actually

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
production part and what is actually

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.100 
production part and what is actually
flight<00:01:01.770> test<00:01:02.270> installations<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.900> I'm<00:01:03.990> going

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
flight test installations so I'm going

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.350 
flight test installations so I'm going
to<00:01:04.170> pass<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.350> over<00:01:04.530> actually<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.280> Erik<00:01:06.180> and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
to pass you over actually to Erik and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.490 
to pass you over actually to Erik and
Petra<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:06.780> I'll<00:01:06.960> give<00:01:07.079> a<00:01:07.110> little<00:01:07.170> bit<00:01:07.290> more
