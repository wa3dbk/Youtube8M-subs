this and and revie's models well let's

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.170 
this and and revie's models well let's
say<00:01:22.260> some<00:01:23.260> might<00:01:23.409> compare<00:01:24.040> this<00:01:24.220> amp<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.820> the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
say some might compare this amp to the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.930 
say some might compare this amp to the
rectifier<00:01:25.720> series<00:01:26.260> although<00:01:26.620> the<00:01:27.490> rectifier

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
rectifier series although the rectifier

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.320 
rectifier series although the rectifier
series<00:01:28.300> has<00:01:28.570> considerably<00:01:29.560> more<00:01:29.890> sub<00:01:30.880> low

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
series has considerably more sub low

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.469 
series has considerably more sub low
frequencies<00:01:32.050> and<00:01:32.610> probably<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.700> little<00:01:34.240> bit

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
frequencies and probably a little bit

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.300 
frequencies and probably a little bit
more<00:01:34.690> gain<00:01:34.960> although<00:01:35.320> this<00:01:35.440> amp<00:01:35.650> has<00:01:35.800> plenty

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
more gain although this amp has plenty

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.219 
more gain although this amp has plenty
of<00:01:36.460> game<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.740> it's<00:01:38.860> just<00:01:39.070> more<00:01:39.340> of<00:01:39.370> a<00:01:40.229> detailed

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
of game but it's just more of a detailed

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.730 
of game but it's just more of a detailed
interpretation<00:01:42.190> of<00:01:42.370> some<00:01:43.240> classic<00:01:43.930> British

interpretation of some classic British

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.930 
interpretation of some classic British
high<00:01:45.430> gain<00:01:45.729> rock<00:01:46.270> amps<00:01:46.690> and<00:01:46.840> rock<00:01:47.049> sounds

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
high gain rock amps and rock sounds

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.700 
high gain rock amps and rock sounds
so<00:01:48.330> whereas<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.810> rectifier<00:01:49.230> tends<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.620> be

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
so whereas the rectifier tends to be

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.710 
so whereas the rectifier tends to be
more<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.980> a<00:01:50.070> modern<00:01:50.250> high<00:01:50.490> gain<00:01:50.730> in<00:01:50.910> general<00:01:51.360> so

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
more of a modern high gain in general so

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.200 
more of a modern high gain in general so
it's<00:01:51.900> not<00:01:52.110> made<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:52.380> jazz<00:01:52.890> guitar<00:01:53.340> players<00:01:53.670> or

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
it's not made for jazz guitar players or

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.710 
it's not made for jazz guitar players or
funk<00:01:54.630> plays<00:01:54.900> or<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.760> also<00:01:56.760> for<00:01:57.270> these<00:01:57.450> guys

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
funk plays or is it also for these guys

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.690 
funk plays or is it also for these guys
no<00:01:58.470> it<00:01:58.680> would<00:01:58.830> definitely<00:01:59.010> be<00:01:59.250> useful<00:01:59.670> for

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
no it would definitely be useful for

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.400 
no it would definitely be useful for
those<00:01:59.910> situations<00:02:00.510> as<00:02:00.690> well<00:02:00.840> although<00:02:01.080> not<00:02:01.380> a

those situations as well although not a

those situations as well although not a
lot<00:02:01.620> of<00:02:01.740> jazz<00:02:01.950> guys<00:02:02.160> play<00:02:02.460> hundred<00:02:02.850> watt<00:02:03.000> amps

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
lot of jazz guys play hundred watt amps

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.960 
lot of jazz guys play hundred watt amps
necessarily<00:02:04.050> but<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:05.070> clean<00:02:05.400> sounds<00:02:05.850> are

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
necessarily but the clean sounds are

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.420 
necessarily but the clean sounds are
very<00:02:06.270> brilliant<00:02:06.900> very<00:02:07.140> detailed<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:08.010> reverb

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
very brilliant very detailed the reverb

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.000 
very brilliant very detailed the reverb
is<00:02:08.729> all<00:02:09.330> tube<00:02:09.690> spring<00:02:10.110> reverb<00:02:10.320> that<00:02:10.830> is

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
is all tube spring reverb that is

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.030 
is all tube spring reverb that is
probably<00:02:11.610> one<00:02:11.820> of<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.000> deepest<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.530> best

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
probably one of the deepest and and best

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.150 
probably one of the deepest and and best
reverbs<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.790> we've<00:02:14.940> made<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.800> jazz

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
reverbs that we've made and so a jazz

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.250 
reverbs that we've made and so a jazz
guy<00:02:17.370> could<00:02:17.640> do<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.880> gig<00:02:18.120> as<00:02:18.900> John<00:02:19.230> pointed

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
guy could do the gig as John pointed

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.060 
guy could do the gig as John pointed
showed<00:02:19.740> earlier<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:20.850> has<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.420> sparkling<00:02:22.230> real

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
showed earlier it has the sparkling real

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.090 
showed earlier it has the sparkling real
tight<00:02:23.400> clean<00:02:23.910> sound<00:02:24.300> potential<00:02:25.020> very<00:02:25.710> punchy

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
tight clean sound potential very punchy

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.250 
tight clean sound potential very punchy
so<00:02:26.280> it's<00:02:26.490> a<00:02:26.580> while<00:02:27.330> Rock<00:02:27.690> guys<00:02:27.960> will

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
so it's a while Rock guys will

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.840 
so it's a while Rock guys will
automatically<00:02:28.980> gravitate<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.580> something

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
automatically gravitate to something

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.870 
automatically gravitate to something
like<00:02:29.970> this<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.630> sounds<00:02:31.080> in<00:02:31.200> here<00:02:31.470> can<00:02:31.740> do<00:02:31.980> just

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
like this the sounds in here can do just

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.170 
like this the sounds in here can do just
