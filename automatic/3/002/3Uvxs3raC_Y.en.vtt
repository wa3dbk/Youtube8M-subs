the<00:01:44.880> basics<00:01:45.390> what<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.840> contouring<00:01:46.560> contouring

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the basics what is contouring contouring

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.090 
the basics what is contouring contouring
is<00:01:47.490> creating<00:01:48.299> shadows<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:48.990> your<00:01:49.320> face<00:01:49.380> that's

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
is creating shadows on your face that's

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.520 
is creating shadows on your face that's
what<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.310> means<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.640> me<00:01:50.759> anyway<00:01:51.119> and

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
what it means to me anyway and

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.359 
what it means to me anyway and
contouring<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.649> very<00:01:52.890> different<00:01:53.280> from

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
contouring is very different from

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.580 
contouring is very different from
bronzing<00:01:54.030> bronzing<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.600> literally<00:01:54.930> taking<00:01:55.409> a

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
bronzing bronzing is literally taking a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.010 
bronzing bronzing is literally taking a
bronzer<00:01:56.460> obviously<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.299> dusting<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.780> over

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
bronzer obviously and dusting it over

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.690 
bronzer obviously and dusting it over
your<00:01:58.140> face<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.530> make<00:01:58.619> your<00:01:58.799> face<00:01:59.009> seem<00:01:59.399> like

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
your face to make your face seem like

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.889 
your face to make your face seem like

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
it's been out in the Sun to make you

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.109 
it's been out in the Sun to make you
look<00:02:00.990> more<00:02:01.049> tanned<00:02:01.520> contouring<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.640> more<00:02:02.909> to

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
look more tanned contouring is more to

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.359 
look more tanned contouring is more to
give<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:04.170> illusion<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.890> much<00:02:05.100> better

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
give the illusion of a much better

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.730 
give the illusion of a much better
facial<00:02:06.030> bone<00:02:06.299> structure<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:06.990> obviously

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
facial bone structure so obviously

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.290 
facial bone structure so obviously
seeing<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.069> how<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.220> highly<00:02:08.729> recommend<00:02:09.119> this

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
seeing is how I highly recommend this

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.580 
seeing is how I highly recommend this
palette<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.780> would<00:02:09.869> only<00:02:09.989> be<00:02:10.170> fair<00:02:10.349> to

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
palette it would only be fair to

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.320 
palette it would only be fair to
actually<00:02:10.950> use<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.550> this

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
actually use it in this

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.030 
actually use it in this
so<00:02:12.900> as<00:02:12.990> you<00:02:13.170> can<00:02:13.290> see<00:02:13.350> I<00:02:13.500> have<00:02:13.710> a<00:02:13.740> blush<00:02:14.010> color

if you're extremely fair like I am you
will<00:02:22.350> need<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.650> go<00:02:22.770> with<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.950> pretty<00:02:23.310> light<00:02:23.550> hand

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
will need to go with a pretty light hand

will need to go with a pretty light hand
with<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.240> but<00:02:24.480> if<00:02:24.570> your<00:02:24.720> medium<00:02:25.110> or<00:02:25.290> even

with this but if your medium or even
dark<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:26.010> think<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.550> one<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.820> go<00:02:26.970> with

effect just a little less chiseled and
more<00:03:06.420> subtle<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.230> think<00:03:07.500> for<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.680> purpose<00:03:07.950> this

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
more subtle I think for the purpose this

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.800 
more subtle I think for the purpose this
video<00:03:08.340> we're<00:03:08.580> going<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.940> go<00:03:09.090> with<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.630> more

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
video we're going to go with the more

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.570 
video we're going to go with the more
chiseled<00:03:10.080> one<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:10.800> it's<00:03:10.920> more<00:03:11.010> pronounced<00:03:11.460> and

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
chiseled one so it's more pronounced and

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.100 
chiseled one so it's more pronounced and
more<00:03:11.730> obvious<00:03:12.060> I'm<00:03:12.360> going<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.660> show<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.840> my

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
more obvious I'm going to show you my

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.740 
more obvious I'm going to show you my
left<00:03:13.350> side<00:03:13.590> because<00:03:13.890> that's<00:03:14.040> my<00:03:14.160> good<00:03:14.340> side<00:03:14.750> so

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
left side because that's my good side so

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.710 
left side because that's my good side so
as<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.260> can<00:03:16.440> see<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.890> am<00:03:17.340> pretty<00:03:17.580> blank<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.600> the

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
as you can see I am pretty blank so the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.630 
as you can see I am pretty blank so the
general<00:03:19.050> consensus<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:19.770> if<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.100> do<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.370> fishy

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
general consensus is if you do the fishy

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.350 
general consensus is if you do the fishy
in<00:03:20.940> tsuki<00:03:21.480> in<00:03:21.600> space<00:03:21.930> like<00:03:23.090> that<00:03:24.090> show<00:03:24.270> you

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
in tsuki in space like that show you

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.000 
in tsuki in space like that show you

where your cheekbones are I don't agree

with that one to be perfectly honest

don't<00:03:32.310> agree<00:03:32.490> with<00:03:32.640> that<00:03:32.850> what<00:03:33.600> I<00:03:33.630> say<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.320> go

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
don't agree with that what I say to go

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.970 
don't agree with that what I say to go
with<00:03:34.770> is<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.640> ear<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.600> mouth<00:03:36.840> rule<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:37.620> from

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
with is the ear to mouth rule so from

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.100 
with is the ear to mouth rule so from
the<00:03:38.100> top<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.520> ear<00:03:38.700> imagine<00:03:39.690> a<00:03:39.750> line<00:03:39.930> is

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
the top of the ear imagine a line is

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.750 
the top of the ear imagine a line is
going<00:03:40.260> straight<00:03:40.860> down<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.400> corner<00:03:41.730> of

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
going straight down to the corner of

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.380 
going straight down to the corner of
your<00:03:41.910> mouth<00:03:42.770> however<00:03:43.770> don't<00:03:44.610> let<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:44.970> contour

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
your mouth however don't let the contour

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.600 
your mouth however don't let the contour
pass<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.959> outer<00:03:46.140> corner<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.740> the<00:03:46.860> eye<00:03:46.890> so<00:03:47.490> if

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
pass the outer corner of the eye so if

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.860 
pass the outer corner of the eye so if
you're<00:03:47.730> contouring<00:03:48.240> don't<00:03:48.450> bring<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:48.750> like

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
you're contouring don't bring it like

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.420 
you're contouring don't bring it like
off<00:03:49.110> down<00:03:49.440> here<00:03:49.470> stop<00:03:50.160> it

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
off down here stop it

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.190 
off down here stop it
around<00:03:50.700> here<00:03:51.060> does<00:03:51.360> that<00:03:51.390> make<00:03:51.630> sense<00:03:51.660> I

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
around here does that make sense I

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.810 
around here does that make sense I
should<00:03:52.470> probably<00:03:52.560> just<00:03:52.740> show<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:53.670> what<00:03:53.790> I

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
should probably just show you so what I

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.880 
should probably just show you so what I
do<00:03:53.910> is<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.209> take<00:03:54.390> my<00:03:54.570> brush<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:55.350> dip<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.709> into

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
do is I take my brush and I dip it into

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.070 
do is I take my brush and I dip it into
the<00:03:56.130> contour<00:03:56.520> shade<00:03:56.550> and<00:03:57.360> I<00:03:57.450> tap<00:03:57.810> off<00:03:58.050> the

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
the contour shade and I tap off the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.290 
the contour shade and I tap off the
excess<00:03:58.680> that's<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.610> one<00:03:59.760> downside<00:04:00.120> to<00:04:00.180> this

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
excess that's the one downside to this

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.420 
excess that's the one downside to this
product<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.750> can<00:04:00.840> be<00:04:00.930> quite<00:04:01.110> powdery<00:04:01.470> tap<00:04:02.250> off

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
product it can be quite powdery tap off

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.790 
product it can be quite powdery tap off
the<00:04:02.459> excess<00:04:02.940> top<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:04.020> the<00:04:04.080> ear<00:04:04.230> down<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.709> the

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
the excess top of the ear down to the

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.560 
the excess top of the ear down to the
mouth<00:04:04.980> but<00:04:05.190> not<00:04:05.400> going<00:04:05.730> past<00:04:05.940> the<00:04:06.150> outside<00:04:06.480> of

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
mouth but not going past the outside of

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:12.410 
mouth but not going past the outside of
the<00:04:06.660> eye<00:04:08.480> and<00:04:10.280> then<00:04:11.280> circular<00:04:11.790> motions<00:04:12.209> once

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
the eye and then circular motions once

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.630 
the eye and then circular motions once
the<00:04:12.570> product<00:04:12.959> is<00:04:13.080> initially<00:04:13.650> applied<00:04:13.950> to

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
the product is initially applied to

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.890 
the product is initially applied to
blend

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.090 

and<00:04:20.900> then<00:04:21.140> I<00:04:21.170> like<00:04:21.380> to<00:04:21.470> do<00:04:21.590> circular<00:04:21.920> motions

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
and then I like to do circular motions

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.100 
and then I like to do circular motions
just<00:04:22.730> around<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.240> hairline<00:04:23.450> so<00:04:23.870> it's<00:04:23.990> not

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
just around the hairline so it's not

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.040 
just around the hairline so it's not
just<00:04:24.470> one<00:04:25.190> big<00:04:25.370> brown<00:04:25.940> stripe<00:04:26.450> so<00:04:26.870> that's

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
just one big brown stripe so that's

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.040 
just one big brown stripe so that's
actually<00:04:27.230> blended<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:29.360> again<00:04:29.600> when<00:04:29.810> it<00:04:29.840> comes

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
actually blended and again when it comes

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.630 
actually blended and again when it comes
to<00:04:30.260> blending<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:30.770> in<00:04:30.920> and<00:04:31.070> making<00:04:31.280> it<00:04:31.370> look<00:04:31.490> a

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
to blending it in and making it look a

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.860 
to blending it in and making it look a
little<00:04:31.730> bit<00:04:32.000> more<00:04:32.090> natural<00:04:32.210> I<00:04:32.480> like<00:04:32.630> to<00:04:32.720> take<00:04:32.840> a

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
little bit more natural I like to take a

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.860 
little bit more natural I like to take a
little<00:04:33.170> bit<00:04:33.440> just<00:04:33.980> up<00:04:34.160> onto<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.610> hairline<00:04:37.870> so

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
little bit just up onto the hairline so

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.240 
little bit just up onto the hairline so
again<00:04:39.170> it's<00:04:39.320> not<00:04:39.470> just<00:04:39.650> like<00:04:39.800> one<00:04:39.830> brown

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
again it's not just like one brown

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.700 
again it's not just like one brown
stripe<00:04:40.580> on<00:04:40.760> the<00:04:40.880> face<00:04:41.090> it<00:04:41.630> can<00:04:41.930> also<00:04:42.080> make<00:04:42.530> your

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
stripe on the face it can also make your

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.570 
stripe on the face it can also make your
forehead<00:04:43.160> appear<00:04:43.280> smaller<00:04:44.470> and<00:04:45.470> I<00:04:46.070> take<00:04:46.280> the

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
forehead appear smaller and I take the

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.680 
forehead appear smaller and I take the
tiniest<00:04:47.030> bit<00:04:47.330> literally<00:04:47.840> along<00:04:48.310> here<00:04:52.690> again

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
tiniest bit literally along here again

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.740 
tiniest bit literally along here again
just<00:04:53.720> to<00:04:54.050> create<00:04:54.260> a<00:04:54.410> seamless<00:04:54.920> contour<00:04:55.790> and<00:04:56.000> if

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
just to create a seamless contour and if

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.170 
just to create a seamless contour and if
like<00:04:56.990> most<00:04:57.260> women<00:04:57.590> you<00:04:57.710> want<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:58.130> get<00:04:59.030> rid<00:04:59.150> of

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
like most women you want to get rid of
