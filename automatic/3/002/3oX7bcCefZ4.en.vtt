00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.229 
kind of more of a business thing that
the<00:01:35.009> u.s.<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.369> would<00:01:35.489> do<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.789> I<00:01:35.849> don't<00:01:36.030> I

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:36.239 
the u.s. you would do and I don't I

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:39.080 
the u.s. you would do and I don't I
didn't<00:01:36.690> really<00:01:36.780> care<00:01:36.899> that<00:01:37.050> much<00:01:38.060> when<00:01:39.060> I

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
didn't really care that much when I

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.620 
didn't really care that much when I
started<00:01:39.179> thinking<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.959> from<00:01:40.110> there

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
started thinking of it from there

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.480 
started thinking of it from there
perspective<00:01:41.409> but<00:01:41.649> if<00:01:41.799> you<00:01:41.890> look<00:01:42.040> at<00:01:42.219> any<00:01:42.369> other

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
perspective but if you look at any other

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.550 
perspective but if you look at any other
guy<00:01:42.939> who's<00:01:43.149> been<00:01:43.299> out<00:01:43.420> six<00:01:44.110> seven<00:01:44.320> months<00:01:44.469> no

especially with the Santa silver thing I

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.750 
especially with the Santa silver thing I
brought<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.390> lot<00:02:25.630> of<00:02:25.920> bad<00:02:26.920> press<00:02:27.160> this<00:02:27.430> sport

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
brought a lot of bad press this sport

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.979 
brought a lot of bad press this sport
but<00:02:27.940> which<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.299> going<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.510> allow<00:02:28.599> us<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.959> grow

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
but which is going to allow us to grow

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.660 
but which is going to allow us to grow
now<00:02:29.319> you<00:02:29.530> know<00:02:29.620> sometimes<00:02:29.830> bad<00:02:30.250> things<00:02:30.280> need

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
now you know sometimes bad things need

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.039 
now you know sometimes bad things need
to<00:02:30.700> happen<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:31.150> for<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.390> sport<00:02:31.599> to<00:02:31.660> grow<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:31.989> I

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
to happen to for the sport to grow and I

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
guy has forward just mentally you should

the reason why I really think he would

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.469 
the reason why I really think he would
it<00:04:34.280> take<00:04:34.400> is<00:04:34.610> because<00:04:34.880> he<00:04:35.090> has<00:04:35.360> his

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
it take is because he has his

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.080 
it take is because he has his
opportunity<00:04:35.960> fight<00:04:36.110> for<00:04:36.229> the<00:04:36.320> real<00:04:36.500> belt<00:04:36.740> and

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
opportunity fight for the real belt and

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.190 
opportunity fight for the real belt and
he<00:04:38.090> could<00:04:38.240> fight<00:04:38.419> for<00:04:38.539> the<00:04:38.600> real<00:04:38.780> bout<00:04:38.990> two
