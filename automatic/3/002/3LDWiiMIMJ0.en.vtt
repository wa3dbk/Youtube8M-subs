00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.699
 Hello everyone, we were going to 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.640
 see today I come to present what is 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:26.720
 a tutorial trick to be able to increase the 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:30.380
 Internet speed down one 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.720
 playstation 3 ps3 and step down the 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.390
 pins for coz type games that 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.360
 is will come very well then we go there 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.100
 with the trick that is very simple 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.410
 The first thing you are going to do is go to 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.940
 adjustments to network settings 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.120
 well here 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.860
 really and then first of all for 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.180
 that you see that it is true you are going to make a 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.850
 connection test to see what connection 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.039
 you currently have 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.079
 this will come in handy in this trick more 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:02.019
 nothing I have fiber optic 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.479
 but for those who have adsl you will see that 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.930
 what's not ready there was more this trick 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.580
 works for both ps4 and ps3 vale 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.409
 Then the first thing you have to do 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.750
 after doing the connection test and 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.789
 see what speed is coming is 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.420
 reach connection settings of the 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:21.740
 Internet 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.880
 forgiveness adjusted state list of 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.090
 Connection 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.460
 and here you are going to catch diverse point the 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.110
 ip address 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:36.049
 and the default router mask and 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.390
 then we are going to change the one in that the dns 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.520
 primary and the secondary dns all of them 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.200
 I will comment 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.860
 when we arrived here we arrived at adjustments 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.860
 Internet connection 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.150
 and in easy measurements that is normal 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.790
 what do people usually do 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.890
 custom we see here by cable 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.390
 well I cable that they have 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.860
 wired and wireless but good the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.040
 most usually so that they do not give 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.890
 failures go for cause and we're going to give here 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.260
 manual adjustments no forgiveness in detection 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.970
 and automatic settings here 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.530
 address and we're going to give malware 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.780
 annual we are not going to change right now 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.940
 it is written on a paper that you have 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.480
 taken a picture I imagine the image that 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.440
 I told you before you put address 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.930
 you are going to change it 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.820
 previous reuters finished is what 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.730
 You are also going to change 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:35.420
 also and then you have that primary vais 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:39.440
 to put 88 88 and then on have that 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.230
 secondary you're going to put 8 844 because you 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.420
 I say this then look let's see this is 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.750
 what is the connection let's say that 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.920
 you are the google dns with the dns of 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.530
 google you will notice a difference 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.870
 quite big on the issue of downloading 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.700
 ps3 connection and then on the subject of 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.800
 pin them if you then do a test of 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.980
 speed on the internet you will see that 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.570
 can go down more than half we can 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.720
 knock out a person so that it arrives 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.970
 an immoral usually has a ping an 186 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.900
 190 with this what you are going to do is 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.790
 lower it to 80 82 86 okay then it says 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:19.769
 here you put it all right 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:22.120
 the rest is already automatic it will use it and 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.280
 then we will give to accept 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.440
 and here they accept and do a test of 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.019
 connection and you'll see that the speed 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.920
 has increased if you have done the 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.049
 connection test 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.810
 now you going to do again and going to 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.420
 notice because they have even raised us between 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.310
 3 5 or 6 megabytes depends on your 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.340
 connection but then the most important thing is going 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.799
 to be in the pin of the pin game to 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.560
 to say it that clearly is to improve it 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.510
 to the subject of reaction the subject of 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.549
 movement that does not go flattered and 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.560
 Even if you have a small advantage 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.260
 with respect to your animals which is what 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.359
 that usually does not happen with videos worth 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.819
 Well, I 'm not going to do it because 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.769
 and what I did and then it is nonsense 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.109
 lose the rhythm after doing everything 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.400
 this will tell me how we have been doing 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:10.560
 trick and nothing else 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.730
 I see that it has gone well you has 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.650
 liked this video more back together 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.180
 and I have done it in a simple way for 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.180
 that everyone understands 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.000
 and if you do a favor or subscribe 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.000
 thank you very much everyone in Wales
