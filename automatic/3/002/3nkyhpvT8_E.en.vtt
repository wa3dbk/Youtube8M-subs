Brothers for the Wii U and you guys are

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.060 
Brothers for the Wii U and you guys are
probably<00:00:09.719> wondering<00:00:10.349> why<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.590> hell<00:00:10.830> are<00:00:10.950> you

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
probably wondering why the hell are you

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.129 
probably wondering why the hell are you
doing<00:00:11.340> an<00:00:11.429> unboxing<00:00:11.759> for<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.330> but<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:12.870> figured

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
doing an unboxing for this but I figured

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.720 
doing an unboxing for this but I figured
it<00:00:13.230> would<00:00:13.320> give<00:00:13.440> me<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.620> chance<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.190> talk<00:00:14.519> about

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
it would give me a chance to talk about

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.029 
it would give me a chance to talk about
Smash<00:00:15.179> Brothers<00:00:15.420> because<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.830> first

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039

Smash<00:00:17.460> Brothers<00:00:17.789> game<00:00:18.180> I've<00:00:18.449> ever<00:00:18.480> played

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
Smash Brothers game I've ever played

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.859 
Smash Brothers game I've ever played
well<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.580> haven't<00:00:20.850> played<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.210> yet<00:00:21.240> obviously

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
well I haven't played it yet obviously

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.750 
well I haven't played it yet obviously
because<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.230> not<00:00:22.380> even<00:00:22.529> out<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.890> box<00:00:23.130> but

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
because it's not even out of the box but

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.920 
because it's not even out of the box but
I<00:00:24.170> missed<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.410> part<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:26.010> Nintendo<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.880> was<00:00:27.240> 14

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
I missed that part of Nintendo I was 14

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.150 
I missed that part of Nintendo I was 14
or<00:00:28.109> 15<00:00:28.560> when<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.890> first<00:00:29.369> smash<00:00:29.699> came<00:00:30.029> out<00:00:30.210> and

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
or 15 when the first smash came out and

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.510 
or 15 when the first smash came out and
between<00:00:32.160> 14<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:32.820> 15<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.420> probably<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:34.380> 20<00:00:35.309> I

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
between 14 and 15 and probably like 20 I

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.970 
between 14 and 15 and probably like 20 I
missed<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.540> lot<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.930> video<00:00:37.140> games<00:00:37.200> between<00:00:37.680> that

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
missed a lot of video games between that

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.490 
missed a lot of video games between that
time<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.250> was<00:00:38.640> up<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.570> no<00:00:39.719> good<00:00:39.750> getting<00:00:40.230> in

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
time I was up to no good getting in

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.729 
time I was up to no good getting in
trouble<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.450> my<00:00:42.629> first<00:00:42.989> smash<00:00:43.410> game

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
trouble so this is my first smash game

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.619 
trouble so this is my first smash game
and<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.980> figured<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.340> would<00:00:44.370> make<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.420> video

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
and I figured I would make this video

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.510 
and I figured I would make this video
and<00:00:46.050> just<00:00:46.200> talk<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> bit<00:00:46.980> about<00:00:47.010> it

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
and just talk a bit about it

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.700 
and just talk a bit about it
so<00:00:47.760> I'm<00:00:47.969> kind<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.420> excited<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.050> don't<00:00:49.410> know<00:00:49.559> what

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
so I'm kind of excited I don't know what

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.040 
so I'm kind of excited I don't know what
to<00:00:49.860> expect<00:00:49.890> all<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:51.059> really<00:00:51.270> know<00:00:51.510> about<00:00:51.539> Smash

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
to expect all I really know about Smash

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.229 
to expect all I really know about Smash
Brothers<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.579> fighting<00:00:53.879> game

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
Brothers is that it's a fighting game

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.450 
Brothers is that it's a fighting game
with<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.660> Nintendo<00:00:55.170> characters<00:00:55.620> that's<00:00:56.160> it

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
with the Nintendo characters that's it

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.450 
with the Nintendo characters that's it
so<00:00:57.170> it's<00:00:58.170> gonna<00:00:58.320> be<00:00:58.500> interesting<00:00:58.620> maybe<00:00:59.309> I

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
so it's gonna be interesting maybe I

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.939 
so it's gonna be interesting maybe I
will<00:00:59.609> do<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> stream<00:01:00.840> or<00:01:01.140> something<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.770> that

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
will do a stream or something like that

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.729 
will do a stream or something like that
I<00:01:02.219> don't<00:01:02.430> know<00:01:02.840> it's<00:01:03.840> really<00:01:03.960> hard<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:04.500> me<00:01:04.650> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
I don't know it's really hard for me to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.500 
I don't know it's really hard for me to
do<00:01:04.949> streams<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.580> probably<00:01:05.909> shouldn't<00:01:06.390> have

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
do streams so I probably shouldn't have

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.190 
do streams so I probably shouldn't have
said<00:01:06.780> that

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
said that

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.070 
said that
