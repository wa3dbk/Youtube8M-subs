Robert Brown decided to peer into the
heart<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.050> plant<00:00:22.350> cell<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.920> then<00:00:23.490> he'd

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
heart of the plant cell and then he'd

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.000 
heart of the plant cell and then he'd
reveal<00:00:24.269> Sunday<00:00:24.689> as<00:00:24.810> important<00:00:25.410> as<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
reveal Sunday as important as the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.450 
reveal Sunday as important as the
discovery<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.849> cell<00:00:27.119> itself<00:00:31.130> now<00:00:32.130> the

discovery of the cell itself now the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.549 
discovery of the cell itself now the
orchid<00:00:32.880> was<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> lucky<00:00:33.390> choice<00:00:33.840> as<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.170> happened

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
orchid was a lucky choice as it happened

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.680 
orchid was a lucky choice as it happened
because<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:35.219> has<00:00:35.370> cells<00:00:35.700> which<00:00:35.940> are<00:00:36.090> larger

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
because it has cells which are larger

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.080 
because it has cells which are larger
than<00:00:36.809> other<00:00:37.170> plants<00:00:37.680> if<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.579> weren't<00:00:38.730> for<00:00:38.850> this

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
than other plants if it weren't for this

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.910 
than other plants if it weren't for this
it's<00:00:39.660> unlikely<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.260> Brown<00:00:40.620> would<00:00:40.800> have

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
it's unlikely that Brown would have

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.700 
it's unlikely that Brown would have
discovered<00:00:41.309> what<00:00:41.610> he<00:00:41.700> did<00:00:41.969> now<00:00:42.960> i'm<00:00:43.469> going<00:00:43.649> to

discovered what he did now i'm going to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.979 
discovered what he did now i'm going to
try<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.920> see<00:00:44.219> what<00:00:44.489> was<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.820> important<00:00:45.390> using

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
try to see what was so important using
