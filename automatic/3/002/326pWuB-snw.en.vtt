00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.959
 hello friends today we are going to make a bread with 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:13.580
 nuts I bought some nuts the pique 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:16.280
 a little bit so they were whole 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.010
 and then we're going to put them in the bread 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.560
 What are we going to do now 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.510
 you can put more nuts or 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.670
 whole as you like it I think that 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.960
 this amount will be fine for the bread is 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:33.500
 a little red okay then we're going to 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.340
 start as usual we take out the bucket 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:41.480
 of the breadmaker we put it here and 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.750
 We are going to put a glass in the bucket 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.750
 milk 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.470
 next two beaten eggs 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:06.220
 a coffee spoon of also more coffee 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:09.450
 or so it fills him with salt like that 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.450
 spread throughout the bucket 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.170
 makes a tablespoon with 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.170
 Butter 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:25.770
 one tablespoon without filling 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:29.750
 so sugar I put brown sugar 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.780
 because I like it better but as it is said 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.380
 A) Yes 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.680
 flour you know more videos than ever 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.979
 it's strength flour according if we do not 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:46.890
 go find her in the flour supermarket 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:53.280
 of force then we put 540 grams 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.280
 this is already heavy from lÃ³pez before 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.820
 and this is 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.380
 and what there is and add 540 grams 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.849
 everything will go to the bucket 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.640
 we take care of it that is not 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.640

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.280
 We throw half breaks with the hand 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.110
 that's how it was and also distribute it in the 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.110
 bucket 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.360
 and there it is 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.020

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.490

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.720

 [Music] 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.220

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.050
 they are enough if you want more 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.050
