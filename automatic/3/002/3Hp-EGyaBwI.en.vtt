00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 and the national education ministry 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.670
 awarded the bachelor's degree in education 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.740
 preschool high accreditation 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.990
 quality this certainly brings benefits 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.500
 for the faculty and for the program for 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.529
 the faculty of education is a 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.660
 benefit to have the degree 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:29.150
 accredited because it opens the possibility 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.610
 to have master's degrees and it's also 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.890
 show the external sector to the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.170
 has teachers who meet 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.980
 quality standards 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.880
 this process started 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.890
 since2008 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.550
 with all the substantive functions of 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.329
 extension research 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.309
 internationalization the implications 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.370
 who has the self - assessment process 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.120
 for accreditation in the teaching role 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.000
 it's very significant because it allows us 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.880
 to teachers recognize the program 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.920
 know in depth their relationships 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.590
 your connections with other processes 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.710
 academics from the university of 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.840
 city of the country and even in the field 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.850
 international all teachers of the 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.710
 program we knew that when parents 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.960
 came to visit us anybody could 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.030
 account for any factor then 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.160
 I believe that the main implication 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.200
 for all of us as teachers was 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.930
 make us part of the process and I think that 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.640
 that was the success really both of the 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.950
 visit of parents as of construction 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.080
 of the document and finally arrive then 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.490
 to the goal that we wanted that was that 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.490
 they will accredit us of high quality 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.689
 Y 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.069
 already with this there are four programs of 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.109
 tuna the broad have said 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.789
 recognition which allows the 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:51.920
 students of the program feel 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:58.459
 gratified both professionally and 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.840
 academically that the program has been 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.659
 accredited benefits us because 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.700
 I think that certification speaks of 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.310
 the future professionals who leave 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.979
 here of the formula competing in a 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.900
 market therefore being the market 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.319
 competitive from knowing the knowledge 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.540
 do and with excellent capabilities the 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.209
 certification is a sign that the 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.280
 university has excellent levels of 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.730
 academic training and quality 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.730
 human 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.080
 accreditation in the manner in which 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.340
 Government recognizes programs 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.590
 university students whose organization 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.900
 operation and compliance with 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.830
 Social function are ideal and optimal 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.830
 to be offered 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.700
 highlights the program's great strengths 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.950
 among them the correspondence that has 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.190
 the educational project with the philosophy 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.470
 also institutional wealth 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.840
 has in the development of its processes 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.569
 academics in terms of flexibility 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.690
 the interdisciplinarity the articulation 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.510
 of the practices of students with 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.549
 professional skills and also 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.920
 with the competences that develop in 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.900
 the field of research after the 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.120
 recognition of high accreditation 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.670
 quality to the program and to the institution 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.920
 they expect a great challenge and it is to maintain this 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.319
 recognition and overcome it in such a way 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.180
 that in four years we can make the 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.790
 process before the national council of 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.680
 accreditation and request again the 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.860
 renewal of accreditation of 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.860
 Program 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.210
 we recognize the team of 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.620
 work of the faculty of education and 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.870
 coordination system 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.880
 accreditation in high quality that with its 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.070
 work have contributed to the development and 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.680
 positioning of both the institution 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.990
 as of the program with this we confirm 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.640
 that quality is the commitment of all and 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.440
 that in the case when a 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.440
 program we all credit ourselves
