00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
um to a to creative with it because I

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.490

mean<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.189> messed<00:01:35.430> up<00:01:35.610> then<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
mean if I messed up then like that the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.120 
mean if I messed up then like that the
whole<00:01:37.530> thing<00:01:38.070> would<00:01:39.030> look<00:01:39.060> really<00:01:39.360> bad<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:41.100> I

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
whole thing would look really bad so I

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.399

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.130 
next to other bricks I cut that part off
and<00:04:29.130> I<00:04:29.730> super<00:04:30.150> glued<00:04:30.300> it<00:04:30.540> to<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.810> side<00:04:30.960> of<00:04:30.990> his

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
and I super glued it to the side of his

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.320 
and I super glued it to the side of his
head<00:04:31.320> now<00:04:32.160> there's<00:04:32.400> two<00:04:32.550> ways<00:04:32.730> you<00:04:32.790> can<00:04:32.970> glue

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
head now there's two ways you can glue

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.270 
head now there's two ways you can glue
it<00:04:33.360> to<00:04:33.600> his<00:04:33.720> head<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:34.170> can<00:04:34.350> as<00:04:34.530> I<00:04:34.950> just<00:04:34.980> said

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
it to his head you can as I just said

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.930 
it to his head you can as I just said
he's<00:04:35.430> a<00:04:35.460> super<00:04:35.880> glue<00:04:36.060> or<00:04:36.750> hot<00:04:36.990> glue<00:04:37.200> I

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
he's a super glue or hot glue I

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.180 
he's a super glue or hot glue I
recommend<00:04:38.940> using<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:40.020> super<00:04:40.410> glue<00:04:40.590> because<00:04:41.010> I

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
recommend using the super glue because I

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.340 
recommend using the super glue because I
believe<00:04:41.760> it<00:04:41.880> would<00:04:41.940> be<00:04:42.030> much<00:04:42.180> safer<00:04:42.480> than

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
believe it would be much safer than

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.880 
believe it would be much safer than
using<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.740> hot<00:04:43.890> glue<00:04:44.540> this<00:04:45.540> is<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.650> type<00:04:46.860> of

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
using the hot glue this is the type of

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.610 
using the hot glue this is the type of
glue<00:04:47.130> that<00:04:47.280> I<00:04:47.370> used<00:04:48.650> office<00:04:49.650> work<00:04:49.860> super<00:04:50.400> glue

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
glue that I used office work super glue

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.830 
glue that I used office work super glue
got<00:04:52.620> that<00:04:52.920> kroger<00:04:53.280> it's<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.690> gel<00:04:54.690> type<00:04:54.900> I<00:04:55.200> mean

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
got that kroger it's the gel type I mean

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.540 
got that kroger it's the gel type I mean
says<00:04:57.840> it's<00:04:58.170> the<00:04:58.320> gel<00:04:58.530> type<00:04:58.740> but<00:04:59.040> it<00:04:59.190> comes<00:04:59.430> out

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
says it's the gel type but it comes out

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.530 
says it's the gel type but it comes out
and<00:04:59.730> liquid<00:05:00.060> form<00:05:00.270> if<00:05:00.420> you<00:05:01.140> do<00:05:01.350> find<00:05:01.760> a<00:05:02.760> super

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.760 
do video with them and you want to
connect<00:07:32.310> the<00:07:32.400> chain<00:07:32.790> to<00:07:32.940> the<00:07:33.090> other<00:07:33.240> figure

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:33.770 
connect the chain to the other figure

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.480 
connect the chain to the other figure
like<00:07:35.180> use<00:07:36.180> a<00:07:36.210> skeleton<00:07:37.080> here<00:07:37.170> for<00:07:37.350> example<00:07:37.490> and

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:38.490 
like use a skeleton here for example and

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.070 
like use a skeleton here for example and
you<00:07:38.580> can<00:07:38.730> easily<00:07:38.880> connect<00:07:39.300> it<00:07:39.420> there<00:07:39.600> now<00:07:39.960> if

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 
you can easily connect it there now if

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.450 
you can easily connect it there now if
you<00:07:40.170> didn't<00:07:40.350> have<00:07:40.470> the<00:07:40.560> connection<00:07:40.950> then<00:07:41.190> you

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:41.460 
you didn't have the connection then you

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.890 
you didn't have the connection then you
obviously<00:07:41.580> can't<00:07:42.030> do<00:07:42.150> that<00:07:42.650> yeah<00:07:43.650> I<00:07:43.680> mean<00:07:43.860> I

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:44.900 
obviously can't do that yeah I mean I

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.830 
obviously can't do that yeah I mean I
just<00:07:45.900> think<00:07:46.230> to<00:07:46.470> do<00:07:46.590> that<00:07:46.620> it<00:07:47.550> um<00:07:47.880> I'd

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 
just think to do that it um I'd

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.000 
just think to do that it um I'd
encourage<00:07:49.110> you<00:07:49.230> just<00:07:49.530> do<00:07:49.650> it<00:07:49.770> that<00:07:49.890> way

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.010 
encourage you just do it that way

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.940 
encourage you just do it that way
because<00:07:50.130> I<00:07:50.250> think<00:07:50.460> that'd<00:07:50.930> be<00:07:51.930> easier<00:07:52.650> if<00:07:52.710> you

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:52.950 
because I think that'd be easier if you

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.390 
because I think that'd be easier if you
want<00:07:53.130> to<00:07:54.680> you<00:07:55.680> can<00:07:55.830> let<00:07:55.980> the<00:07:56.040> chain<00:07:56.220> to<00:07:56.250> be

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 
want to you can let the chain to be

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.050 
want to you can let the chain to be
connected<00:07:56.610> to<00:07:56.850> other<00:07:57.000> figures<00:07:58.040> so<00:07:59.040> um<00:07:59.340> that's

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.060 
connected to other figures so um that's

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.090 
connected to other figures so um that's
it<00:08:00.330> for<00:08:00.510> the<00:08:00.570> ghostwriter<00:08:00.960> there<00:08:01.169> please
