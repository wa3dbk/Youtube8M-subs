00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:16.640
 just the good day we have the car 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:20.210
 which is a g4 goal we have here at home 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.460
 This car is giving a poor car. 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.190
 same high temperature 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:30.800
 we are deleting the connectors that 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:35.360
 provisionally see if you have any 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.210
 connector that is connected to the fan 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.850
 Let's call it straight, do not call it straight here. 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.940
 to see what 's happening and let's go 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.540
 take the fan is a fan and give 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.820
 a look at him personally that also 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.290
 we also have this other connector 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:57.380
 that you are seeing here the temperature 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.090
 ltda turn is ethical show choose 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.600
 also very suspicious touch 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.680
 this connector is very suspicious people 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.260
 You see, it's very defective and we're going 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.229
 make an analysis that just what 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.700
 I tried to tell you that this box 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.140
 it was the workshop he put it on 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.150
 heating up 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.049
 So we'll see it here and here. 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.049
 we'll be back soon 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.369
 the staff here or if you want 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.560
 remove the complete radiator 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.210
 This is the practice that we do alone. 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:41.200
 because I'm insisting that I'm 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:46.130
 wanting to take only want to take the sun 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.350
 player to work harder to pull 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.040
 here a goal and go out there complete 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.110
 opsahl radiator with the wind gone full 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.600
 It's easy to shoot because I do not want to take 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.270
 the water that will get wet 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.500
 is stirring the gases and water here 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.520
 Water 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.520
 I do not want to take 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:13.580
 So here I am going to put here I'm going to take 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:16.280
 here are Paul, I'm going to take this one 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.790
 hose team out oo olhanense on 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:28.940
 sale 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:30.680
 I'm the mangueirinha here was this 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.090
 exchange that is this difficult road 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:42.760
 really as it goes out that way it looks 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:42.760
 fan goes out the water below 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:03:01.690
 only we assembled while voting 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.690
 car athlete 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:11.000
 the disassembled here on man pac 1 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.170
 Okay, here's a capacitor. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.610
 here or do not change it with the new 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.410
 today, people used to do at home 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.720
 nobody does anything that really changes the 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.730
 environment there doctor very new and then 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.700
 trying to do is what leads us to 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.650
 my workshop and did not solve anything 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.780
 We're trying here at home this. 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.910
 does not decide to continue to solve 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.060
 right up to 60km still not 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.730
 found a new one to solve the 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.670
 problem instead of several goals and this 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:45.310
 same problem happens sas usually 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:48.320
 in the connector that take the liha go 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:53.210
 make everything put here again not 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:56.780
 exchange enabled and put an end to the bad 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.790
 she is here then the beam and if you want 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.440
 do at home that does not exist this beam 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.530
 and she stays here 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.790
 if you take it and come this over here 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:14.390
 she come she came in here at 10 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:16.190
 it locks in the armature and shaft to here 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.359
 we will not be back to do the 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.359
 back mounting 

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:26.639
 [Music] 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.800
 by placing the electric fan 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:47.980
 on this side we at the moment have exchanged 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:53.620
 coal lubricated in it to make the 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:05:00.150
 test for the event and will pack up normal 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:00.150
 we are suspecting him he stays 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.160
 It is difficult to say that it is good to 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.860
 radiator but does not remove the 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.020
 radiator moya here that has to take the 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.980
 hose we have not decided to put with 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:19.200
 aleandro bolt ready connect you 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.200
 for the car to work soon 

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:35.279
 They 'll only hook up the phone and do not 

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:37.979
 we connected and we connected the connector 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:40.529
 It's straight to see if there's anything 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:45.679
 direct that does not work alkaline expected 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:45.679
 90 degree investment though it works 

00:05:46.709 --> 00:06:17.729
 I'll see the 40 degrees here near the 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:22.330
 90 degree not see goals and will be bosingwa 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:23.969
 It works works here now. 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.529
 [Applause] 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:27.529
 do not take away from the team 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:37.850
 I'm here, it's been a route this year. 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:46.360
 I do not stop and it's 1 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:50.729
 let's go around the car will win 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:54.939
 his love in the normal professional hand 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:57.339
 ronaldo on the way back there, we see you 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:07:02.669
 that what happened and that will solve the 

00:06:57.339 --> 00:07:02.669
 problem is is more because of that
