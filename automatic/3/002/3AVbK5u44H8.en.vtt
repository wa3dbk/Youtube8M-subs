00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.550
 Relief technique show 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.860

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.610

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:51.120

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.060

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.730
 our uni decor and I'll take it now 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.800
 this blue green for the veins of the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.570
 leaves and then ours 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.230
 bottle green that's like this 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.230
 example here 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.330
 Now I take the soft brush and 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.240
 work that really nice in the 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:25.310
 veins, apply a fill 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:39.440
 that's really true everywhere 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:41.630
 Well done is now I do 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.509
 me that everything is off the surface again 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:49.369
 so i just have the grooves with the 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:58.280
 uni decor has met wipe well with 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:02:00.770
 a damp cloth so that reliefs 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.179
 worked in and wiped off nicely 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.509
 Now I take my bottles 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:04.509
 green 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.660
 because the leaf is born it is beautiful 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.860
 although the bottom half with 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.860
 is engaged 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.060
 Lastly, I wish that to me 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:41.299

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.370

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.480

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.519
