00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:08.280
 today I wanted to make the tag of 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:09.690
 Summer sings in the summer and I do not know why 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.059
 what this morning when I tried 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.279
 aggravating has given me the feeling of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.289
 that I had to dress with a thousand colors 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:20.630
 and get super colorful and what is it 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.630
 what have I done and nothing about this quality 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.290
 end of favorite forever this 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.630
 they raise it went down but recently it has 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.790
 bought this cream and I do not know why 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.370
 but I'm putting this more than far 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.020
 it's better because it looks a bit 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.270
 more natural to the best is because it is 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.770
 novelty story hunger session but the 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.690
 truth is that these two are less 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.080
 sellers all the year I 16 always 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.030
 announced and will try a little less 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.860
 tanned but the same if we have to carry 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.480
 pitcher and that is the one that is me 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.879
 liking a lot lately that this are 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.440
 the case and without cream and nothing but the 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.730
 whenever I liked it is always the 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.730
 slime banana from work 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.820
 if week sugar for the body 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.580
 I would be living all day some 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.110
 defense I love that drink I love 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.030
 and especially when it is super super 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.150
 super cold and that this oil by the 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.430
 lemon and a little bit of candy for the strawberry I 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.490
 love 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.680
 but to make this feel like it's 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.120
 obviously a Vaseline because the 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.040
 grains are dried up a lot because 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.590
 they were dry lips by themselves and in 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.120
 summer we missed a while so he 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.880
 calm down if any Vaseline 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.560
 but this as soon as some color 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.750
 clips love and this love 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.220
 because it's a bit moisturizing and the 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.810
 view of a little bit of color do not look 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.250
 with super super super lips 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.140
 powerful every day that they are just going 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.810
 two but this one gives you a little bit of color 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.440
 and of age also hydration so 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.440
 I love this 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.460
 good in the pool that to the beach 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.610
 because I do not live near the beach but the 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.500
 I love her beach I love being on the beach 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.000
 sand is to sit in the water and go back to 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.530
 the sand in playing for sand and I took 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.990

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.340

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.870
 a lot and it's there 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.680
 I love I love everything that has 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.680
 what to do with the beach 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.840
 for the favorite summer product and 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.810
 I always know not to use or the 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.299
 boxes or buses ships so what 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.129
 always used to try to go back and 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.870
 keep my goods coconut oil and 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.340
 you see in many videos I love the 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.349
 coconut oil because he used it a bit 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.510
 as a serum and nothing gave me a little bit of 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.819
 the boards or if you hit too much face 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.530
 mention a little bit in the hands you give me 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.760
 fruits in the hair center and this is 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.760
 merchant that have less frizz 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.010
 I definitely prefer to get in the sun 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.390
 even if it connects to the sun it is bad not 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.650
 I will try a product from 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.819
 consists 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.819
 to get you brunette 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.439
 these reprehensible of a product for the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.709
 morena transforms bridge because I 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.939
 I am always brunette will admire 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.989
 I do not automatically know why it gets me 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.599
 the memory 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.150
 not to put me in the sun so if I have 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.430
 what to choose I say to put in the sun because 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.269
 they never used products from these 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.269
 to see you way 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:17.650
 favorite food could not say one 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:19.720

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.110

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.689

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:45.129
 I do not know and I love it right now that I 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.409

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.760
 my hands in the days of me feet 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.260
 it seems that it is very turned for me 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.659
 it does not matter since seeing the hands is super 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.659
 super brunettes and nothing I love 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:03.050
 severe tradition I do not remember 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.770
 no but trying to always go to the 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:10.960
 beach at least once throughout the summer 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.960

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.340
 there is one thing that if we do it is always 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.480
 We all go as a family to some place of 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.590
 holidays 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.690

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.960
 family together love to be all 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.960
 together 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.940
 worth favorite perfume is not favorite in 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.699
 As for candles, I always use my 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.800
 color that is smell of sugar cookies or 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.210
 the cake I love that kind of pain 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.360
 both in summer and winter 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.360
 As for the body, this perfume is 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.330
 ezkaba and I do not know exactly you put is the 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.370
 of 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.939
 I do not remember exactly what smells 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.560
 but it 's about scale and it makes you feel 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:02.379
 the key in the blue that smells 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.909
 great and my wife told me not to 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:05.289
 he liked because he remembered one at 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:07.030
 girls from when he went to the institute that 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.219
 they all carried the same then we 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.710
 we went to look for a perfume and we started 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:12.969
 see all the perfumes in the store and 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.789
 this was unique that I liked that 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:17.530
 curiously it smells exactly like 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.719
 from ralph lauren but to him like us 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.849
 different name so I'm such 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.379
 happy little bell I bought it and I 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.210
 I love, I already have super little and 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:27.789
 they had a bad me but the truth is 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.110
 I do not know much about perfume it costs me a 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.030
 lots of finding a perfume that 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.819
 I really like it so it had to be 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:37.569
 how do you say transfer slowly account 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:39.159
 carlin clinker of juices that I like and 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.599
 is already using the scale that I call 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:42.849
 creation a bit but I think we 're going 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:46.029
 sad because he's more tried to give the 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:48.569
 key and for me it smells the same so 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:48.569
 this 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:57.469
 the favorite barbecue food here 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.000
 in the USA they are thick because they buy I do not know 

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:00.439
 yes all the best places in Spain 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.030
 the first pair in canary burgers 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:04.069
 at the barbecue I do not know why but 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.900
 they buy the meat she died healthy but it is 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.430
 heavy make super super saves 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.930
 then they end up being some 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.030
 tiny chiquitita burgers but 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.259
 very fat and they do it later and it stays 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.259
 a little bit beautiful inside 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:23.310
 the burgers I love eating two 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:24.810
 with all the ingredients is very much 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:28.110
 but I love the taste 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:32.990
 I love how I love them and in Spain 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.990
 love all chorizo ​​sandwiches 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:44.650
 a summer proof product like this is 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:46.030
 more sometimes when you're on the street and 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.160
 you spend a lot that something starts to 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.539
 Sweat the whole body to the face like this 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.370
 that sometimes when the printer is better 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:56.050
 face down to me sometimes I get 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:57.430
 moderation here with the mask eyelids 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.229
 of tabs 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.880
 this mascara las de l'oréal 

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:03.849
 at least also works me very 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.889
 well and I loved it so it seems to me that 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:07.840
 these are a super important product 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:09.789
