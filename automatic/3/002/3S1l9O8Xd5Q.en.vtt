00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.680
 ah 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.599
 very good to all people I hope they are 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.400
 very well today I come to bring you a top 5 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.279
 which will be the best series of 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.020
 cartoon network I hope you respect what 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.880
 opinion since in the myths video of 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.739
 the five best anime is that I've seen 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.560
 according to my opinion comments that I 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.420
 They complain about why I did not put some anime 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.250
 but good I hope in this tone 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.080
 claim nothing since this is my top and 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.940
 I will put what I like and if any 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.760
 he does not like my opinion well you know 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.640
 what to do comment or put limits already 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.110
 that's what those options are for 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.290
 well clarified something let's start with a 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.290
 time 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.410
 in position number 5 we have pokemon 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.030
 black and white I know that this is an anime 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.160
 but good is the most affable thing that 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.350
 I found the channel maybe not the best 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.479
 pokemon season for some but 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.430
 He is affable since he looks a lot like 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.290
 previous seasons but with new 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.260
 pokÃ©mon without new companions that 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.090
 they continue to make their adventure there is also a 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.890
 rival beam that is somewhat proud but 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.800
 in my opinion, nobody better than a rival 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.450
 he this anime deserves to be here since 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.450
 It's good and it entertains you a good time 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.560
 here we have the looney tunes show 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.630
 just like pokemon sure some 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.280
 in the comments they will tell me asshole 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.220
 see this series and that reaches them or 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.880
 the heels to the original series but I 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.590
 I'll just tell you something, I sweat it like 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.630
 they gave this series is good although not 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.490
 be as the plastic series seems to me a 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.350
 series very entertaining some jokes 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.260
 They are funny and in my opinion it's another 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.520
 series is spoken on this channel 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.350
 I repeat, I do not say it's better than 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.350
 classic series but it's good even if it's 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.920
 thirdly we have loved if as not 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.500
 I could miss this very funny series 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.660
 although I get bored a little bit because it's already 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.239
 very repetitive but it's still a series 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.980
 very good and very funny as there 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.660
 many movie writings and series 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.640
 that make you laugh and if there is not any 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.379
 sketch that you do not like you can wait for 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.239
 that others happen because in this series you 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.239
 you will laugh a lot with all the things that there are 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.330
 and the silver medal is worn now 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.980
 of adventure and you know what I think of 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.720
 these series I already said in the videos 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.760
 genes of curiosities in your analysis 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.190
 but this series is very good 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.950
 love your story your characters and their 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.080
 plot makes it very good although some 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.050
 chapters are something corny but I like 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.880
 anyway very well deserved this 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.870
 put but does not beat the one in 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.870
 the number one position 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.690
 and the best cartoon series according to my 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.460
 likes is one more are 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.380
 if they thought I would not be 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.080
 they wrong those who did not think 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.850
 was going to be this series is very good that 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.710
 Makes almost all the virgin 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.720
 chapters and always with their parts 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.750
 backs that make it the best series 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.510
 of cartoon networks joined good friends 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.220
