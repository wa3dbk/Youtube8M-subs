 [Music] 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.609
 [Music] 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.470
 yes hello everyone is my dress 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.970
 steak with you so today I 'm going 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.939
 show you how to enter the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.080
 ringtones on an iphone it's very 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.939
 simple when you know how to do it 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.900
 so it's true that it's very difficult 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.279
 precisely when we do not know how to do it 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.850
 so here we are going to use first 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.860
 the edge app agree in a 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.390
 application for wallpaper and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.700
 ringtones I think that's the 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.460
 best application of the moment so 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.360
 we will correct the ringtones so 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.480
 and you also have to download the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:56.070
 software says agency so I put you 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.500

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.329

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.590
