 come on, guys, last video of 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:11.280
 exercises of the law 8,009 to say if 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.400
 1952 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.560
 this is the video of number 17 will only be 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.050
 Five questions, let's go. 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.430
 review the statements below you will 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:28.590
 read and your alternative answer 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.630
 correct if you already used is the letter enter 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.430
 only in the middle is correct then the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.880
 appointment of employees to obtain 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.399
 shall follow the order of classification of 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.920
 candidates in a competition is 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.129
 logical with sorting orders 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.820
 the second will not be able to override the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.570
 first 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.590
 2, the employee is prohibited from working under 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.120
 the orders of relatives up to third degree 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.100
 when it is a matter of mediating 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.079
 except when it is a function of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.390
 immediate confidence and free choice 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.420
 not exceeding 3 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.409
 auxiliaries in areas with this condition 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:11.820
 would be right 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:16.650
 if it were high school here and here 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.380
 It would also be 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.729
 The question is right now is it true 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.890
 employee to work under the orders of 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.689
 relatives up to second degree 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.820
 except when it is a function of 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.460
 immediate confidence and free choice 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.170
 not exceeding two, the number of 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:38.850
 under such conditions then that 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:41.850
 it is nepotism, there can only be relatives 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.520
 up to the second degree in a maximum of two 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.020
 increases by 2 when the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.390
 instant trust only 2 that are 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.680
 162 judge the following statement 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.750

 public prosecution will be disciplined 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.439
 exclusively by this law is right 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.439
 or wrong 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.500
 if you scored wrong you hit 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.680
 Article 28 says that the provision of 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.660

 teachers and even ministry 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:34.330
 continue to be governed by the 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.240
 by special laws 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.370

 teaching applied prosecution 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.360
 subsidiarily the provisions of that 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.000
 status so that the 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.380
 gaps left by special laws 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:01.620
 will be deleted here because they will be supplied 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:04.450
 by this statute by this law 86 963 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:10.239
 analysis statements the same way below 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:12.730
 you will read and give your answer already 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:16.360
 marked and it is said that they are only here type of 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:20.650
 benefit is typical then the alternative 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.030
 correct the letter is the letter only 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.860
 first one is correct 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.290
 let's give a state rate boost 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.260
 to record rafael clothing is remuneration 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.600

 resource requirements or titles 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:41.470
 functional life tax or 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.989
 state rate can not be deducted from 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.900
 employee bonus compensation

 concerning functional life does not confuse 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.980
 with that guarantee of some positions here 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.290
 negative rate boost can not now 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.660
 two conviction of availability 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.700

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.430
 suffer tax rebate 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.810
 or current rates when determined by 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.989
 decree a power regulation 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.290
 executive not what is correct let 's go 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.810
 there we will see only single paragraph 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:20.140
 maturity and availability 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.690
 retirement benefits shall not be

 State taxes or fees then do not 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.920
 can one who go out of their unit 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.990
 house receiving proportional or proceeds 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.440
 what is the salary is the salary of the 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.230

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.360
 state fees 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.900
 we are talking about taxes or fees 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.360
 state 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.210
 I did not say here on consignment of 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.790
 payroll loan which is a 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:59.680
 individual made a bank not taxed or

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.670
 concessions and licenses only produced 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.830
 effects 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.720
 after being signed by the Governor of 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.720
 State is right or wrong 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:32.710
 If you scored wrong, you got it right. 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:36.580
 after published in the official gazette 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:39.490
 effect takes place only after the 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.850
 public advertising is the principle of 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.590
 advertising your car supply 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.840
 when you pass this contest and you 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:50.080
 Go pass, you guys did it. 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:55.060
 in a high level course you will pass 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:58.750
 in this contest then it's just going to be just goes 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:02.320
 take effect will only be effective your 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:08.170
 appointed following publication in the 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:11.140
 official judge the statements to be 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:14.880
 follow in the same way you go to use 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.880
 the video law and its response 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:24.599
 already answered the correct alternative is the 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:27.719
 letter C 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:30.240
 both are correct in cases of 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:32.039
 indemnification to the state farm 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.219
 the official is required to 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:37.800
 once the amount of the injury 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:39.930
 caused by the sun's reach 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.669
 the omission to pay in the 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.789
 entry of a legal deadline 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:48.569
 We talk, this is a lot there in class. 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:51.120
 theory is if you are in doubt one 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:51.809
 look there at the time we spoke that 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.779
 subject matter 

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:57.059
 in this matter here wait for one 

00:06:54.779 --> 00:07:00.270
 in the case of compensation to the farm 

00:06:57.059 --> 00:07:02.219
 state and two out of the cases of 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.039
 damage caused by 

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:06.870
 embezzlement in making the 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:10.439
 collection based on legal deadlines 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:12.710
 the importance of compensation may be 

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:15.990
 deducted from the salary or remuneration 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:18.990
 not receiving the fifth part of his 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:23.639
 net amount to its fifth part 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:28.219
 so save that too 

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:30.599
 we speak very well there in the theoretical class 

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:37.649
 so here folks we're closing more 

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:40.680
 a work to that of the law 8,009 bar 52 and 

00:07:37.649 --> 00:07:42.149
