00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:33.050
 find the printable instructions of the 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:35.420
 ticket also on the link in the info first 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.890
 of all we take a basic card 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.890
 which we cut measure 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.100
 we fold it in half 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.180
 and we calculate the center of the part 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.430
 external 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.430
 marking it with a pencil cross 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.520
 now let's take a compass and with 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.080
 an opening of three and a half centimeters 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.080
 we draw the circle 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:42.170
 with a cutter we remove the circle 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.170
 tracing the outline 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.310
 now take a decorated theme card 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.310
 Christmassy 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.400
 we trace the center with the same 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.290
 first proceeding we create a forum 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.290
 circular of the same size 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.180
 we add double-sided tape for 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.210
 the next operation and we leave from 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.210
 part 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.450
 meanwhile with a Christmas stamp too 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:17.290
 with a greeting phrase we realize the 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.220
 print through the hole made in 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.580
 so be assured that you will see well 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.560
 so we get a piece of acetate 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.610
 and after having returned with tape 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:34.990
 double-sided we apply it over the base 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.150
 initial covering the flight and doing 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.530
 be careful not to see traces of 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.530
 double-sided adhesive tape 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.860
 now we can close everything with the 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:54.200
 cardboard decorated earlier than that 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.709
 will hide the acetate creating a 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.709
 window 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.829
 The time has come to decorate me 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:22.500
 use of the paper balls I have 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:24.990
 decorated with glitter and I go to 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.560
 place in the edge of the circle with 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.560
 of the bi-adhesive 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:40.409
 now I take Christmas flowers always 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:44.400
 glitterati and after having nets 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.400
 three-dimensional by folding the petals 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.450
 lincoln in the empty spaces between the balls 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.199
 in this way complete and the garland 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.060
 I add the brilliant central of the flowers 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.720
 let's not forget to let the people know 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.750
 recipients of our tickets 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.680
 Christmas cards that were made with 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.680
 our hands 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.220
 I hope you enjoyed the project 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.220
 to the next 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:05.389
 ready
