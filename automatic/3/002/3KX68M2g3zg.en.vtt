00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
how I do this and I basically just start

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.950 
how I do this and I basically just start
off<00:00:32.369> by<00:00:32.550> putting<00:00:32.759> my<00:00:32.969> leave<00:00:33.239> out<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.719> nice

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
off by putting my leave out in a nice

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.420 
off by putting my leave out in a nice
little<00:00:34.200> braid<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> front<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.219> doesn't

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
little braid in the front so it doesn't

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.110 
little braid in the front so it doesn't
get<00:00:35.489> frizzy<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.180> puffy<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:37.559> wild<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.640> I

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
get frizzy and puffy and just wild so I

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.119 
get frizzy and puffy and just wild so I
just<00:00:39.600> take<00:00:39.870> my<00:00:40.079> hair<00:00:40.260> out<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> bun<00:00:40.890> from

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
just take my hair out of the bun from

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:41.810

the<00:00:41.280> night<00:00:41.399> before

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the night before

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.170 
the night before
and<00:00:42.059> clearly<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.320> not<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:44.059> acceptable<00:00:45.059> to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
and clearly it is not like acceptable to

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.660 
and clearly it is not like acceptable to
go<00:00:45.300> out<00:00:45.480> with<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.170> I'm<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:47.070> gonna<00:00:47.250> shake<00:00:47.489> it

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.080 
go out with so I'm just gonna shake it
out<00:00:47.820> obviously<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:49.670> do<00:00:50.670> something<00:00:51.030> about

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
out obviously and do something about

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.569 
out obviously and do something about
that<00:00:51.390> because<00:00:52.010> I'm<00:00:53.010> not<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.399> outside

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
that because I'm not going outside

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.939 
that because I'm not going outside
looking<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.390> okay<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.320> basically<00:00:55.739> I

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
looking like that okay so basically I

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.470 
looking like that okay so basically I
start<00:00:56.250> off<00:00:56.370> my<00:00:56.550> finger<00:00:56.969> combing<00:00:57.239> my<00:00:57.449> hair

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
because I'm not going to use a brush or

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.939 
because I'm not going to use a brush or
a<00:00:59.520> comb<00:00:59.640> or<00:01:00.149> anything<00:01:00.449> because<00:01:00.989> one<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.649> don't

just run my fingers through it until I

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.020 
just run my fingers through it until I
feel<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.229> pretty<00:01:13.619> good<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.159> it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
feel like it's pretty good and it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.300 
feel like it's pretty good and it
doesn't<00:01:15.270> look<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.390> bad<00:01:15.659> right<00:01:15.869> now<00:01:16.020> but<00:01:16.409> it's

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
doesn't look that bad right now but it's

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.850 
doesn't look that bad right now but it's
definitely<00:01:17.970> not<00:01:18.270> ready<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.049> take<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> spray

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
definitely not ready so I take a spray

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.670 
definitely not ready so I take a spray
bottle<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.610> some<00:01:20.759> water<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.680> I

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
bottle with just some water in it and I

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.090 
bottle with just some water in it and I
spray<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.340> all<00:01:23.820> over<00:01:23.880> my<00:01:24.420> hair<00:01:25.040> okay<00:01:26.040> so

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
spray it all over my hair okay so

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.830 
spray it all over my hair okay so
sometimes<00:01:26.460> using<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.060> spray<00:01:27.330> bottle<00:01:27.540> is

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
sometimes using the spray bottle is

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.630 
sometimes using the spray bottle is
usually<00:01:28.170> enough<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.530> me<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.460> go

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
kind of kind of come back to life

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.490 
kind of kind of come back to life
so<00:02:11.060> in<00:02:11.210> my<00:02:11.330> first<00:02:11.600> review<00:02:11.780> I<00:02:11.960> did<00:02:12.050> say<00:02:12.380> that

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
so in my first review I did say that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.750 
so in my first review I did say that
this<00:02:12.620> hair<00:02:12.830> was<00:02:13.010> pretty<00:02:13.460> high-maintenance

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
this hair was pretty high-maintenance

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.760 
this hair was pretty high-maintenance
but<00:02:14.390> now<00:02:14.570> that<00:02:14.720> I've<00:02:14.810> gotten<00:02:15.020> used<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.620> and

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
but now that I've gotten used to it and

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.470 
but now that I've gotten used to it and
the<00:02:15.890> hair<00:02:16.040> has<00:02:16.160> gotten<00:02:16.430> older<00:02:16.760> I<00:02:17.000> would<00:02:17.270> say

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
the hair has gotten older I would say

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.900 
the hair has gotten older I would say
that<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.020> is<00:02:18.050> actually<00:02:18.560> low-maintenance

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
that it is actually low-maintenance

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.940 
that it is actually low-maintenance
it<00:02:20.450> takes<00:02:20.690> me<00:02:20.840> just<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.170> couple<00:02:21.410> minutes<00:02:21.650> to

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
it takes me just a couple minutes to

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.710 
it takes me just a couple minutes to
style<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:22.610> I<00:02:22.670> really<00:02:22.970> don't<00:02:23.150> have<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.330> do<00:02:23.480> much

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
style and I really don't have to do much

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.270 
style and I really don't have to do much
to<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.960> except<00:02:24.320> for<00:02:24.470> this<00:02:24.560> routine<00:02:24.980> that<00:02:25.040> I'm

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.600 
at the sink I just take a towel and dry
off<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.260> ends<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.650> my<00:02:30.680> hair<00:02:30.830> so<00:02:31.100> then<00:02:31.490> it

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
off the ends of my hair so then it

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.210 
off the ends of my hair so then it
doesn't<00:02:31.880> drip<00:02:32.090> everywhere<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:33.070> just<00:02:34.070> make

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
doesn't drip everywhere and just make

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.950 
doesn't drip everywhere and just make
sure<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.490> scrunch<00:02:34.880> your<00:02:35.000> hair<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.480> not<00:02:35.570> pull

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
down on it so then the curls will kind

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.970 
down on it so then the curls will kind
of<00:02:38.600> just<00:02:38.780> sit<00:02:39.020> in<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.290> place<00:02:39.470> that<00:02:39.500> you<00:02:39.680> kind
