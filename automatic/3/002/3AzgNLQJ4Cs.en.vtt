00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.550
 new staff so my son who is 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.200
 became its multi elements form and I 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.570
 you presented immediately we stuff 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.960
 with firstly as cov the hoe 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.470
 pace is therefore 385 vitality 50 of 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.990
 chances 52 power 10 damage and 16 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.189
 of bp if it remains we know it is 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.570
 especially for the power I took 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.759
 a coffee and no and vitality 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.800
 then as cac I have the hd game in 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.370
 so give that type in four elements 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.969
 the neutral fire the water and the air that me 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.969
 give a pe of wisdom and 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.430
 vitality of the damage so here I am 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.760
 level is pretty good I was waiting 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.930
 next cap can use them 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:59.309
 mugenot ppm good that's pretty much mac 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.800
 no cape that gives 200 of vitality 44 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:07.049
 of wisdom 52 critical strike power 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.390
 and is it plouay and damage in 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.040
 all elements ie neutral 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.350
 land fire water and air with good ago 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.750
 a few males in the summer pastures ppm and 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.159
 resistances too 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.119
 then good trap where one is dead 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.710
 on the hunt and finds me sorry but 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.890
 I think I was changing for a 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.930
 army strap that will give me 50 of 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.829
 power too and 5% resistance a 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.640
 little everywhere it will be better I think 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:41.640
 then the hoe emulates is therefore his 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.610
 business card and 50 chance 40's 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.829
 power a pea if damage from the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.149
 first edile of the initiative a name that 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.470
 This is important because when we 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.390
 power we really do not have much 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.210
 of initiatives so try to recover 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.579
 these are the best 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.530
 a ring obstinating a ring that n 202 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.990
 vitality five years of power I was 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:06.380
 quite astonished here is 33 of wisdom 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.660
 this is the belt tories so for this 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.060
 who is the belt and boots 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.450
 I hesitated a lot it was hard enough to 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.099
 find out here I do not have focus we're going 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.910
 say the power but rather the 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:23.060
 basic features so the gemmi 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.709
 intelligence and luck and on the boots 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.130
 who make an herti boot I did 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:32.209
 very wise idea here you go it was for 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.580
 compensate so here and then and 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.430
 new trophies so from one of the 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.200
 update that I'm successful at kraft so 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.209
 the fierce major so 12 damage in 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.220
 all the senses but a harm of 24 damage 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.130
 critics and I'm going to do that in 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.069
 normal also the damage in all 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.720
 elements and -12 damage the 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.519
 robust that interests me and who 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.140
 interests me the most it is only 80 of 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.900
 power ie 80 in all 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.780
 mermize elements from -12 still critical 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.700
 and their normal bus so 42 power 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.450
 mass of criticism of which I 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.489
 showed right away 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.930
 characteristics 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:10.790
 here you go to detail 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.970
 so we see characteristic level 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.209
 primary I do not have much of a gym 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.350
 I happen are in all the mistakes 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.519
 to not assist my booty so 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:25.630
 the initiative is really not much 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.630
 1155 my prospection 236 here 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.599
 so here are ten pairs at 6pm good it's me 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:36.599
 allows a good mobility the 6 pm with 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:38.159
 4971 of life points yes and so we are going 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.319
 of the 100 lowest is where that material 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:43.560
 was therefore 331 of power that is to say 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:48.900
 331 of primary characteristics in 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:51.060
 all the worlds 22 normal damage and 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.599
 enfield damage in all 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:59.340
 lovers so 29-year-old 37 earthed 25 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:01.680
 24 years old noÃ© 31Ã¨me so this is 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.720
 thanks mostly to the trophy trophies that 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.970
 I did and so I will show you 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.659
 what is it about the putsch and 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.510
 his parts away so driving on 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:15.239
 a 1950 coup 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:19.349
 so I'm going to show you our boost and 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:22.049
 after boostec fury we type directly 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:25.259
 well, it's great a critical failure 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:30.360
 first we'll wait, let's go 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:32.789
 here we are absent we will say and so here 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.070
 about ten thousand four hundred 400 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:37.260
 course so now we'll get 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.419
 booster to the fury 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.949
 we'll do that for two three laps 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.669
 I think to be well said I think 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:49.940
 three rounds to still do pretty bad 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:52.080
 hop go on to make them part needle 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.240
 no uhry act that is the fate that has 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.400
 have been increased the damage you 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.210
 can have one of my videos from 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.530
 let's talk about it 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.820
 the first episode so who talks about it 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:07.700
 so here is the last round of booster 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:11.220
 after I slap and 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:16.860
 this is for one last fury and my 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:18.840
 mastery and then it's gone a what 954 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.570
 in almost 1000 health points in one 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:27.690
 single shot and after that will continue 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:28.950
 still the a831 and 800 votes that's 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.740
 still pretty big shots 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.690
 with this age it's really hurting 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.880
 knowing that there are also punishments 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:40.050
 sacrieur so here is agile punishment 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.580
 daring and spiritual and therefore forced in addition 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.280
 of fury it can be really 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.700
 something huge huge belly 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.190
 so that's it so I hope you'll have 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.490
 enjoyed this presentation at e3
