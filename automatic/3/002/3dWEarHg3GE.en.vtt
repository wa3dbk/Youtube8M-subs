00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.320
 on the road today I can do everything again 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.180
 today go along with you creperie bar 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.360
 suzet in all dad 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.550
 creperie bar craps pancakes so me 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.870
 love pancakes and that's why I have 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.119
 super excited 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.520
 michael the owner of the creperie body 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.000
 or me and so you also learn how 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.500
 being able to make claps at home so me 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.039
 I am very curious to save a lot 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.059
 fancy 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.059
 so the hammer 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:42.440
 hi this is maikel from the cap creperie 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.690
 living in the grandfather and you will leave us our 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.190
 learn for yourself craps range that go 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.079
 you people learn as the difference 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.370
 between a pancake and crap it is 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.870
 actually very simple it is 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.059
 basically the same only it 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.769
 main difference is that there are more 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.749
 eggs and more milk in the batter 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.190
 and I little bit of water making you 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:00.229
 can make much thinner than we can 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.959
 also be it at home in a frying pan 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:05.960
 yes it is possible that it is my question 

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:07.969
 technology and could and then you are real 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.380
 crappy frying pan yes we are standing 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:11.479
 so that you don't have that high edge and 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.390
 bill so very thin line up 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.829
 very easy bakery was must is 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.799
 actually these plates very easily 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:21.289
 always i hereafter everyone joins in from 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.939
 other way in this is how we do from 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.420
 it with a little butter or whole 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.280
 important research that I have here 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.170
 cold batter I am just two 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.490
 types of batter in the avenue 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.020
 around it unlike the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.000
 I need everything with a pancake pancake 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.950
 make no matter what you do you do away 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.259
 our pancakes started more expensive another 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.500
 those two types of batter created 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.620
 for the sweet you just get a 100% wheat 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.820
 batter and for the 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.020
 hearty right is a book when it is 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.640
 very different cereals is also no 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.230
 good thing 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.610
 just as you see it actually took 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.160
 by imposing in beautiful in the middle of the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.450
 match enamel gently thin skin 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.780
 I can now see very beautiful indeed 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.580
 if I pick up palette knives for k 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.170
 for the time viewing something more difficult though 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.360
 you see it is baseboard dries 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.920
 planting machine through it is so thin and 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.649
 so he becomes a bit along the edge 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.790
 thinner you become also very crisp 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.320
 issambres so you get a light crispy 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.480
 you there is the inside stay nice 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.640
 soft and 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.900
 and just get used to the structure 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.760
 of a pancake indeed and the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.130
 exterior is then really paper thin 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.920
 nice and crispy when you are really dry 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.580
 get loose with me if you butter well 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.230
 done 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:35.880
 he is so beautiful and easy 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.820
 certainly in london and it really is 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.709
 and then you have a basis 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.360
 crap we could tell them no, I can 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.040
 do anything you like you can 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.940
 different kind of caramel do chocolate 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.340
 paste for sweet with slaughtering of this 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.799
 this is the sweet batter 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.600
 I don't know where you relate today 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.480
 We understand you have to tell term 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.580
 of nutella that is of course a cafe 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.640
 without beer is like a chicken special now 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.340
 count that that just doesn't exist 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.720
 less of a little bit 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.580
 So therefore actually quite easy 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.220
 close where you see also the chocolate 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.310
 his buyers arrange very well is yes at 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:19.980
 him past him so close to a kitchen 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:22.080
 mark rut something the point this way 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.640
 Screen crashing ready is very easy 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.200
 seems very mag a johan corpse 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.550
 self-proclaimed anna 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.880
 well that we will soon experience 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.740
 easy a lot harder this would be 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.360
 is the nutella app we want tasty 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.500
 powdered sugar and what 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.510
 strawberries 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:45.560
 you mark a taste or that I myself 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:45.560
 a the snake yes then you become very north 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.420
 her previous sweet 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.069
 just 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.360
 also really what is not that is not bad 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.100
 besides not really true at all 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.860
 now want the construction of two 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.300
 don't press too hard 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.300
 Oh dear 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.400
 olive oil had a lump the first 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.760
 Equal did not sound good 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.820
 mileage had to be done at once 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.820
 attempt 3 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:55.939
 today do 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.979
 no worse no it really knows nothing 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.900
 when holes appear indeed 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.650
 very much and looked abound in seized 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.760
 tractors completes the two illegally 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.760
 crucial point e 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.150
 which you can use at home some of this 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.500
 I also just go home garden and kitchen 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.890
 versions of a 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.840
 12 ok they just walked out to buy 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.540

 ok but they are for sale ok yes 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.810

 turning so put down yes look look look 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:47.030
 look look do it again or something like that 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:51.020
 little karma 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:54.790
 yes he is a tram round on who you go 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.790

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.000
 j look like you your 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:08.120
 look this is him well as you saw there was 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.909
 not very easy to track 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.919
 make yourself a bit of practice 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:14.900
 well the tip you gave 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:16.819
 think until everyone can learn it 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.530
 anyone can learn believe me brenda 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:20.720
 can also learn that see a half 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.250
 walk around slowly for an hour than the chance 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.159
 bake in red 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.440
 yes different if your times are near 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:28.909
 Alkmaar forgot to stop by already 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.060
