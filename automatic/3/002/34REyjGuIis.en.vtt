doesn't<00:03:33.420> scratch<00:03:33.960> and<00:03:34.440> I'm<00:03:34.560> well<00:03:34.950> let's<00:03:35.160> have

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
doesn't scratch and I'm well let's have

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.790 
doesn't scratch and I'm well let's have
a<00:03:35.310> look<00:03:35.460> so<00:03:35.760> take<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.570> off<00:03:36.750> here<00:03:36.990> as<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.770> can

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
a look so take it off here as you can

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.100 
a look so take it off here as you can
see<00:03:38.100> it's<00:03:38.640> actually<00:03:39.000> quite<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.240> tight<00:03:39.600> fit<00:03:39.870> and

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
see it's actually quite a tight fit and

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.140 
see it's actually quite a tight fit and
it<00:03:40.410> does<00:03:40.590> have<00:03:40.860> some<00:03:41.040> rubberized<00:03:41.520> internals

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
it does have some rubberized internals

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.280 
it does have some rubberized internals
there<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.510> make<00:03:42.600> sure<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:42.990> it<00:03:43.110> doesn't

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
there to make sure that it doesn't

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.110 
there to make sure that it doesn't
scrape<00:03:43.620> against<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.100> because<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.850> last<00:03:45.000> thing

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
scrape against it because the last thing

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.700 
scrape against it because the last thing
you<00:03:45.270> want<00:03:45.450> is<00:03:45.570> to<00:03:45.600> harm<00:03:46.170> some<00:03:46.560> of<00:03:46.650> these

we've<00:03:49.950> got<00:03:50.070> these<00:03:50.250> two<00:03:50.550> slots<00:03:50.940> here<00:03:51.240> which

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
we've got these two slots here which

no real chance of it not going into
place<00:03:56.340> right<00:03:56.550> away<00:03:56.670> we've<00:03:57.000> done<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.180> 20<00:03:57.720> x<00:03:57.930> 30

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
place right away we've done that 20 x 30

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.160 
place right away we've done that 20 x 30
x<00:03:58.740> i<00:03:59.160> simply<00:03:59.760> got<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.330> not<00:04:00.750> once<00:04:00.960> have<00:04:01.140> we

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
x i simply got it and not once have we

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.800 
x i simply got it and not once have we
scratch<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.680> machine<00:04:01.980> itself<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:03.540> second

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810

question<00:04:03.930> was<00:04:04.200> about<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.500> charging<00:04:04.920> cable

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
question was about the charging cable

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.270 
question was about the charging cable
what<00:04:06.300> length<00:04:06.570> was<00:04:06.780> it<00:04:06.960> and<00:04:07.530> what<00:04:07.770> it<00:04:07.950> of<00:04:08.070> a

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
what length was it and what it of a

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.520 
what length was it and what it of a
sufficient<00:04:09.090> length<00:04:09.240> to<00:04:09.480> be<00:04:09.570> able<00:04:09.690> to<00:04:10.020> connect

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
sufficient length to be able to connect

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.440 
sufficient length to be able to connect
up<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.710> a<00:04:10.830> power<00:04:11.040> point<00:04:11.190> all<00:04:11.340> day<00:04:11.460> every<00:04:11.700> day<00:04:11.730> so

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
up to a power point all day every day so

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.330 
up to a power point all day every day so
it's<00:04:12.660> actually<00:04:12.930> just<00:04:13.110> a<00:04:13.260> simple<00:04:13.590> USB<00:04:13.830> cable

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
it's actually just a simple USB cable

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.780 
it's actually just a simple USB cable
fairly<00:04:14.790> long<00:04:14.990> about<00:04:15.990> one<00:04:16.260> meter<00:04:16.500> now<00:04:17.130> not<00:04:17.640> the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
fairly long about one meter now not the

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.190 
fairly long about one meter now not the
length<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:18.150> probably<00:04:18.420> want<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.720> have<00:04:18.900> it<00:04:19.020> as<00:04:19.109> a

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
length you probably want to have it as a

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.990 
length you probably want to have it as a
permanent<00:04:19.470> or<00:04:19.830> replacement<00:04:20.310> desktop<00:04:20.700> machine

but<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.600> be<00:04:21.630> honest<00:04:22.020> being<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.320> tablet<00:04:22.710> it's

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
but to be honest being a tablet it's

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.260 
but to be honest being a tablet it's
going<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.340> be<00:04:23.490> out<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:23.730> about<00:04:23.820> it's<00:04:24.090> going<00:04:24.210> to

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
going to be out and about it's going to

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.030 
going to be out and about it's going to
be<00:04:24.330> portable<00:04:24.660> it<00:04:25.170> comes<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.530> this<00:04:25.620> adapter

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
be portable it comes to this adapter

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.680 
be portable it comes to this adapter
here<00:04:26.220> so<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.520> USB<00:04:26.850> goes<00:04:27.090> in<00:04:27.210> here<00:04:27.390> and<00:04:27.540> for

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
here so the USB goes in here and for

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.250 
here so the USB goes in here and for
project<00:04:27.990> connection<00:04:28.320> goes<00:04:28.530> into<00:04:28.830> the

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
project connection goes into the

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.770 
project connection goes into the
go<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.710> tablet<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:34.000> next<00:04:34.180> question<00:04:34.270> is<00:04:34.540> is

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
go to the tablet the next question is is

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.450 
go to the tablet the next question is is
it<00:04:34.810> solid<00:04:35.110> that<00:04:35.440> it<00:04:35.530> squeak<00:04:35.830> at<00:04:35.950> all<00:04:36.070> well

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
it solid that it squeak at all well

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.950 
it solid that it squeak at all well
again<00:04:36.670> we've<00:04:36.850> been<00:04:36.940> playing<00:04:37.180> with<00:04:37.330> it<00:04:37.390> for<00:04:37.930> the

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
again we've been playing with it for the

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.680 
again we've been playing with it for the
last<00:04:38.200> 24<00:04:38.740> hours<00:04:38.770> almost<00:04:39.550> all<00:04:39.760> of<00:04:40.060> the<00:04:40.180> 24<00:04:40.510> hours

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
last 24 hours almost all of the 24 hours

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.570 
last 24 hours almost all of the 24 hours
and<00:04:41.380> you<00:04:41.470> can<00:04:41.500> see<00:04:41.740> here<00:04:41.980> that<00:04:42.010> there's<00:04:42.430> no

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
and you can see here that there's no

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.940 
and you can see here that there's no
squeaking<00:04:43.030> it's<00:04:43.930> a<00:04:44.020> very<00:04:44.290> very<00:04:44.380> solid<00:04:44.830> machine

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
squeaking it's a very very solid machine

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.170 
squeaking it's a very very solid machine
because<00:04:45.460> it<00:04:45.580> uses<00:04:45.840> this<00:04:46.840> metallized<00:04:48.180> casing

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
because it uses this metallized casing

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.020 
because it uses this metallized casing
it<00:04:49.960> makes<00:04:50.170> it<00:04:50.290> very<00:04:50.500> very<00:04:50.590> sturdy<00:04:51.030> doesn't

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
it makes it very very sturdy doesn't

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.980 
it makes it very very sturdy doesn't
creak<00:04:52.300> doesn't<00:04:53.290> squeak<00:04:54.210> it's<00:04:55.210> a<00:04:55.390> very<00:04:55.570> solid

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
creak doesn't squeak it's a very solid

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.850 
creak doesn't squeak it's a very solid
non<00:04:56.770> squeaking<00:04:57.220> machine<00:04:58.620> the<00:04:59.620> next<00:04:59.800> question

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
non squeaking machine the next question

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.830 
non squeaking machine the next question
was<00:05:00.130> finger<00:05:00.580> people<00:05:00.790> resistant<00:05:01.180> yeah<00:05:01.630> look

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
was finger people resistant yeah look

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.360 
was finger people resistant yeah look
it's<00:05:01.930> actually<00:05:02.230> very<00:05:02.260> very<00:05:02.530> good<00:05:02.950> size<00:05:03.160> people
