hi i'm steven from liberia and this is

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.289 
hi i'm steven from liberia and this is
the<00:00:12.730> easy<00:00:13.480> utility<00:00:14.320> stand<00:00:14.879> it<00:00:15.879> looks<00:00:16.059> like<00:00:16.270> a

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
the easy utility stand it looks like a

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.800 
the easy utility stand it looks like a
lot<00:00:16.599> of<00:00:16.630> simple<00:00:17.439> stands<00:00:17.800> you<00:00:17.890> may<00:00:18.040> have<00:00:18.189> seen

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
lot of simple stands you may have seen

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.870 
lot of simple stands you may have seen
but<00:00:19.810> there's<00:00:19.960> one<00:00:20.110> important<00:00:20.710> difference

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
but there's one important difference

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.229 
but there's one important difference
most<00:00:21.880> stairs<00:00:22.150> like<00:00:22.390> that<00:00:22.710> will<00:00:23.710> attach<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:25.150> the

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:25.239 
most stairs like that will attach to the

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.179 
most stairs like that will attach to the

releases<00:00:27.520> now<00:00:28.360> that's<00:00:28.570> fine<00:00:28.869> but<00:00:29.230> sometimes

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:29.649 
releases now that's fine but sometimes

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.170 
releases now that's fine but sometimes
can<00:00:29.800> be<00:00:29.890> quite<00:00:29.919> clumsy<00:00:30.579> to<00:00:30.669> get<00:00:30.790> on<00:00:30.939> and<00:00:31.119> off

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
can be quite clumsy to get on and off

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.310 
can be quite clumsy to get on and off
particularly<00:00:31.630> as<00:00:31.810> there<00:00:31.930> are<00:00:32.020> different

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
particularly as there are different

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.740 
particularly as there are different
different<00:00:33.160> widths<00:00:33.520> and<00:00:33.730> different<00:00:33.940> types<00:00:34.570> of

different widths and different types of
quick<00:00:34.960> releases<00:00:35.290> and<00:00:36.010> idea<00:00:36.520> we've<00:00:36.700> solved

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
quick releases and idea we've solved

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.150 
quick releases and idea we've solved
that<00:00:37.239> problem<00:00:37.420> by<00:00:37.809> putting<00:00:38.770> the<00:00:38.860> stand

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
that problem by putting the stand

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.250 
that problem by putting the stand
underneath<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:40.059> bike<00:00:40.239> chain<00:00:40.269> stage<00:00:40.960> like

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
underneath the bike chain stage like

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.790 
underneath the bike chain stage like
this<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.850> let's<00:00:43.030> just<00:00:43.239> see<00:00:43.510> take<00:00:44.289> the<00:00:44.320> bike<00:00:44.590> off

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
this so let's just see take the bike off

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.880 
this so let's just see take the bike off
and<00:00:45.780> put<00:00:46.780> it<00:00:46.870> back<00:00:47.019> on<00:00:48.210> very<00:00:49.210> simple<00:00:49.719> okay<00:00:50.679> you

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
and put it back on very simple okay you

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.889 
and put it back on very simple okay you
don't<00:00:51.070> have<00:00:51.160> to<00:00:51.280> worry<00:00:51.519> about<00:00:51.809> mucking<00:00:52.809> around

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
don't have to worry about mucking around

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:53.989 
don't have to worry about mucking around
with<00:00:53.170> it

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
with it

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:57.930 
with it
the<00:00:54.999> iberia<00:00:55.600> is<00:00:55.929> utility<00:00:56.800> stand<00:00:57.070> is<00:00:57.309> great<00:00:57.670> for

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
the iberia is utility stand is great for

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.200 
the iberia is utility stand is great for
repair<00:00:58.359> you<00:00:58.749> can<00:00:58.960> turn<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.129> wheel<00:01:00.280> you<00:01:01.179> can

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
repair you can turn the wheel you can

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.750 
repair you can turn the wheel you can
use<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.659> gears<00:01:01.899> so<00:01:02.559> you<00:01:02.649> can<00:01:02.800> adjust<00:01:03.100> you<00:01:03.249> just

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
use the gears so you can adjust you just

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.230 
use the gears so you can adjust you just
the<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:05.350> your<00:01:05.500> gears<00:01:05.710> or<00:01:06.040> oil<00:01:06.610> chain<00:01:07.030> do

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
the the just your gears or oil chain do

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.210 
the the just your gears or oil chain do
anything<00:01:07.570> you<00:01:07.630> like<00:01:07.659> it's<00:01:08.020> also<00:01:08.140> great<00:01:08.530> too<00:01:08.950> if

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
anything you like it's also great too if

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.640 
anything you like it's also great too if
you<00:01:10.090> just<00:01:10.330> want<00:01:10.510> to<00:01:10.570> park<00:01:10.810> it<00:01:10.930> at<00:01:11.050> home<00:01:11.260> a<00:01:11.470> place

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
you just want to park it at home a place

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.460 
you just want to park it at home a place
to<00:01:12.340> put<00:01:12.549> it<00:01:12.640> where<00:01:12.790> it<00:01:12.880> won't<00:01:12.970> fall<00:01:13.240> over<00:01:13.600> or<00:01:13.780> if

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
to put it where it won't fall over or if

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.170 
to put it where it won't fall over or if
you're<00:01:14.680> a<00:01:14.710> bike<00:01:15.009> shop<00:01:15.340> where<00:01:15.759> you<00:01:15.790> go<00:01:15.939> into<00:01:16.149> a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
you're a bike shop where you go into a

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.569 
you're a bike shop where you go into a
bike<00:01:16.420> show<00:01:16.780> it's<00:01:17.290> a<00:01:17.530> great<00:01:17.770> way<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:17.950> display<00:01:18.399> a

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
bike show it's a great way to display a

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.780 
bike show it's a great way to display a
bike<00:01:18.880> as<00:01:19.090> well<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.560> let's<00:01:20.950> have<00:01:21.070> a<00:01:21.100> look<00:01:21.280> now<00:01:21.310> at

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
bike as well so let's have a look now at

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.330 
bike as well so let's have a look now at
how<00:01:22.060> adjustable<00:01:22.780> stand<00:01:23.110> is<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.860> first<00:01:27.100> thing

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
how adjustable stand is the first thing

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.310 
how adjustable stand is the first thing
is<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.950> it's<00:01:30.100> height<00:01:30.310> adjustable<00:01:30.909> so<00:01:31.600> if

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
is is that it's height adjustable so if

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.149 
is is that it's height adjustable so if
you've<00:01:32.500> got<00:01:32.680> a<00:01:33.600> MTB<00:01:34.600> a<00:01:34.630> racing<00:01:35.439> bike<00:01:35.649> it'll<00:01:35.979> fit

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
you've got a MTB a racing bike it'll fit

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.380 
you've got a MTB a racing bike it'll fit
most<00:01:36.399> bikes<00:01:36.670> it<00:01:36.880> doesn't<00:01:37.119> matter

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
most bikes it doesn't matter

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.020 
most bikes it doesn't matter
so<00:01:37.539> can<00:01:37.689> adjust<00:01:37.960> a<00:01:38.049> height<00:01:38.229> just<00:01:38.500> like<00:01:38.649> that

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
so can adjust a height just like that

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.130 
so can adjust a height just like that
very<00:01:40.030> easily<00:01:40.180> and<00:01:40.479> we'll<00:01:40.600> tighten<00:01:40.840> that<00:01:41.079> up

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
very easily and we'll tighten that up

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.400 
very easily and we'll tighten that up
but<00:01:41.469> not<00:01:41.560> all<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.829> way

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.710 

and<00:01:46.410> now<00:01:46.530> we<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.830> micro<00:01:47.220> adjustments<00:01:47.880> so

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
and now we have the micro adjustments so

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.470 
and now we have the micro adjustments so
this<00:01:48.870> is<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.470> fit<00:01:49.680> different<00:01:50.130> bikes

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
this is so you can fit different bikes

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.850 
this is so you can fit different bikes
for<00:01:51.480> example<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.870> chain<00:01:52.110> stays<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.650> bikes

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
for example the chain stays and bikes

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.090 
for example the chain stays and bikes
are<00:01:53.370> often<00:01:53.730> very<00:01:54.030> different<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:55.530> tubing<00:01:55.950> can

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
are often very different the tubing can

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.270 
are often very different the tubing can
be<00:01:56.190> different<00:01:56.520> size<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.030> we<00:01:57.860> we<00:01:58.860> tackle<00:01:59.250> that

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
be different size and we we tackle that

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.420 
be different size and we we tackle that
problem<00:01:59.400> by<00:02:00.030> having<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:01.560> 3-way<00:02:01.950> micro

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
problem by having the 3-way micro

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.420 
problem by having the 3-way micro
adjustment<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.810> first<00:02:04.050> way<00:02:04.260> is<00:02:04.290> width<00:02:04.830> so

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
adjustment the first way is width so

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.010 
adjustment the first way is width so
this<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.790> move<00:02:05.910> in<00:02:06.120> or<00:02:06.240> out<00:02:06.390> for<00:02:06.930> different

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
this can move in or out for different

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.660 
this can move in or out for different
widths<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.680> second<00:02:08.280> way<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.750> they<00:02:09.750> rotate

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
widths the second way is they rotate

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.210 
widths the second way is they rotate
front<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.850> back<00:02:12.110> for<00:02:13.110> different<00:02:13.410> angles<00:02:13.500> and

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
front and back for different angles and

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.960 
front and back for different angles and
also<00:02:14.730> they<00:02:15.270> rotate<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.530> way<00:02:16.740> as<00:02:16.950> well<00:02:16.980> that

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970
