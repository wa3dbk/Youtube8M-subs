00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
important they're almost almost

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.710 
important they're almost almost
secondary<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.670> actual<00:04:14.060> practical

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.350 

application<00:04:17.720> of<00:04:17.870> this<00:04:18.050> is<00:04:19.330> far<00:04:20.330> more

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.360 
application of this is far more

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.330 
application of this is far more
