00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello I'm just the handmade and have 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.670
 today a great idea for the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.160
 Valentine's Day for you and indeed do 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.000
 we beautiful envelopes themselves and can there 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.160
 you then for example vouchers 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.660
 go in for a cinema night or for 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.310
 a common meal for this goal 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.690
 does not need much material that 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.460
 you will most of you anyway 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.850
 you need it at home 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.529
 pretty paper a ruler quite normal 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.019
 a glue to a pencil to 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.630
 draw a marker in front of one 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.070
 message an eraser then needs 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.110
 her normal envelopes as 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.940
 Template for the form and pretty 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.350
 Tape first you have to get one 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.570
 Template for the form of the envelope 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.890
 and I just take one for that 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.579
 normal envelope and we take 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.579
 first of each other 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.420
 so now we have our template and 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.440
 not the paper on this sheet 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.210
 I have to fit that first 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.520
 enlarge and two pieces of paper 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.899
 sticking each other when their patterned 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.420
 have papers like me then look at 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.989
 best that the pattern is also beautiful 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.989
 attaches 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.600
 Now you have a nice piece of paper 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.700
 and you can turn that around him 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:17.390
 now with an envelope as a template 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:20.620
 can record this form and it 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.550
 we can simply cut out the shape 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.080
 now the envelope is made 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.910
 tailored and now we can in 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.530
 every shape brings and folds 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.210
 wrong to teach a lesson 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.080
 then it is easier and the edges 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.080
 be pretty straight 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.490
 now you can already the envelope form 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.930
 recognize and now you are everything 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.490
 stuck together you can think about it 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.840
 how to proceed as I already do 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.670
 an envelope with a message of love 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.350
 I would just have another one now 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.119
 painting a cute picture before I see the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.430
 envelope to stick it the normal 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.990
 Glue stick and behind I still stick 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.010
 with pretty masking tape over it 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.080
 It looks even better and now you can 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.690
 you take the new year again and the 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.190
 upper quick switch now in front of her 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.479
 your envelopes finished and glued 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.070
 folded you can have one 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.390
 disappear love letter in 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.250
 and give the gift for Valentine's Day 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.209
 then have fun imitating and me 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.430
