00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello to all in this video I talk to you 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.350
 of the latest novelty of too faced or 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.139
 the sexy return palette rather than one 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.269
 review in this video I will talk about 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.759
 my first impressions of the product 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.300
 because I bought it a few days ago e 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.730
 I was able to try it only 4 5 times 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.060
 but I think it's a palette that will have 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.119
 quite successful and I have already received 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.400
 some messaggino above all through 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.489
 facebook where you asked me 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.040
 just an opinion on this product 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.969
 consequently I realize this anyway 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.920
 video 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.260
 also because not being in mine 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.420
 usual location where filmo I would have 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.840
 however difficult to make one 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.210
 full review above all I would have 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.730
 difficulty in showing you the swatch 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.610
 live of all colors because I don't have with 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.710
 me all the equipment I use 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.190
 usually just in the videos 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.949
 review 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.649
 let's start immediately to let you see the 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.589
 palette this is the package with 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.750
 which actually comes out is a bit like 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.220
 for the palettes of an urban decay 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.220
 sort of set 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.950
 inside you will find the palette one in 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.200
 italy acs of the primer than in this one 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.229
 case and shodo insurance of to face 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.770
 and you will also find an empty black pencil 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.840
 the professor 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.750
 the packaging is made of plastic 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.430
 shiny black and on the front of the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.159
 palette there is this plastic insert 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.189
 transparent that does a little glass effect 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.860
 on the back of the palette you find the 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.799
 directions with all the names of the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.610
 eyeshadows contained within a 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:45.270
 a snap opening and the inside yes 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.210
 thus presents in the back of the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.130
 cover we have a large mirror 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.090
 rectangular and in the side are 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.640
 located three south cone boards and guardians 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.180
 high make up with these 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.520
 colors 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.799
 we quickly see the cards and the cards 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.500
 therefore they are organized in this way 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.770
 the back is on one side you find the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.920
 complete make-up and on the other side 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.050
 find directions on how 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.390
 will be the day and evening make-up 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.030
 this is an example is that in tones 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.420
 of violet and finally there is that in tones 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.819
 of the gray on the blog you will find the photos 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.880
 also detailed tabs 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.600
 as you can see the maxi pod 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.630
 pod is divided into three macro areas 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.760
 each has five eye shadows in 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.940
 effects each color group 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.590
 the naive icon represents a woman 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.590
 and the seductress 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.330
 all colors present within 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.840
 this 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.840
 they have a bright finish but two 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.880
 this top here that has a soft pink 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.390
 very clear with a matt type finish 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.720
 I'll show you on the fly and instead 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.630
 this color at the bottom right is a 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.910
 micro glitter black which is 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.320
 pretty cute because it's the glitter a 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.320
 blue contrast 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.440
 as I told you most of the 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.750
 Color or ends of the two luminous type 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.480
 predominant ends are shimmer and 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.600
 metallic some colors remind me 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.020
 a little the colors of the hot topics of the 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.270
 dark or have that finish 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.800
 metallic and creamy eyeshadow set that 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.830
 I really like it a lot 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.930
 also in this case I found the 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.270
 softness of the high cia then the 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.310
 waffles are pretty soft when you are 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.489
 go to pick up the product you have to stay 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.100
 be careful because otherwise you will risk to 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.500
 leave a nice groove with the applicator 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.239
 the softness of the czarda translates 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.360
 even in a certain dustiness of the 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.820
 product that turns out a little bit 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.130
 especially fluttering we notice this 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.410
 what with dark colors for curiosity there 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.680
 I also show a little on the fly 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.990
 pigmentation of the pods 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.360
 I believe it is really valid 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.540
 of the beautiful colors for example this 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.660
 purple is beautiful so under this 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.030
 point of view the product is really 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.560
 valid another negative aspect of 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.360
 this palette is just the packaging 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.360
 which is a bit cumbersome and 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.729
 made of a double plastic is 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.440
 heavy and let's say impractical from 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.979
 also carry the mirror 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.500
 can be opened at most at 90 degrees for 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.060
 which is a little awkward to manage 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.400
 when you want to use it 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.200
 during make-up inside the 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.020
 pallets located in this front area 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.800
 you will also find a black pencil and a pencil 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.260
 long lasting waterproof then the pencil 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.430
 presents on the back a 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.430
 child to fade the trait yes 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.390
 presents as a really very black 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.669
 intense with a finish effect a little 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.820
 wet effect a bit glossy reminds me 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:30.000
 a cross between a multi play and the 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.700
 kiko's glossy pencil writes 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.820
 really very good even in the rhyme 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.390
 inner eye and the stroke can 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.099
 to be nuanced I recommend you 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.440
 blend it just a little later 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.529
 the application because otherwise the 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.719
 tract gets fixed 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:51.039
 and it is no longer as soft as you can 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:54.729
 see it fades beautifully with the 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:58.149
 grommet supplied I think the 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:01.149
 question arises spontaneously or as al 

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:03.789
 comparing the perversion of the urban 

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:08.649
 decay then I randomly have the o here 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:11.849
 and I show it to you immediately 

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:15.099
 for a comparison 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:19.329
 I report below that of the to 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:22.509
 make a nuance then as you can 

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:26.499
 see here we have that of the face 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:29.499
 and this is the intensity of urban decay 

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:31.659
 of the black and very much the same thing 

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:34.359
 which changes is a bit the type of finish 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:37.029
 because this of the two face remains a 

00:06:34.359 --> 00:06:39.459
 a bit more lucid while the urban one 

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:41.679
 decay is really very pope effect 

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:44.129
 carbon so if you like a pencil 

00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:48.249
 really very intense very dark 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:50.949
 really hyperpigmented I think the 

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:53.559
 perversion in this case still remains 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:55.809
 at the top of the ranking in conclusion 

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:57.629
 for the moment a palette that I like 

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:59.829
 is that I judge positively 

00:06:57.629 --> 00:07:03.909
 especially because for the price that a 

00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:07.599
 via offers a bit of little things for 44 euros in 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:11.169
 effects you will have as many as 15 eye shadows you will have the 

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:13.839
 coupons with the mini tutorial the format 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:16.359
 of the ACS of the shared shore that being 

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:19.029
 from five grams of it will last quite a while 

00:07:16.359 --> 00:07:21.819
 you will still have a good black pencil 

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:23.409
 very writing also along the rhyme 

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:25.419
 inside the eye though that 

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:27.639
 video may have been useful to me 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:29.939
 Meanwhile I greet you and the next video 

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:29.939
 Hello
