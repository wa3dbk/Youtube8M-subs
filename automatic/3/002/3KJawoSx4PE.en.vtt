along<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.970> way<00:01:54.079> so<00:01:55.079> yeah<00:01:55.920> instead<00:01:56.640> we<00:01:56.819> do

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
along the way so yeah instead we do

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.270 
along the way so yeah instead we do
things<00:01:57.239> like<00:01:57.479> base<00:01:57.810> jump<00:01:58.140> off<00:01:58.319> hotels<00:01:58.920> in
