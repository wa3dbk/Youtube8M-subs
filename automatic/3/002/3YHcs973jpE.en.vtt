00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 so hello and welcome to 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.779
 this new video 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.059
 Today we would like to meet 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.050
 look at us or with the question 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.130
 employ 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.100
 how do I make a usb stick bootable 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.830
 First I want to briefly me 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.710
 my facebook page just shows here 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.600
 fit there official and post here 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.910
 I always go from time to time which is 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.500
 new videos yes also partly things 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.570
 from the everyday life I just like to 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.510
 Yes, I will be glad if you are there 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.460
 Just stop by and then 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.710
 Start now just with the video 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:44.070
 through something we need we need 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.370
 a bootable usb-stick so completely 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.520
 clearly the size here is individual 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.800
 that means what you do 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.309
 Of course you want to do it with the usb stick 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.180
 should the pendrive at least 4 gb 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:05.100
 have windows 7 for example 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:08.490
 yes between 3 and 4 gb then owns 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.869
 you need a medium around the usb stick 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.119
 make it bootable 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.030
 Here we work with the diskpart 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.710
 program which windows already have such 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.119
 you say is available 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.500
 and of course, last but not least 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.080
 operating system either a windows 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.200
 license or a trial version which you 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.270
 then at the very end on your usb stick 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.090
 you can push and then you can 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.630
 so to speak of this usb stick then 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.700
 can boot and then from there 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.380
 want to install operating systems 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.320
 start here with the ones 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.970
 Working steps go to the state and give 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.220
 cmd and then opens here the 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.259
 command line and now you have to 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.759
 call diskpart program for this 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.759
 Let's just type in a disco 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.350
 and in now opens the supplied 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:07.490
 program of windows very briefly why is 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.800
 this video on 720p quite simply therefore 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.060
 then you can say it's the pixel 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.310
 recognize better if I am here now 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.520
 then a full hd video would upload 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.130
 do you have this video in full screen 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.900
 I look and I just think so 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.220
 that's why it's a little better 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.709
 720p okay what we have to do is 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.350
 First of all we have to list 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.250
 Let's use what we have for media 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.610
 have available 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:39.800
 This is what we do about the step 3 list 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:42.080
 disc and now we just see our things 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.239
 which we have installed in our pc 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.910
 with us it is now about the volume 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.680
 four of these have 4gb that's the usb 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.970
 Stick I just connected 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.620
 and we would like to choose now 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.850
 and for that reason I have to go here now 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:05.930
 in step 4 specify so to speak select 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:07.700
 the sticks yes means select the 4th 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.640
 in your case it could be natural now 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.769
 also be volume three or 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.989
 data carrier 1 depending on 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.120
 and here would be for the four then 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.880
 Say that value here 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.850
 i confirm with enter now i have 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.530
 just made a mistake here and must 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.209
 give a select of the 4 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.060
 and that is now the chosen one 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:38.750
 disk and now I can do it again 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:41.239
 which lets the media list 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.360
 disc and now I see through this 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:47.090
 asterisk that I sort of like this 4 gb 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.510
 usb-stick currently selected here 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.220
 we really have to be careful with this 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.200
 diskpart program could be partial 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.430
 really scrape your tight garden and 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.239
 That's why it should be here 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.850
 really take care and now we have to 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.720
 of course this is the volume four 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.180
 clean 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.180
 this is done by the function clean 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.439
 and now the volume has been cleaned up 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.980
 and now we have to on this usb 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:19.840
 stick to create a primary partition 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.840
 this works via the function 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.530
 creator tables 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.440
 we confirm and now became, so to speak 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.570
 The position successfully created now 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.520
 we still need to activate the partition 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.360
 So that's a pc, so to speak , okay 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:46.310
 This position should be active 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.100
 and now of course we have to do this 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:54.280
 format usb stick 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:05:02.389
 this works on the dot 8 format 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:04.400
 fs is equal to vaart 32 and doing it now 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:07.070
 we have a small addition to it and 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.370
 Although we format this volume 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.080
 quick so fast that's sort of 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.000
 actually equally effective and sport 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.810
 Just stop confirming with us here 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.699
 enter and we are already at 100 percent 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.340
 and the volume became successful 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:25.669
 formatted and now we still have to 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.340
 last step for the program 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.720
 instruct to complete the process 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.449
 this works over the function of it 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.940
 his 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:36.979
 we confirm and now the 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.419
 been drive letters to and here 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:43.940
 the window already opens under the 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.410
 removable disk and now we can 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.470
 close the program here 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.830
 we will open the volume once 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:54.590
 and you speak it now here 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.630
 You can set the operating system 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.620
 now just pull in the data here 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:02.449
 who wants to be booted her and he 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.660
 makes just created expensive 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:11.490
 computer then represses depending on the 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:13.170
 like a bios or a mainboard 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:17.010
 the function key is set up 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.850
 usually eg f11 or f2 that always comes 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.160
 on it 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.770
 and then you can choose, so to speak 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:26.670
 which medium you want to boot from 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:28.710
 choose here just the usb stick and 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.420
 then it had to say so with it 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.290
 I thank you for watching me 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.160
 I wish you a nice day 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.160
 makes it good
