the reason for that is this area down

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.100 
the reason for that is this area down
here<00:01:47.370> is<00:01:47.610> called<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.850> gesture<00:01:48.210> area<00:01:48.390> this

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
here is called the gesture area this

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.810 
here is called the gesture area this

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
allows us to do molt's tomorrow most of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.640 
allows us to do molt's tomorrow most of
the<00:01:50.880> navigation<00:01:51.300> from<00:01:52.080> this<00:01:52.260> little<00:01:52.410> area

what<00:04:29.800> we<00:04:29.860> try<00:04:30.040> to<00:04:30.070> do<00:04:30.250> with<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.460> webos<00:04:30.820> is

what we try to do with the webos is

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.730 
what we try to do with the webos is
basically<00:04:31.450> kind<00:04:31.690> of<00:04:31.810> replicate<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.380> desktop

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
basically kind of replicate the desktop

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.710 
basically kind of replicate the desktop
environment<00:04:33.280> but<00:04:33.850> we<00:04:33.970> didn't<00:04:34.180> want<00:04:34.300> it<00:04:34.360> but<00:04:34.390> we

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
environment but we didn't want it but we

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.270 
environment but we didn't want it but we
didn't<00:04:34.930> want<00:04:35.050> to<00:04:35.140> bring<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.590> desktop<00:04:35.950> and<00:04:36.100> try

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
didn't want to bring the desktop and try

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.090 
didn't want to bring the desktop and try
and<00:04:36.400> cram<00:04:36.670> it<00:04:36.820> into<00:04:36.970> a<00:04:37.120> small<00:04:37.480> platform<00:04:38.230> so<00:04:39.040> we

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
and cram it into a small platform so we

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.190 
and cram it into a small platform so we
had<00:04:39.190> to<00:04:39.250> come<00:04:39.400> up<00:04:39.430> with<00:04:39.520> a<00:04:39.640> new<00:04:39.730> metaphor<00:04:40.200> the

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
had to come up with a new metaphor the

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.330 
had to come up with a new metaphor the
metaphor<00:04:41.260> we're<00:04:41.650> using<00:04:41.770> is<00:04:41.920> like<00:04:42.070> a<00:04:42.100> deck<00:04:42.310> of

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
metaphor we're using is like a deck of

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.580 
metaphor we're using is like a deck of
cards<00:04:42.600> so<00:04:43.600> each<00:04:43.750> of<00:04:43.870> these<00:04:43.900> applications<00:04:44.500> that

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
cards so each of these applications that

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.800 
cards so each of these applications that
I've<00:04:44.680> been<00:04:44.770> running<00:04:44.980> are<00:04:45.220> actually<00:04:45.580> cards<00:04:45.940> if

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
I've been running are actually cards if

I press on the center button you can see

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.610 
I press on the center button you can see

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
that that zooms out and reveals a card

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.360 
if I slide left to right right to left
you<00:04:52.990> can<00:04:53.110> see<00:04:53.140> the<00:04:53.650> applications<00:04:54.190> that<00:04:54.220> I'd

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
you can see the applications that I'd

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.540 
you can see the applications that I'd
previously<00:04:54.550> opened<00:04:54.940> now<00:04:55.570> these<00:04:55.690> are<00:04:55.840> all<00:04:55.990> live

what's<00:05:37.510> energy<00:05:37.840> allows<00:05:38.290> us<00:05:38.500> to<00:05:38.590> do<00:05:38.710> basically

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
what's energy allows us to do basically

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.860 
what's energy allows us to do basically
it<00:05:39.280> allows<00:05:39.400> us<00:05:39.700> to<00:05:39.790> tap<00:05:40.030> into<00:05:40.300> the<00:05:40.420> multiple

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
it allows us to tap into the multiple

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.450 
it allows us to tap into the multiple
sources<00:05:41.200> of<00:05:41.320> information<00:05:41.590> that<00:05:41.980> we<00:05:42.100> have<00:05:42.310> it

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
sources of information that we have it

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.610 
sources of information that we have it
lives<00:05:42.640> in<00:05:42.760> the<00:05:43.150> cloud<00:05:43.420> basically<00:05:44.320> on<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.410> web

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
lives in the cloud basically on the web

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.410 
lives in the cloud basically on the web
