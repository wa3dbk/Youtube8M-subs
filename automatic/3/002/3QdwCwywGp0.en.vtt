00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.680

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
so if you wanted to dress up I

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.270 
so if you wanted to dress up I
definitely<00:01:59.960> recommend<00:02:00.289> wearing<00:02:00.860> a<00:02:01.070> dress

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
definitely recommend wearing a dress

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.400 
definitely recommend wearing a dress
this<00:02:01.640> is<00:02:01.759> just<00:02:01.910> a<00:02:02.090> sheer<00:02:02.390> black<00:02:02.630> one<00:02:02.899> and<00:02:03.080> it

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
this is just a sheer black one and it

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.710 
this is just a sheer black one and it
really<00:02:03.649> reminds<00:02:04.039> me<00:02:04.160> of<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.340> holidays<00:02:07.720> I'm

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
really reminds me of the holidays I'm

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.900 
really reminds me of the holidays I'm
wearing<00:02:09.259> tights<00:02:09.530> underneath<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.369> my<00:02:10.670> black

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
wearing tights underneath and my black

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.410 
wearing tights underneath and my black
combat<00:02:11.360> boots<00:02:15.459> so<00:02:16.459> it's<00:02:16.610> obviously<00:02:17.090> going<00:02:17.300> to

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
combat boots so it's obviously going to

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.300 
combat boots so it's obviously going to
get<00:02:17.570> very<00:02:17.600> cold<00:02:18.170> near<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.620> winter<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.280> I

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
get very cold near the winter so I

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.490 
get very cold near the winter so I
recommend<00:02:19.670> bringing<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.300> coat<00:02:20.570> unless<00:02:21.320> of

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
recommend bringing a coat unless of

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.080 
recommend bringing a coat unless of
course<00:02:21.530> a<00:02:21.860> cute<00:02:22.130> guys<00:02:22.280> going<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.670> give<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:22.910> his

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
coat but that is most likely not going

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:35.050 
coat but that is most likely not going
to<00:02:25.220> happen<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.670> me<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:33.640> definitely<00:02:34.640> bring<00:02:34.970> up
