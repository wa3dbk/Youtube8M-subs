we're<00:00:15.240> really<00:00:15.660> starting<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.990> understand<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
we're really starting to understand the

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.439 
we're really starting to understand the
defense<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.890> know<00:00:16.949> back<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.550> spring<00:00:17.880> we

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
defense you know back in the spring we

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.840 
defense you know back in the spring we
just<00:00:18.660> kind<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.869> learned<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.230> plays<00:00:19.730> but<00:00:20.730> now

we're<00:00:21.300> kind<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.619> understanding<00:00:22.619> why<00:00:23.279> we're

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
we're kind of understanding why we're

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.310
