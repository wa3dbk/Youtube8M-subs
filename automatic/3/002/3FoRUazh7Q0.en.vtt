water<00:01:46.960> stick<00:01:47.320> so<00:01:47.440> you<00:01:47.560> have<00:01:47.680> to<00:01:47.800> swim<00:01:48.010> through

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
water stick so you have to swim through

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.200 
water stick so you have to swim through
I<00:01:48.280> think<00:01:48.550> I'll<00:01:48.640> show<00:01:48.790> you<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.030> whole<00:01:49.180> thing

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
on the right-hand side of the map I

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.809 
on the right-hand side of the map I
can't<00:03:57.560> miss<00:03:57.739> it<00:03:57.800> if<00:03:58.040> you're<00:03:58.190> looking<00:03:58.459> for<00:03:58.670> it

so if you get to the bridge you've gone

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.449 
so if you get to the bridge you've gone
too<00:04:04.130> far

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
too far

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.410 
too far
and<00:04:05.019> that's<00:04:06.019> gonna<00:04:06.200> be<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.530> next<00:04:06.709> body<00:04:07.190> part

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.240 

that's<00:04:11.420> gonna<00:04:11.510> be<00:04:11.750> his<00:04:11.870> right<00:04:12.110> arm<00:04:12.319> then<00:04:13.100> go

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
that's gonna be his right arm then go

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.550 
that's gonna be his right arm then go
all<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.519> way<00:04:13.549> back<00:04:13.760> around<00:04:14.000> until<00:04:14.900> you<00:04:15.049> get<00:04:15.290> to

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
all the way back around until you get to

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.440 
all the way back around until you get to
the<00:04:16.160> drench<00:04:16.430> for<00:04:16.729> it<00:04:16.820> this<00:04:16.970> is<00:04:17.120> kind<00:04:17.299> of<00:04:17.359> the

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
the drench for it this is kind of the

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.900 
the drench for it this is kind of the
way<00:04:17.570> that<00:04:17.720> I<00:04:17.780> do<00:04:17.870> it<00:04:18.019> I<00:04:18.410> go<00:04:19.130> to<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.340> drench<00:04:19.609> for

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
way that I do it I go to the drench for

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.460 
way that I do it I go to the drench for
it<00:04:20.000> and<00:04:20.150> then<00:04:20.299> backtrack<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:21.320> could

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
it and then backtrack you could

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.129 
it and then backtrack you could
obviously<00:04:21.799> go<00:04:22.010> to<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.490> fjord<00:04:22.850> and<00:04:23.300> then<00:04:23.960> make

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
obviously go to the fjord and then make

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.930 
obviously go to the fjord and then make
your<00:04:24.290> way<00:04:24.350> toward<00:04:24.979> the<00:04:25.190> drench<00:04:25.460> for<00:04:25.729> it<00:04:25.820> and

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
your way toward the drench for it and

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.700 
your way toward the drench for it and
you<00:04:26.000> would<00:04:26.120> find<00:04:26.360> it<00:04:26.510> as<00:04:26.630> well<00:04:26.810> but<00:04:27.350> either<00:04:27.500> way

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
you would find it as well but either way

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.740 
you would find it as well but either way
that<00:04:27.889> works<00:04:28.040> better<00:04:28.280> for<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:28.700> I<00:04:28.940> basically<00:04:29.570> go

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
that works better for you I basically go

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.180 
that works better for you I basically go
to<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.900> drench<00:04:30.200> for<00:04:30.470> it<00:04:30.530> work<00:04:30.680> my<00:04:30.830> way<00:04:30.950> back

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
to the drench for it work my way back

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.070 
to the drench for it work my way back
through<00:04:31.400> this<00:04:31.520> cavern<00:04:31.970> area<00:04:32.210> and<00:04:32.450> then<00:04:32.900> it's

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
through this cavern area and then it's

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.050 
through this cavern area and then it's
gonna<00:04:33.169> be<00:04:33.260> down<00:04:33.530> here<00:04:33.590> on<00:04:33.830> my<00:04:33.950> left<00:04:34.280> so

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
gonna be down here on my left so

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.340 
gonna be down here on my left so
obviously<00:04:35.540> if<00:04:35.660> you're<00:04:35.780> coming<00:04:35.990> from<00:04:36.200> the

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
obviously if you're coming from the

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.490 
obviously if you're coming from the
fjord<00:04:36.800> it's<00:04:37.610> gonna<00:04:37.729> be<00:04:37.940> on<00:04:38.060> your<00:04:38.240> right<00:04:38.500> but

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
fjord it's gonna be on your right but

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.710 
fjord it's gonna be on your right but
it's<00:04:39.680> like<00:04:39.740> in<00:04:40.039> a<00:04:40.070> little<00:04:40.310> I<00:04:40.910> don't<00:04:41.450> know<00:04:41.570> like

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
it's like in a little I don't know like

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.529 
it's like in a little I don't know like
a<00:04:41.780> little<00:04:41.870> nook<00:04:42.229> area<00:04:42.590> over<00:04:42.830> here<00:04:43.330> just<00:04:44.330> right

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
a little nook area over here just right

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:49.000 
a little nook area over here just right
there<00:04:45.160> and<00:04:46.160> that's<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:46.700> last<00:04:47.000> one<00:04:47.860> okay<00:04:48.860> and

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
there and that's the last one okay and

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.570 
there and that's the last one okay and
activate<00:04:49.430> it<00:04:53.680> it's<00:04:54.680> gonna<00:04:54.830> be<00:04:54.919> his<00:04:55.130> right<00:04:55.370> leg

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
activate it it's gonna be his right leg

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.340 
activate it it's gonna be his right leg
I'm<00:04:56.060> pretty<00:04:56.330> sure<00:04:56.510> that<00:04:56.690> was<00:04:56.870> his<00:04:56.990> right<00:04:57.169> leg

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
I'm pretty sure that was his right leg

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.370 
I'm pretty sure that was his right leg
sometimes<00:04:58.190> you<00:04:58.520> can't<00:04:58.729> tell<00:04:59.050> all<00:05:00.050> right<00:05:00.140> then

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
sometimes you can't tell all right then

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.409 
sometimes you can't tell all right then
you<00:05:00.470> want<00:05:00.620> to<00:05:00.680> head<00:05:00.800> back<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:01.010> Oren<00:05:01.490> and<00:05:01.640> I

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
you want to head back to Oren and I

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:03.790 
you want to head back to Oren and I
think<00:05:02.720> the<00:05:02.810> fastest<00:05:03.169> way<00:05:03.320> to<00:05:03.350> get<00:05:03.530> there<00:05:03.770> is

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
think the fastest way to get there is

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.320 
think the fastest way to get there is
either<00:05:04.130> just<00:05:04.400> to<00:05:04.460> go<00:05:04.639> ahead<00:05:04.700> and<00:05:04.910> ride<00:05:05.060> it<00:05:05.240> out

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
either just to go ahead and ride it out
