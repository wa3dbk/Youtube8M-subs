00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.980
 October 23 is the day that marks the centennial of the feat of a 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:10.970
 the flight of 14-bis piloted by saints dumont and this historical moment 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.150
 will be revived by a Goiana on board a replica 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.819
 four years of study to know the details of each piece 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:26.999
 pieces of white bread with burlap fur and size equal together all this there is a 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:32.410
 true passion and able to recreate the first leaps nicole bahls your body 

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.870
 firefighters for 2010 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.810
 it was summer child's dream fourteen of them I went to the wall is the 14 bis 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.770
 it was supposed to be there and it did not exist so I decided that it would be manufactured 14a 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.700
 the curious aviator of the interior of goiÃ¡s 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.970
 was faithful to the original engine the rebel command by e-mail or French 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.660
 the aircraft model command of the sailor goshawk and enjoyed 1906 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.700
 which is pressed by the counterpart 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.840
 alright 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.770
 the action is identical 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.370
 all the fuselage measurements are accurate with airplanes are open well 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.979
 it is difficult to imagine that everything started in such a simple way. 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.520
 with eight meters that together seem like a great toy but only if it is 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.850
 thus stopped for having this machine worse is still a great 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.050
 challenge 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.290
 and that few can face speaking after months of training 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.990
 live to dominate 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.290
 and now faces another challenge 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.890
 at six meters 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.630
 aline deficit of alan calaÃ§a in the first attempts 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.110
 time does not help 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.110
 strong sale 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.749
 but gradually she managed to dominate the plane 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.599
 is a great effect, 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.209
 the middle class and that of childhood did not - 36 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.610
 so beyond expectations expectations and anxiety of responsibility is a 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:19.239
 very big pride
