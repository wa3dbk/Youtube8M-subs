00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.800
 the tree confused 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.200
 there was once 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.260
 somewhere that could be any 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.830
 place and in a time that could be 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.800
 any time a beautiful garden with 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.140
 apple trees pear trees and beautiful 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.140
 roses all of them happy and 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.860
 satisfied everything was joy in the 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.020
 garden except for a tree 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:40.079
 deeply sad the poor man had a 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.079
 problem did not know who was 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.140
 what you need is concentration will 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.890
 said the apple tree if really what 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.520
 you try you can have tasty apples 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:55.180
 you see how easy 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:59.579
 do not listen to it demanded the rosebush is more 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:03.359
 easy to have roses and see how beautiful they are 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.090
 and the desperate tree tried everything 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.509
 that suggested him and how he could not do 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.020
 like the others he felt more and more 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:16.320
 frustrated one day he came to the garden 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.250
 the owl the wisest of the birds and the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.890
 see the desperation of the tree exclaimed 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.979
 do not worry your problem is not so 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.920
 serious is the same as many beings 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.860
 on earth I will give you the solution 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.690
 do not dedicate your life to be like others 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:40.350
 want you to be yourself, know yourself and 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.730
 to achieve it listen to your inner voice and 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:48.380
 saying this the owl disappeared 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.990
 my inner voice be myself knowing myself 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.230
 he wondered the desperate tree 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.350
 when suddenly he understood and closed 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.690
 the eyes and the ears opened the heart and 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.350
 At last he could hear his inner voice 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.980
 telling him you'll never give apples 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.610
 because you are not an apple tree or will flourish 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:13.250
 every spring because you're not a rosebush 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.920
 you are an oak and your destiny is to grow 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.430
 big and majestic to give shelter to 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:23.740
 Birds shadow the travelers beauty at 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.200
 landscape you have a mission accomplished 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.660
 and the tree felt strong and secure 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.990
 himself and set out to do everything 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.300
 what it was meant for 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.730
 so soon he filled his space and it was 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.760
 admired and respected by all and only 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.180
 then the garden was completely 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.810
 happy 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.140
 and you 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.330
 you let the oak that is in you grow 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.090
 remember that in life everyone has a 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.730
 purpose to fulfill a space that 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.950
 fill do not allow anything or nobody to 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.720
 prevent to know and share the 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.720
 wonderful essence of your being
