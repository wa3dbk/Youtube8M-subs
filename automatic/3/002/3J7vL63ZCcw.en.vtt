00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:04.420
 We can and will support the mood in St-Jakob-park 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.730
 Fight right from the start of zero to a hundred in 90 minutes 

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:11.539
 in the run-up to the game, the director had him like API for headlines 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:12.239
 provided 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:16.499
 He can imagine a change to FC Basel for next season 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.309
 now he has injured his ligaments in final training yesterday 

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:19.970
 on the 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.669
 today were not there 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.259
 the atmosphere before the game friendly and mutual 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.140
 Respect shaped 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.550
 In the first ten minutes, the two teams came soon 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.050
 Noack 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.530
 It was about after the long break endeavored to find the needs 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.780
 stop his time 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.850
 Give plan b 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.590
 with the bad pass 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.600
 Marco Streller the first conclusion of the game 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.080
 Marco Streller also had him for a number like Thorsten Fink 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.539
 that was today 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.220
 a big game 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.380
 I love offensive in the start quarter hour without any effect 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.230
 they held themselves back elegantly 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.450
 First and foremost, it was about closing in. Colom was still little 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.390
 employ 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.450
 Nevertheless, the honors went to the cause of the friendliness before the game was 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.640
 not much to see 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.600
 there was yellow here 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.220
 for her 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.170
 20 minutes but far corner for the Bayern easily 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.490
 Regazzoni 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.340
 and then 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.079
 we have with the possibility Kolumba was careful it should be known 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:23.820
 also in Barßel 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.479
 does not need many chances for his goals that was definitely 12 first 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.890
 offensive sign 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.130
 happens to be his last 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.830
 but somehow Petkovic seemed to be with the first half hour of his team 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.829
 not really satisfied 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.060
 because even after this cold hour 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.570
 Brennberg 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.020
 and Stockach could not do anything with the cross from Marco Streller 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.890
 Min granite had stucco publicity 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.070
 the Basler but were clear the more active and better team watch her 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.150
 Second in the middle 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.219
 he was suddenly on the ground 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:10.750
 He used to live but was the fixed Audi on the decision of Massimo 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.769
 Busacca had a handball clearance at the ball acceptance review 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:19.419
 not a delicate situation 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:22.789
 Here one has the feeling of the thing correctly not only read 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.829
 I hope that we already in the 2 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.269
 but dare not for use again the choice ran 74 of the minute 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:34.199
 safari 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:35.549
 Streller 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.299
 and Shaqiri 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.150
 that was the final point under one 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.900
 average first half with clear advantages and an opportunity advantage 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.999
 for the weapon 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:48.229
 Zero to zero after 45 minutes 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.410
 the home team had done more but the goals were missing 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.900
 because with a draw you are on the heels of today's adversary on the heels 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.900
 even when approaching below it goes with it 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.909
 at the beginning of the second half Streller with great pain on the ground 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:03.500
 unintentionally 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.829
 900 on the hand 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.060
 finally transplanted and was three minutes later 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.129
 ready to play for the book values 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.170
 the big footballing exclamation points were still missing 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:19.699
 also in the face and came to opportunities 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:22.619
 Alex free 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.959
 but again the entire effort game has decided 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:26.899
 the two 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:29.899
 In any case, they have the full profit increase 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.349
 Nani 67 the Innotech fight in midfield 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.349
 Klocke the EHC pace 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.439
 Wölfl Issuer n-tv and Dan «Make the MV more Marco Streller 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.740
 Men to the horror of Marko Marin Cilic 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.270
 he could not understand Busaka's decision, we try to dissolve 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.169
 for it could not be held for the ball 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:06.809
 Ban was preparing Streller for a possible choice of Wolfli and the 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:10.989
 Bible Goalie made him like living or Wolfli Streller Fothen 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:11.919
 legs 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.919
 the trend seems 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:19.249
 Wolfli free against Alex 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:22.270
 a crucial scene Voldemort 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.889
 the h1 10 0 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.470
 the advantage earned the advantage of the Barßeler rides more for the game 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.759
 surprisingly passive 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.759
 this afternoon to this time to 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.900
 although it would depend on my person on the guide's heat 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.820
 when to no reaction capable on the contrary now the makers are still looking for 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.580
 more purposeful then graduation 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.440
 Streller with the perfectly timed header no chance for Marco Wölfli 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:58.000
 the 2 2 in the 81 minute excellently prepares Stocker's first 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.949
 powerful and craft CIS 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.999
 In addition, nobody in the middle felt like having a fixed contractor 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.160
 left out on the ranks of jubilation 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.530
 The majority of 26 thousand celebrated clock Matt go Marco Streller 

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:22.379
 the match was not decided yet by the 87c minute Almerares 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:24.330
 actually in the offside 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.759
 he left the ball but then Aleks 3 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.439
 near the place but he 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:32.439
 the smallest model 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:36.339
 Seifried defensive signs of dissolution 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.009
 hardly a Basel player completely free 5 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:44.849
 3 c minor 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.029
 the victory secured 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:50.249
 Thorsten Fink confers 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:53.249
 but that was not all the stoppage time 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:59.169
 Safari is the final point under a one-sided game 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.169
 the Basel win absolutely deserves a bit high 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.050
 5 up to four points from today's opponents 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:09.889
 faceless today 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:10.980
 and in Barßel 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.629
 is danced again 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:13.439
 the second half
