00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.120 
unlike a 10 cane where 10 cane cost you
more<00:04:19.459> you<00:04:19.940> get<00:04:20.090> a<00:04:20.150> little<00:04:20.420> bit<00:04:20.510> more<00:04:20.750> for<00:04:21.200> the

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
more you get a little bit more for the

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.520 
more you get a little bit more for the
full<00:04:22.610> body<00:04:22.820> flavor<00:04:23.300> of<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.630> drink<00:04:23.750> I<00:04:24.110> would

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
full body flavor of the drink I would

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.500 
full body flavor of the drink I would
say<00:04:24.710> if<00:04:24.830> you're<00:04:24.950> making<00:04:25.130> like<00:04:25.460> a<00:04:25.510> something

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
say if you're making like a something

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.440 
say if you're making like a something
that's<00:04:26.690> very<00:04:27.140> rum<00:04:27.650> centric<00:04:28.250> this<00:04:29.090> would<00:04:29.270> work

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
that's very rum centric this would work

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.960 
that's very rum centric this would work
well<00:04:29.660> I<00:04:29.900> wouldn't<00:04:30.500> put<00:04:30.590> this<00:04:30.860> in<00:04:31.070> like<00:04:31.100> a<00:04:31.490> Long

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
well I wouldn't put this in like a Long

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.300 
well I wouldn't put this in like a Long
Island<00:04:32.000> iced<00:04:32.510> tea<00:04:32.870> or<00:04:33.170> anything<00:04:34.040> that<00:04:34.160> has

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
Island iced tea or anything that has

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.820 
Island iced tea or anything that has
like<00:04:34.340> more<00:04:34.970> than<00:04:35.270> say<00:04:35.930> three<00:04:36.260> components<00:04:36.770> if

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
like more than say three components if

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.380 
like more than say three components if
it<00:04:36.920> has<00:04:37.040> tequila<00:04:37.250> I<00:04:37.760> would<00:04:37.940> leave<00:04:38.150> it<00:04:38.270> out

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
it has tequila I would leave it out

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.030 
it has tequila I would leave it out
because<00:04:38.540> this<00:04:38.810> I<00:04:39.020> think<00:04:39.530> you're<00:04:39.620> gonna<00:04:39.710> lose<00:04:40.010> a

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
because this I think you're gonna lose a

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.250 
because this I think you're gonna lose a
lot<00:04:40.400> of<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.670> flavor<00:04:40.940> because<00:04:41.840> I<00:04:42.050> get<00:04:42.230> a

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
lot of the flavor because I get a

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.660 
lot of the flavor because I get a
similarity<00:04:42.920> of<00:04:42.950> tequila<00:04:43.310> with<00:04:43.370> some<00:04:43.460> of<00:04:43.640> that

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
similarity of tequila with some of that

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.120 
similarity of tequila with some of that
sweetness<00:04:44.030> on<00:04:44.300> a<00:04:44.660> higher-end<00:04:45.140> tequila<00:04:45.500> you

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
sweetness on a higher-end tequila you

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.070 
sweetness on a higher-end tequila you
really<00:04:46.460> want<00:04:46.640> to<00:04:46.760> think<00:04:46.880> about<00:04:47.060> cocktail<00:04:47.810> set

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
really want to think about cocktail set

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.130 
really want to think about cocktail set
focus<00:04:48.410> center<00:04:49.310> on<00:04:49.490> the<00:04:49.910> rum<00:04:50.120> and<00:04:50.390> maybe<00:04:50.900> some

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
focus center on the rum and maybe some

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.250 
focus center on the rum and maybe some
bitters<00:04:51.530> like<00:04:52.070> our<00:04:52.220> orange<00:04:53.030> flower<00:04:53.330> water<00:04:53.480> or

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
bitters like our orange flower water or

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.350 
bitters like our orange flower water or
something<00:04:54.560> like<00:04:54.620> that<00:04:54.680> to<00:04:54.890> accent<00:04:55.370> it<00:04:55.550> and<00:04:55.730> if

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
something like that to accent it and if

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.030 
something like that to accent it and if
you're<00:04:56.510> into<00:04:56.690> vermouth<00:04:56.990> maybe<00:04:57.260> vermouth<00:04:57.650> me

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
you're into vermouth maybe vermouth me

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.840 
you're into vermouth maybe vermouth me
not<00:04:58.280> so<00:04:58.430> much

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
not so much

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.310 
not so much
I<00:04:58.880> could<00:04:59.210> totally<00:04:59.600> see<00:04:59.780> like<00:04:59.930> a<00:04:59.960> pomegranate

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
I could totally see like a pomegranate

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.270 
I could totally see like a pomegranate
splash<00:05:01.210> maybe<00:05:02.210> even<00:05:02.570> you<00:05:03.500> know<00:05:03.530> a<00:05:03.620> liqueur<00:05:04.070> in

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
splash maybe even you know a liqueur in

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.500 
splash maybe even you know a liqueur in
that<00:05:04.400> direction<00:05:04.550> a<00:05:05.030> little<00:05:05.210> pomegranate

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
that direction a little pomegranate

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.900 
that direction a little pomegranate
might<00:05:05.810> get<00:05:05.930> a<00:05:05.960> little<00:05:06.020> medicinal<00:05:06.590> I<00:05:07.400> wouldn't

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
might get a little medicinal I wouldn't

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.430 
might get a little medicinal I wouldn't
go<00:05:08.000> to<00:05:08.060> too<00:05:08.390> heavy<00:05:08.600> sweet<00:05:08.930> like<00:05:09.080> it<00:05:09.230> wouldn't

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
go to too heavy sweet like it wouldn't

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.310 
go to too heavy sweet like it wouldn't
go<00:05:09.560> with<00:05:09.710> the<00:05:09.890> Baron<00:05:10.370> Jager<00:05:10.550> maybe<00:05:11.420> some<00:05:11.690> even

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
go with the Baron Jager maybe some even

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.800 
go with the Baron Jager maybe some even
some<00:05:12.920> weird<00:05:13.100> cognac<00:05:13.670> type<00:05:13.940> play<00:05:14.180> I<00:05:14.420> don't<00:05:14.690> know

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
some weird cognac type play I don't know

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.180 
some weird cognac type play I don't know
so<00:05:15.200> think<00:05:15.740> about<00:05:15.800> that

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
so think about that

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.520 
so think about that
and<00:05:16.460> and<00:05:17.030> just<00:05:17.420> consider<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:17.930> fact<00:05:18.140> that<00:05:18.260> at

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
and and just consider the fact that at

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.290 
and and just consider the fact that at
the<00:05:18.770> price<00:05:19.040> point<00:05:19.070> you<00:05:19.460> may<00:05:19.580> be<00:05:19.640> purchasing<00:05:20.180> it

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
the price point you may be purchasing it

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.360 
the price point you may be purchasing it
at<00:05:20.450> I<00:05:20.750> would<00:05:21.140> say<00:05:21.290> this<00:05:21.410> is<00:05:21.560> a<00:05:21.590> definite<00:05:22.160> core

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
at I would say this is a definite core

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.130 
at I would say this is a definite core
component<00:05:22.880> to<00:05:22.970> a<00:05:23.000> drink<00:05:23.300> and<00:05:23.570> it<00:05:23.840> has<00:05:23.960> some

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
component to a drink and it has some

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.530 
component to a drink and it has some
nice<00:05:24.380> driven<00:05:24.920> sweetness<00:05:25.370> to<00:05:25.550> it<00:05:25.580> so<00:05:26.090> there<00:05:26.390> you

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
nice driven sweetness to it so there you

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.230 
nice driven sweetness to it so there you
go<00:05:26.780> that's<00:05:27.230> the<00:05:27.530> Calico<00:05:28.070> Puerto<00:05:28.700> Rican<00:05:28.970> run
