00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.910
 serves all boys and well found with 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.100
 this new test is definitely there 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.439
 you will already be aware that they have left 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.560
 practically two days but in reality it is 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.109
 one but in reality they are two in the sense that 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.970
 it is the same need when speaking of 6 thousand 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.920
 810 but let's say the lifter 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.559
 the other front instead of the accelerator 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.690
 but the front loader that precisely 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.579
 it is not that they avoided the whole charger 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.930
 because this as you can see is of the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:49.160
 But let 's say the footprint brackets 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.160
 let's say for the front loader 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.690
 I must say that as an external aesthetic 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.160
 let's say they are not top of the range 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.500
 however let's say as early as 2015 I would say that 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.770
 we can also content ourselves with teheran 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.390
 especially for deer lovers 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.970
 also behind as you can see however they are 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.590
 fairly detailed central of the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:22.150
 thread of day2 so two regulators 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.130
 here then the inclination to rio 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.200
 yes, they are quite enough 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.370
 well enough detailed wheels 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.370
 are those of 2015 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.080
 even the structure itself seems to me 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.180
 enough of the textured footprint 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.790
 of 2015 then no one knows 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.350
 I don't know if the basic background model 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:47.080
 both evils of 2013, however, to see if 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.290
 we have done well they have a little something 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.060
 I don't like the lights that after you 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.530
 I will show that I have to fix but 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.570
 I think it's one thing 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.760
 a bit so they have a speed 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.790
 maximum of 43 kilometers per hour 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.340
 sincerely personally if you had it 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.729
 done I would have put at least 50 anyway 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.690
 after some effort cute calla carts 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.300
 definitely mirrors anyway 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.640
 they work there is a carving of one 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.190
 mirror I noticed and even if a 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.400
 part by part as if there were but 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.940
 they had moved it and they are forgotten 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.620
 bordeaux on these are cazzatine but me 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.810
 the text and form I do everything to 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.340
 all 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.530
 personally room a little bit 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.570
 back will be that they did it for 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.190
 then go on to monitor both 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:44.490
 mirrors more or less see with a 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.620
 yes with a look only also seas for 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.800
 to be able to see better but I would have put 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.130
 a little more ancient is closer 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:57.130
 what is nice is quality and quality 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.980
 sharpness of the writings that really 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.970
 betsy true that all headlights for example 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.680
 the headlights are practically the headlights 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.269
 area 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.790
 we read both read and intra read 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:17.799
 little something 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:20.709
 march on n 123 which would be a 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.859
 something not internal animations to the of 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.120
 out of the dashboard that then too 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.040
 backlit however that the 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.750
 backlight you see ruin a little 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.579
 the dash their own embroidery 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.099
 color and sincerely I would prefer 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.930
 keep it that way since it already looks 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.780
 backlit let's say it also registered 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.540
 the arrows we say on beautiful from outside yes 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.519
 sees practically so form this 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.680
 circle like the lighting in the year 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:52.209
 Strong of this tractor as you see 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.239
 the headlights become totally white and yes 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.700
 and no in the sense that yes because seas 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.780
 indeed it lights up and in the night yes 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.180
 sees 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.669
 no because you don't see the detail 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.129
 inside of the lighthouse when turned on 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:09.069
 here for example these are small 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:12.159
 details that make but rebel 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:15.819
 they make perfect that then it is impossible 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:18.699
 perfect lander and a motorcycle though those 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.370
 small things that make it dance 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:24.310
 they also took the holds 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.430
 in the weight area there were those up there 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:31.060
 the radio is off not written in a while 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.490
 however a good mortuary is dead for 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.880
 I have to say that they worked on it 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.660
 well 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.760
 I always have our little man and how 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.639
 you see there is still some defect for 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.810
 example on the steering 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:49.340
 see for a while to be rearranged 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.620
 obviously I don't know criticizing the work 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.889
 others because they do certain things really 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.849
 you have to be good to have passion though 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:02.680
 the world test I do one says and I have 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:03.860
 heard I never know if you download it 9 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.289
 cav 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.599
 practically pro 11 but yes we talk e 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.490
 I look at how the photos look like 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:13.629
 details those errorines could have 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.759
 if anything new time I don't want to be there 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:19.520
 going to look here is the point on 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:21.460
 to actually present you as the 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.099
 fashion is v1 ok 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:29.740
 I hope there was a b2 ahead like this 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:33.800
 and of course you know about the idea that oct 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.349
 reach fendt however when it comes 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.189
 of moder tests and towards a test mode 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:41.509
 impartial 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:45.050
 regardless, I can put it there too 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:48.379
 this equal warning spit only 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.319
 that changes practically fact that has the 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:54.680
 lifter censor the loader 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:57.550
 front that has no lift but 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.550
 than to the front loader 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:03.099
 nothing these are practically i 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:06.340
 tractors and meanwhile sees every now and then 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:08.680
 he began to pull out something there and also 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.599
 because it takes time at the beginning then 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.509
 go begins to make a two-three way 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.800
 you take a base that you succeed 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:17.050
 anyway to do something 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.069
 I would say well for this test too 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:24.340
 fashions all guys well nothing 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:26.560
 I thought of something less I saw nothing 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.030
 I recommend you comment subscribe 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.699
 let be like leave them the link 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:33.039
 original in description download 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:35.229
 very little weight nothing would be 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:37.599
 neither extract nor bar are copy the 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:40.120
 file was the zip file and throw it inside 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:42.879
 the fashions folder and you're good to go 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.979
 good bye to everyone the next is true 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:48.300
