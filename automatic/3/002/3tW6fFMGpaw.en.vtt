from the original DBZ Angeles saga first
off<00:02:45.450> this<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.780> based<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.950> history<00:02:47.220> of

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
off this is based on the history of

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.449 
off this is based on the history of
trunks<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:47.910> it's<00:02:48.060> not<00:02:48.180> exactly<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.459> Android

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
trunks so it's not exactly the Android

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.789 
trunks so it's not exactly the Android
saga<00:02:50.730> but<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.540> would<00:02:51.750> say<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.079> biggest<00:02:52.349> change

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
saga but I would say the biggest change

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.589 
saga but I would say the biggest change
we<00:02:53.130> made<00:02:53.340> was<00:02:53.610> probably<00:02:54.000> just<00:02:54.299> kind<00:02:54.540> of

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
we made was probably just kind of

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.990 
we made was probably just kind of

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
I think Gohan and Trunks his

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.900 
I think Gohan and Trunks his
relationship<00:04:02.080> are<00:04:02.340> pretty<00:04:03.340> awesome<00:04:03.550> I<00:04:03.880> really

like the dynamic of Gohan being the
father<00:04:06.700> figure<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:08.830> like<00:04:09.580> a<00:04:09.610> mentor<00:04:10.120> to
