00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
thing would be so low fee this looks

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.320 
thing would be so low fee this looks
like<00:03:09.910> it's<00:03:10.210> not<00:03:10.330> for<00:03:10.540> both<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:12.580> stability<00:03:13.210> on

like it's not for both the stability on

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.660 
like it's not for both the stability on
it<00:03:13.510> is<00:03:13.600> so<00:03:13.780> much<00:03:13.960> better<00:03:16.620> this<00:03:17.620> ability<00:03:18.100> is<00:03:18.340> so

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
it is so much better this ability is so

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:39.320 
it is so much better this ability is so
much<00:03:18.820> better<00:03:19.060> like<00:03:19.450> you<00:03:19.660> even<00:03:19.960> need<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.230> perk
