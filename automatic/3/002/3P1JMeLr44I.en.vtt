clicking on d6 then Bishop e5 will get
onto<00:04:34.810> that<00:04:34.930> diagonal<00:04:35.350> so<00:04:35.620> I<00:04:35.680> think<00:04:35.830> I'm<00:04:35.920> going

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
onto that diagonal so I think I'm going

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.900 
onto that diagonal so I think I'm going
to<00:04:36.070> go<00:04:36.190> for<00:04:36.400> that<00:04:36.520> I<00:04:37.770> take<00:04:38.770> on<00:04:38.950> d6<00:04:39.220> then<00:04:39.730> play

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
to go for that I take on d6 then play

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
diagonal trying to try now sort of on

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.530 
diagonal trying to try now sort of on
the<00:04:46.450> -<00:04:46.780> defense<00:04:47.200> of<00:04:47.500> this<00:04:48.040> diagonal<00:04:48.450> so<00:04:49.450> the

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
the - defense of this diagonal so the

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.210 
the - defense of this diagonal so the

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.150 

why<00:05:43.020> actually<00:05:43.139> beating<00:05:43.560> this<00:05:43.650> guy<00:05:43.830> before

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
why actually beating this guy before

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.830 
why actually beating this guy before
this<00:05:44.370> could<00:05:44.580> be<00:05:44.639> the<00:05:44.729> first<00:05:44.910> time<00:05:45.210> if<00:05:45.449> this<00:05:45.630> is

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
this could be the first time if this is

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:53.210 
this could be the first time if this is
indeed<00:05:46.500> no<00:05:46.710> defense<00:05:49.760> yes<00:05:50.780> yes<00:05:51.780> finally<00:05:52.620> this

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
indeed no defense yes yes finally this

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.960 
indeed no defense yes yes finally this
guy<00:05:53.430> goes<00:05:53.669> down<00:05:55.340> so<00:05:56.340> instead<00:05:56.520> of<00:05:56.580> playing<00:05:56.760> for

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970

guy goes down so instead of playing for
c4<00:05:57.389> I<00:05:57.419> went<00:05:57.630> for<00:05:57.750> a<00:05:57.810> quick<00:05:57.930> f4<00:05:58.530> I<00:05:59.840> took<00:06:00.840> with<00:06:01.229> the

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
c4 I went for a quick f4 I took with the

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.320 
c4 I went for a quick f4 I took with the
bishop<00:06:01.650> instead<00:06:01.860> of<00:06:01.979> the<00:06:02.070> pawn<00:06:02.370> because<00:06:03.060> this

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
bishop instead of the pawn because this

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.850

actually<00:06:03.540> this<00:06:03.840> bishops<00:06:04.229> on<00:06:04.380> this<00:06:04.500> diagonal

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
actually this bishops on this diagonal

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.770 
actually this bishops on this diagonal
is<00:06:05.070> quite<00:06:05.280> dangerous<00:06:05.430> for<00:06:05.790> a<00:06:05.910> fight<00:06:06.210> break<00:06:06.510> and

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
Queen maybe there's Queen e1 as an

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.409 
Queen maybe there's Queen e1 as an
improvement<00:06:18.650> Knight<00:06:19.650> takes<00:06:19.949> c2<00:06:20.550> there'll<00:06:21.389> be

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
improvement Knight takes c2 there'll be

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:29.810 
improvement Knight takes c2 there'll be
seven<00:06:22.020> so<00:06:25.220> Bishop<00:06:26.220> d4<00:06:26.820> though<00:06:27.740> the<00:06:28.740> end<00:06:28.919> if<00:06:29.669> I

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
seven so Bishop d4 though the end if I

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.580 
seven so Bishop d4 though the end if I
play<00:06:30.000> this<00:06:30.210> you<00:06:30.539> know<00:06:30.600> is<00:06:30.840> like<00:06:31.350> really

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
play this you know is like really

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.710 
play this you know is like really
frightening<00:06:31.979> yes<00:06:32.340> it<00:06:32.490> probably<00:06:32.760> is<00:06:32.880> because

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
frightening yes it probably is because

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.330 
frightening yes it probably is because
takes<00:06:34.139> there's<00:06:34.440> Knight<00:06:34.590> takes<00:06:34.860> G<00:06:35.070> free<00:06:35.370> check

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
takes there's Knight takes G free check

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.430 
takes there's Knight takes G free check
so<00:06:38.340> the<00:06:38.460> exchange<00:06:38.639> sac<00:06:39.180> is<00:06:39.479> kind<00:06:40.320> of

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
so the exchange sac is kind of

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.129 
so the exchange sac is kind of
interesting<00:06:40.949> maybe<00:06:41.370> anyway<00:06:41.820> because<00:06:42.810> these

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:43.139 
interesting maybe anyway because these

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:44.629 
interesting maybe anyway because these
pawns<00:06:43.440> are<00:06:43.680> really<00:06:43.830> quite<00:06:44.010> dangerous<00:06:44.220> this

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 
pawns are really quite dangerous this

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.210 
pawns are really quite dangerous this
King<00:06:44.940> is<00:06:45.090> already<00:06:45.389> kind<00:06:45.660> of<00:06:45.750> shattered<00:06:46.440> these

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
King is already kind of shattered these

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.520 
King is already kind of shattered these
dark<00:06:47.550> squares<00:06:47.940> in<00:06:48.090> particular<00:06:48.360> just<00:06:49.320> get<00:06:49.470> rid

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.530 
dark squares in particular just get rid

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:54.520 
dark squares in particular just get rid
of<00:06:49.620> this<00:06:49.710> dark<00:06:50.010> square<00:06:50.250> defender<00:06:52.520> which<00:06:53.520> are

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:54.530 
of this dark square defender which are

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.170 
of this dark square defender which are
and<00:06:55.530> that<00:06:55.889> Bishop<00:06:56.220> f7<00:06:56.580> that<00:06:56.669> these<00:06:56.820> these<00:06:57.030> were

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
and that Bishop f7 that these these were

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.230 
and that Bishop f7 that these these were
protecting<00:06:57.690> each<00:06:57.780> other<00:06:58.490> making<00:06:59.490> the<00:06:59.910> King<00:07:00.150> a

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
protecting each other making the King a

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.650 
protecting each other making the King a
little<00:07:00.450> bit<00:07:00.570> weaker<00:07:00.930> I<00:07:00.990> think<00:07:02.240> okay<00:07:03.240> comments

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 
little bit weaker I think okay comments

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.849 
little bit weaker I think okay comments
or<00:07:03.780> questions<00:07:03.900> on<00:07:04.260> YouTube<00:07:04.760> thanks<00:07:05.760> so<00:07:05.820> much
