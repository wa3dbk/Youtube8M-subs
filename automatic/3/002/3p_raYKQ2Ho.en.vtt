00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
prongs on them and then a handle to hold

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.380 
prongs on them and then a handle to hold

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
around the edge of the hole not into it

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.169 
around the edge of the hole not into it
and<00:01:25.690> then<00:01:26.259> push<00:01:26.590> forward<00:01:27.130> and<00:01:27.640> as<00:01:27.850> you<00:01:28.000> push

and then push forward and as you push

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.830 
and then push forward and as you push
forward<00:01:28.210> you'll<00:01:29.080> loosen<00:01:29.860> some<00:01:30.039> of<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.280> ground

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
forward you'll loosen some of the ground

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.870 
forward you'll loosen some of the ground
so<00:01:31.840> that<00:01:31.869> the<00:01:32.140> whole<00:01:32.289> can<00:01:32.860> get<00:01:33.009> repaired<00:01:33.340> the

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
so that the whole can get repaired the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.880 
so that the whole can get repaired the
mistake<00:01:34.360> that<00:01:34.630> a<00:01:34.960> lot<00:01:35.050> of<00:01:35.200> people<00:01:35.350> make<00:01:35.710> when

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
mistake that a lot of people make when

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.889 
mistake that a lot of people make when
they<00:01:35.950> do<00:01:36.069> it<00:01:36.250> they<00:01:36.789> insert<00:01:37.090> it<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.600> then<00:01:37.750> they

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
they do it they insert it and then they

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.450 
they do it they insert it and then they
lift<00:01:38.140> back<00:01:38.350> on<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.710> handle<00:01:39.039> thinking<00:01:39.340> that

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
lift back on the handle thinking that

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.029 
lift back on the handle thinking that
lifting<00:01:39.850> up<00:01:39.970> the<00:01:40.149> whole<00:01:40.330> works<00:01:40.929> it<00:01:41.380> doesn't<00:01:41.890> it

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
lifting up the whole works it doesn't it

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.760 
lifting up the whole works it doesn't it
actually<00:01:42.340> tears<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:43.149> grass<00:01:43.420> roots<00:01:43.929> kills<00:01:44.590> the

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
actually tears the grass roots kills the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.680 
actually tears the grass roots kills the
graph<00:01:44.979> so<00:01:45.250> push<00:01:45.759> forward<00:01:46.240> that's<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.569> way<00:01:46.630> to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
graph so push forward that's the way to

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.870 
graph so push forward that's the way to
fix<00:01:46.869> it<00:01:47.050> and<00:01:47.080> finally<00:01:47.350> when<00:01:48.039> you're<00:01:48.159> done<00:01:48.340> take

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
fix it and finally when you're done take

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.760 
fix it and finally when you're done take
your<00:01:49.000> putter<00:01:49.210> head<00:01:49.479> and<00:01:49.690> just<00:01:50.110> tamp<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:50.590> thing

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
your putter head and just tamp the thing

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.370 
your putter head and just tamp the thing
down<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:51.369> now<00:01:51.970> that's<00:01:52.210> nicely<00:01:52.420> fixed<00:01:52.899> and<00:01:53.050> it

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
down and now that's nicely fixed and it

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.770 
down and now that's nicely fixed and it
will<00:01:53.520> repair<00:01:54.520> beautifully<00:01:55.299> in<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.479> couple<00:01:55.719> of

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
will repair beautifully in a couple of

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.499 
will repair beautifully in a couple of
days<00:01:55.840> so<00:01:56.770> that's<00:01:56.950> all<00:01:57.130> there<00:01:57.280> is<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.579> it<00:01:57.610> repair
