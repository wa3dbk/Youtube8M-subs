00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
getting a skill that cooldown varies

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.580 
getting a skill that cooldown varies
from<00:06:26.699> like<00:06:26.909> five<00:06:27.509> seconds<00:06:27.930> to<00:06:28.050> eight<00:06:28.169> seconds

from like five seconds to eight seconds

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.179 
from like five seconds to eight seconds
or<00:06:28.860> so<00:06:29.069> maybe<00:06:29.819> through<00:06:30.120> second<00:06:30.509> stage<00:06:31.189> it

get a longer cooldown and that seems to

00:06:48.900 --> 00:07:14.990
