Evinrude<00:00:07.440> sport<00:00:08.250> twin<00:00:09.230> I<00:00:10.230> picked<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.190> motor

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
Evinrude sport twin I picked this motor

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.539 
Evinrude sport twin I picked this motor
up<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:12.150> few<00:00:12.450> months<00:00:12.719> ago<00:00:12.980> actually<00:00:13.980> probably<00:00:14.519> a

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
up a few months ago actually probably a

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.170 
up a few months ago actually probably a
year<00:00:14.730> ago<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:16.580> haven't<00:00:17.580> even<00:00:17.699> tried<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.090> get

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
year ago and I haven't even tried to get

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.480 
year ago and I haven't even tried to get
it<00:00:18.330> started<00:00:18.539> till<00:00:18.930> today<00:00:19.140> yesterday<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.800> pulled

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
it started till today yesterday I pulled

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.370 
it started till today yesterday I pulled
the<00:00:20.580> flywheel<00:00:20.970> off<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.539> shined<00:00:22.080> up<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
the flywheel off and shined up the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.380 
the flywheel off and shined up the
points<00:00:23.000> everything<00:00:24.000> looked<00:00:24.240> good<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:26.390> this

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
points everything looked good and this

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.060 
points everything looked good and this
motor<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.500> believe<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:29.310> really<00:00:31.070> well

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
motor is I believe a really well

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.049 
motor is I believe a really well
engineered<00:00:32.550> motor<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:34.910> it's<00:00:35.910> got

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
engineered motor it's it's got

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.190 
engineered motor it's it's got
everything<00:00:36.360> about<00:00:36.750> it

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
everything about it

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.950 
everything about it
it<00:00:37.469> says<00:00:37.739> Evinrude<00:00:38.309> with<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.090> exception<00:00:39.750> I

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
it says Evinrude with the exception I

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.530 
it says Evinrude with the exception I
think<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> ugliest<00:00:41.670> motor<00:00:42.030> around<00:00:42.210> in

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
think it's the ugliest motor around in

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.880 
think it's the ugliest motor around in
my<00:00:42.660> life<00:00:42.870> but<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.940> being<00:00:44.940> said<00:00:45.590> this<00:00:46.590> thing

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
my life but that being said this thing

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.639 
my life but that being said this thing
is<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> excellent<00:00:47.820> running<00:00:48.239> motor<00:00:48.530> didn't<00:00:49.530> do

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
is a excellent running motor didn't do

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.760 
is a excellent running motor didn't do
anything<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.899> recap<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.140> spark<00:00:52.440> plugs

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
anything I just recap the spark plugs

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.810 
anything I just recap the spark plugs
shined<00:00:53.520> up<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.820> points<00:00:54.379> that's<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.949> coils

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
shined up the points that's it coils

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.510 
shined up the points that's it coils
looked<00:00:57.260> like<00:00:58.260> they<00:00:58.410> were<00:00:58.469> new<00:00:58.770> even<00:00:59.399> though

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
looked like they were new even though

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.189 
looked like they were new even though
they're<00:00:59.699> probably<00:00:59.930> original<00:01:00.930> no<00:01:01.559> cracks<00:01:03.199> got

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
they're probably original no cracks got

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.730 
they're probably original no cracks got
it<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.559> bucket<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.920> water<00:01:06.080> garbage<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.439> pull

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
it in a bucket of water garbage can pull

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:23.240 
it in a bucket of water garbage can pull
and<00:01:11.240> go<00:01:12.240> ahead<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.479> start<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.780> up

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.120 

there<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.570> not<00:01:24.930> very<00:01:25.140> well<00:01:25.290> tied

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
there you have it not very well tied

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:39.080 
there you have it not very well tied
down<00:01:26.420> but<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:28.020> pumping<00:01:28.380> lots<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.740> water

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:57.550 

revs<00:01:40.090> nicely<00:01:41.550> idles<00:01:42.550> nicely

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.050 

run<00:01:57.979> it<00:01:58.130> smoothly

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.639 

there's<00:02:04.060> cuts<00:02:04.509> right<00:02:04.780> along<00:02:05.049> and<00:02:05.320> low<00:02:05.500> idle

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
there's cuts right along and low idle

there's cuts right along and low idle
I<00:02:07.679> haven't<00:02:08.369> tried<00:02:08.519> put<00:02:08.759> her<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.060> gear<00:02:09.330> yet<00:02:09.599> I

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
I haven't tried put her in gear yet I

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.820 
I haven't tried put her in gear yet I
think<00:02:09.810> my<00:02:09.959> buckets<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.500> little<00:02:10.739> bit

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830
