00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:15.779 
now I just wanted to go ahead and give

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:17.870 
now I just wanted to go ahead and give
you<00:00:15.869> guys<00:00:15.930> a<00:00:16.080> quick<00:00:16.560> look<00:00:16.890> at<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.400> compass

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
you guys a quick look at the compass

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.820 
you guys a quick look at the compass
application<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.869> built<00:00:19.109> into<00:00:19.439> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
application that is built into the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.810 
application that is built into the
BlackBerry<00:00:20.310> Bold<00:00:20.550> 9900<00:00:21.179> and<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:22.289> course<00:00:22.500> other

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
BlackBerry Bold 9900 and of course other

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.419 
BlackBerry Bold 9900 and of course other
BlackBerry<00:00:23.820> 7<00:00:24.179> devices<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.929> will<00:00:25.080> be

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:25.429 
BlackBerry 7 devices that will be

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.349 
BlackBerry 7 devices that will be
eventually<00:00:26.429> released<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.999> compass

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
eventually released the compass

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.419 
eventually released the compass
application<00:00:27.509> is<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.380> 9810<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.310> it's

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
application is on the 9810 and it's

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.050 
application is on the 9810 and it's
coming<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.089> torch<00:00:30.619> 9850<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.859> 9860<00:00:32.520> as

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
coming to the torch 9850 and 9860 as

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.049 
coming to the torch 9850 and 9860 as
well<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:34.440> compass<00:00:34.800> application<00:00:35.160> actually

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
well the compass application actually

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.970 
well the compass application actually
works<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.600> combination<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
works in combination with the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.250 
works in combination with the
magnetometer<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.120> built-in<00:00:39.629> now<00:00:40.170> if

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
magnetometer that is built-in now if

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.720 
magnetometer that is built-in now if
you're<00:00:40.410> still<00:00:40.530> kind<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.949> fuzzy<00:00:41.160> about<00:00:41.489> what<00:00:41.699> a

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
you're still kind of fuzzy about what a

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.439 
you're still kind of fuzzy about what a
magnetometer<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:43.640> basically<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:45.000> measures

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
magnetometer is basically it measures

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.970 
magnetometer is basically it measures
the<00:00:45.719> magnetic<00:00:45.960> fields<00:00:46.949> on<00:00:47.219> earth<00:00:48.949> for<00:00:49.949> our

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the magnetic fields on earth for our

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.630 
the magnetic fields on earth for our
purposes<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.719> short<00:00:52.199> explanation<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.429> is

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
purposes the short explanation of it is

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.500 
purposes the short explanation of it is
that<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.269> will<00:00:54.469> help<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:56.000> increasing<00:00:57.000> GPS

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
that it will help with increasing GPS

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.930 
that it will help with increasing GPS
accuracy<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:59.329> also<00:01:00.329> helps<00:01:00.690> create

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
accuracy and also helps create

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.060 
accuracy and also helps create
applications<00:01:02.940> augmented<00:01:03.839> reality

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
applications augmented reality

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.220 
applications augmented reality
applications<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.250> Wikitude<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.060> such<00:01:06.690> so

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
applications like Wikitude and such so

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.670 
applications like Wikitude and such so
location-based<00:01:07.860> services<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:10.170> TeleNav

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
location-based services and like TeleNav

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.370 
location-based services and like TeleNav
Foursquare<00:01:11.370> stuff<00:01:11.730> like<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.060> will<00:01:12.380> benefit

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
Foursquare stuff like that will benefit

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.980 
Foursquare stuff like that will benefit
from<00:01:13.440> having<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.070> magnetometer<00:01:14.910> built<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.450> as

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
from having the magnetometer built in as

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.740 
from having the magnetometer built in as
well<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.070> compass<00:01:17.430> application<00:01:17.640> now<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
well as the compass application now the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.480 
well as the compass application now the
compass<00:01:19.110> application<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.830> actually<00:01:20.220> kind<00:01:20.430> of

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
compass application is actually kind of

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.070 
compass application is actually kind of
cool<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.910> doesn't<00:01:21.060> really<00:01:21.360> serve<00:01:21.810> much

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
cool it doesn't really serve much

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.870 
cool it doesn't really serve much
purpose<00:01:22.110> for<00:01:22.680> me<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:23.160> I'm<00:01:23.280> pretty<00:01:23.310> sure<00:01:23.670> there

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
purpose for me but I'm pretty sure there

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.430 
purpose for me but I'm pretty sure there
may<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.060> some<00:01:24.390> people<00:01:24.570> out<00:01:24.810> there<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.200> can

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
may be some people out there that can

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.710 
may be some people out there that can
actually<00:01:25.890> make<00:01:26.640> use<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.910> it<00:01:27.210> for<00:01:27.420> what<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.690> was

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
actually make use of it for what it was

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.290 
actually make use of it for what it was
intended<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:29.580> you<00:01:29.730> see<00:01:29.910> it<00:01:30.060> does<00:01:30.650> work<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
intended for as you see it does work and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.740 
intended for as you see it does work and
there's<00:01:33.300> the<00:01:33.630> tune-up<00:01:35.060> window<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.300> does<00:01:36.510> pop

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
there's the tune-up window that does pop

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.080 
there's the tune-up window that does pop
up<00:01:36.990> when<00:01:37.230> you<00:01:37.350> haven't<00:01:37.970> calibrated<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
up when you haven't calibrated the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.910 
up when you haven't calibrated the
actual<00:01:39.510> compass<00:01:39.900> now<00:01:40.080> as<00:01:40.230> you<00:01:40.380> guys<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.740> see

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
actual compass now as you guys can see

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.520 
actual compass now as you guys can see
on<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.160> screen<00:01:41.280> there<00:01:41.730> the<00:01:42.600> calibration

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
on the screen there the calibration

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.440 
on the screen there the calibration
method<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.040> actually<00:01:44.370> kind<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.700> funny<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.270> it

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
method is actually kind of funny for it

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.770 
method is actually kind of funny for it
so<00:01:45.770> compass<00:01:46.770> tune-up<00:01:47.160> you<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.060> move<00:01:48.540> away

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
so compass tune-up you have to move away

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.900 
so compass tune-up you have to move away
from<00:01:49.290> metal<00:01:49.470> then<00:01:49.920> flip<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.490> tilt<00:01:50.820> your

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
from metal then flip and tilt your

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.080 
from metal then flip and tilt your
device<00:01:51.170> repeatedly<00:01:52.170> until<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.920> buzzes<00:01:53.190> so

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
device repeatedly until it buzzes so

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.330 
device repeatedly until it buzzes so
like<00:01:55.080> I<00:01:55.170> say<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.470> kind<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.770> funny<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.280> you

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
like I say it's kind of funny so you

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.730 
like I say it's kind of funny so you
kind<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.730> have<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.910> just<00:01:57.300> basically<00:01:58.170> flip<00:01:58.560> your

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
kind of have to just basically flip your

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.310 
kind of have to just basically flip your
phone<00:01:58.980> around<00:01:59.160> a<00:01:59.640> few<00:02:00.630> times<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:03.180> there<00:02:04.140> goes

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
phone around a few times and there goes

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.650 
phone around a few times and there goes
the<00:02:04.350> buzz<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.640> calibrated<00:02:06.330> at<00:02:06.450> that

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
the buzz and it's calibrated at that

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.339 
the buzz and it's calibrated at that
point<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.729> that's<00:02:08.729> basically<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.509> when<00:02:09.869> you

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
point so that's basically it when you

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.809 
point so that's basically it when you
have<00:02:10.469> it<00:02:10.619> calibrated<00:02:11.129> then<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.549> should<00:02:11.730> be

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
have it calibrated then it should be

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.320 
have it calibrated then it should be
working<00:02:12.060> as<00:02:12.390> as<00:02:12.989> expected<00:02:13.760> there<00:02:14.760> are<00:02:14.879> a<00:02:14.909> few

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
working as as expected there are a few

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.270 
working as as expected there are a few
options<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.050> can<00:02:16.200> choose<00:02:16.440> from<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.950> here

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
options that you can choose from in here

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.520 
options that you can choose from in here
like<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:18.360> can<00:02:18.540> calibrate<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:19.140> whenever<00:02:19.320> you

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
like you can calibrate it whenever you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.180 
like you can calibrate it whenever you
do<00:02:19.770> so<00:02:19.980> wish<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:22.140> option<00:02:22.500> for<00:02:22.770> display

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
do so wish the option for display

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.680 
do so wish the option for display
settings<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.790> can<00:02:24.000> turn<00:02:24.180> your<00:02:24.240> latitude

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
settings so you can turn your latitude

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.770 
settings so you can turn your latitude
long<00:02:25.080> attitude<00:02:25.620> display<00:02:26.160> format<00:02:26.640> on<00:02:26.880> turn<00:02:27.600> it

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
long attitude display format on turn it

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.960 
long attitude display format on turn it
into<00:02:27.960> what<00:02:28.380> however<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:28.980> wish<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.460> have<00:02:29.820> it

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
into what however you wish to have it

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.510 
into what however you wish to have it
viewed<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:31.260> can<00:02:31.410> pick<00:02:31.590> true<00:02:31.830> north<00:02:32.070> or<00:02:32.430> you

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
viewed you can pick true north or you

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.030 
viewed you can pick true north or you
can<00:02:32.700> pick<00:02:32.820> magnetic<00:02:33.480> north<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.990> set<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
can pick magnetic north and set the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.040 
can pick magnetic north and set the
global<00:02:35.220> map<00:02:35.550> services<00:02:36.180> so<00:02:36.390> for<00:02:36.600> example<00:02:36.960> if

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
global map services so for example if

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.480 
global map services so for example if
you<00:02:37.140> have<00:02:38.960> Google<00:02:39.960> Maps<00:02:39.990> installed<00:02:40.680> if<00:02:41.280> you

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
you have Google Maps installed if you

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.240 
you have Google Maps installed if you
have<00:02:41.580> blackberry<00:02:42.030> Maps<00:02:42.360> installed<00:02:42.810> it's<00:02:43.800> just

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
have blackberry Maps installed it's just

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.580 
have blackberry Maps installed it's just
basically<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:45.060> fonts<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.780> cache<00:02:46.200> sizes

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
basically the fonts and the cache sizes

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.770 
basically the fonts and the cache sizes
the<00:02:47.190> system<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.700> measurement<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.330> know<00:02:48.540> like

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
the system of measurement you know like

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.500 
the system of measurement you know like
the<00:02:48.900> imperial<00:02:49.730> kilometers<00:02:50.730> miles<00:02:51.060> whatever

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
the imperial kilometers miles whatever

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.400 
the imperial kilometers miles whatever
however<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.770> wish<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.070> go<00:02:53.190> ahead<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.610> view<00:02:53.790> it

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
however you wish to go ahead and view it

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.050 
however you wish to go ahead and view it
again<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.530> does<00:02:55.709> integrate<00:02:56.310> with<00:02:56.490> blackberry

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
again it does integrate with blackberry

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.540 
again it does integrate with blackberry
maps<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.320> can<00:02:58.680> pull<00:02:58.920> up<00:02:58.950> your<00:02:59.100> own

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
maps so you can pull up your own

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.300 
maps so you can pull up your own
location<00:02:59.940> on<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.540> map<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.050> have<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.100> load

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
location on the map and have it load

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.380 
location on the map and have it load
everything<00:03:02.640> up<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:04.580> it<00:03:05.580> shows<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:05.970> I'm<00:03:06.240> in

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
everything up and it shows that I'm in

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.720 
everything up and it shows that I'm in
Dartmouth<00:03:06.750> but<00:03:06.930> we<00:03:07.080> can<00:03:07.230> actually<00:03:07.490> zoom<00:03:08.490> in<00:03:08.670> a

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
Dartmouth but we can actually zoom in a

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.420 
Dartmouth but we can actually zoom in a
little<00:03:08.940> bit<00:03:09.209> there<00:03:09.510> find<00:03:10.260> out<00:03:10.380> how<00:03:10.590> accurate

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
little bit there find out how accurate

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.750 
little bit there find out how accurate
it<00:03:11.610> really<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:16.070> guess<00:03:17.070> I<00:03:17.190> reach<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.550> zoom

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
it really is I guess I reach the zoom

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.240 
it really is I guess I reach the zoom
level<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.870> that's<00:03:19.140> that's<00:03:19.800> pretty<00:03:19.920> accurate

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
level and that's that's pretty accurate

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.130 
level and that's that's pretty accurate
for<00:03:20.519> where<00:03:20.850> I<00:03:20.880> am<00:03:20.970> it's<00:03:21.269> gotta<00:03:21.570> be<00:03:21.750> on<00:03:21.989> the

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
for where I am it's gotta be on the

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.960 
for where I am it's gotta be on the
right<00:03:22.320> Street<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.400> looks<00:03:23.670> like<00:03:23.820> I'm

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
right Street and it looks like I'm

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.970 
right Street and it looks like I'm
pretty<00:03:24.360> pretty<00:03:25.110> much<00:03:25.350> right<00:03:25.590> where<00:03:25.800> my

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
pretty pretty much right where my

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.040 
pretty pretty much right where my
building<00:03:26.489> is<00:03:26.700> so<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.420> pulled<00:03:27.750> down<00:03:27.810> the

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
building is so it pulled down the

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.290 
building is so it pulled down the
information<00:03:28.410> rather<00:03:28.769> quickly<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.459> if<00:03:30.000> you

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
information rather quickly and if you

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.509 
information rather quickly and if you
wish<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:31.080> go<00:03:31.350> ahead<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.890> set<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.190> destination

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
wish to go ahead and set a destination

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.970 
wish to go ahead and set a destination
or<00:03:33.209> anything<00:03:33.420> like<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:34.380> does<00:03:34.650> allow<00:03:34.830> for

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
or anything like that it does allow for

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.400 
or anything like that it does allow for
that<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:35.850> can<00:03:36.090> pull<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:36.390> up<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.840> let's<00:03:37.110> see

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
that so you can pull it up and let's see

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.910 
that so you can pull it up and let's see
how<00:03:38.130> fast<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.610> pulls<00:03:38.880> down<00:03:39.150> information<00:03:39.920> I'll

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
how fast it pulls down information I'll

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:50.000 
how fast it pulls down information I'll
check<00:03:41.489> my<00:03:41.670> mum's<00:03:42.590> address<00:03:48.470> see<00:03:49.470> how<00:03:49.530> fast<00:03:49.800> it

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
check my mum's address see how fast it

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.479 
check my mum's address see how fast it
pulls<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:50.459> up<00:03:51.530> there<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:55.590> again<00:03:55.920> you<00:03:55.980> can<00:03:56.250> tap

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
pulls it up there and again you can tap

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.759 
pulls it up there and again you can tap
in<00:03:56.730> on<00:03:56.940> wherever<00:03:57.450> it<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:57.900> you<00:03:58.110> can<00:03:58.260> choose<00:03:58.590> your

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
in on wherever it is you can choose your

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.280 
in on wherever it is you can choose your
option<00:03:59.550> and<00:03:59.670> then<00:04:00.180> once<00:04:00.360> you<00:04:00.450> tap<00:04:00.630> in<00:04:00.840> on<00:04:00.989> it<00:04:01.170> it

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
option and then once you tap in on it it

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.199 
option and then once you tap in on it it
tells<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.650> exactly<00:04:01.830> how<00:04:02.220> far<00:04:02.550> it<00:04:02.730> is<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:02.880> your

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
tells you exactly how far it is to your

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.670 
tells you exactly how far it is to your
destination<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.080> everything

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
destination and everything

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.460 
destination and everything
now<00:04:05.130> I'm<00:04:05.340> not<00:04:05.459> entirely<00:04:05.730> too<00:04:06.030> sure<00:04:06.260> what<00:04:07.260> else

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
now I'm not entirely too sure what else

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.500 
now I'm not entirely too sure what else
you<00:04:07.709> can<00:04:07.920> do<00:04:08.220> with<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.580> application<00:04:09.209> beyond

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
you can do with the application beyond

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.930 
you can do with the application beyond
this<00:04:09.800> but<00:04:10.800> like<00:04:10.950> I<00:04:11.070> say<00:04:11.250> there<00:04:11.430> will<00:04:11.580> be<00:04:11.700> later

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
this but like I say there will be later

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.729 
this but like I say there will be later
integration<00:04:12.720> that<00:04:12.870> will<00:04:12.989> come<00:04:13.200> with<00:04:13.350> it<00:04:13.560> and

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
integration that will come with it and

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.130 
integration that will come with it and
hopefully<00:04:14.549> make<00:04:14.910> better<00:04:15.120> use<00:04:15.390> of<00:04:15.420> it<00:04:15.780> so<00:04:15.810> that

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
hopefully make better use of it so that

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.009 
hopefully make better use of it so that
everybody<00:04:16.799> can<00:04:17.010> utilize<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:17.840> that's<00:04:18.840> it

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
everybody can utilize it that's it

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.199 
everybody can utilize it that's it
that's<00:04:19.049> pretty<00:04:19.560> much<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.769> good<00:04:20.549> look<00:04:20.729> at<00:04:20.940> the

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
that's pretty much a good look at the
