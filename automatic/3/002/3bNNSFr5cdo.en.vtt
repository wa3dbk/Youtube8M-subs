00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:04.209
 the product are more closely related 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.360
 they also see a picture here again 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.790
 yes this is didactically very nice area you can wonderful Wiesbaden them 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.729
 here 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:15.729
 what do you think 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.060
 You see They see 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.060
 the product manager 1 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.140
 they see the sun god is right 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.360
 Take a look around the product manager and group the function 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.020
 if she does that 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.480
 So the product manager Redl is at the center here, for example 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.570
 to name a product from Procter &amp; Gamble who betrayed the idea 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.500
 have 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.310
 Orban of the 1 more open 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.310
 the product is not 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.300
 as a city does not get out of the world out of theory 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.870
 was out of practice and Procter &amp; Gamble writes that so well that they do 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.070
 many years ago 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.470
 invented 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.459
 and so he is in the center 

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:06.560
 the product manager Radl for example 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.010
 and everything the product manager area needs is grouped around and around it 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.510
 the access 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.630
 There are two forms of access once the full competence 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.570
 and pushes one completely 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.570
 full competence means 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.450
 about some decisions 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.330
 that is, the product manager can borrow on the functional processes 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.600
 successful 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.360
 Look, let's look at research and development 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.409
 Legal Department and so on has theirs 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 and no competence means 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.760
 in the mood 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.570
 Well the product manager decide in the vote 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.060
 with the functional departments 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.410
 while the functional departments 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.450
 may still num other product manager to break 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.300
 yes this is classic for the Taiko means that is the product manager 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.930
 Areal calls his legal department and says 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.229
 but i had such a problem we use words specific area 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.860
 material 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.640
 he can bring legal issues with him, I like checking that out for 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.900
 but I have my construction order from product manager dapd 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.239
 among musicians, as you can see, that's good 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.979
 so vote there 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:26.800
 who at the perfect dance 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.160
 the product manager is actually a bit like a sunburn 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.249
 acts 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:32.929
 Knows music 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:36.879
 Historical heard the fourteenth Sun god for this 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.079
 built in Versailles 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.599
 and prompt him around 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.349
 all functions 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.700
 we have them all in the castle in their two wings Hampel itself 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.360
 all left all the offices you need to run our city yes 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.509
 and the closer one announces, the higher it was going to be in the EU 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:01.119
 Country is and only a bit 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:04.509
 yes that's a bit of a product manager like there but there 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:12.660
 Center at least at full complete when further competence like that already 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:13.730
 little kes
