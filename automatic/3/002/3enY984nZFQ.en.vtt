00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
I'm just going to use a clip to hold

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.289 
I'm just going to use a clip to hold
this<00:03:47.650> piece<00:03:47.920> because<00:03:48.190> I'm<00:03:48.489> gonna<00:03:48.609> start

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
this piece because I'm gonna start

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.650 
this piece because I'm gonna start
twisting<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.870> other<00:03:50.079> side<00:03:50.349> of<00:03:50.440> my<00:03:50.560> head

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
twisting the other side of my head

00:03:52.660 --> 00:04:01.200 
twisting the other side of my head
so<00:03:53.140> we<00:03:53.320> twist<00:03:53.740> twist<00:03:54.190> twist<00:03:54.460> it<00:03:58.440> okay<00:04:00.180> so<00:04:01.180> I

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
so we twist twist twist it okay so I

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.840 
so we twist twist twist it okay so I
twist<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.990> front<00:04:02.260> part<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:02.860> then<00:04:03.250> I<00:04:03.490> will<00:04:03.700> be

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
twist the front part and then I will be

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.500 
twist the front part and then I will be
left<00:04:04.090> with<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.810> middle<00:04:05.500> section<00:04:05.920> so<00:04:06.300> I<00:04:07.300> have

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
left with a middle section so I have

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.930 
left with a middle section so I have
three<00:04:07.750> sections<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.500> middle<00:04:09.370> section<00:04:09.550> make

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
three sections the middle section make

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.199 
three sections the middle section make
sure<00:04:10.120> you<00:04:10.300> go<00:04:10.450> under<00:04:11.020> not<00:04:11.260> over<00:04:12.090> under<00:04:15.060> this<00:04:16.060> is

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
sure you go under not over under this is

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.530 
sure you go under not over under this is
very<00:04:16.390> complicated<00:04:16.690> this<00:04:17.350> step<00:04:17.680> right<00:04:17.800> here

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
very complicated this step right here

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.260 
very complicated this step right here
but<00:04:19.540> anyways<00:04:20.459> under<00:04:21.459> and<00:04:21.760> then<00:04:21.940> start

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
but anyways under and then start

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.230 
but anyways under and then start
braiding<00:04:22.680> if<00:04:23.680> you<00:04:23.830> go<00:04:23.950> over<00:04:24.430> a<00:04:24.460> looks<00:04:24.910> like<00:04:25.180> you

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
braiding if you go over a looks like you

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.360 
braiding if you go over a looks like you
have<00:04:25.420> a<00:04:25.480> bump<00:04:25.720> on<00:04:25.840> your<00:04:25.870> head<00:04:26.170> so<00:04:26.800> this<00:04:26.980> under

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
have a bump on your head so this under

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.720 
have a bump on your head so this under
technique<00:04:28.050> just<00:04:29.050> creates<00:04:29.410> a<00:04:29.500> nice<00:04:29.650> flow<00:04:30.040> from

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
technique just creates a nice flow from

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.510 
technique just creates a nice flow from
the<00:04:30.850> twists<00:04:31.180> into<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:31.870> braid<00:04:32.080> and<00:04:32.890> you<00:04:33.310> just

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
the twists into the braid and you just

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.920 
the twists into the braid and you just
keep<00:04:33.790> braiding<00:04:34.180> it<00:04:34.690> up<00:04:34.960> braids<00:04:39.870> tie<00:04:40.870> the

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
keep braiding it up braids tie the

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.820 
keep braiding it up braids tie the
bottom<00:04:41.470> tie<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.460> bottom<00:04:42.700> tie<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.360> bottom<00:04:43.900> tie
