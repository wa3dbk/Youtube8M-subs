00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
that concept but the whole killed

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.100 
that concept but the whole killed
support<00:01:17.310> killstreaks<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.150> how<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.840> doesn't

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
support killstreaks and how it doesn't

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.190 
support killstreaks and how it doesn't
reset<00:01:19.409> if<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.650> die<00:01:19.860> i<00:01:20.720> don't<00:01:21.720> know<00:01:21.810> i<00:01:22.080> don't

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
reset if you die i don't know i don't

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.160

know<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.500> i'm<00:01:23.330> bored<00:01:24.330> against<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.840> right<00:01:25.049> now

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
know if i'm bored against it right now

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.140 
know if i'm bored against it right now
I'm<00:01:25.290> leaning<00:01:25.409> towards<00:01:26.280> against<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.970> because

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
I'm leaning towards against it because

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.910 
I'm leaning towards against it because
it<00:01:27.420> does<00:01:27.600> have<00:01:27.630> advanced<00:01:28.259> UAV<00:01:28.380> which<00:01:28.770> is

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
it does have advanced UAV which is

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.840 
it does have advanced UAV which is
basically<00:01:29.759> an<00:01:29.939> sr-71<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.890> might<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:32.820> a

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
basically an sr-71 and I might have a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.280 
basically an sr-71 and I might have a
problem<00:01:33.060> with<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.570> other<00:01:33.689> team<00:01:33.780> getting<00:01:34.200> an

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
problem with the other team getting an

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.590 
problem with the other team getting an
sr-71<00:01:34.799> because<00:01:35.250> when<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.670> usually<00:01:36.119> play<00:01:36.270> I'm

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
sr-71 because when I usually play I'm

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.069 
sr-71 because when I usually play I'm
I'm<00:01:37.610> not<00:01:38.610> used<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.970> having<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.659> other<00:01:39.810> team

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
I'm not used to having the other team

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.230 
I'm not used to having the other team
even<00:01:40.560> getting<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.920> simple<00:01:41.640> UAV

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
even getting a simple UAV

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.990 
even getting a simple UAV
but<00:01:43.869> the<00:01:43.930> more<00:01:44.110> I<00:01:44.140> think<00:01:44.290> about<00:01:44.560> it<00:01:44.740> I<00:01:45.040> could<00:01:45.759> I

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
but the more I think about it I could I

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.899 
but the more I think about it I could I
could<00:01:46.030> really<00:01:46.329> see<00:01:46.689> how<00:01:47.340> even<00:01:48.340> for<00:01:48.700> a<00:01:48.729> new

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
could really see how even for a new

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.340 
could really see how even for a new
player<00:01:49.320> getting<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.920> amount<00:01:51.220> of<00:01:51.340> kills

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
player getting the amount of kills

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.219 
player getting the amount of kills
necessary<00:01:53.350> for<00:01:53.649> sr-71<00:01:54.420> would<00:01:55.420> be<00:01:55.540> quite<00:01:56.020> hard

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
necessary for sr-71 would be quite hard

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.289 
necessary for sr-71 would be quite hard
I<00:01:56.530> don't<00:01:57.130> know<00:01:57.189> what<00:01:57.310> happened<00:01:57.670> here<00:01:57.909> like

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
I don't know what happened here like

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.980 
I don't know what happened here like
this<00:01:58.680> no<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.979> cyber<00:02:00.189> rifles<00:02:00.720> actually<00:02:01.720> I<00:02:01.780> have

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
this no the cyber rifles actually I have

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.510 
this no the cyber rifles actually I have
another<00:02:02.020> video<00:02:02.470> actually<00:02:02.740> coming<00:02:03.070> up<00:02:03.250> later

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
another video actually coming up later

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.359 
another video actually coming up later
on<00:02:03.789> about<00:02:04.720> sniping<00:02:05.140> but<00:02:05.679> quick<00:02:05.860> scoping<00:02:06.250> and

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
on about sniping but quick scoping and

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.919 
on about sniping but quick scoping and
how<00:02:06.490> it's<00:02:06.670> come<00:02:06.880> back<00:02:06.909> in<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.450> great<00:02:07.720> new<00:02:07.899> way

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
how it's come back in a great new way

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.830 
how it's come back in a great new way
it's<00:02:08.709> actually<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:09.369> lot<00:02:09.759> easier<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:10.269> to

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
it's actually a lot easier to to

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.190 
it's actually a lot easier to to
quickscope<00:02:12.180> modern<00:02:13.180> warfare<00:02:13.330> 3<00:02:13.510> then<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:13.989> was

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
quickscope modern warfare 3 then it was

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.979 
quickscope modern warfare 3 then it was
