on<00:00:01.890> here<00:00:02.280> and<00:00:02.460> today<00:00:02.879> I'm<00:00:03.810> going<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.319> be<00:00:04.410> taken

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
on here and today I'm going to be taken

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.800 
on here and today I'm going to be taken
off<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.069> Northbridge<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:06.000> southbridge<00:00:06.660> off

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
off the Northbridge and southbridge off

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.049 
off the Northbridge and southbridge off
my<00:00:06.960> EVGA<00:00:07.259> s<00:00:07.620> all<00:00:07.890> I<00:00:07.919> classified<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.940> way

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
my EVGA s all I classified the way

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.180 
my EVGA s all I classified the way
reason<00:00:09.599> why<00:00:09.690> I'm<00:00:09.840> doing<00:00:09.960> this<00:00:10.139> excuse<00:00:10.860> me<00:00:11.040> is

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
reason why I'm doing this excuse me is

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.320 
reason why I'm doing this excuse me is
because<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.610> lot<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:11.910> people<00:00:12.000> have<00:00:12.300> been

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
because a lot of people have been

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.360 
because a lot of people have been
claimed<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:13.590> their<00:00:13.799> temperatures<00:00:14.219> are

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
claimed that their temperatures are

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.890 
claimed that their temperatures are
getting<00:00:14.639> too<00:00:14.790> hot<00:00:15.000> on<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.330> Northbridge<00:00:15.780> I

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
getting too hot on the Northbridge I

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.260 
getting too hot on the Northbridge I
think<00:00:16.109> it's<00:00:16.230> 50<00:00:17.100> or<00:00:17.220> 60<00:00:17.520> degrees<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.090> they're

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
think it's 50 or 60 degrees that they're

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.099 
think it's 50 or 60 degrees that they're
hitting<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:19.520> temperature<00:00:20.520> range<00:00:20.760> but<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
hitting it in temperature range but the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.590 
hitting it in temperature range but the
best<00:00:22.289> way<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.560> do<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.060> take<00:00:24.060> off<00:00:24.269> your

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
best way to do that is take off your

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.990 
best way to do that is take off your
Northbridge<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.260> your<00:00:25.439> southbridge<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:26.130> your

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
Northbridge and your southbridge on your

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.700 
Northbridge and your southbridge on your

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
EV j SL I classified and this is what it

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.530 
EV j SL I classified and this is what it
looks<00:00:31.890> like<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.820> what<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.030> North<00:00:33.300> Bridge

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
looks like this is what a North Bridge

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.440 
looks like this is what a North Bridge
would<00:00:33.809> be<00:00:33.960> right<00:00:34.170> here<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:35.180> this<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.239> where

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
would be right here and this is where

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.950 
would be right here and this is where
the<00:00:36.840> Southbridge<00:00:37.410> would<00:00:37.649> be<00:00:37.800> right<00:00:37.980> here<00:00:38.010> and

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
the Southbridge would be right here and

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.729 
the Southbridge would be right here and
here's<00:00:40.879> here's<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.239> heat<00:00:42.809> sink<00:00:43.050> itself<00:00:43.440> right

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
here's here's the heat sink itself right

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.180 
here's here's the heat sink itself right
here<00:00:44.420> that's<00:00:45.420> what<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.660> looks<00:00:45.870> like

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
here that's what it looks like

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.799 
here that's what it looks like
underneath<00:00:47.190> as<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:47.879> tell<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.480> thermal

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
underneath as you can tell the thermal

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.229 
underneath as you can tell the thermal
paste<00:00:49.020> really<00:00:49.289> didn't<00:00:49.469> spread<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.129> well<00:00:50.309> in

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
paste really didn't spread to it well in

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.350 
paste really didn't spread to it well in
my<00:00:51.300> opinion<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.789> some<00:00:53.789> reason<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.180> feel

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
my opinion and some reason to feel

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.729 
my opinion and some reason to feel
pretty<00:00:55.050> powdery<00:00:55.559> right<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:57.739> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
pretty powdery right here the the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.380 
pretty powdery right here the the
thermal<00:00:59.219> compound<00:00:59.370> didn't<00:00:59.879> look<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.239> was

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
thermal compound didn't look like it was

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.319 
thermal compound didn't look like it was
spread<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.989> evenly<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.940> I'm<00:01:03.120> just

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
spread to evenly on here and I'm just

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.950 
spread to evenly on here and I'm just
going<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.570> do<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.040> like<00:01:05.119> little<00:01:06.119> dot<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.780> then

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
going to do the like little dot and then

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.679 
going to do the like little dot and then
put<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.830> heat<00:01:08.130> sink<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.490> top<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.180> they<00:01:09.479> use

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
put the heat sink on top and they use

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:10.969 
put the heat sink on top and they use
the<00:01:09.869> pressure<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.350> spread<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.710> out<00:01:10.770> evenly

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the pressure to spread it out evenly

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.920 
the pressure to spread it out evenly
instead<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> plastic<00:01:11.850> baggie<00:01:12.390> method

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
instead of the plastic baggie method

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.840 
instead of the plastic baggie method
this<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.740> my<00:01:13.860> preference<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.700> can

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
this is just my preference but you can

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.999 
this is just my preference but you can
do<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.090> plastic<00:01:15.540> baggie<00:01:15.810> method<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.530> lot<00:01:16.890> of

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
do the plastic baggie method a lot of

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.630 
do the plastic baggie method a lot of
people<00:01:17.280> use<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:18.350> but<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.369> what<00:01:20.549> it

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
people use that but this is what it

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.609 
people use that but this is what it
looks<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:20.939> right<00:01:21.000> here<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.320> thermal

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
looks like right here in the thermal

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.289 
looks like right here in the thermal
compound<00:01:22.799> I'm<00:01:23.159> going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.430> replacing<00:01:23.610> with

compound I'm going to be replacing with

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.469 
compound I'm going to be replacing with
this<00:01:24.930> one<00:01:25.170> into<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.409> top<00:01:25.650> 20<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.159> recommend<00:01:26.729> if

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
this one into the top 20 to recommend if

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.230 
this one into the top 20 to recommend if
I<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.810> pop<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.259> out
