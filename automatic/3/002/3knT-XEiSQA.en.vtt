00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.869 

I'm<00:00:00.900> always<00:00:01.230> convinced<00:00:02.040> and<00:00:02.220> I<00:00:02.310> say<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.580> my

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
I'm always convinced and I say to my

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.930 
I'm always convinced and I say to my
rowers<00:00:03.240> that<00:00:03.720> they<00:00:04.290> cannot<00:00:04.560> be<00:00:04.830> perfect<00:00:05.310> when

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
rowers that they cannot be perfect when

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.240 
rowers that they cannot be perfect when
they<00:00:06.150> roll<00:00:06.390> so<00:00:06.900> we<00:00:06.930> don't<00:00:07.470> ask<00:00:07.710> really<00:00:08.009> the

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
they roll so we don't ask really the

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.640 
they roll so we don't ask really the
perfection<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.030> moment<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.990> coach<00:00:10.260> that

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
perfection of a moment the coach that

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.740 
perfection of a moment the coach that
they<00:00:10.889> ask<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.370> perfection<00:00:12.000> they<00:00:12.389> will<00:00:12.570> never

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
they ask the perfection they will never

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.830 
they ask the perfection they will never
finishes<00:00:13.530> job<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.250> impossible<00:00:14.840> because

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
finishes job and is impossible because

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.620 
finishes job and is impossible because
there<00:00:16.349> are<00:00:16.470> some<00:00:16.890> moments<00:00:17.099> that<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:18.060> ask<00:00:18.269> them

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
there are some moments that you ask them

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.109 
there are some moments that you ask them
and<00:00:18.839> they<00:00:19.079> are<00:00:19.199> not<00:00:19.349> able<00:00:19.589> to<00:00:19.739> change<00:00:20.099> it<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
and they are not able to change it the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.419 
and they are not able to change it the
best<00:00:21.359> way<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.720> communicate<00:00:22.259> with<00:00:22.769> my<00:00:23.009> rowers

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:23.429 
best way to communicate with my rowers

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.329 
best way to communicate with my rowers
is<00:00:23.789> not<00:00:24.119> just<00:00:24.539> nice<00:00:24.869> words<00:00:25.319> important<00:00:26.039> words

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:26.339 
is not just nice words important words

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:31.069 
is not just nice words important words
but<00:00:27.199> simple<00:00:28.199> words<00:00:28.470> simple<00:00:29.329> effect<00:00:30.329> and<00:00:30.689> see

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
but simple words simple effect and see

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.349 
but simple words simple effect and see
if<00:00:31.439> they<00:00:31.949> are<00:00:31.979> able<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.369> realize<00:00:32.879> it<00:00:33.120> for

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:33.359 
if they are able to realize it for

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:36.979 
if they are able to realize it for
example<00:00:34.320> with<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.370> girl<00:00:35.699> she<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.539> quite<00:00:36.870> good

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
example with this girl she is quite good

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.200 
example with this girl she is quite good
in<00:00:37.350> technique<00:00:37.679> but<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:39.030> girl<00:00:39.359> shares<00:00:40.289> some

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
in technique but this girl shares some

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.619 
in technique but this girl shares some
mistakes<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.600> feeling<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.800> catch<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.399> what<00:00:45.059> if

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
mistakes of feeling the catch of what if

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.700 
mistakes of feeling the catch of what if
you<00:00:45.899> see<00:00:46.199> her<00:00:47.039> catch<00:00:47.519> is<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:48.120> always<00:00:48.660> exact<00:00:49.140> so

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
you see her catch is not always exact so

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.279 
you see her catch is not always exact so
in<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.039> exercise<00:00:50.460> she<00:00:51.449> should<00:00:51.690> be<00:00:51.929> able<00:00:52.079> to

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
in this exercise she should be able to

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.259 
in this exercise she should be able to
understand<00:00:52.890> when<00:00:53.219> she<00:00:53.249> can<00:00:53.789> make<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:53.999> good

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
understand when she can make a good

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.290 
understand when she can make a good
catch<00:00:54.659> or<00:00:55.050> bad<00:00:55.589> fetch<00:00:55.920> because<00:00:56.370> if<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.059> move

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
catch or bad fetch because if you move

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.209 
catch or bad fetch because if you move
easily<00:00:57.839> back<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.499> you<00:00:58.559> don't<00:00:58.739> feel<00:00:58.980> any

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
easily back and you don't feel any

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.119 
easily back and you don't feel any
pressure<00:00:59.429> with<00:00:59.819> the<00:00:59.940> water<00:01:00.179> in<00:01:00.839> this<00:01:01.050> case<00:01:01.350> she

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
pressure with the water in this case she

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.040 
pressure with the water in this case she
understand<00:01:02.670> or<00:01:02.909> should<00:01:03.059> understand<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
understand or should understand that the

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.870 
understand or should understand that the
connection<00:01:04.559> with<00:01:04.649> the<00:01:04.769> blue<00:01:04.949> water<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.670> not

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
connection with the blue water is not

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.679 
connection with the blue water is not
correct<00:01:06.329> and<00:01:07.159> she<00:01:08.159> need<00:01:08.310> time<00:01:08.549> for<00:01:08.579> this<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
correct and she need time for this the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.770 
correct and she need time for this the
second<00:01:10.020> point<00:01:10.259> for<00:01:10.710> air<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.090> finish<00:01:12.479> you

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
second point for air is the finish you

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.560 
second point for air is the finish you
see<00:01:13.619> she's<00:01:13.920> taking<00:01:14.610> down<00:01:14.850> at<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.360> ends

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
see she's taking down at the ends

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.070 
see she's taking down at the ends
all<00:01:16.660> Rovers<00:01:17.260> to<00:01:17.590> go<00:01:17.950> up<00:01:18.160> with<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.550> stroke<00:01:18.850> rate

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
all Rovers to go up with the stroke rate

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.200 
all Rovers to go up with the stroke rate
they<00:01:20.080> find<00:01:20.380> a<00:01:20.500> solution<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:21.160> go<00:01:21.340> very<00:01:21.610> fast

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
they find a solution to go very fast

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.500 
they find a solution to go very fast
down<00:01:22.660> and<00:01:23.470> rushed<00:01:23.830> in<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.190> recovery<00:01:24.670> because

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
down and rushed in the recovery because

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.420 
down and rushed in the recovery because
for<00:01:25.930> technical<00:01:26.650> point<00:01:26.890> of<00:01:27.010> view<00:01:27.040> you<00:01:27.400> should

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
for technical point of view you should

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.910 
for technical point of view you should
say<00:01:27.880> always<00:01:28.300> low<00:01:28.660> stroke<00:01:29.080> rate<00:01:29.350> and<00:01:29.590> we<00:01:29.890> have

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
say always low stroke rate and we have

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.490 
say always low stroke rate and we have
perfect<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.640> rowing<00:01:30.910> technique<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:32.320> cannot

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
perfect the rowing technique we cannot

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.620 
perfect the rowing technique we cannot
do<00:01:32.740> this<00:01:32.920> in<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.190> race<00:01:33.340> so<00:01:33.880> we<00:01:33.940> must<00:01:34.120> find<00:01:34.330> the

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
do this in the race so we must find the

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.860 
do this in the race so we must find the
compromise<00:01:34.930> all<00:01:35.770> my<00:01:36.100> crews<00:01:36.400> now<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:37.540> they<00:01:37.720> are

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
compromise all my crews now and they are

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.650 
compromise all my crews now and they are
very<00:01:38.229> much<00:01:38.470> concentrate<00:01:39.280> on<00:01:39.910> the<00:01:40.330> on<00:01:40.540> the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
very much concentrate on the on the

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.040 
very much concentrate on the on the
catch<00:01:40.870> because<00:01:41.830> is<00:01:42.400> due<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.360> fact<00:01:43.510> that<00:01:43.660> we

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
catch because is due to the fact that we

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.469 
catch because is due to the fact that we
go<00:01:44.229> up<00:01:44.260> stroke<00:01:44.800> rates<00:01:45.100> their<00:01:45.880> first<00:01:46.270> mistake

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
go up stroke rates their first mistake

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.320 
go up stroke rates their first mistake
is<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:47.110> catch<00:01:47.290> so<00:01:47.830> these<00:01:48.070> girls<00:01:48.340> both<00:01:48.910> of<00:01:48.940> them

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
is the catch so these girls both of them

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.570 
is the catch so these girls both of them
they<00:01:49.540> are<00:01:49.570> good<00:01:49.930> but<00:01:50.500> they<00:01:50.680> look<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.190> blade<00:01:51.400> at

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
they are good but they look the blade at

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.150 
they are good but they look the blade at
the<00:01:51.610> Ketchel<00:01:52.060> they<00:01:52.180> are<00:01:52.270> doing<00:01:52.950> they're<00:01:53.950> going

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
the Ketchel they are doing they're going

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.530 
the Ketchel they are doing they're going
up<00:01:55.259> losing<00:01:56.259> balance<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.700> then<00:01:57.910> when<00:01:58.180> they<00:01:58.330> put

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
up losing balance and then when they put

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.390 
up losing balance and then when they put
the<00:01:58.630> blade<00:01:58.810> in<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.990> water<00:01:59.110> they<00:01:59.920> lose<00:02:00.130> too

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
the blade in the water they lose too

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.109 
the blade in the water they lose too
much<00:02:00.550> water<00:02:00.850> so<00:02:01.240> this<00:02:02.140> is<00:02:02.320> very<00:02:03.190> common<00:02:03.460> throw

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
much water so this is very common throw

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.230 
much water so this is very common throw
so<00:02:04.960> tell<00:02:05.229> them<00:02:05.410> go<00:02:05.800> closer<00:02:06.160> to<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.580> water<00:02:06.790> and

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
so tell them go closer to the water and

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.960 
so tell them go closer to the water and
try<00:02:07.509> to<00:02:07.570> find<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:07.990> water<00:02:08.200> I<00:02:08.500> think<00:02:08.560> one<00:02:09.220> of<00:02:09.250> the

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
try to find the water I think one of the

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.120 
try to find the water I think one of the
key<00:02:10.390> point<00:02:10.660> for<00:02:11.050> mobile<00:02:11.739> speedboat<00:02:12.700> is<00:02:13.300> that

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
key point for mobile speedboat is that

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.590 
key point for mobile speedboat is that
we<00:02:15.130> need<00:02:15.340> that<00:02:15.580> lets<00:02:15.880> they<00:02:16.180> have<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.300> really

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
we need that lets they have a really

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.930 
we need that lets they have a really
good<00:02:16.780> feeling<00:02:17.080> of<00:02:17.350> speed<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:18.100> economy<00:02:18.850> of

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
good feeling of speed the economy of

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.810 
good feeling of speed the economy of
movement<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.600> Cox<00:02:19.840> s4<00:02:20.380> is<00:02:21.040> something<00:02:21.550> more

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
movement in Cox s4 is something more

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.900 
movement in Cox s4 is something more
important<00:02:22.570> than<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.810> power<00:02:23.070> so<00:02:24.070> if<00:02:24.550> the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
important than the power so if the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.180 
important than the power so if the
robotic<00:02:25.480> access<00:02:25.840> for<00:02:26.110> their<00:02:26.709> really<00:02:27.070> good

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
robotic access for their really good

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.800 
robotic access for their really good
feeling<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:27.820> their<00:02:28.000> very<00:02:28.239> good<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.570> length

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
feeling and their very good the length

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.100 
feeling and their very good the length
of<00:02:29.050> stroke<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.500> they<00:02:29.920> feel<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:31.239> right<00:02:31.450> moment

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
of stroke and they feel the right moment

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.350 
of stroke and they feel the right moment
of<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.410> cage<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:33.010> they<00:02:33.190> feel<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.640> right<00:02:33.790> moment

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
of a cage and they feel the right moment

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.780 
of a cage and they feel the right moment
of<00:02:34.540> exit<00:02:34.959> in<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.230> finish<00:02:35.590> these<00:02:36.250> Rovers

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
of exit in the finish these Rovers

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.750 
of exit in the finish these Rovers
really<00:02:37.630> they<00:02:38.049> can<00:02:38.110> make<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.530> fast<00:02:38.920> boat<00:02:39.280> also<00:02:39.670> if

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
really they can make a fast boat also if

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.150 
really they can make a fast boat also if
they<00:02:40.030> are<00:02:40.060> not<00:02:40.420> huge<00:02:40.720> huge<00:02:41.230> power<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.950> main

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
they are not huge huge power the main

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.060 
they are not huge huge power the main
target<00:02:42.610> for<00:02:42.640> them<00:02:43.209> is<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.810> get<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.530> feeling<00:02:44.890> of

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
target for them is to get the feeling of

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.310 
target for them is to get the feeling of
being<00:02:45.130> together<00:02:45.730> in<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.750> catch

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
being together in the catch

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.530 
being together in the catch
so<00:02:47.650> they<00:02:47.980> must<00:02:48.190> have<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.700> feeling<00:02:49.030> that<00:02:49.060> they

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
so they must have the feeling that they

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.080 
so they must have the feeling that they
move<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.140> boat<00:02:50.530> together<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.880> last

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
move the boat together and the last

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.930 
move the boat together and the last
point<00:02:52.360> is<00:02:52.630> also<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.170> finish<00:02:53.500> because<00:02:53.940> rowing

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
point is also the finish because rowing

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.380 
point is also the finish because rowing
you<00:02:55.810> know<00:02:55.959> when<00:02:56.350> you<00:02:56.739> pool<00:02:57.130> is<00:02:58.090> not

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
you know when you pool is not

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.050 
you know when you pool is not
complicated<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:59.709> only<00:03:00.010> to<00:03:00.430> complicated

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
complicated the only to complicated

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.570 
complicated the only to complicated
things<00:03:01.360> in<00:03:01.570> my<00:03:01.750> opinion<00:03:02.230> or<00:03:02.440> when<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:03.250> put<00:03:03.280> the

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
things in my opinion or when you put the

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.940 
things in my opinion or when you put the
blade<00:03:03.760> in<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:03.910> water<00:03:04.209> and<00:03:04.510> when<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:05.140> take<00:03:05.709> out

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
blade in the water and when you take out

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.000 
blade in the water and when you take out
the<00:03:06.310> blade<00:03:06.489> from

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
the blade from

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.940 
the blade from
these<00:03:07.849> two<00:03:08.120> points<00:03:08.599> are<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:09.170> very<00:03:09.379> sensitive

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
these two points are the very sensitive

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:10.360 
these two points are the very sensitive
one

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
one

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.050 
one
and<00:03:10.610> my<00:03:11.150> rowers<00:03:11.769> they<00:03:12.769> try<00:03:13.190> to<00:03:13.250> move<00:03:13.670> together

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
and my rowers they try to move together

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.660 
and my rowers they try to move together
but<00:03:14.540> always<00:03:15.230> we<00:03:15.500> must<00:03:15.530> recall<00:03:16.220> this<00:03:16.430> point

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
but always we must recall this point

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.399 
but always we must recall this point
because<00:03:16.909> if<00:03:17.180> they<00:03:17.390> learn<00:03:17.569> once<00:03:17.900> doesn't<00:03:18.319> mean

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:18.409 
because if they learn once doesn't mean

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.430 
because if they learn once doesn't mean
that<00:03:18.680> is<00:03:18.890> forever<00:03:19.209> so<00:03:20.209> always<00:03:20.540> you<00:03:20.959> must<00:03:21.200> put

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
that is forever so always you must put

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.989 
that is forever so always you must put
attention<00:03:21.890> on<00:03:22.129> this<00:03:22.720> basically<00:03:23.720> pawns
