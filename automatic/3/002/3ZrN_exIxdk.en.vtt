00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.060
 It is considered the liturgi stunt the century has been for over 70 years next to 

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:08.269
 john paul 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.379
 as a master of the celebrations of the holy father he was also close 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.919
 we are talking about the archbishop to the current pontiff and some years ago 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:24.029
 titular martyr of Monsignor a piero marini in the visit in enter camasca in 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.090
 seriana valley and this today a gandino to celebrate a solemn 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.610
 concelebration in the solemnity of Christ I listen to a service that I do 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.310
 it was asked 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:43.800
 and this service started 45 years after 22 years working with it already 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.180
 congregation 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.940
 for worship and even before in the councils omg 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.910
 for the implementation of the liturgical reform 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.870
 this bo burber service to the successor of peter to the bishop of 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.650
 universal church yes e 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.670
 prolonged over time 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.270
 on Friday, what I could imagine 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.480
 and this is due both to the pontificate of john paul according to 27 years 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.150
 and also from the illness that the Pope had in recent years 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.550
 and that made it difficult for him to change the people around him or 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.229
 better 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.409
 it was easier for him to carry out his ministry also for this reason 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:38.170
 service if extended for over 20 years 20 and a half years I am 18 years old over 18 years 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.770
 with john paul second two and a half years cont 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.040
 his blessed successor decimesto six kesa more left than this service 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.830
 we were saying master of the celebrations of the holy father we want to remember 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.300
 what is this task in what 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.300
 the task consists first or foremost 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.030
 - Kurganise 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.960
 direct 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.220
 the celebrations presided over by the pope ooh celebrated his name 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.780
 and therefore all the celebrations that take place in the Roman basilicas in Rome 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.129
 parishes of rome in italy 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.499
 and in all 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:22.479
 large or small communities that the pope visits that john paul according to abyss 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:23.589
 ita 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:26.719
 she according to rob 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:31.129
 The task of the master is also to assist the person of the 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.129
 holy father so these are the two races 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.819
 during all these years I could see say 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.339
 a shepherd 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:45.339
 in the exercise of his ministry 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:50.629
 the shepherd and chieri I met in Krakow in 1973 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.970
 king who celebrated this diocese with his people for years 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:03:01.049
 I then saw him as a father exercising this function throughout the church and 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.189
 then 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:06.749
 I could also see the exercise of what we call the ministry 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:10.649
 Petrine especially through celebrations
