00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Good day and welcome back 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.450
 to the new episode of the idea factory and 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.980
 today was or will be an idea 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.790
 presented by the northeast 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.660
 was submitted 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.429
 and that's about its own base 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.139
 Many fans wanted to attack 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.369
 surely you can already know 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.080
 you can attack your own 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.520
 maybe just destroy it for now 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.949
 the war is a lot of tactics 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.560
 Try out your little kick space 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.029
 holds or does not hold if you are 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.820
 for example , it can attack itself 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.500
 yes yes I do not know if so 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.059
 a sandbox mode in the specific in 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.860
 this particular motto gives the current 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.320
 also partially used but 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.079
 I do not know it at all 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.160
 cool if you attack menu now if 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.100
 as throw it down the left to a 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.450
 trigger triggers and left then has 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.739
 bottom left I know I have the now 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.510
 button around it but the gossip 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.160
 The main thing somewhere you have the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.420
 possibility its own base 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.590
 he had had to attack 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.510
 still with jewels 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.460
 but I find something there with jewels 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.199
 his normal, maybe even 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.480
 maybe nothing really costs 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.460
 only the games cost 57 gold back 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:08.790
 stand to test his own pace 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.920
 how strong she is whether man has one or not 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.510
 could go kick his own best 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.100
 and win and, as I said, around 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.530
 clear war just to test where 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.460
 are because the weak points or 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.689
 may be practicing a few attacks 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.430
 because I mean mine if you own one 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.659
 the units would seem better 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.939
 then do not lose and like that 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.100
 sandbox attack so you can stop 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.250
 do what you want and eat something 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.500
 one would like his own wisdom under 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.150
 take fire so to speak and yes something 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.979
 something not really also said well 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.390
 not so bad so know me 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.310
 just then even own base 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.960
 attack and see how shit 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.000
 serve seriously for the opponent is because 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.460
 the sopac is constructed because so lousy 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.680
 is constructed 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.950
 why did she test if she holds up to her 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.119
 withstand or if they really only 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.610
 find free resources go there 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.130
 So it would not be bad for me 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.810
 Of course, but look forward to see if 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.549
 something would be implemented at all 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.049
 At least that would be ideal from the northeast I 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.100
 do not think they are bad and like 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.969
 your opinion 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.500
 What you would say to that, if you like 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.520
 would want to attack your own base 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.619
 thought best you ever it 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.650
 or if we have it now if we 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.230
 want to do it 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.629
 whatever your opinion of the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.790
 comments that have been out of their own 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.530
 Pace attack maybe possible times 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.000
 watch financial spectators in any case 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.129
 until the next episode of the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.129
 idea factory until then people at 3
