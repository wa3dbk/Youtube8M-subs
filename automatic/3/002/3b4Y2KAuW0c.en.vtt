water in it and start it smell good
light<00:05:38.160> now<00:05:38.370> so<00:05:38.880> then<00:05:39.120> we<00:05:39.840> should<00:05:40.050> take<00:05:40.490> how<00:05:41.490> is

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
light now so then we should take how is

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:50.150 
light now so then we should take how is
I<00:05:47.630> think<00:05:48.630> that<00:05:48.960> air<00:05:49.139> is<00:05:49.290> pretty<00:05:49.560> good<00:05:49.889> right

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
so then after you get a little bubble

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:05.689 
so then after you get a little bubble
