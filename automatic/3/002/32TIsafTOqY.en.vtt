00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.840
 information video so remember 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.779
 a few days ago you have exit 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.669
 information video of discoveries on 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.860
 the project that a Frenchman was doing 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.930
 to do so this French was done at m 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.149
 and in fact he modified vehicles 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.890
 which are already available in gta 5 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.899
 so online sports and 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.270
 supersportives is actually he did 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.649
 spyder roadster versions of 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.989
 convertible actually makes antics and 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.309
 who are really stylish so in the 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.199
 previous video look at you have 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.210
 shown these three vehicles so the area 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.089
 turner listeners with and without spoiler 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.710
 who was quite appreciated in the 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.109
 comments she has more to a lot of 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.659
 people then here went away adheres 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.789
 great sport so this one she does not have 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.289
 we really do not go it's true that one 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.210
 bugatti veyron is such that we 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.260
 knows and not otherwise so this one 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.840
 will have to say that she gives us a little 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.150
 less pleased and to finish so from the old 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.830
 video we went sightseeing spyder 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.240
 voxel if that's really what all the 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.399
 fact that in the world is that everyone 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.420
 would like to have in gta 5 online so 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:17.899
 that's what I saw in your 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.320
 comments 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:24.439
 and then so this french sent me 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.820
 a message on twitter one telling me 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.189
 precisely that he had finished his work 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.990
 that he had finished modifying five more 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.210
 vehicles and who had sent them to 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.060
 rockstar so first keep here one 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.829
 has a titi xf roadster this one too 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.030
 frankly is really beautiful 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.579
 I even think it might be 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.890
 one of my favorites then here we have the 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.820
 cittÃ  spyder doc this one too is 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.079
 really not bad 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.240
 after as I said in 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.659
 the old video of the novelty that makes 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.149
 No problem 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.399
 we will not spit on it here 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.570
 there a farmer roadster this one too 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.579
 frankly I think if I should 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.890
 do a little ranking I m and that 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.200
 in second and the torno zone in 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.390
 third then these sciences discovers 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.899
 the vaca spyder those ones is 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.759
 really stylish and finally we will finish 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.960
 on the spyder porsche seems to look 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.520
 who is really beautiful 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.190
 apart from this one back which is a little 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.300
 odd in my opinion that I'm not going to say 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.560
 that it was badly done since 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.540
 frankly it's really beautiful 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.490
 but maybe a little badly finished for this 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.590
 vehicle broke a little weird 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.180
 all smooth flat and that's so we 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.580
 comes to the end of the discovery of those 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.650
 of his vehicles so that god my 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.600
 modified frankly they are really 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.890
 stylish in comments do not hesitate to 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.660

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.690
 just introduced do not hesitate 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.400
 not to make a small ranking 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.080

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.510

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.610
