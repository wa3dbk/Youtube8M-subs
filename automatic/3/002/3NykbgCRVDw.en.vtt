okay<00:00:01.650> in<00:00:01.740> this<00:00:01.890> tutorial<00:00:02.340> we're<00:00:02.429> going<00:00:02.520> to

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
okay in this tutorial we're going to

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.649 
okay in this tutorial we're going to
take<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.760> look<00:00:02.909> at<00:00:03.030> some<00:00:03.179> really<00:00:03.389> powerful

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
take a look at some really powerful

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.780 
take a look at some really powerful
features<00:00:04.380> built<00:00:04.680> into<00:00:04.859> blender<00:00:05.370> in<00:00:05.549> a

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
features built into blender in a

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.280 
features built into blender in a
particular<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.210> game<00:00:06.750> engine<00:00:07.109> which<00:00:07.259> is

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
particular the game engine which is

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.500 
particular the game engine which is
really<00:00:07.649> just<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.919> physics<00:00:08.250> engine<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.760> we<00:00:09.330> want

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
really just a physics engine and we want

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.820 
really just a physics engine and we want
to<00:00:09.570> take<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.719> look<00:00:09.870> at<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.019> game<00:00:10.200> logic<00:00:10.590> so

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
to take a look at the game logic so

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.499 
to take a look at the game logic so
we'll<00:00:10.950> switch<00:00:11.099> our<00:00:11.370> view<00:00:11.400> over<00:00:11.849> here<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.300> game

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
we'll switch our view over here to game

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.640 
we'll switch our view over here to game
logic<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.200> we<00:00:13.860> have<00:00:13.980> access<00:00:14.190> now<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.910> these

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
logic and we have access now to these

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.900 
logic and we have access now to these
actuators<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.680> sensors<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.310> controllers

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
actuators and sensors and controllers

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.460 
actuators and sensors and controllers
and<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.600> particular<00:00:18.930> we're<00:00:19.080> going<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.230> look<00:00:19.289> at

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
and in particular we're going to look at

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.349 
and in particular we're going to look at
or<00:00:19.650> these<00:00:19.800> game<00:00:20.100> properties<00:00:20.699> they're<00:00:21.119> really

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
or these game properties they're really

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.750 
or these game properties they're really
just<00:00:21.600> variables<00:00:22.080> which<00:00:22.980> if<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.430> haven't<00:00:23.580> done

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
just variables which if you haven't done

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.250 
just variables which if you haven't done
any<00:00:23.880> programming<00:00:24.359> before<00:00:24.630> that's<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.080> way<00:00:25.230> to

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
any programming before that's a way to

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.700 
any programming before that's a way to
keep<00:00:25.740> track<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.660> values<00:00:27.660> like<00:00:27.900> integers<00:00:28.230> or

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
keep track of values like integers or

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.769 
keep track of values like integers or
floating-point<00:00:29.160> numbers<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.119> counter<00:00:30.539> like

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
floating-point numbers of a counter like

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.020 
floating-point numbers of a counter like
you<00:00:31.349> might<00:00:31.470> have<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.769> game<00:00:31.949> or<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.910> know

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
you might have in a game or you know

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.330 
you might have in a game or you know
some<00:00:33.630> kind<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.870> mathematical<00:00:34.050> operation<00:00:34.860> that

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
some kind of mathematical operation that

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.700 
some kind of mathematical operation that
you're<00:00:35.550> doing<00:00:35.730> so<00:00:36.270> with<00:00:36.989> my<00:00:37.170> mouse<00:00:37.380> over<00:00:37.680> here

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
you're doing so with my mouse over here

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.880 
you're doing so with my mouse over here
I<00:00:37.860> can<00:00:38.010> press<00:00:38.280> control<00:00:39.059> up<00:00:39.930> arrow<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.469> then

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
I can press control up arrow and then

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.260 
I can press control up arrow and then
you<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.100> see<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.309> full<00:00:41.489> screen<00:00:41.700> then<00:00:41.969> with<00:00:42.059> my

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
you can see it full screen then with my

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.760 
you can see it full screen then with my
wheel<00:00:42.570> mouse<00:00:42.809> I'm<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.170> scroll<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.649> you

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
wheel mouse I'm going to scroll so you

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.920 
wheel mouse I'm going to scroll so you
can<00:00:43.890> see<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> little<00:00:44.219> bit<00:00:44.430> bigger<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.329> just<00:00:45.780> for

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
can see a little bit bigger so just for

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.850 
can see a little bit bigger so just for
starters<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.379> case<00:00:46.530> you're<00:00:46.680> not<00:00:46.800> familiar

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
starters in case you're not familiar

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.630 
starters in case you're not familiar
with<00:00:47.250> game<00:00:48.210> logic<00:00:48.510> I'll<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:50.190> something

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
with game logic I'll just do something

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.630 
with game logic I'll just do something
very<00:00:50.879> basic<00:00:51.120> I'll<00:00:51.480> grab<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> center<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.280> I'll

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
very basic I'll grab a center and I'll

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.400 
very basic I'll grab a center and I'll
get<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> keyboard<00:00:54.120> Center<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.140> going

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
get a keyboard Center and this is going

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.869 
get a keyboard Center and this is going
to<00:00:55.469> sense<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.980> key<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.399> held<00:00:56.550> down<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
to sense the key I just held down the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.720 
to sense the key I just held down the
middle<00:00:57.180> mouse<00:00:57.390> wheel<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.690> move<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.109> over<00:00:58.730> so

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
middle mouse wheel to move that over so

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.310 
middle mouse wheel to move that over so
if<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.969> left<00:01:00.210> click<00:01:00.420> here<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:00.840> press<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.289> a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
if I left click here I can press the a

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.650 
if I left click here I can press the a
key<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:02.250> what<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.579> doing<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.120> center<00:01:03.449> says

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
key so what it's doing the center says

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.469 
key so what it's doing the center says
sense<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> key<00:01:05.100> basically<00:01:05.460> wait<00:01:05.909> until<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
sense the a key basically wait until the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.570 
sense the a key basically wait until the
a<00:01:06.510> key<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.930> pressed<00:01:07.220> alright<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.430> then<00:01:08.549> I

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
a key is pressed alright and then I

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.030 
a key is pressed alright and then I
wanted<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.939> do<00:01:09.150> something<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.869> doing<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.799> is

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
wanted to do something so doing it is

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.070 
wanted to do something so doing it is
actually<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.090> actuator<00:01:12.540> I'm<00:01:12.750> going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.020> do

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
actually is the actuator I'm going to do

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.190 
actually is the actuator I'm going to do
a<00:01:13.110> motion<00:01:13.350> actuator<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:15.450> where's<00:01:15.689> my<00:01:15.869> motion

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
a motion actuator and where's my motion

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.620 
a motion actuator and where's my motion
actuator<00:01:16.560> right<00:01:16.710> there<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.670> I'll<00:01:18.330> connect

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
actuator right there so I'll connect

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.660 
actuator right there so I'll connect
these<00:01:18.750> together<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.280> when<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
these together and this with when the a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
these together and this with when the a
key<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.150> pressed<00:01:21.180> I'm<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.140> say<00:01:22.259> rotate

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
key is pressed I'm going to say rotate

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.310 
key is pressed I'm going to say rotate
it<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> z-axis<00:01:23.369> by<00:01:23.909> 45<00:01:24.390> degrees<00:01:24.420> like

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
it all the z-axis by 45 degrees like

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.530 
it all the z-axis by 45 degrees like
this<00:01:25.350> alright<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.549> I'm<00:01:26.610> going<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.759> do<00:01:26.909> control

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
this alright so I'm going to do control

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.719 
this alright so I'm going to do control
left<00:01:27.960> arrow<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.350> go<00:01:28.560> right<00:01:28.890> back<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.400> this

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
left arrow to go right back to this

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.120 
left arrow to go right back to this
default<00:01:30.600> scene<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.380> I'll<00:01:31.740> start<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
default scene like this I'll start the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.219 
default scene like this I'll start the
game<00:01:32.250> engine<00:01:32.400> with<00:01:32.610> P<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.150> then<00:01:33.780> when<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.930> press

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
game engine with P and then when I press

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.109 
game engine with P and then when I press
a<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:35.400> starts<00:01:35.729> rotating<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.479> 45<00:01:37.110> degree

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
a it starts rotating it on 45 degree

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.690 
a it starts rotating it on 45 degree
increments<00:01:39.500> like<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.740> alright<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.070> control

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
increments like this alright so control

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.120 
increments like this alright so control
right<00:01:41.909> arrow<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.450> then<00:01:43.110> notice<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.860> did<00:01:44.009> it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
right arrow and then notice it did it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.179 
right arrow and then notice it did it
continuously<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.409> instead<00:01:46.409> maybe<00:01:46.740> I'll<00:01:46.920> do

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
continuously so instead maybe I'll do

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.590 
continuously so instead maybe I'll do
this<00:01:47.220> I'll<00:01:47.790> just<00:01:47.970> press<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:49.670> tap<00:01:50.670> key<00:01:51.000> like

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
this I'll just press this tap key like

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.600 
this I'll just press this tap key like
this<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:52.110> here<00:01:52.350> I'll<00:01:52.979> go<00:01:53.100> back<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.579> again

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
this in here I'll go back to it again

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.600 
this in here I'll go back to it again
press<00:01:54.119> P<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.930> then<00:01:55.079> when<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.200> press<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.740> even

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
press P and then when I press a even

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.459 
press P and then when I press a even
though<00:01:56.670> I'm<00:01:56.790> holding<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.240> down<00:01:57.450> now<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.320> only

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
though I'm holding it down now it only

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.090 
though I'm holding it down now it only
does<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:59.780> each<00:02:00.780> time<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.649> press<00:02:01.950> it

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
does it each time that I press it

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.709 
does it each time that I press it
instead<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.369> doing<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.759> continuously<00:02:03.299> all

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
instead of doing it continuously all

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.370 
instead of doing it continuously all
right<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:05.240> I'll<00:02:06.240> just<00:02:06.509> leave<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.899> for<00:02:07.259> now

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
right so I'll just leave that for now

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.109 
right so I'll just leave that for now
but<00:02:07.799> now<00:02:07.950> what<00:02:08.099> we<00:02:08.190> really<00:02:08.459> want<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.670> focus<00:02:08.789> on

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
but now what we really want to focus on

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.600 
but now what we really want to focus on
it<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.330> these<00:02:09.599> properties<00:02:10.170> or<00:02:10.410> variables<00:02:11.129> so

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
it is these properties or variables so

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.010 
it is these properties or variables so
maybe<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:11.910> don't<00:02:12.000> want<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.420> happen<00:02:12.599> right

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
maybe I don't want it to happen right

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.370 
maybe I don't want it to happen right
away

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
away

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.640 
away
maybe<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.420> wanted<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.480> happen<00:02:15.810> only<00:02:16.140> after<00:02:16.530> you

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
maybe I wanted to happen only after you

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.930 
maybe I wanted to happen only after you
press<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.910> key<00:02:18.230> ten<00:02:19.230> times<00:02:19.560> alright<00:02:20.280> so

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
press the a key ten times alright so

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.360 
press the a key ten times alright so
let's<00:02:21.300> go<00:02:21.450> full<00:02:21.930> screen<00:02:22.200> into<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.770> game<00:02:22.920> logic

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
let's go full screen into the game logic

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.840 
let's go full screen into the game logic
control<00:02:23.670> up<00:02:23.820> arrow<00:02:23.940> again<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:25.670> instead<00:02:26.670> of

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
control up arrow again and instead of

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.420 
control up arrow again and instead of
connecting<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.110> keyboard<00:02:28.350> directly<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.340> the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
connecting the keyboard directly to the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.160 
connecting the keyboard directly to the
motion<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.880> can<00:02:29.940> hold<00:02:30.270> down<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.510> control<00:02:30.930> key

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
motion I can hold down the control key

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.490 
motion I can hold down the control key
and<00:02:31.410> then<00:02:31.920> with<00:02:32.220> left<00:02:32.490> mouse<00:02:32.700> button<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:33.270> can

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
and then with left mouse button that can

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.960 
and then with left mouse button that can
just<00:02:34.500> cross<00:02:34.830> over<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.850> will

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
just cross over that and that will

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.810 
just cross over that and that will
remove<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.830> connection<00:02:37.830> like<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.790> I

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
remove that connection like that so I

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.580 
remove that connection like that so I
don't<00:02:39.000> want<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.570> want<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.080> keyboard

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
don't want to I want the keyboard

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.350 
don't want to I want the keyboard
instead<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:41.010> controlling<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.700> motion<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.180> want

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
instead of controlling the motion I want

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.840 
instead of controlling the motion I want
the<00:02:42.420> keyboard<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.110> increase<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.280> value<00:02:44.670> of

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
the keyboard to increase the value of

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.050 
the keyboard to increase the value of
one<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.630> these<00:02:45.720> variables<00:02:46.560> or<00:02:46.800> properties<00:02:47.550> so

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
one of these variables or properties so

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.760 
one of these variables or properties so
the<00:02:48.150> way<00:02:48.240> we<00:02:48.390> do<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.630> we<00:02:48.720> have<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.960> give<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.740> a

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
the way we do it we have to give it a

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.550 
the way we do it we have to give it a
property<00:02:50.250> associated<00:02:51.000> with<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.600> cube<00:02:52.110> that

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
property associated with that cube that

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.120 
property associated with that cube that
object<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.250> scene<00:02:53.460> and<00:02:53.960> right<00:02:54.960> in<00:02:55.080> here<00:02:55.320> it

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
object in the scene and right in here it

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.280 
object in the scene and right in here it
comes<00:02:56.550> up<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.000> has<00:02:57.210> this<00:02:57.510> C<00:02:57.810> float

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
comes up and it has this C float

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.260 
comes up and it has this C float
floating<00:02:58.860> point<00:02:59.100> property<00:02:59.580> but<00:03:00.030> I'm<00:03:00.120> going<00:03:00.240> to

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
floating point property but I'm going to

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.150 
floating point property but I'm going to
change<00:03:00.420> this<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.750> an<00:03:01.110> integer<00:03:01.470> because<00:03:01.920> I've

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
change this to an integer because I've

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.830 
change this to an integer because I've
just<00:03:02.220> one<00:03:02.490> simple<00:03:02.940> number<00:03:03.300> counting<00:03:03.720> the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
just one simple number counting the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.930 
just one simple number counting the
whole<00:03:04.170> numbers<00:03:04.590> no<00:03:04.920> floating<00:03:05.550> point

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
whole numbers no floating point

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.760 
whole numbers no floating point
representations<00:03:06.780> all<00:03:07.020> right<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.530> saves

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
representations all right that saves

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.500 
representations all right that saves
computer<00:03:08.250> memory<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.550> little<00:03:08.640> bit<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.030> this<00:03:09.360> is

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
computer memory a little bit and this is

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.150 
computer memory a little bit and this is
the<00:03:09.570> name<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.530> I'm<00:03:10.590> going<00:03:10.710> to<00:03:10.770> come<00:03:10.890> in<00:03:11.010> here

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
the name so I'm going to come in here

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.310 
the name so I'm going to come in here
and<00:03:11.400> just<00:03:11.580> type<00:03:12.000> counter<00:03:12.510> that'll<00:03:13.110> be<00:03:13.200> the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
and just type counter that'll be the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.100 
and just type counter that'll be the
name<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.590> our<00:03:13.680> property<00:03:14.220> in<00:03:15.210> order<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.870> take

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
name of our property in order to take

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.470 
name of our property in order to take
advantage<00:03:16.290> of<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.740> property<00:03:17.270> we<00:03:18.270> need<00:03:18.390> to

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
advantage of the property we need to

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.390 
advantage of the property we need to
have<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.630> sensor<00:03:19.080> property<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:20.040> we<00:03:20.190> need<00:03:20.340> to

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
have a sensor property and we need to

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.000 
have a sensor property and we need to
have<00:03:20.520> an<00:03:20.640> actuator<00:03:20.970> property<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:22.740> I'll

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
have an actuator property and so I'll

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.910 
have an actuator property and so I'll
add<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.280> property<00:03:24.000> here<00:03:24.210> sensor<00:03:25.200> property<00:03:25.680> and

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
add a property here sensor property and

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.670 
add a property here sensor property and
I'll<00:03:26.130> add<00:03:26.280> an<00:03:26.400> actuated<00:03:26.850> property<00:03:27.440> like<00:03:28.440> this

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
I'll add an actuated property like this

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.030 
I'll add an actuated property like this
in<00:03:28.950> this<00:03:29.610> case<00:03:29.970> I'm<00:03:30.870> going<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.170> move<00:03:31.380> this<00:03:31.740> up

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
in this case I'm going to move this up

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.330 
in this case I'm going to move this up
in<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.030> stack<00:03:33.330> a<00:03:34.730> little<00:03:35.730> bit<00:03:35.850> so<00:03:36.590> well<00:03:37.590> with

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
in the stack a little bit so well with

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.520 
in the stack a little bit so well with
that<00:03:38.460> map<00:03:38.640> we<00:03:38.760> just<00:03:39.000> cross<00:03:39.210> it<00:03:39.240> over<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:39.780> let's

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
that map we just cross it over so let's

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.000 
that map we just cross it over so let's
so<00:03:41.010> when<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:41.910> keyboard<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.570> pressed<00:03:42.960> I<00:03:43.290> want

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
so when the keyboard is pressed I want

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.110 
so when the keyboard is pressed I want
to<00:03:44.100> actually<00:03:45.650> do<00:03:46.650> something<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.610> property

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
to actually do something to the property

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.260 
to actually do something to the property
all<00:03:48.990> right<00:03:49.200> so<00:03:49.890> let's<00:03:50.100> see<00:03:50.220> what<00:03:50.370> happens<00:03:50.730> in

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
all right so let's see what happens in

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.470 
all right so let's see what happens in
this<00:03:51.960> case<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:53.040> value<00:03:53.580> of<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.820> property<00:03:54.090> when

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
this case the value of the property when

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.260 
this case the value of the property when
you<00:03:54.510> first<00:03:54.810> start<00:03:55.110> is<00:03:55.380> equal<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:55.980> zero<00:03:56.340> all

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
you first start is equal to zero all

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.120 
you first start is equal to zero all
right<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.600> then<00:03:58.020> when<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.590> keyboard<00:03:59.040> is

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
right and then when the keyboard is

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.130 
right and then when the keyboard is
pressed<00:03:59.490> I<00:03:59.670> wanted<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.090> do<00:04:00.330> something<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.990> it

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
pressed I wanted to do something to it

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.470 
pressed I wanted to do something to it
and<00:04:01.260> so<00:04:01.890> I<00:04:01.920> wanted<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.730> I'm<00:04:03.030> going<00:04:03.210> to<00:04:03.270> change

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
and so I wanted to I'm going to change

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.550 
and so I wanted to I'm going to change
this<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.900> add<00:04:04.080> and<00:04:04.940> I<00:04:05.940> have<00:04:06.270> to<00:04:06.420> since<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.440> name

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
this to add and I have to since the name

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.870 
this to add and I have to since the name
is<00:04:07.710> counter<00:04:08.070> I'm<00:04:08.160> going<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.370> pick<00:04:08.520> counter

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
is counter I'm going to pick counter

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.270 
is counter I'm going to pick counter
from<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.120> list<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.680> what<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:10.740> wanted<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.160> add

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
from the list and what I wanted to add

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.320 
from the list and what I wanted to add
is<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:12.210> number<00:04:12.870> one<00:04:13.490> alright<00:04:14.490> so<00:04:14.700> what

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
is the number one alright so what

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.660 
is the number one alright so what
happens<00:04:15.630> is<00:04:15.780> anytime<00:04:16.350> you<00:04:16.530> press<00:04:16.950> this<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:17.340> key

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
happens is anytime you press this a key

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.920 
happens is anytime you press this a key
on<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:17.910> keyboard<00:04:18.120> it's<00:04:18.540> going<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:18.720> come

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
on the keyboard it's going to come

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.650 
on the keyboard it's going to come
through<00:04:19.140> and<00:04:19.500> it's<00:04:20.100> going<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.310> add<00:04:20.489> 1<00:04:20.910> to<00:04:21.270> the

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
through and it's going to add 1 to the

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.840 
through and it's going to add 1 to the
value<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:22.169> our<00:04:22.500> property<00:04:23.010> called<00:04:23.250> counter<00:04:23.669> and

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
value of our property called counter and

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.330 
value of our property called counter and
it's<00:04:24.330> going<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.510> make<00:04:24.660> it<00:04:24.840> equal<00:04:25.260> to<00:04:25.350> 1<00:04:25.530> then

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
it's going to make it equal to 1 then

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.230 
it's going to make it equal to 1 then
the<00:04:26.430> next<00:04:26.640> time<00:04:26.729> it's<00:04:26.970> going<00:04:27.060> to

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
the next time it's going to

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.059 
the next time it's going to
one<00:04:27.569> is<00:04:27.810> going<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.020> make<00:04:28.110> it<00:04:28.259> equal<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.530> two<00:04:28.770> and

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:29.069 
one is going to make it equal to two and

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:30.350 
one is going to make it equal to two and
it's<00:04:29.520> just<00:04:29.639> going<00:04:29.759> to<00:04:29.819> keep<00:04:29.940> doing<00:04:30.210> that<00:04:30.300> every

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
it's just going to keep doing that every

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.730 
it's just going to keep doing that every
time<00:04:30.539> you<00:04:30.750> press<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.080> a<00:04:31.110> it's<00:04:31.380> going<00:04:31.530> to<00:04:31.590> add

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
time you press the a it's going to add

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.180 
time you press the a it's going to add
one<00:04:32.069> to<00:04:32.310> it<00:04:32.340> so<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.360> value<00:04:33.630> changes<00:04:34.139> so<00:04:34.710> then

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
one to it so the value changes so then

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.120 
one to it so the value changes so then
while<00:04:36.060> it's<00:04:36.300> changing<00:04:36.870> over<00:04:37.620> here<00:04:37.919> what<00:04:38.099> I

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
while it's changing over here what I

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.879 
while it's changing over here what I
want<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.370> do<00:04:38.550> is<00:04:38.789> I<00:04:39.240> want<00:04:39.449> to<00:04:39.509> evaluate<00:04:39.930> what's

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
want to do is I want to evaluate what's

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:42.770 
want to do is I want to evaluate what's
happening<00:04:41.340> I'm<00:04:41.460> sensing<00:04:42.000> what's<00:04:42.270> happening

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
happening I'm sensing what's happening

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.360 
happening I'm sensing what's happening
to<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.020> property<00:04:43.500> as<00:04:43.620> it<00:04:43.740> goes<00:04:43.889> along<00:04:44.130> so<00:04:44.160> I

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
to the property as it goes along so I

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.860 
to the property as it goes along so I
also<00:04:44.520> have<00:04:44.819> to<00:04:44.970> pick<00:04:45.690> counter<00:04:46.259> from<00:04:46.530> here<00:04:46.830> and

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
also have to pick counter from here and

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.559 
also have to pick counter from here and
I'm<00:04:48.870> going<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.020> put<00:04:49.199> in<00:04:49.349> the<00:04:49.410> number<00:04:49.620> ten<00:04:49.860> and

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:50.569 
I'm going to put in the number ten and

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:53.420 
I'm going to put in the number ten and
by<00:04:51.569> default<00:04:51.900> here's<00:04:52.289> how<00:04:52.560> I'm<00:04:52.680> evaluating<00:04:53.039> it

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
by default here's how I'm evaluating it

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.150 
by default here's how I'm evaluating it
you<00:04:53.759> can<00:04:53.910> evaluate<00:04:54.810> whether<00:04:55.319> it's<00:04:55.590> equal<00:04:56.039> to

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
you can evaluate whether it's equal to

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.430 
you can evaluate whether it's equal to
ten<00:04:56.370> not<00:04:56.639> equal<00:04:56.940> to<00:04:57.090> ten<00:04:57.270> etc<00:04:57.720> so<00:04:58.110> we'll<00:04:58.259> just

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
ten not equal to ten etc so we'll just

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.080 
ten not equal to ten etc so we'll just
leave<00:04:58.590> it<00:04:58.650> the<00:04:58.860> default<00:04:59.160> is<00:04:59.400> equal<00:04:59.759> so<00:04:59.940> this

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
leave it the default is equal so this

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.990 
leave it the default is equal so this
says<00:05:00.330> this<00:05:01.320> Center<00:05:01.710> is<00:05:01.860> saying<00:05:02.070> well<00:05:02.580> if<00:05:02.759> the

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
says this Center is saying well if the

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.180 
says this Center is saying well if the
value<00:05:03.360> of<00:05:03.509> the<00:05:03.690> counter<00:05:04.169> this<00:05:04.710> property

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
value of the counter this property

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.580 
value of the counter this property
called<00:05:05.370> counter<00:05:05.910> is<00:05:06.090> equal<00:05:06.389> to<00:05:06.840> ten<00:05:07.080> then<00:05:09.590> I'm

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
called counter is equal to ten then I'm

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.379 
called counter is equal to ten then I'm
going<00:05:10.800> to<00:05:10.830> rotate<00:05:10.979> it<00:05:11.160> 45<00:05:11.400> degrees<00:05:11.910> all<00:05:12.270> right

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
going to rotate it 45 degrees all right

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.879 
going to rotate it 45 degrees all right
so<00:05:12.539> now<00:05:12.660> this<00:05:12.780> is<00:05:12.840> connected<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.410> that<00:05:13.590> but

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
so now this is connected to that but

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.279 
so now this is connected to that but
it's<00:05:14.039> not<00:05:14.400> equal<00:05:14.820> to<00:05:14.970> ten<00:05:15.210> it<00:05:15.449> simply<00:05:16.139> won't

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
it's not equal to ten it simply won't

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:18.710 
it's not equal to ten it simply won't
rotate<00:05:16.560> it<00:05:16.919> 45<00:05:17.460> degrees<00:05:17.699> so<00:05:18.419> let's<00:05:18.599> go<00:05:18.690> back

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
rotate it 45 degrees so let's go back

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.909 
rotate it 45 degrees so let's go back
I'll<00:05:19.560> press<00:05:19.800> P<00:05:20.039> I'll<00:05:20.880> press<00:05:21.180> a<00:05:21.360> once<00:05:21.659> so<00:05:22.620> that's

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
I'll press P I'll press a once so that's

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.029 
I'll press P I'll press a once so that's
nothing<00:05:23.190> twice<00:05:23.970> three<00:05:24.630> four<00:05:24.659> five<00:05:25.289> six<00:05:25.680> seven

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
nothing twice three four five six seven

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.870 
nothing twice three four five six seven
eight<00:05:26.400> nine<00:05:26.819> ten<00:05:27.330> and<00:05:27.599> it<00:05:28.169> starts<00:05:28.470> rotating

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
eight nine ten and it starts rotating

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.649 
eight nine ten and it starts rotating
like<00:05:29.880> that<00:05:30.120> all<00:05:30.419> right

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:30.659 
like that all right

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:32.390 
like that all right
so<00:05:31.050> only<00:05:31.199> when<00:05:31.349> it<00:05:31.470> gets<00:05:31.590> to<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:31.800> value<00:05:32.070> of<00:05:32.159> ten

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
so only when it gets to the value of ten

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.320 
so only when it gets to the value of ten
and<00:05:32.669> so<00:05:33.570> then<00:05:33.780> in<00:05:34.020> this<00:05:34.380> case<00:05:34.620> in<00:05:35.400> the<00:05:35.639> first

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.120 

example<00:05:39.330> I<00:05:39.419> put<00:05:39.870> the<00:05:39.990> tap<00:05:40.199> so<00:05:40.229> the<00:05:40.620> keyboard

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
example I put the tap so the keyboard

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.469 
example I put the tap so the keyboard
won't<00:05:41.520> read<00:05:41.699> it<00:05:41.729> because<00:05:41.909> if<00:05:42.060> I<00:05:42.150> didn't<00:05:42.330> have

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
won't read it because if I didn't have

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.110 
won't read it because if I didn't have
tap<00:05:42.840> what<00:05:43.650> would<00:05:43.770> happen<00:05:44.130> is<00:05:44.280> well<00:05:44.969> let<00:05:45.090> me

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
tap what would happen is well let me

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.820 
tap what would happen is well let me
just<00:05:45.270> show<00:05:45.419> you<00:05:45.449> I'll<00:05:45.630> take<00:05:45.810> tap<00:05:46.110> off<00:05:46.380> and<00:05:46.710> I'll

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
just show you I'll take tap off and I'll

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.040 
just show you I'll take tap off and I'll
go<00:05:46.949> back<00:05:47.099> here<00:05:47.520> let's<00:05:48.330> start<00:05:48.479> the<00:05:48.690> game<00:05:48.719> and<00:05:48.990> if

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
go back here let's start the game and if

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:55.459 
go back here let's start the game and if
I<00:05:49.110> press<00:05:49.409> a<00:05:49.590> once<00:05:53.419> doesn't<00:05:54.419> quite<00:05:54.780> do<00:05:55.050> quite

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:55.469 
I press a once doesn't quite do quite

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:56.420 
I press a once doesn't quite do quite
what<00:05:55.919> I<00:05:55.949> want

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
what I want

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.459 
what I want
so<00:05:56.610> let's<00:05:56.969> come<00:05:57.150> back<00:05:57.300> in<00:05:57.570> here<00:05:57.719> so<00:05:58.229> I<00:05:58.259> leave

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469 
so let's come back in here so I leave

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:00.649 
so let's come back in here so I leave
the<00:05:58.590> tap<00:05:58.800> on<00:05:58.979> the<00:05:59.099> keyboard<00:05:59.490> sensor<00:05:59.909> and<00:06:00.150> I'm

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659 
the tap on the keyboard sensor and I'm

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:03.409 
the tap on the keyboard sensor and I'm
also<00:06:00.810> going<00:06:00.990> to<00:06:01.050> put<00:06:01.229> a<00:06:01.259> tap<00:06:01.500> on<00:06:01.940> here<00:06:02.940> as<00:06:03.120> well

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
also going to put a tap on here as well

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:05.899 
also going to put a tap on here as well
so<00:06:03.990> that<00:06:04.139> means<00:06:04.409> that<00:06:04.740> when<00:06:05.009> it<00:06:05.130> reaches<00:06:05.580> ten

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:05.909 
so that means that when it reaches ten

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:08.089 
so that means that when it reaches ten
it's<00:06:06.240> only<00:06:06.960> going<00:06:07.169> to<00:06:07.259> rotate<00:06:07.500> it<00:06:07.740> once

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
it's only going to rotate it once

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.060 
it's only going to rotate it once
instead<00:06:08.789> of<00:06:08.909> continually<00:06:09.949> rotating<00:06:10.949> it<00:06:11.039> so

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
instead of continually rotating it so

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.010 
instead of continually rotating it so
I'm<00:06:11.280> going<00:06:11.370> to<00:06:11.460> press<00:06:11.610> P<00:06:11.880> and<00:06:12.180> then<00:06:12.539> one<00:06:12.780> two

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
I'm going to press P and then one two

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.890 
I'm going to press P and then one two
three<00:06:13.380> four<00:06:13.680> five<00:06:13.979> six<00:06:14.280> seven<00:06:14.639> eight<00:06:15.030> nine<00:06:15.330> ten

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
three four five six seven eight nine ten

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.640 
three four five six seven eight nine ten
and<00:06:16.139> there<00:06:16.620> does<00:06:16.889> and<00:06:17.669> it<00:06:17.820> rotates<00:06:18.210> it<00:06:18.440> to<00:06:19.440> ten

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
and there does and it rotates it to ten

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.399 
and there does and it rotates it to ten
and<00:06:19.889> then<00:06:20.580> that's<00:06:21.330> where<00:06:21.570> it<00:06:21.659> is<00:06:21.780> so<00:06:22.020> it's<00:06:22.199> just

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:22.409 
and then that's where it is so it's just

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:23.959 
and then that's where it is so it's just
always<00:06:22.650> going<00:06:22.979> to<00:06:23.039> it's<00:06:23.370> just<00:06:23.550> going<00:06:23.669> to<00:06:23.759> stay

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:23.969 
always going to it's just going to stay

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:25.760 
always going to it's just going to stay
there<00:06:24.000> because<00:06:24.659> I<00:06:24.719> put<00:06:24.930> the<00:06:25.020> tap<00:06:25.199> sensor<00:06:25.620> other

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
there because I put the tap sensor other

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.409 
there because I put the tap sensor other
hole<00:06:26.280> in<00:06:26.400> it<00:06:26.490> because<00:06:26.789> without<00:06:26.940> the<00:06:27.180> taps

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
hole in it because without the taps

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.719 
hole in it because without the taps
without<00:06:28.289> the<00:06:28.440> tap<00:06:28.650> sensor<00:06:29.039> what<00:06:29.190> happens<00:06:29.550> is

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729 
without the tap sensor what happens is

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.050 
without the tap sensor what happens is
it<00:06:30.889> since<00:06:31.889> this<00:06:32.099> says<00:06:32.310> it's<00:06:32.490> equal<00:06:32.759> to<00:06:32.789> ten

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
it since this says it's equal to ten

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.180 
it since this says it's equal to ten
it's<00:06:33.240> constantly<00:06:33.810> equal<00:06:34.080> to<00:06:34.229> ten<00:06:34.469> in<00:06:34.949> fact<00:06:35.099> if

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
it's constantly equal to ten in fact if

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.089 
it's constantly equal to ten in fact if
I<00:06:35.279> turn<00:06:35.490> it<00:06:35.639> off<00:06:35.729> and<00:06:35.880> do<00:06:35.969> it<00:06:36.000> again<00:06:36.919> two<00:06:37.919> three

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:38.099 
I turn it off and do it again two three

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:40.159 
I turn it off and do it again two three
four<00:06:38.279> five<00:06:38.520> six<00:06:38.729> seven<00:06:39.060> eight<00:06:39.150> nine<00:06:39.419> ten<00:06:39.900> and

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169 
four five six seven eight nine ten and

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:41.480 
four five six seven eight nine ten and
then<00:06:40.860> if<00:06:41.279> I

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
then if I

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.100 
then if I
press<00:06:41.699> a<00:06:41.849> again<00:06:42.150> it's<00:06:42.330> going<00:06:42.419> to<00:06:42.509> become<00:06:42.630> 11:00

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
press a again it's going to become 11:00

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.990 
press a again it's going to become 11:00
and<00:06:43.289> it's<00:06:44.039> going<00:06:44.160> to<00:06:44.250> stop<00:06:44.460> because<00:06:44.910> I'm

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
and it's going to stop because I'm

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.610 
and it's going to stop because I'm
evaluating<00:06:45.360> whether<00:06:45.750> it's<00:06:45.960> equal<00:06:46.199> to<00:06:46.319> 10<00:06:46.470> or

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
evaluating whether it's equal to 10 or

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.589 
evaluating whether it's equal to 10 or
not<00:06:46.740> so<00:06:47.699> that<00:06:47.849> should<00:06:48.000> help<00:06:48.030> you<00:06:48.210> get<00:06:48.300> started

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:48.599 
not so that should help you get started

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:50.779 
not so that should help you get started
these<00:06:49.169> are<00:06:49.349> really<00:06:49.620> powerful<00:06:49.800> tools<00:06:50.310> and<00:06:50.699> if

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:50.789 
these are really powerful tools and if

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:52.790 
these are really powerful tools and if
you're<00:06:50.880> not<00:06:51.030> programming<00:06:51.569> yet<00:06:51.840> then<00:06:52.110> this<00:06:52.650> is

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
you're not programming yet then this is

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.659 
you're not programming yet then this is
a<00:06:52.830> great<00:06:52.949> way<00:06:53.130> to<00:06:53.160> get<00:06:53.310> started<00:06:53.460> because

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:53.669 
a great way to get started because

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:54.950 
a great way to get started because
that's<00:06:53.880> a<00:06:53.940> lot<00:06:54.090> of<00:06:54.120> what<00:06:54.240> programming<00:06:54.630> is<00:06:54.810> all

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
that's a lot of what programming is all

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.540 
that's a lot of what programming is all
about<00:06:55.199> you<00:06:55.349> just<00:06:55.590> testing<00:06:55.979> conditions<00:06:56.250> if

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
about you just testing conditions if

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.400 
about you just testing conditions if
this<00:06:56.759> is<00:06:56.880> equal<00:06:57.150> to<00:06:57.300> that<00:06:57.539> greater<00:06:57.990> than<00:06:58.080> that

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410 
this is equal to that greater than that

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.129 
this is equal to that greater than that
less<00:06:58.830> than<00:06:59.009> or<00:06:59.099> equal<00:06:59.130> to<00:06:59.699> this<00:06:59.880> then<00:07:00.870> do

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:01.139 
less than or equal to this then do

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:04.219 
less than or equal to this then do
something<00:07:01.410> right<00:07:02.190> when<00:07:03.060> so<00:07:03.750> it's<00:07:03.780> pretty<00:07:04.050> much
