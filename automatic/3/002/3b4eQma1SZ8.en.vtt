00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.200
 My Emperor, I must remind you that it is November 20th. 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.000
 Yeah so? 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.600
 November 20 is the day we try to get the young Skywalker to the Dark Side. 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.600
 Oh yes, that's true, bring him here 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.300
 Guards, leave us alone. 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:05.000
 So Skywalker, you know why you are here. 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:15.000
 This is the first time in a year that I am taking you out of jail, you must hate me. 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:27.000
 But you can get rid of me by using this. Go ahead, get it and knock us down. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 So Skywalker, now you know the power of the Dark Side. 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:02:00.000
 Participate, and you will become the most powerful Sith in the universe! 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.000
 I don't walk over to the Dark Side, NEVER! 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.500
 So be it. Jedi. 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.000
 Are you not going too far? 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.400
 I've had enough of it! 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 Ooh! Aah! Oh! 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.000
 Hum, maybe I went a bit too far ... ahum .... 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.500
 Get up, my young student ..... 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.500
 Phooo! Pfieuw! It was just a bad dream ...........
