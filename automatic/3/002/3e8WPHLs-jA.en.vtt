00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
criminal ambitions mass which was the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.120 
criminal ambitions mass which was the

last of the four released with the
poetry<00:00:23.699> Jam<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.180> did<00:00:24.390> have<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:25.310> customize<00:00:26.310> it

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
poetry Jam I did have to customize it

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.470 
poetry Jam I did have to customize it
however<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.720> TC<00:00:28.080> n<00:00:28.199> mass<00:00:28.439> and

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
however this is the TC n mass and

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.450 
however this is the TC n mass and
problem<00:00:30.480> with<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.289> looks<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.920> damn<00:00:32.160> good

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
problem with it is it looks so damn good

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.030 
problem with it is it looks so damn good
without<00:00:32.880> any<00:00:33.059> customization<00:00:33.890> customizing<00:00:34.890> is

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
without any customization customizing is

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.530 
without any customization customizing is
something<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> be<00:00:35.640> very<00:00:35.880> tentative

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
something you have to be very tentative

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.590 
something you have to be very tentative
with<00:00:37.250> so<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.430> way<00:00:38.550> I've<00:00:38.700> chosen<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.210> do<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.480> is

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
with so the way I've chosen to do it is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.530 
with so the way I've chosen to do it is
as<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:39.989> see<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.440> screen<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.540> delicate

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
as you can see on screen the delicate

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.000 
as you can see on screen the delicate
red<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.930> gemstone<00:00:43.559> material<00:00:44.629> the<00:00:46.010> pattern

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
red of the gemstone material the pattern

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.799 
red of the gemstone material the pattern
of<00:00:47.129> choice<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.489> actually<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.850> hexagon<00:00:48.300> circle

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
of choice is actually the hexagon circle

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.590 
of choice is actually the hexagon circle
it's<00:00:49.320> required<00:00:50.100> for<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.640> because<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
it's required for this because it's the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.180 
it's required for this because it's the
only<00:00:51.780> way<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.170> make<00:00:52.500> some<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.920> original

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
only way to make some of the original

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.790 
only way to make some of the original
color<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.239> pattern<00:00:54.719> truly<00:00:55.079> shine<00:00:55.379> through

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
color and pattern truly shine through

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.189 
color and pattern truly shine through
and<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.520> generally<00:00:57.059> wanted<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.570> whitish

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
and then I generally wanted a whitish

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.349 
and then I generally wanted a whitish
color<00:00:59.480> where<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.840> skeleton<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:02.280> just<00:01:03.090> feel

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
color where the skeleton is I just feel

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.179 
color where the skeleton is I just feel
that<00:01:03.420> pale<00:01:03.899> white<00:01:04.140> was<00:01:04.379> most<00:01:04.559> suited<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
that pale white was most suited to the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.240 
that pale white was most suited to the
mask<00:01:05.580> itself<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.450> finally<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> color<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.740> red

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
mask itself so finally the color is red

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.880 
mask itself so finally the color is red
and<00:01:08.549> white<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.540> try<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.080> keep<00:01:10.170> as<00:01:10.409> close<00:01:10.619> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
and white to try and keep as close to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.340 
and white to try and keep as close to
the<00:01:10.979> original<00:01:11.070> color<00:01:11.580> ideas<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.420> get<00:01:13.200> that

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the original color ideas and get that

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.850 
the original color ideas and get that
White's<00:01:13.650> core<00:01:14.090> skeleton<00:01:15.380> as<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.560> possibly

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
White's core skeleton as I possibly

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.840 
White's core skeleton as I possibly
could<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:18.740> this<00:01:19.740> mask<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.520> say<00:01:20.700> when

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
could so this mask is like I say when

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.399 
could so this mask is like I say when
you<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.119> be<00:01:21.210> careful<00:01:21.630> with<00:01:21.780> assuming<00:01:22.290> you

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
you have to be careful with assuming you

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.969 
you have to be careful with assuming you
do<00:01:22.530> enjoy<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.070> original<00:01:23.520> plan<00:01:24.619> design<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.830> it

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
do enjoy the original plan design on it

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.230 
do enjoy the original plan design on it
I<00:01:26.100> think<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.759> looks<00:01:26.909> great

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
I think it looks great

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.840 
I think it looks great
and<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.140> may<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.380> inclined<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.280> customize

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
and I may be inclined to not customize

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.249 
and I may be inclined to not customize
it<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.240> course<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.570> did<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.900> do<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> mask

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
it of course I did have to do a mask

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.840 
it of course I did have to do a mask
though<00:01:31.409> today<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.860> don't<00:01:32.250> really<00:01:32.549> know<00:01:32.700> how<00:01:32.790> to

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
though today I don't really know how to

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.200 
though today I don't really know how to
mask<00:01:33.119> lured<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.840> without<00:01:34.549> any<00:01:35.549> mask<00:01:35.850> design

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
mask lured a is without any mask design

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.140 
mask lured a is without any mask design
for<00:01:36.450> anything<00:01:36.659> as<00:01:36.750> much<00:01:36.869> point<00:01:37.140> then<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:38.150> this

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
for anything as much point then so this

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.510 
for anything as much point then so this
is<00:01:39.270> my<00:01:39.420> idea<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.470> guys<00:01:40.619> might<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.310> better

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
is my idea you guys might have a better

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.289 
is my idea you guys might have a better
way<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.909> maintain<00:01:42.479> some<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.869> its<00:01:44.060> natural<00:01:45.060> look

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
way to maintain some of its natural look

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.800 
way to maintain some of its natural look
but<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.590> not<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.950> for<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.189> video<00:01:47.630> as<00:01:48.630> I
