this video with my gopro hero it's my

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.810 
this video with my gopro hero it's my
best<00:00:24.449> quality<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.350> video<00:00:25.500> camera<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.519> i<00:00:26.640> have

best quality of video camera that i have

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.429 
best quality of video camera that i have
so<00:00:27.029> i<00:00:27.090> thought<00:00:27.240> i'd<00:00:27.390> try<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.660> out<00:00:27.779> not<00:00:28.230> sure<00:00:28.380> if

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
so i thought i'd try it out not sure if

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.870 
so i thought i'd try it out not sure if
it's<00:00:28.500> fish<00:00:28.740> i<00:00:28.890> only<00:00:29.279> when<00:00:29.400> it's<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> case

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
it's fish i only when it's in the case

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.269 
it's fish i only when it's in the case
but<00:00:30.090> right<00:00:30.210> now<00:00:30.330> it's<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.750> case<00:00:30.980> so<00:00:31.980> i

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
but right now it's not in the case so i

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.180 
but right now it's not in the case so i
guess<00:00:32.730> we'll<00:00:32.910> see<00:00:33.770> so<00:00:34.770> these<00:00:34.890> are<00:00:34.950> my<00:00:35.100> new

in<00:00:41.899> 1969<00:00:43.010> yamaha<00:00:44.010> as1<00:00:44.940> um<00:00:45.780> i<00:00:46.680> looked<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.670> up<00:00:47.789> i

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
in 1969 yamaha as1 um i looked it up i

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.279 
in 1969 yamaha as1 um i looked it up i
saw<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.079> 90<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.829> mean<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> 69<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.809> 70

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
saw that the 90 I mean the 69 and the 70

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.920 
saw that the 90 I mean the 69 and the 70
and<00:00:52.530> up<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.399> exhaust<00:00:53.910> pipes<00:00:54.239> went<00:00:54.480> up<00:00:54.660> over

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
and up the exhaust pipes went up over

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.520 
and up the exhaust pipes went up over
the<00:00:55.520> engine<00:00:56.520> they<00:00:56.820> didn't<00:00:57.030> go<00:00:57.120> underneath<00:00:57.530> so

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the engine they didn't go underneath so

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.939 
the engine they didn't go underneath so
I<00:00:58.859> think<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.670> might<00:00:59.910> be<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.059> 68<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.020> there's

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
I think this might be a 68 and there's

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.670 
I think this might be a 68 and there's
also<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:03.180> model<00:01:03.539> which<00:01:04.110> I'm<00:01:04.290> not<00:01:04.409> sure

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
also the the model which I'm not sure

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.539

because<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:05.040> looked<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.510> a<00:01:06.890> s1<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.189> found<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549

exhaust<00:02:01.110> pipes<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:03.119> side<00:02:03.360> cover

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
exhaust pipes and the the side cover

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.540 
exhaust pipes and the the side cover
over<00:02:03.899> here<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.200> different<00:02:06.259> but<00:02:07.259> yeah<00:02:07.520> before<00:02:08.520> I

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
over here is different but yeah before I

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.550 
over here is different but yeah before I
go<00:02:08.910> closely<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.450> bike<00:02:09.780> I'd<00:02:09.959> like<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.289> show

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
go closely on that bike I'd like to show

you guys what I see what I found on this
yesterday<00:02:14.010> when<00:02:14.099> I<00:02:14.160> got<00:02:14.340> home<00:02:14.629> so<00:02:15.629> apparently

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
yesterday when I got home so apparently

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.140 
yesterday when I got home so apparently
they<00:02:16.379> didn't<00:02:16.620> have<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.739> shifter<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.340> they

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
they didn't have a shifter and they

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.309 
they didn't have a shifter and they
welded<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.910> square<00:02:20.910> piece<00:02:21.239> of<00:02:21.390> metal<00:02:21.629> to<00:02:22.290> the

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
welded a square piece of metal to the

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.949 
welded a square piece of metal to the
shifter<00:02:22.800> now<00:02:23.730> if<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.150> look<00:02:24.269> at<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.420> weld<00:02:24.690> it

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
shifter now if you look at the weld it

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.020 
shifter now if you look at the weld it
is<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.349> worst<00:02:25.680> well<00:02:25.950> I've<00:02:26.129> ever<00:02:26.280> seen<00:02:26.550> it's

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
is the worst well I've ever seen it's

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.880 
is the worst well I've ever seen it's
like<00:02:27.180> if<00:02:27.300> they<00:02:27.420> just<00:02:27.599> poured<00:02:27.930> some<00:02:28.200> lava<00:02:28.440> on<00:02:28.680> it

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
like if they just poured some lava on it

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.509 
like if they just poured some lava on it
and<00:02:29.519> it<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:29.819> kind<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.030> melted<00:02:30.569> together<00:02:31.519> I

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
and it just kind of melted together I

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.660 
and it just kind of melted together I
hope<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.940> guys<00:02:33.030> can<00:02:33.180> see<00:02:33.239> that<00:02:33.450> well<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:34.670> it

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
hope you guys can see that well and it

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.119 
hope you guys can see that well and it
barely<00:02:36.299> works<00:02:36.450> like<00:02:36.840> my<00:02:37.319> hand<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.709> can<00:02:37.739> do<00:02:38.010> it

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
barely works like my hand I can do it

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.890 
barely works like my hand I can do it
but<00:02:38.310> with<00:02:38.430> your<00:02:38.549> foot<00:02:38.849> it's<00:02:39.060> ridiculously

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
but with your foot it's ridiculously

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.000 
but with your foot it's ridiculously
hard<00:02:40.379> to<00:02:40.620> do<00:02:41.299> like<00:02:42.299> I'm<00:02:43.170> going<00:02:43.319> to<00:02:43.379> cut<00:02:43.620> my<00:02:43.799> foot

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
hard to do like I'm going to cut my foot

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.569 
hard to do like I'm going to cut my foot
on<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.340> edge<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:46.099> how<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.160> hell<00:02:47.250> am<00:02:47.489> I

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
on the edge and how the hell am I

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.520 
on the edge and how the hell am I
supposed<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.910> take<00:02:48.060> off<00:02:48.209> this<00:02:48.390> cover<00:02:48.690> now<00:02:48.930> this

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
supposed to take off this cover now this

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.319 
supposed to take off this cover now this
is<00:02:49.680> welded<00:02:50.099> together<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.400> little<00:02:50.610> need<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.060> cut

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
is welded together a little need to cut

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.550 
is welded together a little need to cut
this<00:02:51.450> off<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.989> then<00:02:52.950> I'm<00:02:53.040> cutting<00:02:53.370> my<00:02:54.560> the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
this off and then I'm cutting my the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.390 
this off and then I'm cutting my the
shaft<00:02:56.390> so<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.420> is<00:02:58.200> absolutely<00:02:58.769> retarded<00:02:58.980> i

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
shaft so that is absolutely retarded i

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.289 
shaft so that is absolutely retarded i
don't<00:02:59.519> know<00:02:59.579> if<00:02:59.670> you<00:02:59.760> guys<00:02:59.819> have<00:02:59.970> ever<00:03:00.060> seen

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
don't know if you guys have ever seen

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.500 
don't know if you guys have ever seen
anything<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:01.290> top<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.739> but<00:03:02.010> i<00:03:02.040> think<00:03:02.129> that's

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
anything to top that but i think that's

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.430 
anything to top that but i think that's
probably<00:03:03.510> one<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.930> worst<00:03:04.049> things<00:03:04.319> I've

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
probably one of the worst things I've

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.030 
probably one of the worst things I've
ever<00:03:04.470> seen<00:03:05.720> um<00:03:06.720> that's<00:03:07.500> what<00:03:07.709> all<00:03:07.799> I'm<00:03:07.950> going

inside the cylinders hopeful was hoping

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.129 
inside the cylinders hopeful was hoping
that<00:03:52.769> might<00:03:52.980> unstick<00:03:53.370> them<00:03:53.519> if<00:03:54.329> not<00:03:54.540> i<00:03:54.569> might

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.080 
that might unstick them if not i might
just<00:03:55.169> switch<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.709> cylinder<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.489> pistons

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
just switch the cylinder and pistons

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.129
