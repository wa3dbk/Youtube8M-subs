00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.230
 followed the same 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.430

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.220
 an increase of 15 thousand reais in the purchase of two sewing machines of 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.490
 raw material 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.530
 all business is done over the internet 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.400

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.990
 company every second that is no longer produced 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.080
 tevez in production means lower cost and lower price for the customer 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.710
 the company sells bags from three reais and thirty cents each 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.750
 ecological products value the image of customers like these that such 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.409
 fund that buys a thousand bags a month 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.039
 the transactions carried out in an entity together with the result of the examinations

 full of gears it was already bought used 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.450
 It's quite old, it's 30 years old. 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.509
 but so complete 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:52.509
 which ensures the productivity required for a successful business 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:54.759

 pressed 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:07.909
 ps of glue 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:08.949

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:12.559
 is an ecological cola of the ones we make at home as a child 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.819
 this conversation that is the role 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.899
 and on the other side the bags to come out amount 

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:23.929

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:25.639

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:31.709
 Paulo 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.669
 I'm going to stay in the recycled paper bag costing 60 to 35 cents as 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:41.139
 size for this two times more expensive than the plastic bag 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:45.089
 but it's the eco-friendly office that comes

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.939
 a very strong brand value 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.129

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.420
 within my brand and my proposal along with the feet 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:16.620

00:04:16.619 --> 00:04:21.669
 ecology you have a tremendous opportunity to produce a tremendous 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.240
 opportunity came from business 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.449
 joining the two things right the bag was the great villain 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:32.209

 this time as long as possible avoiding the goal 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.099
 the circulation of such deliveries to customers should be initiated, concludes that 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:56.039
 is important 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:57.230
 in the futures 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.230
