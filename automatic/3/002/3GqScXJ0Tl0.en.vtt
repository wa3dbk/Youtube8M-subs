00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
headstock around and I think you touched

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.860

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
balance and the the problem of if you

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.660 
balance and the the problem of if you
have<00:02:43.240> a<00:02:43.270> long<00:02:44.110> structure<00:02:44.980> under<00:02:45.400> which<00:02:45.430> a

basic weight advantage of bringing that

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.950 
basic weight advantage of bringing that
heavy<00:02:54.610> mechanism<00:02:55.150> putting<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.510> on<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.720> body

heavy mechanism putting it on the body

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.470 
heavy mechanism putting it on the body
is<00:02:56.460> you<00:02:57.460> know<00:02:57.550> it<00:02:57.730> brings<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.090> instrument

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
is you know it brings the instrument

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.610 
is you know it brings the instrument
into<00:02:58.570> balance<00:02:58.960> but<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.200> does<00:02:59.320> some<00:02:59.470> other

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
into balance but it does some other

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.440 
into balance but it does some other
things<00:02:59.860> that<00:02:59.920> are<00:03:00.040> also<00:03:00.700> interesting<00:03:01.270> and

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
things that are also interesting and

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.030 
things that are also interesting and
valuable<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:03.570> also<00:03:04.570> are<00:03:04.990> why<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.290> believe<00:03:05.830> that

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
valuable and also are why I believe that

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.190 
valuable and also are why I believe that
the<00:03:06.370> this<00:03:06.940> basic<00:03:07.390> headless<00:03:07.690> system<00:03:08.020> is

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
the this basic headless system is

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.300 
the this basic headless system is
superior<00:03:08.590> because<00:03:08.830> this<00:03:09.760> mass<00:03:10.480> now<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:12.010> at<00:03:12.280> the

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
superior because this mass now is at the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
superior because this mass now is at the
bridge<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:13.290> every<00:03:14.290> note<00:03:14.560> is<00:03:14.830> enjoying<00:03:15.550> direct

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
the notes that need the most help which

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.250 
the notes that need the most help which
are<00:03:35.980> further<00:03:36.190> up<00:03:36.400> on<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.700> strings<00:03:37.030> so<00:03:37.540> it<00:03:38.080> is<00:03:38.230> a

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
have a weight on the end of a neck then

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.320 
have a weight on the end of a neck then
you<00:03:44.860> have<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.160> work<00:03:45.519> very<00:03:45.760> hard<00:03:45.850> to<00:03:46.090> keep<00:03:46.209> your
