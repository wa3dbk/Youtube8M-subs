 home for 52.39 and as a processor I have 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.610
 chosen the five to 46 no 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.260
 the latest quality ratio processor 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:52.460

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:16.040
 a great processor for 200 17.73 euros 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.130
 as a motherboard I chose instead 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.280
 the other h note 04 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:26.360
 one last video card not suitable 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.000
 overlook but I chose the 5 46 90 not 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.840
 k so I don't expect this 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.900
 configuration is then points to 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.269
 the motherboard is great at price 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:45.519
 ie that of 85 100 the parade 3 euros e 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:50.680

 it is a 16 for itself to well know between how 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.389
 video card instead I chose the 69 280 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.419
 hicks from trigilia bytes 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:26.120
 this video card last card for the

 save around fifty euros vi 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:34.849
 I recommend taking the 39 280 because 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.879
