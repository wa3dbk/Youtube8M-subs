00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.570
 hello to all those facts that have a 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.520
 outperformance coach point fr 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.980
 today I do not find you in 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.539
 the pastures of praz-sur-arly but I 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.380
 find a bag of physical preparation 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.849
 from the center the signal in the station of 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.450
 seizures a quote from a mask is 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.020
 known for its trail and mountain bike trails 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.180
 today so we are in a 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.920
 weight room and I'm going to you 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.680
 present three exercises that are 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.219
 fundamental to well prepare 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.219
 more interest 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.730
 then this slit exercise is realized 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.220
 in- house years right leg 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.320
 django it's a very slow exercise for 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.699
 work as much the balanced so the 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.860
 articulation strengthening like the 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.840
 ankle and knee but also the 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.600
 movement control on the descent so 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.550
 on the eccentric phase followed by a 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.340
 concentric phase for this repulsed 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.470
 backwards take as much what 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.050
 is your breath inspired to the 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.070
 descent is blown to the push for 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.070
 to contract the abdominals 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.590
 this exercise can be done in two 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:30.409
 big cushions or on a mattress the ai if 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.000
 so we use cushions of 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.920
 mobility to strengthen the ankle 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.209
 the idea of ​​working unstable 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.429
 on squats it's to increase the 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:42.700
 muscle strain instead of 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:46.219
 overload with a weight bar 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:50.170
 think about picking up behind you 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.170
 to press very hard on the heels 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.039
 necas 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.080
 it's sure 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.270
 this exercise requires a little bit 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.500
 of material then there we use some 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.030
 straps with wrists but you 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.670
 can very well used a rope 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.470
 attached a very solid fixed point with 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.750
 two handles to not hurt yourself 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.640
 hands the idea so and realize 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.110
 one leg squats with the front leg 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.210
 okay the leg who do not work 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.950
 to be tense in front of one presses very hard 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.790
 on the heel to mobilize and the 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.350
 quadriceps and glutes the idea is 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.000
 not going down too much too low we can 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.610
 be limited to two miss what to see 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.230
 a third of squats this amplitude 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.230
 Enough is enough for a runner 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.430
 these three exercises will make it possible to be 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.870
 a little bit more powerful and 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.880
 do not forget to copy my page to 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.320
