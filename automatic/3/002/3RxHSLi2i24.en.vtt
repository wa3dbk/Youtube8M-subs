00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.230 
see one way they make the frame shorter
is<00:02:20.270> actually<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:22.400> frame<00:02:23.400> comes<00:02:23.760> into<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
is actually the frame comes into the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.650 
is actually the frame comes into the
will<00:02:24.420> see<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.080> difference<00:02:25.440> on<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:26.250> one<00:02:26.660> see

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
will see the difference on this one see

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.770 
will see the difference on this one see
the<00:02:27.810> tire<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:29.460> separation<00:02:30.830> see<00:02:31.830> this<00:02:32.780> no

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
the tire the separation see this no

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:43.780 
the tire the separation see this no
separation<00:02:34.350> so<00:02:35.220> those<00:02:35.490> are<00:02:35.730> my<00:02:36.500> one<00:02:38.240> two<00:02:41.300> three

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
separation so those are my one two three

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.470 
separation so those are my one two three
four<00:02:44.790> bikes<00:02:45.260> this<00:02:46.260> is<00:02:46.500> Megan's<00:02:47.040> road<00:02:47.760> bike<00:02:48.030> she

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
with this water bottle that actually

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.740 
with this water bottle that actually
fits<00:03:40.470> inside<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:41.250> bike<00:03:41.850> itself<00:03:42.270> so<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:42.959> goes

fits inside the bike itself so it goes

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.080 
fits inside the bike itself so it goes
down<00:03:45.750> into<00:03:46.020> there<00:03:46.400> okay<00:03:47.400> so<00:03:47.459> that's<00:03:47.790> about

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
down into there okay so that's about

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.210 
down into there okay so that's about
three<00:03:48.480> minutes<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:49.110> almost<00:03:49.590> four<00:03:49.800> minutes<00:03:49.980> of
