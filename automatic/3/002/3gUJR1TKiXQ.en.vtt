I absolutely have to use the by Terry

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.539 
I absolutely have to use the by Terry
primer<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.200> goes<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.560> clear<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.369> it

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
primer and it just goes on clear and it

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.310 
primer and it just goes on clear and it
gives<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.909> really<00:01:45.329> really<00:01:45.509> nice<00:01:45.659> base<00:01:45.990> for<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
gives a really really nice base for the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.120 
gives a really really nice base for the
color<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.009> makes<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.579> shade

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
color and it makes the shade

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.910 
color and it makes the shade
stand<00:01:48.310> out<00:01:48.549> a<00:01:48.880> lot<00:01:49.090> more<00:01:49.149> so<00:01:49.659> first<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:50.320> take<00:01:50.680> the

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
stand out a lot more so first I take the

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.550 
stand out a lot more so first I take the
lux<00:01:51.189> classic<00:01:51.820> shader<00:01:52.090> in<00:01:52.420> two<00:01:52.659> three<00:01:52.840> two<00:01:53.200> and

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
lux classic shader in two three two and

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.730 
lux classic shader in two three two and
I<00:01:54.280> use<00:01:54.610> this<00:01:54.880> matte<00:01:55.299> color<00:01:55.719> that's<00:01:56.170> almost<00:01:56.590> the

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
I use this matte color that's almost the

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.130 
I use this matte color that's almost the
same<00:01:56.950> shade<00:01:57.430> as<00:01:57.460> my<00:01:57.700> skin<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.479> I<00:01:58.659> just<00:01:58.689> brush

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
same shade as my skin and I just brush

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.830 
same shade as my skin and I just brush
it<00:01:59.320> all<00:01:59.500> over<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.950> lid<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.880> foldable<00:02:01.299> lid<00:02:01.630> and

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
it all over the lid the foldable lid and

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.020 
it all over the lid the foldable lid and
up<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.259> brow<00:02:02.439> bone<00:02:02.500> this<00:02:03.429> creates<00:02:03.850> a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
up to the brow bone this creates a

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.760 
up to the brow bone this creates a
really<00:02:04.360> good<00:02:04.570> base<00:02:04.840> for<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:05.320> pigment<00:02:05.740> to

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
really good base for the pigment to

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.070 
really good base for the pigment to
stand<00:02:06.130> out<00:02:06.340> as<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:07.329> can<00:02:07.479> see<00:02:07.689> it's<00:02:07.899> really

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
stand out as you can see it's really

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.660 
stand out as you can see it's really
starting<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.500> create<00:02:08.830> some<00:02:09.130> depth

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
starting to create some depth

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.640 
starting to create some depth
the<00:02:09.880> next<00:02:10.209> color<00:02:10.390> which<00:02:10.899> is<00:02:11.080> this<00:02:11.230> coppery

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
the next color which is this coppery

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.190 
the next color which is this coppery
shade<00:02:11.950> is<00:02:12.250> significantly<00:02:12.880> darker<00:02:13.120> so<00:02:13.690> as<00:02:13.989> I'm

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
shade is significantly darker so as I'm

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.620 
shade is significantly darker so as I'm
using<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.530> 221<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.400> diffuse<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.090> color<00:02:16.330> I'm

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
using the 221 to diffuse the color I'm

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.780 
using the 221 to diffuse the color I'm
really<00:02:17.019> blending<00:02:17.380> into<00:02:17.530> my<00:02:17.800> crease<00:02:18.099> creating

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
really blending into my crease creating

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.210 
really blending into my crease creating
kind<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.269> false<00:02:19.810> eye<00:02:20.019> crease<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.650> take<00:02:21.069> the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.339 
more I'm going into this dark chocolate
shade<00:02:33.459> so<00:02:34.180> now<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.450> we've<00:02:34.660> created<00:02:34.900> this

depth I'm going to use a 230 luxe pencil
which<00:02:39.519> is<00:02:39.549> just<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.150> little<00:02:40.569> bit<00:02:40.750> tinier<00:02:41.440> than

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
which is just a little bit tinier than

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.430 
which is just a little bit tinier than
the<00:02:41.860> 231<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:42.940> I<00:02:42.970> go<00:02:43.299> right<00:02:43.540> into<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.900> corner

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
the 231 so I go right into the corner

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.250 
the 231 so I go right into the corner
outer<00:02:44.680> corner<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.220> my<00:02:45.310> eye<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.849> I<00:02:46.420> create<00:02:46.900> like

a<00:02:47.290> v-shape<00:02:48.120> blending<00:02:49.120> into<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.690> inner<00:02:49.900> corner

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
a v-shape blending into the inner corner

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.740 
a v-shape blending into the inner corner
of<00:02:50.290> my<00:02:50.410> eye<00:02:50.440> but<00:02:50.950> just<00:02:51.340> half<00:02:51.579> way<00:02:51.610> so<00:02:52.390> this<00:02:52.540> way

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
of my eye but just half way so this way

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.390 
of my eye but just half way so this way
I'm<00:02:53.019> adding<00:02:53.440> more<00:02:53.590> depth<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.250> you're

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
I'm adding more depth and you're

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.009 
I'm adding more depth and you're
starting<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.790> see<00:02:54.910> that<00:02:55.120> it's<00:02:55.480> getting<00:02:55.780> much

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
times don't worry if it looks kind of

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.090

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
on adhesive eyelash glue and so I wait a

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.980 
on adhesive eyelash glue and so I wait a
little<00:04:52.340> bit<00:04:52.610> just<00:04:53.060> to<00:04:53.210> let<00:04:53.480> it<00:04:53.510> get<00:04:53.720> tacky

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
little bit just to let it get tacky

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.330 
little bit just to let it get tacky
because<00:04:54.410> if<00:04:54.560> you<00:04:54.650> put<00:04:54.830> them<00:04:54.920> on<00:04:55.040> right<00:04:55.250> away

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
because if you put them on right away

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.830 
because if you put them on right away
they'll<00:04:55.700> fall<00:04:55.910> off<00:04:55.940> if<00:04:56.390> you<00:04:56.510> wait<00:04:56.660> too<00:04:56.810> long

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
they'll fall off if you wait too long

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.840 
they'll fall off if you wait too long
they'll<00:04:57.290> also<00:04:57.440> fall<00:04:57.770> off<00:04:57.980> so<00:04:58.550> you<00:04:58.610> have<00:04:58.700> to

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
they'll also fall off so you have to

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.790 
they'll also fall off so you have to
make<00:04:59.030> sure<00:04:59.240> that<00:04:59.480> you<00:04:59.570> just<00:04:59.750> wait<00:05:00.020> one<00:05:00.590> minute

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
make sure that you just wait one minute
