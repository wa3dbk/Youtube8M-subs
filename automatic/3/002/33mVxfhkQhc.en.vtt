right in front of these pistons and then
you<00:01:04.019> want<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.409> pressure<00:01:04.680> plate<00:01:04.860> here<00:01:05.700> at<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
you want a pressure plate here at the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.060 
you want a pressure plate here at the
beginning<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.930> your<00:01:07.080> starting<00:01:07.439> area

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
beginning this is your starting area

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.789 
beginning this is your starting area
this<00:01:08.970> will<00:01:09.180> be<00:01:09.299> repeated<00:01:09.869> at<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.380> other<00:01:10.530> end

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
this will be repeated at the other end

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.420 
this will be repeated at the other end
but<00:01:11.040> facing<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.610> way<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.909> send<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.450> back<00:01:13.430> now

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
but facing this way to send you back now

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.219 
but facing this way to send you back now
the<00:01:14.490> next<00:01:14.640> sections<00:01:15.180> can<00:01:15.390> be<00:01:15.450> repeated<00:01:16.110> as

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the next sections can be repeated as

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.140 
the next sections can be repeated as
many<00:01:16.500> times<00:01:16.830> as<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.130> like<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.880> get<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
many times as you like to get the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.390 
many times as you like to get the
required<00:01:18.450> distance<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.259> leave<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.830> gap

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
required distance so you leave a gap

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.630 
required distance so you leave a gap
after<00:01:20.700> your<00:01:21.090> half<00:01:21.360> slabs<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.860> two

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
after your half slabs you have two

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.600 
after your half slabs you have two
pistons<00:01:24.060> facing<00:01:24.420> towards<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.189> two<00:01:26.189> pistons

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
pistons facing towards you two pistons

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.450 
pistons facing towards you two pistons
facing<00:01:27.030> away<00:01:27.150> from<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.770> front<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.950> these<00:01:29.100> each

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
facing away from you front of these each

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.149 
facing away from you front of these each
side<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.180> half<00:01:30.540> slabs<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.530> then<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> pressure

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
side to half slabs and then a pressure

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.990 
side to half slabs and then a pressure
plates<00:01:32.520> here<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.710> here<00:01:34.710> let's<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.880> do<00:01:35.970> that

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
plates here and here let's just do that

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.090 
plates here and here let's just do that
again<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.560> leave<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:38.400> gap<00:01:39.740> pistons<00:01:40.740> are

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
again so you leave one gap pistons are

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.480 
again so you leave one gap pistons are
facing<00:01:41.430> towards<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.770> pistons<00:01:43.770> facing<00:01:44.369> away

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
facing towards you pistons facing away

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.020 
facing towards you pistons facing away
from<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:45.060> two<00:01:45.990> half<00:01:46.320> slabs<00:01:46.710> each<00:01:47.100> side<00:01:47.520> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
from you two half slabs each side and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.770 
from you two half slabs each side and
pressure<00:01:48.960> plates<00:01:49.320> here<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.040> here<00:01:50.729> as<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.720> said

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
pressure plates here and here as I said

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.230 
pressure plates here and here as I said
you<00:01:52.079> can<00:01:52.110> keep<00:01:52.439> repeating<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.130> as<00:01:53.549> far<00:01:54.030> as

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
you can keep repeating this as far as

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.240 
you can keep repeating this as far as
you<00:01:54.390> need<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.720> travel<00:01:55.079> let's<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:55.950> go<00:01:56.219> through

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
you need to travel let's just go through

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.990 
you need to travel let's just go through
that<00:01:56.579> one<00:01:56.820> time<00:01:57.890> or<00:01:58.890> one<00:01:59.100> more<00:01:59.340> time<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.820> should

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
that one time or one more time I should

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
pressure plate here you then jump in

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.660 
pressure plate here you then jump in
that's<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.780> button<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.800> you're<00:02:32.370> going<00:02:32.550> out

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
open our back for every five blocks of

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.870 
open our back for every five blocks of
travel<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.480> need<00:02:39.690> four<00:02:40.110> Pistons<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:41.370> pressure

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
travel you need four Pistons to pressure

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.510 
travel you need four Pistons to pressure
plates<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.510> for<00:02:42.930> half<00:02:43.170> slabs<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.220> this<00:02:44.370> way

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
plates and for half slabs so this way

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.370
