 of 1500 milliamps that he also had 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.830
 included it seems that a usb flex cable and 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.170
 it also has what is a connector 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.970
 30 pins and a led indicator we are going to 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.730
 proceed to biblio immediately we are going to 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.230
 see what brings in and removed from 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.280
 the same way as the covers that he has 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.810
 sent this company 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.790
 and here we are going to 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.810
 open it how good this occasion I think that 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.810
 it opens in this way 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.219
 and we are going to proceed to remove them 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.130
 quickly we are going to put the box to a 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:22.080
 side so that it does not get in the way and we're going to 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.000
 try to get this out 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.580
 to the package of a small user manual 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.620
 What is the guarantee we are going to put is 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.130
 one side and good as you can see here 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.410
 is what is an usb extender what 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.300
 which allows you to connect it in 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.300
 case you have a rear port in 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.370
 your pc or something like that they bring extend what 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.130
 which is the connector for which it deals with 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.950
 this side let's put a side here you 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.440
 good as a kind of hook which 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.790
 as you can see it connects this can already 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.590
 be hanging either from your suitcase of your 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:00.410
 pants or anything what is 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:03.780
 One year warranty and here it includes us 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.660
 that apparently a manual in which we 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.070
 it indicates good about the operation 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.959
 how many tells us how much 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.340
 battery we have appear the maximum is 4 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.050
 the minimum is one is the same for giving 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.910
 some examples of how to load it as 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.470
 it is loaded to the devices and more let's 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.600
 to put everything at your side and we're going to 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.550
 focus on what is this this 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.520
 small battery as you can appreciate the 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.560
 Two cables are retractable in one 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.269
 small part the game can not be 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.040
 Save in this way is designed to 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.930
 save it like this 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.959
 without any problem and with you they are going 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.730
 to occupy can take out the round cables 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.739
 small a small indicator which 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.620
 good as you can appreciate now no 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.269
 it would be that the battery is full and it brings 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.760
 here what it is to be able to load it via 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.769
 usb is loaded via usb obviously in 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.290
 this part of here we can hang what 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.659
 is the little hook that brings us and here 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.250
 We have the tied 30-pin neves that 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:56.639
 let's check if it works here I have 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.879
 this time my iphone 4 and we're going to 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:02.930
 connect it um to see if it really starts 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.209
 to charge our device 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.700
 apparently he was without a battery denver 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.069
 is completely dead but yes look 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.319
 it is already loading and in this way 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.629
 can charge your device without any 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.430
 problem on the street where you are 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.500
 water, it's worth noting that the company 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.060
 he said is that from the month of April 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.310
 that year they are going to have these products 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.900
 available with the lighting adapter 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.639
 it's with the students and you do not count 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.650
 with a 30-pin conat device 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:29.719
 you can check on your website and you're going to 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.969

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:35.239
