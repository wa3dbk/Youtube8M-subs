00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
how I installed all these climbing holds

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.549 
how I installed all these climbing holds
in<00:00:10.769> my<00:00:11.490> house<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:12.049> by<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.110> way<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.290> got<00:00:13.469> these

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
in my house and by the way I got these

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.860 
in my house and by the way I got these
climbing<00:00:13.950> holds<00:00:14.040> from<00:00:14.490> atomic<00:00:15.030> climbing

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
climbing holds from atomic climbing

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.050 
climbing holds from atomic climbing
holds<00:00:15.990> calm<00:00:16.650> they<00:00:17.310> have<00:00:17.490> tons<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.970> different

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
holds calm they have tons of different

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.189 
holds calm they have tons of different
shapes<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.690> sizes<00:00:18.869> for<00:00:19.800> different<00:00:20.100> levels

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
shapes and sizes for different levels

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.540 
shapes and sizes for different levels
some<00:00:22.199> are<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.380> lot<00:00:22.619> more<00:00:22.830> difficult<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.220> hold<00:00:23.369> on

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
some are a lot more difficult to hold on

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.310 
some are a lot more difficult to hold on
than<00:00:23.730> others<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.210> when<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.539> order<00:00:24.840> them<00:00:25.019> make

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
than others so when you order them make

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.859 
than others so when you order them make
sure<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:26.130> would<00:00:26.849> start<00:00:27.090> off<00:00:27.240> with<00:00:27.510> something

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
sure I would start off with something

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.070 
sure I would start off with something
easier<00:00:28.560> like<00:00:29.490> some<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.179> small<00:00:30.449> ones<00:00:30.750> just

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
easier like some of the small ones just

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.620 
easier like some of the small ones just
to<00:00:31.380> make<00:00:31.590> sure<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.279> can<00:00:32.520> actually<00:00:33.180> do

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
to make sure that you can actually do

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.380 
to make sure that you can actually do
them<00:00:33.870> because<00:00:34.800> some<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.040> these<00:00:35.160> other<00:00:36.149> ones

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
them because some of these other ones

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.810 
them because some of these other ones
they<00:00:36.870> can<00:00:36.930> get<00:00:37.230> pretty<00:00:37.800> difficult<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.460> hold<00:00:38.640> on

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
they can get pretty difficult to hold on

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.530 
they can get pretty difficult to hold on
to<00:00:40.010> especially<00:00:41.010> some<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.879> these<00:00:41.940> big<00:00:42.180> bowls

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
to especially some of these big bowls

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.510 
to especially some of these big bowls
they're<00:00:42.870> kind<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.140> sloppy<00:00:43.410> bombs<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.340> count

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
they're kind of sloppy bombs and count

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.880 
they're kind of sloppy bombs and count
bombs<00:00:44.789> but<00:00:45.750> some<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.110> combs<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.590> think<00:00:46.800> are

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
bombs but some of the combs I think are

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.760 
bombs but some of the combs I think are
pretty<00:00:47.010> easy<00:00:47.600> some<00:00:48.600> banana<00:00:48.899> shapes<00:00:49.230> these<00:00:49.649> are

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
pretty easy some banana shapes these are

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.040 
pretty easy some banana shapes these are
pretty<00:00:49.950> easy<00:00:50.100> hold<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.670> more<00:00:51.120> advanced<00:00:51.840> and

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
pretty easy hold on to more advanced and

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.220 
pretty easy hold on to more advanced and
difficult<00:00:52.379> here<00:00:53.420> anyways<00:00:54.449> during<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
difficult here anyways during the

have noticed that this set of holes here

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.890 
have noticed that this set of holes here
that<00:05:40.600> I<00:05:40.630> installed<00:05:41.080> are<00:05:41.290> installed<00:05:42.160> on<00:05:42.490> a<00:05:42.900> 2x4

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
that I installed are installed on a 2x4

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.300 
that I installed are installed on a 2x4
and<00:05:44.820> that<00:05:45.820> 2x4<00:05:46.300> is<00:05:46.480> then<00:05:46.690> attached<00:05:47.140> to<00:05:47.530> the

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
and that 2x4 is then attached to the

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.910 
and that 2x4 is then attached to the
Joyce's<00:05:48.790> up<00:05:49.060> in<00:05:49.180> the<00:05:49.270> ceiling<00:05:49.630> and<00:05:49.810> the<00:05:50.590> reason

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:50.920 
Joyce's up in the ceiling and the reason

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.520 
Joyce's up in the ceiling and the reason
I<00:05:51.010> did<00:05:51.220> that<00:05:51.250> was<00:05:51.730> because<00:05:52.240> I<00:05:52.690> can<00:05:52.900> adjust

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
I did that was because I can adjust

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:59.280 
I did that was because I can adjust
