00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
in the arena when she went up you're

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.319 
in the arena when she went up you're
looking<00:01:33.659> at<00:01:33.900> about<00:01:33.990> 3,000<00:01:34.890> damage<00:01:35.159> now<00:01:36.119> you're

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
looking at about 3,000 damage now you're

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.999 
looking at about 3,000 damage now you're
in<00:01:36.420> Phase<00:01:36.600> two<00:01:36.630> there<00:01:37.079> was<00:01:37.229> another<00:01:37.470> AoE<00:01:37.770> to

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
in Phase two there was another AoE to

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.950 
in Phase two there was another AoE to
the<00:01:38.100> count<00:01:38.340> 4<00:01:38.549> as<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.390> will<00:01:39.479> see<00:01:39.659> there<00:01:39.840> is

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
the count 4 as you will see there is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.810 
the count 4 as you will see there is
like<00:01:40.140> rings<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.920> come<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> outside<00:01:41.700> of

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
like rings that come on the outside of

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.429 
like rings that come on the outside of
the<00:01:41.880> arena<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.079> Titan

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
the arena this is just like the Titan

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.230 
the arena this is just like the Titan
bombs<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.950> first<00:01:44.189> one<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.670> spawns<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
bombs the first one that spawns is the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.030 
bombs the first one that spawns is the
first<00:01:45.450> one<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.780> explode<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.680> when<00:01:46.860> that

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
first one to explode and when that

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.039 
first one to explode and when that
explodes<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.939> can<00:01:48.090> then<00:01:48.210> run<00:01:48.390> into<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.810> area

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
explodes you can then run into that area

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.350 
explodes you can then run into that area
and<00:01:49.409> you'll<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:49.680> safe<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.790> another<00:01:51.090> thing<00:01:51.180> to

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
and you'll be safe so another thing to

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.539 
and you'll be safe so another thing to
look<00:01:51.570> out<00:01:51.750> for<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.200> phase<00:01:52.409> 2<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> move<00:01:53.159> Shiva

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
look out for in phase 2 is a move Shiva

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.760 
look out for in phase 2 is a move Shiva
