00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.629
 you know what a real tube is this one 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.550
 magic word if you think about it 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.559
 but they use children when they all play 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.340
 they know it is for everyone it is synonymous with 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.340
 to go fast 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:23.550
 in short, there are so many emotions linked to 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:25.740
 turbo takes a bit from the tastes I ad 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.640
 example I ca n't resist when I drive 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.640
 I like to go sideways 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.650
 marco instead is a security when there is 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.650
 to keep down the right foot 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.200
 and then there is fabio our magician of 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.200
 guide to the last drop 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.290
 which machines we have chosen for this 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.820
 turbo test only one renault clio che 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.570
 with the turbo has a little fun doing 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.570
 three card game 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.070
 here 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.720
 but what is the meaning of all this? 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.120
 asking 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.980
 it's a question of sensations we have 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.700
 wanted to tell you how many emotions can 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.700
 give the turbo 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.370
 that of speed because they whistle 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.230
 the ears of an engine so you enter 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.550
 inside as a rhythm to follow for 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.550
 devour one curve after another 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.340
 and then there is the security to have feel 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.750
 to be able to count on so much push also 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.500
 when a change is wrong and turns 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.940
 down 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.410
 this allows you to enjoy it even more 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.380
 the dirty guide to focus on 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.380
 steering as the car moves beautiful 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.470
 but the turbo is also a challenge for those 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.360
 guide that is to consume the less 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.920
 possible engines that as far as they are of 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.470
 small displacement for downsizing 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:10.060
 still remain gasoline but then 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:12.450
 we see a little hundred divided by 3.4 29.4 km 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.450
 with a liter 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.760
 obviously it is about the media that the 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.930
 nine hundred three-cylinder renon from 90 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.060
 horses can do at speed 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.800
 traffic constant the distances 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.840
 decrease but it is also true that in 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.460
 general gas turbos do not consume 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.950
 more like once with 200 horses 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.660
 instead of the rs 1600 turbo you can't 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.520
 have the manual gearbox also double 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.110
 clutch is not fast in gear and 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.820
 also suggestive to use makes you feel 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.650
 like pilots in a race to the most 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.270
 fans, however, a heel point one 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.740
 two goals and manage to give the guide 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.319
 that something more than everything 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.449
 and the clio cup is so well prepared 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:47.800
 treated well developed professional 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.270
 which almost looks like a car from 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.979
 endurance tourism championship 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.930
 there is a risk that the 220 horses of the 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.759
 Turbo engine is not enough after a few races 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.960
 plus it is a moment to get caught up in the 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.240
 furiousness of the sequential gearbox 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.620
 front and rear axle clutches 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.960
 nervous ready to close each 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.310
 trajectory drawn by a steering wheel e 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.900
 instead it looks like wheels are connected 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:10.870
 covered with glue for how it changes 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:12.759
 efficient fast fun direction 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.139
 as you have seen the tube technology 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.930
 lets go to the other end 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:21.509
 some kind of drivers are clean 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.509
 let us know or dirty
