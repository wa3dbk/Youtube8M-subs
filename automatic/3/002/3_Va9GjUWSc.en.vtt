00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 heard a joke the inscription on the tombstone is not 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.319
 all yogurts are equally useful 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.319
 is it true let's talk about it 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.450
 just sign the milk 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.210
 home-made kefir homemade yogurt is 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.540
 what we call yogurt yogurt is 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.830
 milky base with added 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.730
 lactobacillus 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.920
 lactobacilli can form 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.860
 either naturally or added 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.590
 artificially all very useful 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.600
 because lactobacilli have 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.120
 stimulating effect on microflora 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.820
 our stomach to buy 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.410
 the store that we call this yogurt 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.040
 system which is structured 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.350
 reminiscent of minced meat 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.870
 because this fat is girder 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.630
 this thickener to yogurt and 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.899
 honey structure added and lactobacillus 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.690
 sugar and further flavoring which 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.649
 are added either in the form of fruit or in 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.759
 cheaper options are marzipan 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.640
 natural yoghurt stored for 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.960
 twenty twenty four hours is not 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.570
 very tasty drink 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.009
 but very useful that yogurt which 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.840
 we buy in the store 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.729
 has a shelf life of 14 to 48 days 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.490
 naturally preservatives are added there 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.069
 but the amount of preservatives that 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.649
 added to yogurt is 100 share 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.390
 percent these preservatives are not involved in 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.819
 metabolism they are derived from 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.069
 organism as slags but allow 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.560
 keep product long enough 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:49.560
 time yogurt may be fat 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.810
 vary from 0 to 22 percent 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.630
 Yogurt coloring determines the amount 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.479
 sugar added there and so if you 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.110
 eat 6 cans of yogurt a day which 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:05.330
 contains 11 17 percent sugar hardly 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.330
 whether it will give harmony to your figure
