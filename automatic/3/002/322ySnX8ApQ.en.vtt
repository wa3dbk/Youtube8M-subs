00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
obviously toddlers weren't until the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.300 
obviously toddlers weren't until the
sims<00:01:05.280> 4<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.880> mean<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.360> until<00:01:06.840> sims<00:01:07.080> 2<00:01:07.350> but<00:01:07.950> um

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
like there's so much coding that needs

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.620 
like there's so much coding that needs
to<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.640> done<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.090> probably<00:01:24.330> won't<00:01:24.479> be

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
to be done and you probably won't be

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.679 
to be done and you probably won't be
able<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.840> get<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:24.990> out<00:01:25.140> but<00:01:25.920> pools<00:01:26.549> should<00:01:27.150> this

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
able to get it out but pools should this

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.410 
able to get it out but pools should this
be<00:01:27.750> there<00:01:28.320> it's<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.250> thing<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:30.150> know<00:01:30.270> it's

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
be there it's it's a thing you know it's

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.350 
be there it's it's a thing you know it's
it's<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:33.270> like

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
it's just it's just like just like

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.030 
it's just it's just like just like
anything<00:01:33.659> else<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.140> know<00:01:34.259> it's<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.710> pond

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
anything else you know it's like a pond

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
it's a little bit harder now to play the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.170 
it's a little bit harder now to play the
game<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:40.049> because<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.890> but<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:42.000> don't

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
game just because of that but I don't

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.580 
game just because of that but I don't
know<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.329> feel<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.409> takes

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
know I feel like that that just takes

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.550 
know I feel like that that just takes
the<00:01:43.740> enjoyment<00:01:44.220> out<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.659> at<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.350> same

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
the enjoyment out of it but at the same

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.999 
the enjoyment out of it but at the same
time<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.250> why<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.689> know<00:01:49.009> one

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
time it's just like why you know one

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.039
