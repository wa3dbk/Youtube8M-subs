which<00:03:14.139> is<00:03:14.169> quite<00:03:14.560> cool<00:03:19.799> alright<00:03:20.799> I<00:03:21.870> think<00:03:22.870> they

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
which is quite cool alright I think they

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.720 
which is quite cool alright I think they
have<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.319> different<00:03:23.530> color<00:03:23.889> on<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.340> side

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
have a different color on the side

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:32.880 
have a different color on the side
mirrors<00:03:27.299> Bonaparte<00:03:28.299> same<00:03:29.019> deal

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.740 

not<00:03:33.890> much<00:03:34.160> difference<00:03:35.090> from<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.690> original

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
not much difference from the original

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.900 
not much difference from the original
all<00:03:38.750> right<00:03:39.020> now<00:03:39.200> let's<00:03:39.440> transform<00:03:40.010> this<00:03:40.700> KO

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
all right now let's transform this KO

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.970 
all right now let's transform this KO
same<00:03:43.910> transformation<00:03:44.950> overall<00:03:47.830> squeeze<00:03:48.830> that

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
same transformation overall squeeze that

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:56.350 
same transformation overall squeeze that
out<00:03:51.160> for<00:03:52.160> all<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.490> says<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.910> same<00:03:55.150> move<00:03:56.150> the

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
out for all it says the same move the

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.990 
out for all it says the same move the
bumper<00:03:56.750> that<00:03:56.990> becomes<00:03:57.350> a<00:03:57.470> steady

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.920 

oh<00:04:02.060> yeah

oh yeah
let's<00:04:04.930> do<00:04:05.050> that<00:04:05.080> later<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:07.030> take<00:04:07.540> out<00:04:07.720> the

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
let's do that later and take out the

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:20.400 
let's do that later and take out the
feet<00:04:09.870> same<00:04:10.870> transformation<00:04:14.670> camera<00:04:19.410> then

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
feet same transformation camera then

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.880 
feet same transformation camera then
what<00:04:20.739> you<00:04:20.860> do<00:04:21.010> here<00:04:21.340> is<00:04:21.610> take<00:04:22.180> out<00:04:22.390> the<00:04:22.740> arms<00:04:23.740> at

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
what you do here is take out the arms at

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:35.310 
what you do here is take out the arms at
the<00:04:24.010> ends<00:04:30.300> then<00:04:31.300> chilled<00:04:31.570> down<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:34.030> then<00:04:34.870> pop

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
the ends then chilled down and then pop

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:43.200 
the ends then chilled down and then pop
feed<00:04:36.570> for<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.690> trunk<00:04:38.520> I'm<00:04:39.520> sorry<00:04:39.700> the<00:04:39.850> hood<00:04:42.210> ok

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
feed for the trunk I'm sorry the hood ok

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.250 
feed for the trunk I'm sorry the hood ok
now<00:04:43.540> let's<00:04:43.750> go<00:04:43.930> to<00:04:43.960> the<00:04:45.150> point<00:04:46.150> part<00:04:46.510> of<00:04:46.720> this

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
now let's go to the point part of this

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.700 
now let's go to the point part of this
figure<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:48.130> shares<00:04:48.370> of<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.640> face<00:04:49.290> after<00:04:50.290> we

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
figure the shares of the face after we

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:58.440 
figure the shares of the face after we
transformed<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.400> arms<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:58.270> same

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
transformed the arms the same

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.750 
transformed the arms the same
transformation<00:04:59.790> now<00:05:00.790> the<00:05:01.390> face<00:05:01.690> is<00:05:02.760> pretty

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
transformation now the face is pretty

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.750 
transformation now the face is pretty
much<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.030> same<00:05:04.680> except<00:05:05.680> that<00:05:05.950> he<00:05:06.580> doesn't

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
much the same except that he doesn't

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.620 
much the same except that he doesn't
have<00:05:06.910> any<00:05:07.120> light-piping<00:05:09.300> it<00:05:10.300> doesn't<00:05:10.540> have

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
have any light-piping it doesn't have

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.580 
have any light-piping it doesn't have
any<00:05:10.810> light<00:05:10.990> pipe<00:05:11.230> in<00:05:11.410> the<00:05:11.560> back<00:05:13.380> what<00:05:14.380> I<00:05:14.440> could

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
any light pipe in the back what I could

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.200 
any light pipe in the back what I could
do<00:05:14.710> without<00:05:14.890> light-piping<00:05:15.370> it's<00:05:15.910> alright

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
do without light-piping it's alright

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.720 
do without light-piping it's alright
it's<00:05:16.990> not<00:05:17.200> something<00:05:17.740> that<00:05:18.150> is<00:05:19.150> a<00:05:20.730> it's

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
it's not something that is a it's

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:28.080 
it's not something that is a it's
actually<00:05:22.060> just<00:05:22.210> a<00:05:22.330> trivial<00:05:22.780> I<00:05:23.430> temper<00:05:24.430> me<00:05:27.090> ok

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
actually just a trivial I temper me ok

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.510 
actually just a trivial I temper me ok
let's<00:05:28.660> move<00:05:28.930> the<00:05:29.140> camera<00:05:29.410> up<00:05:29.530> a<00:05:29.770> bit<00:05:29.920> so<00:05:30.370> I<00:05:30.400> can

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
let's move the camera up a bit so I can

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:52.470 
let's move the camera up a bit so I can
I<00:05:30.700> go

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:06:01.240 

they're<00:05:56.320> KO<00:05:57.320> animated<00:05:58.010> jazz<00:05:59.620> sim<00:06:00.620> robot<00:06:01.040> mode

they're KO animated jazz sim robot mode
same<00:06:01.940> figure<00:06:02.270> same<00:06:02.960> possibility<00:06:03.710> send<00:06:04.550> colors

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:15.550 

articulation<00:06:08.210> is<00:06:08.390> pretty<00:06:08.750> much<00:06:08.900> the<00:06:08.960> same<00:06:14.560> big

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
articulation is pretty much the same big

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.130 
articulation is pretty much the same big
difference<00:06:15.950> with<00:06:16.280> this<00:06:16.400> one<00:06:16.670> is<00:06:17.140> the

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
difference with this one is the

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.100 
difference with this one is the
nunchucks<00:06:18.590> that<00:06:18.800> he<00:06:19.010> has<00:06:19.220> on<00:06:19.520> the<00:06:19.610> side<00:06:20.110> the

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
nunchucks that he has on the side the

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.970 
nunchucks that he has on the side the
original<00:06:21.560> can<00:06:22.190> be<00:06:22.370> detached<00:06:22.940> with<00:06:23.480> a<00:06:24.410> pair<00:06:24.950> of

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
nunchucks when you detach this one it's

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.230 
nunchucks when you detach this one it's
just<00:06:28.700> a<00:06:29.060> pair<00:06:29.920> up<00:06:30.920> rocket<00:06:31.430> boosters<00:06:31.850> on<00:06:32.150> the

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
just a pair up rocket boosters on the

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.910 
just a pair up rocket boosters on the
side<00:06:33.340> he<00:06:34.340> can<00:06:34.520> hold<00:06:34.670> it<00:06:34.880> but<00:06:35.680> to<00:06:36.680> no<00:06:36.800> avail

side he can hold it but to no avail

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.330 
side he can hold it but to no avail
what's<00:06:37.280> he<00:06:37.400> going<00:06:37.520> to<00:06:37.580> use<00:06:37.730> with<00:06:38.410> two<00:06:39.410> rocket

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
what's he going to use with two rocket

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.790 
what's he going to use with two rocket
boosters

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.540 

but<00:06:45.460> that's<00:06:46.210> all<00:06:46.389> right<00:06:48.659> you<00:06:49.659> can<00:06:49.900> still

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
but that's all right you can still

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:58.350 
but that's all right you can still
rotate<00:06:51.550> that<00:06:53.370> but<00:06:54.370> in<00:06:54.490> any<00:06:54.639> case<00:06:54.729> I<00:06:57.150> still<00:06:58.150> like

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
rotate that but in any case I still like

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:06.050 
rotate that but in any case I still like
this<00:06:58.750> figure<00:07:01.229> overall<00:07:02.229> I<00:07:02.530> guess<00:07:04.470> sometimes

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060 
this figure overall I guess sometimes

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.029 
this figure overall I guess sometimes
getting<00:07:07.060> a<00:07:07.210> knockoff<00:07:07.629> these<00:07:08.590> really<00:07:08.860> worth

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 
getting a knockoff these really worth

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:10.800 
getting a knockoff these really worth
the<00:07:09.220> money<00:07:09.340> especially<00:07:10.090> when<00:07:10.240> you<00:07:10.360> just<00:07:10.659> buy

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:10.810 
the money especially when you just buy

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:17.700 
the money especially when you just buy
him<00:07:11.580> under<00:07:12.580> two<00:07:13.270> bucks<00:07:14.199> in<00:07:15.479> my<00:07:16.479> case<00:07:16.720> this<00:07:17.169> is<00:07:17.379> a

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:17.710 
him under two bucks in my case this is a

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:22.980 
him under two bucks in my case this is a
Filipino<00:07:19.949> peso<00:07:20.949> so<00:07:21.250> this<00:07:21.849> is<00:07:22.000> less<00:07:22.449> than<00:07:22.659> 100

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990 
Filipino peso so this is less than 100

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:29.399
