about any lateral movement should be a

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.069 
about any lateral movement should be a

here

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.309 
here
and<00:01:56.729> let's<00:01:56.999> see<00:01:57.149> how<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.630> do<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.810> with<00:01:58.200> the

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
and let's see how we can do it with the

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:05.109 
and let's see how we can do it with the
better<00:01:58.469> method<00:01:59.899> ready

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.340 

obviously<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.299> was<00:02:06.420> quite<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.659> bit<00:02:06.869> faster

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
obviously that was quite a bit faster

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.410 
obviously that was quite a bit faster
being<00:02:07.859> having<00:02:08.039> my<00:02:08.250> body<00:02:08.429> position<00:02:08.700> lined<00:02:09.240> up

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
being having my body position lined up
