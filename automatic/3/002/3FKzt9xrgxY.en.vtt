00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
today I'm going to show you how to work

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.799 
today I'm going to show you how to work
this

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
this

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.900 
this
arches<00:00:10.320> pattern<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:11.519> can<00:00:11.639> see<00:00:11.759> we've<00:00:11.880> got

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
arches pattern you can see we've got

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.340 
arches pattern you can see we've got
arches<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:13.370> chains<00:00:14.370> anchored<00:00:15.179> with<00:00:15.480> single

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
arches of chains anchored with single

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.930 
arches of chains anchored with single
crochet<00:00:16.800> stitches<00:00:17.130> it's<00:00:17.490> really<00:00:17.760> quite

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
crochet stitches it's really quite

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.730 
crochet stitches it's really quite
simple<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.720> looks<00:00:18.900> pretty<00:00:19.170> nice<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.560> both

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
simple it looks pretty nice on both

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.740 
simple it looks pretty nice on both
sides<00:00:20.100> I'm<00:00:20.970> going<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.210> show<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.390> how<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.570> do

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
sides I'm going to show you how to do

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.390 
sides I'm going to show you how to do
this<00:00:21.869> step<00:00:22.320> by<00:00:22.500> step<00:00:24.680> so<00:00:25.680> here<00:00:25.830> I've<00:00:25.949> got<00:00:26.039> a

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
this step by step so here I've got a

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.310 
this step by step so here I've got a
foundation<00:00:26.609> chain<00:00:26.880> already<00:00:27.420> begun<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.080> a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
foundation chain already begun this is a

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.760 
foundation chain already begun this is a
chain<00:00:29.070> 18<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:32.030> I'm<00:00:33.030> gonna<00:00:33.239> begin<00:00:33.480> Row<00:00:33.840> 1<00:00:34.079> which

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
chain 18 and I'm gonna begin Row 1 which

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.190 
chain 18 and I'm gonna begin Row 1 which
is<00:00:34.950> our<00:00:35.070> right<00:00:35.280> side<00:00:35.550> row<00:00:35.820> with<00:00:36.329> one<00:00:36.570> SC<00:00:36.960> and

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
is our right side row with one SC and

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.380 
is our right side row with one SC and
second<00:00:37.770> chain<00:00:37.950> from<00:00:37.980> hook<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.670> remember<00:00:39.059> don't

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
second chain from hook so remember don't

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.000 
second chain from hook so remember don't
count<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.050> loop<00:00:40.290> that's<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.710> your<00:00:40.829> hook

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
count to this loop that's on your hook

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.639 
count to this loop that's on your hook
that<00:00:41.190> does<00:00:41.399> not<00:00:41.550> count<00:00:41.790> as<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.000> chain<00:00:42.440> that's<00:00:43.440> my

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
that does not count as a chain that's my

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.830 
that does not count as a chain that's my
first<00:00:44.280> chain<00:00:44.550> from<00:00:44.760> hook<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.239> here's<00:00:45.660> my

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
first chain from hook and here's my

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.720 
first chain from hook and here's my
second<00:00:46.350> chain<00:00:46.530> from<00:00:46.559> hook<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.190> I'm<00:00:47.370> gonna<00:00:47.550> work

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
second chain from hook so I'm gonna work

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.180 
second chain from hook so I'm gonna work
one<00:00:48.000> SC<00:00:49.190> right<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.969> chain<00:00:52.100> then<00:00:53.100> I'm

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
one SC right in that chain then I'm

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.340 
one SC right in that chain then I'm
going<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> chain<00:00:53.760> four<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.600> where<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
going to chain four this is where the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.000 
going to chain four this is where the
pattern<00:00:55.800> repeat<00:00:56.160> begins<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.789> chain<00:00:57.120> 4<00:01:01.010> skip

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
pattern repeat begins so chain 4 skip

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.359 
pattern repeat begins so chain 4 skip
next<00:01:02.640> three<00:01:02.969> chain<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.570> then<00:01:04.500> one<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.890> see<00:01:05.100> in

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
next three chain and then one is see in

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.490 
next three chain and then one is see in
next<00:01:05.760> chain<00:01:05.970> setting<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.780> count<00:01:06.990> across<00:01:07.229> here

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
next chain setting to count across here

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.010 
next chain setting to count across here
1<00:01:07.770> 2<00:01:08.100> 3<00:01:08.130> I've<00:01:08.790> skipped<00:01:09.210> those<00:01:09.540> I'm<00:01:09.840> going<00:01:09.930> to

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
1 2 3 I've skipped those I'm going to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.560

put my thumb in the fourth chain that's

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.969 
put my thumb in the fourth chain that's
where<00:01:12.750> I'm<00:01:12.900> gonna<00:01:13.140> work<00:01:13.350> my<00:01:13.650> stitch<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.560> 1<00:01:16.799> SC

my work for the second row and that's
going<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.130> begin<00:02:30.370> with<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.820> chain<00:02:31.120> 5<00:02:36.300> now<00:02:37.300> that

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
going to begin with a chain 5 now that

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.390 
going to begin with a chain 5 now that
chain<00:02:37.720> 5<00:02:37.990> counts<00:02:38.590> as<00:02:38.770> 1<00:02:39.010> double<00:02:39.370> crochet

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.890 
chain 5 counts as 1 double crochet
stitch<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:41.080> chain<00:02:41.380> 3<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:43.270> it's<00:02:43.480> not<00:02:43.630> really

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
stitch and a chain 3 and it's not really

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.230 
stitch and a chain 3 and it's not really
apparent<00:02:44.350> until<00:02:44.650> we<00:02:45.040> come<00:02:45.580> back<00:02:45.760> around<00:02:45.940> and

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
apparent until we come back around and

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.990 
apparent until we come back around and
get<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.540> end<00:02:46.630> of<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.810> next<00:02:47.020> row<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:48.000> let's

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
get to the end of the next row so let's

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.580 
get to the end of the next row so let's
not<00:02:49.120> worry<00:02:49.270> about<00:02:49.360> that<00:02:49.660> for<00:02:49.720> now<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:50.560> just

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
not worry about that for now you just

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.420 
not worry about that for now you just
leave<00:02:51.280> our<00:02:51.460> chain<00:02:51.670> 5<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.240> then<00:02:53.080> 1<00:02:53.560> SC<00:02:53.830> in<00:02:54.310> the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
leave our chain 5 and then 1 SC in the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.940 
leave our chain 5 and then 1 SC in the
first<00:02:54.790> chain<00:02:55.330> 4<00:02:55.720> space<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:56.260> this<00:02:56.380> is<00:02:56.530> my<00:02:56.680> first

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
first chain 4 space so this is my first

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.370 
first chain 4 space so this is my first
chain<00:02:57.160> 4<00:02:57.430> space<00:02:57.550> and<00:02:58.270> I'm<00:02:58.930> going<00:02:59.050> to<00:02:59.080> work<00:02:59.230> in

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
chain 4 space and I'm going to work in

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.970 
chain 4 space and I'm going to work in
SC<00:02:59.709> I'm<00:02:59.950> just<00:03:00.130> gonna<00:03:00.220> insert<00:03:00.760> my<00:03:00.820> hook<00:03:00.970> right

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
SC I'm just gonna insert my hook right

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.740 
SC I'm just gonna insert my hook right
under<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.160> chain<00:03:03.430> 4<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:04.000> it's<00:03:04.120> just<00:03:04.270> this<00:03:04.420> big

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
under that chain 4 so it's just this big

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.270 
under that chain 4 so it's just this big
space<00:03:05.200> here<00:03:05.230> we're<00:03:05.620> not<00:03:05.740> working<00:03:05.890> into<00:03:06.250> the

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
space here we're not working into the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.550 
space here we're not working into the
chain<00:03:06.640> we're<00:03:07.240> working<00:03:07.510> into<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.720> chain<00:03:08.050> of<00:03:08.290> 4

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
chain we're working into the chain of 4

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.750 
chain we're working into the chain of 4
space<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:10.720> I've<00:03:10.900> worked<00:03:11.080> one<00:03:11.560> SC<00:03:12.070> there<00:03:12.459> and

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
space so I've worked one SC there and

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.110 
space so I've worked one SC there and
now<00:03:13.480> my<00:03:13.690> repeat<00:03:14.230> begins<00:03:14.890> it's<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.670> chain<00:03:16.000> 4<00:03:18.120> just

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
now my repeat begins it's a chain 4 just

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.580 
now my repeat begins it's a chain 4 just
as<00:03:19.300> before

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
as before

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.580 
as before
and<00:03:20.709> then<00:03:21.280> wanna<00:03:21.580> see<00:03:21.940> in<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.240> next<00:03:22.540> chain<00:03:23.050> 4

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
and then wanna see in the next chain 4

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.510 
and then wanna see in the next chain 4
space<00:03:24.090> I'm<00:03:25.090> skipping<00:03:25.390> over<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.780> this<00:03:25.959> space

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
space I'm skipping over to this space

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:39.620 
space I'm skipping over to this space
and<00:03:27.520> working<00:03:27.940> in<00:03:28.240> one<00:03:28.480> SC<00:03:33.240> she<00:03:34.240> in<00:03:34.360> for<00:03:37.680> one<00:03:38.680> SC

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
and working in one SC she in for one SC

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.309 
and working in one SC she in for one SC
in<00:03:40.630> next<00:03:40.840> chain<00:03:41.440> 4<00:03:41.770> space<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.900> it's<00:03:44.020> really

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
in next chain 4 space so it's really

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.370 
in next chain 4 space so it's really
quite<00:03:44.680> quick<00:03:45.040> because<00:03:45.370> we're<00:03:45.550> just<00:03:45.580> making

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
quite quick because we're just making

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.420 
quite quick because we're just making
chains<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:48.060> then<00:03:49.060> working<00:03:49.330> into<00:03:50.040> these<00:03:51.040> chain

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
chains and then working into these chain

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.220 
chains and then working into these chain
spaces<00:03:51.880> such<00:03:52.360> as<00:03:52.390> much<00:03:52.720> easier<00:03:53.080> than

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
spaces such as much easier than

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.960 
spaces such as much easier than
inserting<00:03:53.739> your<00:03:53.830> hook<00:03:54.120> into<00:03:55.120> a<00:03:55.330> stitch<00:03:55.720> so<00:03:56.970> I'm

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
inserting your hook into a stitch so I'm

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.240 
inserting your hook into a stitch so I'm
repeating<00:03:58.330> that<00:03:58.660> to<00:03:59.200> my<00:03:59.410> last<00:03:59.709> SC<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:02.769> last<00:04:03.010> SC

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
repeating that to my last SC and last SC

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.280 
repeating that to my last SC and last SC
is<00:04:03.519> over<00:04:03.760> here<00:04:03.970> I'm<00:04:04.269> gonna<00:04:04.480> chain<00:04:04.810> 3<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:08.140> then

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
is over here I'm gonna chain 3 and then

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.729 
is over here I'm gonna chain 3 and then
I'm<00:04:08.410> gonna<00:04:08.500> work<00:04:08.769> a<00:04:09.010> double<00:04:09.340> crochet<00:04:09.489> in<00:04:10.739> that

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
I'm gonna work a double crochet in that

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.979 
I'm gonna work a double crochet in that
last<00:04:12.400> stitch<00:04:13.120> let<00:04:13.390> me<00:04:13.480> make<00:04:13.600> sure<00:04:13.630> I'm<00:04:13.870> getting

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
last stitch let me make sure I'm getting

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.270 
last stitch let me make sure I'm getting
in<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.230> right<00:04:14.350> place<00:04:14.590> sometimes<00:04:14.980> I<00:04:15.069> like<00:04:15.250> to

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
in the right place sometimes I like to

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.210 
in the right place sometimes I like to
flip<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.730> work<00:04:15.910> and<00:04:16.120> look<00:04:16.959> at<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.769> front<00:04:17.979> of

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
flip the work and look at the front of

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.590 
flip the work and look at the front of
the<00:04:18.280> stitch<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.609> find<00:04:18.820> it<00:04:18.910> easier<00:04:19.209> to<00:04:19.359> recognize

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
the stitch I find it easier to recognize

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.060 
the stitch I find it easier to recognize
than<00:04:20.169> when<00:04:20.290> you're<00:04:20.410> looking<00:04:20.590> at<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.799> back<00:04:21.040> of

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
than when you're looking at the back of

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.750 
than when you're looking at the back of
the<00:04:21.459> stitch<00:04:21.639> so<00:04:22.360> this<00:04:22.389> is<00:04:22.870> where<00:04:23.080> I'm<00:04:23.320> working

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
the stitch so this is where I'm working

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.400 
the stitch so this is where I'm working
my<00:04:24.760> last<00:04:24.790> stitch<00:04:25.300> which<00:04:25.540> is<00:04:25.570> a<00:04:25.690> double<00:04:25.960> crochet

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
my last stitch which is a double crochet

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.130 
my last stitch which is a double crochet
so<00:04:26.470> first<00:04:26.950> I<00:04:27.070> need<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.250> yarn<00:04:27.610> over<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:28.060> hook

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
so first I need to yarn over the hook

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.920 
so first I need to yarn over the hook
before<00:04:29.140> inserting<00:04:29.830> into<00:04:30.220> my<00:04:30.820> stitch<00:04:31.090> drop<00:04:31.900> a

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
before inserting into my stitch drop a

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.290 
before inserting into my stitch drop a
loop<00:04:32.229> yarn<00:04:33.160> over<00:04:33.490> hook<00:04:33.520> draw<00:04:33.820> through<00:04:34.030> two

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
loop yarn over hook draw through two

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.060 
loop yarn over hook draw through two
loops<00:04:34.450> on<00:04:34.690> hook<00:04:34.720> yarn<00:04:35.080> over<00:04:35.260> hook<00:04:35.410> draw

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
loops on hook yarn over hook draw

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.000 
loops on hook yarn over hook draw
through<00:04:36.340> two<00:04:37.120> loops<00:04:37.240> on<00:04:37.510> hook<00:04:37.710> so<00:04:38.710> that's<00:04:38.860> like

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
through two loops on hook so that's like

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.150 
through two loops on hook so that's like
double<00:04:39.190> crochet<00:04:39.640> and<00:04:39.850> that's<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.390> end<00:04:40.600> of<00:04:41.160> my

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
double crochet and that's the end of my

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.540 
double crochet and that's the end of my
row<00:04:42.430> -<00:04:43.050> so<00:04:44.050> we<00:04:44.169> just<00:04:44.320> have<00:04:44.500> one<00:04:45.070> more<00:04:45.250> row<00:04:45.490> to

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
row - so we just have one more row to

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.130 
row - so we just have one more row to
work<00:04:46.650> for<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.740> pattern<00:04:48.070> to<00:04:48.220> repeat<00:04:48.700> so<00:04:49.140> the

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
work for the pattern to repeat so the

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.260 
work for the pattern to repeat so the
last<00:04:50.350> two<00:04:50.740> rows<00:04:50.950> are<00:04:51.550> going<00:04:51.580> to<00:04:51.789> form<00:04:52.060> our

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
last two rows are going to form our

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.529 
last two rows are going to form our
pattern<00:04:52.690> so<00:04:53.470> this<00:04:53.710> is<00:04:53.979> the<00:04:54.490> third<00:04:54.970> row<00:04:55.270> I'm

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
pattern so this is the third row I'm

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.219 
pattern so this is the third row I'm
gonna<00:04:55.690> begin<00:04:55.870> with<00:04:55.990> a<00:04:56.140> chain<00:04:56.470> one<00:04:56.500> now<00:04:58.229> I'm

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
gonna begin with a chain one now I'm

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.659 
gonna begin with a chain one now I'm
just<00:04:59.440> work<00:04:59.620> that<00:04:59.770> chain<00:05:00.010> one<00:05:00.160> at<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.340> end<00:05:00.490> of

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
just work that chain one at the end of

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.700 
just work that chain one at the end of
my<00:05:00.820> row<00:05:00.880> it<00:05:01.479> really<00:05:01.750> doesn't<00:05:02.020> matter<00:05:02.110> if<00:05:02.440> you

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
my row it really doesn't matter if you

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.520 
my row it really doesn't matter if you
chain<00:05:03.100> one<00:05:03.130> and<00:05:03.550> then<00:05:03.970> turn<00:05:04.240> or<00:05:04.780> turn<00:05:05.110> and<00:05:05.380> then

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
chain one and then turn or turn and then

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.650 
chain one and then turn or turn and then
chain<00:05:05.800> one<00:05:06.039> it's<00:05:06.310> it's<00:05:06.700> the<00:05:07.120> very<00:05:07.270> same<00:05:07.360> thing

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
chain one it's it's the very same thing

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.140 
chain one it's it's the very same thing
so<00:05:10.660> much<00:05:10.840> for<00:05:11.200> my<00:05:11.289> third<00:05:11.560> row<00:05:11.850> I've<00:05:12.850> got<00:05:13.030> my

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
so much for my third row I've got my

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.060 
so much for my third row I've got my
chain<00:05:13.390> 1<00:05:13.600> turning<00:05:13.870> chain<00:05:13.990> then<00:05:14.530> I'm<00:05:14.650> going<00:05:14.890> to

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
chain 1 turning chain then I'm going to

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:22.920 
chain 1 turning chain then I'm going to
work<00:05:15.370> one<00:05:15.669> SC<00:05:17.490> in<00:05:18.490> the<00:05:18.700> first<00:05:19.000> DC<00:05:21.810> then<00:05:22.810> I'm

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
work one SC in the first DC then I'm

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.820 
work one SC in the first DC then I'm
going<00:05:23.110> to<00:05:23.200> skip<00:05:23.740> this<00:05:24.370> chain<00:05:25.060> 3<00:05:25.419> space<00:05:27.360> and<00:05:28.830> I'm

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
going to skip this chain 3 space and I'm

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.370 
going to skip this chain 3 space and I'm
gonna<00:05:29.950> chain<00:05:30.310> 4

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.100 

and<00:05:35.470> wanna<00:05:36.190> see<00:05:36.310> in<00:05:36.820> the<00:05:37.000> next<00:05:37.300> chain<00:05:37.690> 4<00:05:38.590> space

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
and wanna see in the next chain 4 space

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:48.990 
and wanna see in the next chain 4 space
and<00:05:41.820> that's<00:05:42.820> my<00:05:43.030> repeat<00:05:43.480> of<00:05:43.690> tuning<00:05:44.500> for<00:05:47.070> for<00:05:48.070> 1

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
and that's my repeat of tuning for for 1

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.200 
and that's my repeat of tuning for for 1
SC<00:05:49.180> in<00:05:49.660> next<00:05:49.720> chain<00:05:50.680> at<00:05:50.890> 4<00:05:51.160> space<00:05:51.460> it's<00:05:51.790> just<00:05:52.090> as

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
SC in next chain at 4 space it's just as

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.050 
SC in next chain at 4 space it's just as
before<00:05:52.390> the<00:05:52.870> only<00:05:53.680> difference<00:05:54.070> between<00:05:54.190> our

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
before the only difference between our

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.780 
before the only difference between our
2nd<00:05:55.510> and<00:05:55.600> 3rd<00:05:55.840> row<00:05:56.110> is<00:05:59.010> way<00:06:00.010> we<00:06:00.190> begin<00:06:00.460> and<00:06:00.610> end

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
2nd and 3rd row is way we begin and end

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.780 
2nd and 3rd row is way we begin and end
the<00:06:00.940> rows<00:06:01.120> and<00:06:01.390> that's<00:06:01.570> what<00:06:01.840> creates<00:06:02.260> the

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
the rows and that's what creates the

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.970 
the rows and that's what creates the
staggering<00:06:03.790> of<00:06:04.120> the<00:06:04.330> arches<00:06:07.440> so<00:06:08.440> now<00:06:08.740> I've

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
staggering of the arches so now I've

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.700 
staggering of the arches so now I've
worked<00:06:09.160> into<00:06:09.610> my<00:06:09.790> last<00:06:10.030> chain<00:06:10.420> 4<00:06:10.720> space<00:06:10.900> and

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
worked into my last chain 4 space and

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.150 
worked into my last chain 4 space and
I've<00:06:11.800> got<00:06:11.950> a<00:06:11.980> chain<00:06:12.250> 5<00:06:12.610> space<00:06:12.880> at<00:06:13.240> the<00:06:13.330> end<00:06:13.390> here

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 
I've got a chain 5 space at the end here

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:21.330 
I've got a chain 5 space at the end here
you<00:06:15.160> chain<00:06:15.520> 4<00:06:17.190> and<00:06:18.990> then<00:06:19.990> work<00:06:20.230> one<00:06:20.500> SC<00:06:20.920> in<00:06:21.160> the

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
you chain 4 and then work one SC in the

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.420 
you chain 4 and then work one SC in the
second<00:06:21.850> chain<00:06:22.060> of<00:06:22.360> my<00:06:23.140> chain<00:06:23.470> 5<00:06:23.830> so<00:06:24.130> there's<00:06:24.280> my

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
second chain of my chain 5 so there's my

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.750 
second chain of my chain 5 so there's my
first<00:06:24.460> there's<00:06:25.360> my<00:06:25.510> second<00:06:26.020> chain<00:06:26.760> and

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
first there's my second chain and

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:34.200 
first there's my second chain and
working<00:06:28.180> SC<00:06:29.880> in<00:06:30.880> there<00:06:31.240> and<00:06:32.730> that's<00:06:33.730> the<00:06:34.000> end

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
working SC in there and that's the end

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.560 
working SC in there and that's the end
of<00:06:34.480> the<00:06:35.170> third<00:06:35.500> row<00:06:35.770> and<00:06:36.150> that's<00:06:37.150> all<00:06:37.300> there<00:06:37.450> is

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
of the third row and that's all there is

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.070 
of the third row and that's all there is
to<00:06:37.810> it

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
to it

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.530 
to it
if<00:06:38.680> you<00:06:38.860> repeat<00:06:39.220> the<00:06:39.550> second<00:06:40.000> and<00:06:40.120> third<00:06:40.300> row

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
if you repeat the second and third row

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.420 
if you repeat the second and third row
over<00:06:40.990> and<00:06:41.620> over<00:06:42.420> that's<00:06:43.420> what<00:06:43.660> forms<00:06:43.960> our

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
over and over that's what forms our

00:06:44.430 --> 00:07:00.660 
over and over that's what forms our
arches<00:06:45.430> pattern

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:00.670
