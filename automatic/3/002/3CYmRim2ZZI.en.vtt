00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.709 
one take those and you line those up and
then<00:00:51.410> you<00:00:52.410> attach<00:00:52.710> them<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.670> right<00:00:54.480> now<00:00:54.629> you

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
then you attach them so right now you

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.139 
then you attach them so right now you
have<00:00:54.839> that<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.499> just<00:00:55.620> attach<00:00:56.280> them<00:00:56.609> like

that and then you have that right there

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.930 
that and then you have that right there
so<00:01:01.589> that's<00:01:01.769> why<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.129> cleat<00:01:02.339> that's

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
so that's why it's cleat that's

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.320 
so that's why it's cleat that's
basically<00:01:03.269> it<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.839> the<00:01:04.100> Hornet<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.309> then<00:01:05.610> you
