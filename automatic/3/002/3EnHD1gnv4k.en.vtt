00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.009
 charly geek and today I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.189
 about how to take care of your comics 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.189
 efficient and economic way let's start 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.600
 or that we all have as good those who 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.710
 they are watching this video well not all 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.680
 because someone may have given 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.060
 click for accident good the case too 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.770
 this video is because they want to keep 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:46.820
 his comics but not the way I say 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.550
 to this I mean protective things 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.020
 specialized with cartons 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.220
 specialized companies who wish to spend 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.020
 one the note 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.610
 now 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.660
 this is supposed to be the care 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.070
 correct thrombus 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.070
 Take your protective cardboard 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.950
 your comic 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.450
 and you do not put in his voice 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.380
 but these materials are very expensive 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.969
 they must also be put in a box 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.979
 special for comics which has 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:23.500
 it's just a box with the measurements 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.920
 for comics which you get in a 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.259
 fortune but as we are inhabitants of 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.049
 ecatepec and we do not have so much biyuyo to 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.270
 be spending on so many bags good if 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.680
 is that we want to buy the comics that 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.630
 not what 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.610
 so I bring you a tutorial about 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.790
 of how to take care of your comics so 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.240
 efficient and economical the materials that 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.240
 we are going to need 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.759
 things you can get in any 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.049
 Raw materials store in the market 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.049
 in the super whatever 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.990
 diurex that can get a 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.560
 obviously stationery 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.009
 and a box can be from the box that 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:09.989
 it came with 24 packs of eggs or one 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:13.550
 box of the same or whatever but now 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.550
 this is the simple procedure 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.879
 it's even very obvious is your comic 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:27.400
 let's see a small surplus here 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.590
 when the problem simply doubles 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.569
 buy here 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.980
 and end and you have your comic just do not 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.950
 stick with yúnes 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.480
 and then keep in your box because they 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.010
 I will explain the functionality of each 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.920
 thing 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.140
 the bag what it does is to prevent the 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.790
 comic be blonde or double this 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.750
 It's usually a bit stressful for 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.880
 the collectors 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.560
 so with these bags do not worry 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.680
 to see himself in the comic while he puts us 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.970
 environment now the box because the box 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.340
 good comics to fade in the sun 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.540
 be in the sun the ink goes goes away 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.160
 making ugly then in a box the most 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.520
 advisable is to keep us in a box 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.230
 so that comics do not fade 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.790
 now 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.220
 they have to keep them somewhere 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.319
 dark if they do not have a box in 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.840
 a shelf that blocks the light of the 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.700
 windows or in a closet the problem 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.250
 Wherever it's dark 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.030
 the joke is to move them away from the rays of 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:38.540
 Sun also another tip is do not buy your 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.910
 comics in a magazine post because 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.670
 they tend to be hanging apart from that 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.580
 they wrinkle they bend they mistreat 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.790
 the tweezers are exposed to the sun 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.010
 so they become horrible 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.230
 so I recommend you go to a 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.260
 shop specialized in comics 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.770
 here you would take in the state mexico there 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.020
 a he 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.780
 there is a company aragón there is a square 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.720
 center that yes the type is super reserved 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.180
 do not try to make conversation with him and 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.410
 there are others in the center so that's why 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.380
 do not worry they can even get 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.870
 up to the method 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.570
 another thing that I recommend is if they go to 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.720
 buy comics try to buy them from 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.970
 this way I usually say normally 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.740
 because in some stores if they charge for 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.450
 more for having these things but 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.820
 normally they do not charge for having the 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.280
 bag and cardboard that charge the price 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.490
 of cover and simply this already comes 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.920
 included and it's free then if they arrive 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.500
 to see comics that bring the price of 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.500
 cover already if they buy them it's a bargain 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.639
 this usually I use it for comics that 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.400
 I want to keep for example this is 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.830
 signed by the elgar thin dictator 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.009
 by the way it was the comicon was that it was 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.509
 excellent and they are comics that I want 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.300
 keep because we have meaning 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:04.340
 special to me but then what 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.919
 I recommend you is only to get apart 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.660
 12 of these things and good comics 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.479
 that if you want to keep for example 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.639
 this west of spider wars that I got 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.409
 in another store that is here in the center 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.539
 confiscated 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:20.059
 and they are comics that I want to keep in 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.860
 good condition because he bought them with his 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:24.139
 sachet and cardboard or edges I bought a 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.930
 sachet and cardboard apart 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.939
