 full headset that found the topic 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.320
 not so exciting and that was me 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.730
 not the only one if you go into the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.199

 packed so you see how it is 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.759
 looks when it comes in 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.170
 it was all packed additionally in 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.190
 bubble wrap you hold this 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.040
 carton an English-speaking 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.360
 user manual yes that is very good 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.010
 but you do not need it 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.770
 really because the money is quite self 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.520
 explain is go on with one 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.829
 cable set with a battery with a 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.350
 ship shows you later again 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.570
 detail and our little baby 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.850
 next to speakers and it shows up 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.189
 the same very well processed yes that is 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.799
 good a 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.659
 there is nothing to offer the speakers 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.790
 you may see it right here 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.560
 this has a very positive effect on the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.780
 sound quality out just when you are now 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.460
 thinks it is handsfree from the mobile phone 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.259
 it also cramps the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.020
 to hear conversation partners here you can hear 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.430
 really good for the price 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.090
 maybe another quick who unpacks 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.369
 the gadget cost 16 eur 50 in 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.880
 Germany is paid at least 30 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.060
 Euro 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.810
 It was also from Germany already 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.850
 inferior copies probably 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.780
 sent here the gadget is really 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.369
 top battery is perhaps this battery 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.890
 was he comes to you paraded known 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.530
 in a million Nokia phones exemplaren 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.390
 installed that is the bfc the proven 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.210
 quality and should the part but times 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.100
 Give up the ghost for two euros 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.899
 fifty to three fifty euros from china 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.180
 replenishment is no problem at all 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.040
 here this chip not so stupid 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.259
 we're here is just a 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.149
 We can also do our stand 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.840
 put it in and out so you can 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.340
 the part too 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.350
 good for the next party or in the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.390
 next park can transport 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:16.560
 in the bag to this cable too 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.260
 quickly loses a few words and that 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.420
 once we have the usb cable this 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.459
 money is normally loaded via usb 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.620
 here is the input usb 5 volt yes how 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.690
 you always want to load it on 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.920
 notebook on the power supply on the computer that is 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.299
 no problem and here that 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.620
 jack cable that means if you now 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.650
 not want the bluetooth function 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.209
 but it just so s.Kunstigt to clamp 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.959
 would like to notebook or wherever 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.040
 that is not a problem 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.989
 the shipping time was at 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.269
 record breaking 15 days that is 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.920
 especially in the winter time very fast 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.510
 So I was once again positive 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.700
 surprised that the part about the 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.329
 half the world is hiking well 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.230
 I'll show you a little bit more 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.959
 There is nothing to complain about 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.760
 the part looks very chic 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.590
 Now I want to show you how to do it 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.150
 I can have these special beads 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.880
 an iphone gossip me an iphone 3gs 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.760
 taken an iphone because we 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.940
 everybody knows that the iphones are not 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.579
 just so the devices friendliest 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.980
 Phones are sometimes turned off 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.739
 quite like to cross 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.930
 I turn on the speaker it flashes 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.959
 a little bit I'm doing my cellphone 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.440
 the bluetooth function pressed on here 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.590
 on the play button now should the led 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.489
 blue-red alternate flashing and we 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:46.590
 Hopefully here is the device and 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.880
 Although it is that 258 I press 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.590
 easy to connect 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.090
 that lasts a bit now 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.090
 this pairing story and we see 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.730
 Already connected to some phones 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.019
 you still have the pin code 000 000 so 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.630
 four times the zero to take the so 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.180
 the standard combination because you 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.739
 standard combinations is it is here 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.410
 in this iphone model for example 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.950
 no longer necessary so press now 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.180
 music and maybe you have the icon 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.650
 never seen that means we are 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.640
 now connected to a bluetooth 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.110
 speakers and we can do it 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.600
 just times 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:23.090
 play press and I hope you hear yes 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.240
 So the sound quality is powerful 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.900
 better than normal cellphone we can 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.040
 yes, the volume louder 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.290
 that's not a problem at all 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.330
 the range is ten meters 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.720
 I've now tested by air 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.120
 two walls so two rooms was further 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.440
 no problem at all there you can 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.340
 Do not complain at all that is 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.910
 You can also join the party 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.630
 to take 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.090
 his buddy fast song pretend that 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.169
 No problem at all is so natural 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.419
 I also want you all the time 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.730
 call acceptance introduce calls 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.230
 I am using this phone now 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.470
 It takes a bit of music to go 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.750
 from we see christian goes 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.520
 we can accept here or here 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.240
 Just give it to the cell phone 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.480
 myself and hopefully you can 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.050
 I can hear now hear me 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.280
 you can 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.280
 we can now also here 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.100
 volume is louder and quieter 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.050
 that is no problem at all here 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.390
 Let's do the audio source again 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.940
 see speaker iphone we do here 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:29.720
 again we hear now have to 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.160
 really really good so i think that 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.880
 should show the preservation of the small theater 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.500
 on 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.260
 now I understand myself here twice and 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.930
 Three times that means I do again 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.880
 end expressions and designed yes the 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.340
 music play straight on is 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.660
 really really great for just 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.060
 the people maybe more now 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.460
 Phoning and keyword is easy 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.870
 handsfree I then finish on the 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.760
 keyboard and can continue 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.610
 be able to work it is also something 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:06:00.370
 make yes song on 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:02.900
 this is really a nice thing 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:07.969
 we can not go on here again 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:10.039
 it must be smart now I am alright 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:13.129
 click times that I'm playing now, too 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:15.979
 a little bit through the menu and me 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:17.360
 hope that is enough as an impression 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:19.129
 of course you have to ask here wrong 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.389
 Ball has me in the comments that 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.949
 is not a problem I have the part 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:24.710
 now really enough several 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:26.210
 hours yes I can do it 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.889
 unreservedly recommend in the 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.840
 I also see similar comments 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:32.330
 comments so if you are interested 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.520
 Buzz gadget beat at the price 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.389
 is really good against what we do 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.389
 see us at the next test
