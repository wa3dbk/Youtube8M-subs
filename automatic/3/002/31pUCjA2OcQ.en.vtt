00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
really steady so I don't think the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.480 
really steady so I don't think the
camera<00:01:13.170> will<00:01:13.290> focus<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> little<00:01:14.369> bit

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
camera will focus it's a little bit

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.039 
camera will focus it's a little bit
difficult<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.939> keep<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.270> steady<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:15.750> anyway

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
difficult to keep that steady but anyway

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.840 
difficult to keep that steady but anyway
we're<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.799> training<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.130> 6k<00:01:17.520> today

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
in hook let's see here what we will find

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.080 
in hook let's see here what we will find
so<00:03:37.830> we<00:03:37.890> find<00:03:38.100> one<00:03:38.280> there<00:03:38.400> for<00:03:38.580> two<00:03:38.700> point<00:03:38.910> seven

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
so we find one there for two point seven

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.390 
so we find one there for two point seven
cases<00:03:39.390> cheapest<00:03:39.780> just<00:03:40.200> won<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.470> Super<00:03:40.500> 4.6<00:03:41.250> k

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
cases cheapest just won the Super 4.6 k

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.790 
cases cheapest just won the Super 4.6 k
so<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:41.970> next<00:03:42.030> cheapest<00:03:42.360> is<00:03:42.450> 2.7<00:03:43.080> k<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.709> we'll
