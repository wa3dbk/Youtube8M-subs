delay<00:02:00.850> unlike<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.270> Magnum<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.680> mp4<00:02:03.160> 12

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.330 
delay unlike the Magnum and the mp4 12
but<00:02:04.330> it<00:02:04.450> doesn't<00:02:04.600> have<00:02:04.720> not<00:02:05.230> nearly<00:02:05.950> as<00:02:06.100> much

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
but it doesn't have not nearly as much

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.440 
but it doesn't have not nearly as much
recoil<00:02:06.850> as<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.420> as<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:09.160> what's<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:09.670> called<00:02:09.729> SW

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
40 the SW 40 has an insane amount of

40 the SW 40 has an insane amount of
side-to-side<00:02:14.320> recoil<00:02:14.800> making<00:02:15.460> it<00:02:15.550> possible

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
side-to-side recoil making it possible

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.780 
side-to-side recoil making it possible
to<00:02:16.060> hit<00:02:16.240> your<00:02:16.360> targets<00:02:16.780> consistently<00:02:17.470> but

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
to hit your targets consistently but

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.100 
to hit your targets consistently but
this<00:02:18.790> ones<00:02:19.000> are<00:02:19.150> good<00:02:19.300> in<00:02:19.570> both<00:02:19.780> close

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
this ones are good in both close

this ones are good in both close

snipers<00:02:22.780> in<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:23.050> Magnum<00:02:23.410> but<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:24.370> can

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
snipers in the Magnum but you can

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.920 
snipers in the Magnum but you can
definitely<00:02:24.700> get<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.060> job<00:02:25.240> done<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.510> long-range

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
definitely get the job done a long-range

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.780 
definitely get the job done a long-range
it<00:02:28.930> has<00:02:29.260> one<00:02:29.530> of<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.740> coolest<00:02:30.070> reloads<00:02:30.640> I

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
it has one of the coolest reloads I

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.790 
it has one of the coolest reloads I
think<00:02:31.150> out<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.420> all<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:32.080> roles<00:02:32.320> I've<00:02:32.560> ever

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
think out of all the roles I've ever

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.490 
think out of all the roles I've ever
seen<00:02:33.130> but<00:02:34.000> if<00:02:34.270> that<00:02:34.570> plays<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.810> factor<00:02:35.110> at<00:02:35.410> all

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
seen but if that plays a factor at all

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.640 
seen but if that plays a factor at all
into<00:02:35.860> your<00:02:36.010> gun<00:02:36.880> um<00:02:37.110> some<00:02:38.110> attachments<00:02:38.590> i

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
into your gun um some attachments i

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.100 
into your gun um some attachments i
would<00:02:38.800> use<00:02:38.920> with<00:02:39.130> this<00:02:39.250> is<00:02:39.520> just<00:02:39.820> plain

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
would use with this is just plain

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.190 
would use with this is just plain
nothing<00:02:41.110> really<00:02:41.500> i<00:02:41.830> mean<00:02:41.950> i<00:02:42.870> don't<00:02:43.870> i<00:02:44.020> think

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
nothing really i mean i don't i think

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.040 
nothing really i mean i don't i think
it's<00:02:44.350> great<00:02:44.530> as<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:44.770> sniper<00:02:45.070> i<00:02:46.050> wouldn't

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
it's great as a sniper i wouldn't

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.650 
it's great as a sniper i wouldn't
recommend<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.920> muzzle<00:02:48.700> brake<00:02:48.880> or<00:02:49.090> compensator

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
recommend a muzzle brake or compensator

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.030 
recommend a muzzle brake or compensator
because<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:49.989> doesn't<00:02:50.230> have<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.350> much<00:02:50.590> recoil

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
because it doesn't have that much recoil

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.290 
because it doesn't have that much recoil
it's<00:02:51.340> just<00:02:51.520> visual<00:02:52.260> i<00:02:53.489> tried<00:02:54.489> out<00:02:54.670> some<00:02:54.700> of<00:02:55.120> the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
it's just visual i tried out some of the

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.180 
it's just visual i tried out some of the
other<00:02:55.540> scope<00:02:55.930> like<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.530> ghost<00:02:57.370> ring<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.450> the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
other scope like the ghost ring and the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.790 
other scope like the ghost ring and the
mini<00:03:00.190> reflex<00:03:00.700> but<00:03:01.090> it<00:03:01.360> just<00:03:01.570> it<00:03:01.900> felt<00:03:02.440> so<00:03:02.769> weird

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
mini reflex but it just it felt so weird

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.820 
mini reflex but it just it felt so weird
on<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.310> revolver<00:03:03.910> I'm<00:03:04.030> Perea<00:03:04.420> I'm<00:03:05.290> using<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.620> hand

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
on a revolver I'm Perea I'm using a hand

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.479 
on a revolver I'm Perea I'm using a hand
cannon<00:03:06.269> then<00:03:07.269> I<00:03:07.300> just<00:03:07.540> like<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:08.250> just<00:03:09.250> like<00:03:09.400> to

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
cannon then I just like to just like to

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.710 
cannon then I just like to just like to
use<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.700> iron<00:03:09.910> sighs<00:03:10.060> because<00:03:10.209> it<00:03:10.360> feels<00:03:10.510> so

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
use the iron sighs because it feels so

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.900 
use the iron sighs because it feels so
much<00:03:10.870> more<00:03:10.930> realistic<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.310> don't<00:03:12.850> know

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
much more realistic and I don't know

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.020 
much more realistic and I don't know
it's<00:03:13.120> just<00:03:13.209> it's<00:03:14.190> if<00:03:15.190> you<00:03:15.340> want<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.550> more<00:03:15.760> clear

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
it's just it's if you want to more clear

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.810 
it's just it's if you want to more clear
and<00:03:16.239> tactical<00:03:16.720> site<00:03:16.900> then<00:03:17.110> I<00:03:17.580> would<00:03:18.580> recommend

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
and tactical site then I would recommend

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.430 
and tactical site then I would recommend
that<00:03:19.300> but<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:21.610> SW<00:03:22.000> unica<00:03:22.750> 6<00:03:22.930> I<00:03:23.170> wouldn't

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
that but the SW unica 6 I wouldn't

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.920 
that but the SW unica 6 I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:23.800> getting<00:03:24.160> an<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.390> close<00:03:25.630> quarters

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
recommend getting an to close quarters

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.410 
recommend getting an to close quarters
but<00:03:26.380> you<00:03:26.680> can<00:03:26.860> definitely<00:03:27.160> deal<00:03:27.820> in<00:03:27.970> medium

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
but you can definitely deal in medium

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.740 
but you can definitely deal in medium
range<00:03:28.720> I<00:03:28.930> think<00:03:29.110> that's<00:03:29.320> the<00:03:29.470> best<00:03:29.830> one<00:03:30.040> on<00:03:30.760> to

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
range I think that's the best one on to

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.740 
range I think that's the best one on to
the<00:03:31.840> desert<00:03:32.110> eagle<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:33.370> desert<00:03:33.670> eagle<00:03:33.820> is

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
the desert eagle the desert eagle is

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.330 
the desert eagle the desert eagle is

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
about a hundred kills in each gun but I

about a hundred kills in each gun but I
really<00:03:49.209> really<00:03:49.900> like<00:03:50.079> the<00:03:50.230> desert<00:03:50.500> eagle

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
really really like the desert eagle

really really like the desert eagle
first<00:03:51.280> off<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:52.060> look<00:03:52.269> of<00:03:52.420> it<00:03:52.570> is

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
first off the look of it is

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.250 
first off the look of it is
incredible<00:03:53.939> it's<00:03:54.060> probably<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.079> coolest

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
incredible it's probably the coolest

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.489 
incredible it's probably the coolest
looking<00:03:55.530> gun<00:03:55.890> in<00:03:56.159> all<00:03:56.459> of<00:03:56.840> for<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.049> moment<00:03:58.230> in

looking gun in all of for the moment in

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:02.809 
looking gun in all of for the moment in
my<00:03:58.709> opinion<00:03:58.980> but<00:04:00.019> I<00:04:01.310> didn't<00:04:02.310> like<00:04:02.459> with<00:04:02.670> any

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
my opinion but I didn't like with any

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.640 
my opinion but I didn't like with any
cameras<00:04:03.239> which<00:04:03.389> was<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.569> weird<00:04:03.810> side<00:04:04.109> note<00:04:04.319> but

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
cameras which was a weird side note but

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.119 
cameras which was a weird side note but

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
of it it was it might look good in gold

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.289 
of it it was it might look good in gold
but<00:04:10.500> i<00:04:10.680> haven't<00:04:11.010> had<00:04:11.129> it<00:04:11.280> yeah<00:04:14.030> the<00:04:15.030> desert

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299

eagle<00:04:15.389> is<00:04:15.750> not<00:04:16.410> very<00:04:16.919> good<00:04:16.979> at<00:04:17.220> long<00:04:17.579> range

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
eagle is not very good at long range

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.449 
eagle is not very good at long range
just<00:04:18.389> because<00:04:18.630> it<00:04:18.720> doesn't<00:04:18.959> have<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.079> good

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
just because it doesn't have a good

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.820 
just because it doesn't have a good
accuracy<00:04:20.539> the<00:04:21.539> iron<00:04:21.810> sights<00:04:21.989> i<00:04:22.199> really<00:04:22.650> like

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
accuracy the iron sights i really like

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.830 
accuracy the iron sights i really like
maybe<00:04:23.699> that's<00:04:23.940> just<00:04:24.090> because<00:04:24.240> it<00:04:24.570> isn't

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
maybe that's just because it isn't

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.120 
maybe that's just because it isn't
histology<00:04:25.349> from<00:04:25.800> God<00:04:26.789> for<00:04:27.120> whatever<00:04:27.449> but<00:04:27.810> i

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
histology from God for whatever but i

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.980 
histology from God for whatever but i
don't<00:04:29.130> know<00:04:29.220> i<00:04:29.460> would<00:04:30.470> recommend<00:04:31.470> using<00:04:32.130> some

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
don't know i would recommend using some

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.420 
don't know i would recommend using some
what's<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.080> called<00:04:34.289> a<00:04:34.590> muzzle<00:04:35.220> breaker

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
what's it called a muzzle breaker

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.879 
what's it called a muzzle breaker
compensator<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.389> reduce<00:04:36.840> that<00:04:37.050> Rico<00:04:37.440> just

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
compensator to reduce that Rico just

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.749 
compensator to reduce that Rico just
because<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:40.650> desert<00:04:41.220> eagle<00:04:41.310> isn't

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
because the the desert eagle isn't

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.249 
because the the desert eagle isn't
really<00:04:41.940> made<00:04:42.150> for<00:04:42.389> long<00:04:42.570> range<00:04:42.810> all<00:04:43.080> that<00:04:43.199> you

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
really made for long range all that you

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.010 
really made for long range all that you
can<00:04:43.530> do<00:04:43.770> it<00:04:43.919> it's<00:04:44.820> more<00:04:44.970> made<00:04:45.389> for<00:04:45.720> close

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
can do it it's more made for close

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.620 
can do it it's more made for close
quarters<00:04:46.259> because<00:04:46.620> it<00:04:47.310> has<00:04:47.490> 300<00:04:48.150> rounds<00:04:48.509> per

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
quarters because it has 300 rounds per

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.839 
quarters because it has 300 rounds per
minute<00:04:48.810> instead<00:04:49.199> of<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.560> I<00:04:50.130> think<00:04:50.580> it<00:04:50.669> was<00:04:50.759> the

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
minute instead of the I think it was the

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.960 
minute instead of the I think it was the
280<00:04:51.360> on<00:04:51.660> the<00:04:51.960> unica<00:04:52.680> 6<00:04:52.889> it<00:04:53.220> isn't<00:04:53.490> publicly

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
280 on the unica 6 it isn't publicly

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.050 
280 on the unica 6 it isn't publicly
announced<00:04:54.449> yet<00:04:54.630> but<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:56.430> deagle<00:04:56.880> is

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
announced yet but the deagle is

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.050 
announced yet but the deagle is
incredibly<00:04:57.960> fast<00:04:58.229> firing<00:04:58.729> also<00:04:59.729> new<00:04:59.880> trigger

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
incredibly fast firing also new trigger

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.550 
incredibly fast firing also new trigger

this<00:05:09.509> one<00:05:09.750> again<00:05:09.990> I'm<00:05:10.530> not<00:05:10.560> a<00:05:10.800> fan<00:05:11.130> of<00:05:11.159> using

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
this one again I'm not a fan of using

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.749 
this one again I'm not a fan of using
the<00:05:11.880> ghost<00:05:12.690> ring<00:05:13.020> or<00:05:13.320> the<00:05:13.380> reflex<00:05:14.280> or<00:05:14.550> the

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
the ghost ring or the reflex or the

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:22.010 
the ghost ring or the reflex or the
Delta<00:05:15.150> it<00:05:15.330> just<00:05:15.599> feels<00:05:15.900> so<00:05:16.550> not<00:05:17.550> a<00:05:17.580> place<00:05:20.449> but<00:05:21.449> I

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
Delta it just feels so not a place but I

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.980 
Delta it just feels so not a place but I
wouldn't<00:05:22.470> really<00:05:22.620> recommend<00:05:22.740> hip<00:05:23.400> firing<00:05:23.990> the

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
wouldn't really recommend hip firing the

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.350 
wouldn't really recommend hip firing the
desert<00:05:25.680> you<00:05:25.770> I<00:05:25.919> would<00:05:26.250> would<00:05:26.759> recommend<00:05:27.210> hip

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
desert you I would would recommend hip

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.779 
desert you I would would recommend hip
firing<00:05:27.599> if<00:05:27.870> you're<00:05:28.440> using<00:05:28.590> the<00:05:28.800> unit<00:05:29.099> 6<00:05:29.400> but

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
firing if you're using the unit 6 but

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.540 
firing if you're using the unit 6 but
even<00:05:30.360> though<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.900> desert<00:05:31.680> eagle<00:05:31.770> looks<00:05:32.250> like

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
even though the desert eagle looks like

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.129 
even though the desert eagle looks like
it's<00:05:32.729> on<00:05:32.849> par<00:05:33.120> I<00:05:33.389> think<00:05:33.780> I've<00:05:33.930> gotten<00:05:34.349> a<00:05:34.729> a<00:05:36.139> one

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:37.139 
it's on par I think I've gotten a a one

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.200 
it's on par I think I've gotten a a one
out<00:05:37.440> of<00:05:37.979> the<00:05:38.310> hundred<00:05:38.610> kills<00:05:38.820> I<00:05:38.940> think<00:05:39.120> I've

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
out of the hundred kills I think I've

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.930 
out of the hundred kills I think I've
gotten<00:05:39.539> about<00:05:39.870> five<00:05:40.289> successful<00:05:40.919> hipshot<00:05:41.460> hip

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
gotten about five successful hipshot hip

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.200 
gotten about five successful hipshot hip
fire<00:05:42.210> shots<00:05:42.509> and<00:05:42.840> I've<00:05:42.930> get<00:05:43.289> fired<00:05:43.530> a<00:05:43.740> lot<00:05:44.210> I

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
fire shots and I've get fired a lot I

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.240 
fire shots and I've get fired a lot I
wouldn't<00:05:45.719> recommend<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.229> laser<00:05:46.409> sight<00:05:46.680> just

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
wouldn't recommend the laser sight just

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.779 
wouldn't recommend the laser sight just
because<00:05:47.789> it<00:05:48.330> just<00:05:48.780> gives<00:05:49.050> you<00:05:49.199> a<00:05:49.229> false<00:05:49.590> sense

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
because it just gives you a false sense

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:53.930 
because it just gives you a false sense
a<00:05:50.789> hip<00:05:51.659> fire<00:05:51.900> even<00:05:52.169> though<00:05:52.440> if<00:05:53.099> you<00:05:53.490> take<00:05:53.699> one

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
a hip fire even though if you take one

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.020 
a hip fire even though if you take one
shot<00:05:54.210> it<00:05:54.479> goes<00:05:55.039> after<00:05:56.039> one<00:05:56.250> shot<00:05:56.490> hip<00:05:56.789> firing

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
shot it goes after one shot hip firing

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.029 
shot it goes after one shot hip firing
you<00:05:57.330> just<00:05:57.360> kind<00:05:57.719> of<00:05:57.780> screwed<00:05:58.110> you<00:05:58.650> just<00:05:58.889> need

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
you just kind of screwed you just need

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
is just aimed out sites and shoot very

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.760 
is just aimed out sites and shoot very
quickly<00:06:08.509> kind<00:06:08.870> of<00:06:08.930> like<00:06:09.050> your<00:06:09.229> quick<00:06:09.470> scope
