00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
thinks I'm rounded in the bristle n

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.330 
thinks I'm rounded in the bristle n
because<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.019> bristle<00:04:08.350> tends<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.829> be<00:04:09.100> more

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
because the bristle tends to be more

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.220 
because the bristle tends to be more
difficult<00:04:09.400> to<00:04:09.790> control<00:04:10.000> okay<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.870> first<00:04:11.079> step

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
difficult to control okay the first step

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.720 
difficult to control okay the first step
is<00:04:11.350> kind<00:04:11.530> of<00:04:11.620> digging<00:04:12.010> in<00:04:12.130> there<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:12.579> just

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
is kind of digging in there and just

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
quickly as I can why is speed such a key

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.520 
quickly as I can why is speed such a key
thing<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:31.390> is<00:04:31.510> key<00:04:31.750> because<00:04:31.900> if<00:04:32.169> you<00:04:32.260> let<00:04:32.410> the

this couch overhears and then the next

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.230 
this couch overhears and then the next
step<00:04:42.570> is<00:04:43.260> to<00:04:43.320> apply<00:04:43.560> icings<00:04:44.520> in<00:04:44.850> the
