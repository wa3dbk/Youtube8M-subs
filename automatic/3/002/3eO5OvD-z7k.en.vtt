today from my buddy down in LA and
basically<00:00:21.740> this<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.070> stompbox<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:24.119> goes

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
basically this is the stompbox this goes

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.189 
basically this is the stompbox this goes
in<00:00:25.230> your<00:00:25.350> pedalboard<00:00:25.820> pretty<00:00:26.820> small

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
in your pedalboard pretty small

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.479 
in your pedalboard pretty small
you<00:00:28.680> just<00:00:28.859> plug<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> AC<00:00:30.060> into<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> wall

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
you just plug in the AC into the wall

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.890 
you just plug in the AC into the wall
take<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> output<00:00:33.739> cable<00:00:34.739> into<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.129> amp<00:00:35.430> and

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
take the output cable into the amp and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.009 
take the output cable into the amp and
then<00:00:37.640> there's<00:00:38.640> two<00:00:38.940> antennas<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:39.720> that<00:00:39.930> he

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
then there's two antennas here that he

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.439 
then there's two antennas here that he
just<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.739> are<00:00:40.860> pretty<00:00:41.010> easy<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.549> snap<00:00:42.239> in

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
just that are pretty easy to snap in

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.439 
just that are pretty easy to snap in
there<00:00:42.600> get<00:00:43.019> those<00:00:43.229> in<00:00:43.589> place<00:00:44.059> and<00:00:45.059> then<00:00:45.180> here

00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:45.449 
there get those in place and then here

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.500 
there get those in place and then here
on<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> transmitter<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.470> goes<00:00:46.979> on<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.510> on

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
on the transmitter that goes on the on

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.340 
on the transmitter that goes on the on
your<00:00:48.570> guitar<00:00:49.440> strap<00:00:49.860> your<00:00:50.129> pocket<00:00:50.519> wherever

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
your guitar strap your pocket wherever

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.410 
your guitar strap your pocket wherever
I've<00:00:52.350> got<00:00:52.589> channel<00:00:53.010> one<00:00:53.190> selected<00:00:53.640> here<00:00:53.879> and

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
I've got channel one selected here and

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.689 
I've got channel one selected here and
then<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.760> guess<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.940> stop<00:00:57.750> box<00:00:58.019> I've<00:00:58.260> got

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
then on I guess the stop box I've got

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.859 
then on I guess the stop box I've got
channel<00:00:59.699> one<00:00:59.820> selector<00:01:00.150> there<00:01:00.330> and<00:01:00.659> that's

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:00.869 
channel one selector there and that's

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:03.579 
channel one selector there and that's
pretty<00:01:01.290> much<00:01:01.409> it<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.949> plug<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.670> and

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
pretty much it you just plug it in and

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.469 
pretty much it you just plug it in and
this<00:01:04.589> thing's<00:01:04.830> pretty<00:01:05.339> much<00:01:05.580> ready<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.850> go<00:01:05.939> so

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
this thing's pretty much ready to go so

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:24.490 
this thing's pretty much ready to go so
here's<00:01:06.840> what<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.229> sounds<00:01:07.590> like

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.710 

pretty<00:01:25.500> cool<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.700> far<00:01:26.730> so<00:01:27.090> good<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.330> can't<00:01:27.390> tell

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
pretty cool so far so good I can't tell

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.110 
pretty cool so far so good I can't tell
any<00:01:27.900> difference<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.410> earlier<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.280> plugged

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
any difference I earlier I plugged

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.600 
any difference I earlier I plugged
directly<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:30.600> app<00:01:30.690> of<00:01:30.810> my<00:01:30.870> cable<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.610> it's

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
directly to the app of my cable and it's

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.490 
directly to the app of my cable and it's
maybe<00:01:32.880> testing<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.780> can't<00:01:34.140> tell<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
maybe testing I can't tell the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.160 
maybe testing I can't tell the
difference<00:01:34.910> so<00:01:35.910> it<00:01:36.330> sounds<00:01:36.720> great

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
difference so it sounds great

00:01:37.170 --> 00:02:04.550

wireless<00:03:10.200> system<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.650> was<00:03:10.740> like<00:03:10.920> recommending

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
wireless system I was like recommending

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.930 
wireless system I was like recommending
these<00:03:11.880> I've<00:03:12.599> also<00:03:12.750> got<00:03:13.050> an<00:03:13.260> ad<00:03:13.500> which<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:14.580> use<00:03:14.790> in

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
these I've also got an ad which I use in

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.690 
these I've also got an ad which I use in
studio<00:03:15.270> which<00:03:15.569> works<00:03:15.930> pretty<00:03:16.080> well<00:03:16.550> the<00:03:17.550> only

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
studio which works pretty well the only

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.540 
studio which works pretty well the only
thing<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:18.420> I<00:03:18.810> kind<00:03:19.080> of<00:03:19.110> watch<00:03:19.260> out<00:03:19.440> for<00:03:19.650> are

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
thing that I kind of watch out for are

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.000 
thing that I kind of watch out for are
is<00:03:20.819> the<00:03:21.030> battery<00:03:21.440> life

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
is the battery life

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.070 
is the battery life
I<00:03:23.040> got<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.640> rechargeable<00:03:24.270> battery<00:03:24.300> in<00:03:24.660> here<00:03:24.930> I

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
I got a rechargeable battery in here I

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.710 
I got a rechargeable battery in here I
just<00:03:25.110> replaced<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.970> lasts<00:03:27.300> about<00:03:27.390> three

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
just replaced it it lasts about three

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.800 
just replaced it it lasts about three
hours<00:03:28.489> there<00:03:29.489> are<00:03:29.520> some<00:03:30.239> batteries<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.569> heard

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
hours there are some batteries I heard

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.340 
hours there are some batteries I heard
about<00:03:31.459> their<00:03:32.459> rechargeable<00:03:33.239> lithium<00:03:34.140> polymer

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
about their rechargeable lithium polymer

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.050 
about their rechargeable lithium polymer
batteries<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.459> think<00:03:35.610> there's<00:03:35.760> only<00:03:35.790> one

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
batteries and I think there's only one

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.210 
batteries and I think there's only one
company<00:03:36.269> that<00:03:36.510> makes<00:03:36.690> those<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.220> supposedly

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
company that makes those and supposedly

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.570 
company that makes those and supposedly
those<00:03:38.489> lasts<00:03:38.790> around<00:03:39.500> five<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.769> six<00:03:41.069> hours<00:03:41.190> so

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
those lasts around five to six hours so

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.490 
those lasts around five to six hours so
that's<00:03:42.569> it

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
that's it

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.009 
that's it
I<00:03:43.910> would<00:03:44.910> highly<00:03:45.150> recommend<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.660> get<00:03:45.780> one<00:03:45.930> of

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
I would highly recommend you get one of

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.170

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
but that's the only kind of bummer

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.930 
but that's the only kind of bummer
and<00:04:04.470> also<00:04:04.769> it's<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.069> straight<00:04:05.310> angle<00:04:05.489> cable

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
and also it's a straight angle cable

and also it's a straight angle cable
that<00:04:06.060> goes<00:04:06.180> into<00:04:06.330> my<00:04:06.450> guitar<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:06.959> play<00:04:07.110> an

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
that goes into my guitar and I play an

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.710 
that goes into my guitar and I play an
SG<00:04:07.530> so<00:04:07.860> I'd<00:04:08.819> rather<00:04:09.030> have<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.360> right<00:04:09.600> angle

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
SG so I'd rather have a right angle

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.910 
SG so I'd rather have a right angle
cable<00:04:10.200> so<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.560> ordered<00:04:11.130> an<00:04:11.910> aftermarket<00:04:12.359> cable

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
cable so I ordered an aftermarket cable

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.199 
cable so I ordered an aftermarket cable
that<00:04:13.920> I<00:04:13.950> should<00:04:14.130> be<00:04:14.250> getting<00:04:14.459> next<00:04:14.609> week<00:04:14.850> and

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
that I should be getting next week and

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.810 
that I should be getting next week and
this<00:04:16.169> one<00:04:16.380> seems<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.100> be<00:04:17.190> about<00:04:17.340> three<00:04:17.669> feet

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
this one seems to be about three feet

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.500 
this one seems to be about three feet
long<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.209> other<00:04:18.329> one's<00:04:18.859> 18<00:04:19.859> inches<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:20.510> that's

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
long the other one's 18 inches so that's

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.750 
long the other one's 18 inches so that's
it<00:04:21.810> for<00:04:21.959> now<00:04:22.109> I<00:04:22.380> hope<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:23.130> enjoyed<00:04:23.520> this
