00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.140
 bags that put them in an area 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.650

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.340
 to the folder in which you have installed 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:48.180

 from the moment of installation 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.520

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:22.880
 they can search up to version 4.3 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.090

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.220

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.920

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.100

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:06.810
