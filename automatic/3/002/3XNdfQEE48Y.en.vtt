00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:11.230
 and then youtube people should only be 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.480
 here I'll make room for you and 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.460
 Today I will compare the mode of 2014 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.340
 against 2015 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.740
 the 4g mode then let's talk about 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.510
 difference between the two is beyond 4g 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.099
 more current 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:31.509
 we have is a greater weight in 4g 155 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:33.510
 grams against 149 grams of the old 11 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.640
 mm thick same hd screen 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.460
 294 perfect and seven per inch ips lcd 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.530
 16 million colors and the same protection 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.239
 core fabric la galaxy 3 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.180
 the two handsets have almost 1,000 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:49.059
 operating system or 4g already attacked already 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.879
 leaves factory with 5.0.1 2 on android 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.100
 lollipop and the old 2014 is already 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.129
 getting this android then who 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.219
 even paired snapdragon 400 processor 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.620
 quad core of 1.2 ghz versus 17 and the delay 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.780
 of five the two has card slot 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.479
 micro sd of up to 32 gigabytes 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.640
 both have 1GB of ram 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.069
 The last one has its versions of 8 16 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.050
 gigabytes I believe the current one has 

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:17.080
 version of 16 gigabytes the two have 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.429
 8 megapixel rear camera and 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.679
 front of 2 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:26.890
 the cuddle the tuf gps radio fm and 2070 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.819
 military personnel in the other and 2,390 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.849
 4g 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:34.750
 I believe that this difference is 

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:39.700
 some better 4g pros in 4g is by 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:42.910
 account the entire amount of battery that the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.289
 4g should consume more if you are used 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.800
 then you have to put a little more 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.000
 battery then the new g1 engine that is 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.539
 with 4g 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.319
 it's coming out of release by 899 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:59.709
 and the other can find $ 650 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:02.229
 real cash on the spot then this is it and 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:04.720
 ticket on motorola website the 54 reais 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.340
 paying cash on the 4g play and get 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.590
 worried about comparatives for 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.430
