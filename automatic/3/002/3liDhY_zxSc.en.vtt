00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:31.559 
it almost looks straight if we lay a

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:33.930 
it almost looks straight if we lay a
pencil<00:00:32.559> or<00:00:32.710> straight<00:00:33.100> edge<00:00:33.280> on<00:00:33.519> it<00:00:33.550> we<00:00:33.790> could

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
pencil or straight edge on it we could

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.460 
pencil or straight edge on it we could

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
view the top view will get a little bit

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.130 
view the top view will get a little bit
more<00:01:40.300> pointy<00:01:40.810> if<00:01:41.260> we<00:01:41.530> look<00:01:41.710> at<00:01:42.750> some<00:01:43.750> gouges

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
more pointy if we look at some gouges

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.270 
more pointy if we look at some gouges
with<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.530> hump<00:01:47.310> it'll<00:01:48.310> look<00:01:48.400> like<00:01:48.580> this<00:01:48.930> okay

that<00:02:12.700> well<00:02:12.849> that<00:02:12.879> point<00:02:13.480> eNOS<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:13.989> going<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.459> be

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
that well that point eNOS is going to be

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.670 
that well that point eNOS is going to be
harder<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.819> control<00:02:16.240> but<00:02:17.020> what's<00:02:17.200> happening

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
harder to control but what's happening

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.230 
harder to control but what's happening
the<00:02:17.860> control<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.810> the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
the control of the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.580 
the control of the
support<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:21.930> going<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.620> be<00:02:24.020> more<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.320> feature

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
support is going to be more of a feature

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.920 
support is going to be more of a feature
of<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:26.490> bevel<00:02:27.360> support<00:02:27.840> from<00:02:28.020> behind<00:02:28.730> not<00:02:29.930> the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
of the bevel support from behind not the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.810 
of the bevel support from behind not the
top<00:02:31.410> edge<00:02:32.070> of<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.480> sharp<00:02:33.810> edge<00:02:34.050> so<00:02:34.890> if<00:02:35.400> we<00:02:35.640> look

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
top edge of the sharp edge so if we look

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.180 
top edge of the sharp edge so if we look
at<00:02:36.000> this<00:02:36.180> from<00:02:36.620> looking<00:02:37.620> right<00:02:37.830> down<00:02:38.010> the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
at this from looking right down the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.960 
at this from looking right down the
flute<00:02:40.760> okay

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
flute okay

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.500 
flute okay
the<00:02:42.450> bevel<00:02:42.810> now<00:02:43.220> or<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.300> flute

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
the bevel now or the the flute

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.750 
the bevel now or the the flute
configuration<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.380> parabola<00:02:46.770> it's<00:02:47.640> a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
configuration is a parabola it's a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.060 
configuration is a parabola it's a
rounded<00:02:48.210> soft<00:02:49.200> arc<00:02:49.560> okay<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:53.000> side<00:02:54.000> angles

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
rounded soft arc okay the side angles

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.850 
rounded soft arc okay the side angles
for<00:02:56.070> some<00:02:56.850> people<00:02:57.210> are<00:02:57.480> fairly<00:03:00.710> straight<00:03:01.710> up

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
for some people are fairly straight up

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.310 
for some people are fairly straight up
and<00:03:02.040> down<00:03:02.330> okay<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:04.610> what<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:05.790> does<00:03:05.970> is<00:03:06.320> take

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
and down okay and what that does is take

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.860 
and down okay and what that does is take
away<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:09.360> radius<00:03:09.810> in<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.110> bottom<00:03:10.470> for<00:03:10.830> the

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
away the radius in the bottom for the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.760 
away the radius in the bottom for the
support<00:03:12.870> mine

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
support mine

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.100 
support mine
I<00:03:13.800> have<00:03:14.730> Chilton<00:03:15.270> in<00:03:15.570> on<00:03:16.430> the<00:03:17.430> side<00:03:17.700> so<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:18.690> my

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
I have Chilton in on the side so that my

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.220 
I have Chilton in on the side so that my
side<00:03:19.410> angles<00:03:19.830> are<00:03:20.700> tilted<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.900> give<00:03:22.050> us

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
side angles are tilted in to to give us

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.710 
side angles are tilted in to to give us
more<00:03:22.410> support<00:03:22.860> back<00:03:23.040> here<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.640> that's<00:03:24.420> where

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
more support back here and that's where

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.600 
more support back here and that's where
we're<00:03:24.840> going<00:03:24.960> to<00:03:24.990> ride<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.320> bevel<00:03:25.470> at<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:26.340> tip

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
we're going to ride the bevel at the tip

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.610 
we're going to ride the bevel at the tip
edge<00:03:26.820> up<00:03:27.090> here<00:03:27.360> where<00:03:27.570> where<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.200> sharp<00:03:28.440> edge

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
edge up here where where the sharp edge

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.830 
edge up here where where the sharp edge
is<00:03:28.800> is<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.220> little<00:03:29.580> bit<00:03:29.700> sharper<00:03:29.910> but<00:03:30.570> I<00:03:30.630> have

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
is is a little bit sharper but I have

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.910 
is is a little bit sharper but I have
more<00:03:31.110> support<00:03:31.530> on<00:03:31.740> the<00:03:31.830> back<00:03:33.470> we<00:03:34.470> look<00:03:34.650> at<00:03:34.770> the

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
more support on the back we look at the

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.260 
more support on the back we look at the
back<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.160> these<00:03:36.590> this<00:03:37.590> is<00:03:37.770> one<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.340> would<00:03:39.240> be

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
back of these this is one that would be

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.480 
back of these this is one that would be
sharpened<00:03:39.810> on<00:03:39.930> normally<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.710> the<00:03:40.980> Wolverine

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
sharpened on normally the the Wolverine

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.030 
sharpened on normally the the Wolverine
directions<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.570> a<00:03:42.960> lot<00:03:43.320> of<00:03:43.440> people<00:03:43.650> use<00:03:43.860> this

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
directions and a lot of people use this

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.820 
directions and a lot of people use this
tool<00:03:44.630> you<00:03:45.630> know<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.930> lot<00:03:46.110> of<00:03:46.230> famous<00:03:46.380> Turner's

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
tool you know a lot of famous Turner's

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.710 
tool you know a lot of famous Turner's
use<00:03:47.010> this<00:03:47.130> kind<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.520> tool<00:03:47.670> but<00:03:48.390> this<00:03:48.540> angle

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
use this kind of a tool but this angle

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.890 
use this kind of a tool but this angle
here<00:03:49.340> is<00:03:50.340> fairly<00:03:50.820> steep<00:03:51.120> straight<00:03:51.600> up<00:03:51.750> and

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
here is fairly steep straight up and

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.590 
here is fairly steep straight up and
down<00:03:51.930> if<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.800> look<00:03:52.980> over<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.250> mine<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:54.270> angle

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
down if you look over a mine the angle

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.560 
down if you look over a mine the angle
is<00:03:54.720> tilted<00:03:55.170> in<00:03:55.610> quite<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.640> bit<00:03:56.850> let<00:03:57.030> me<00:03:57.150> put<00:03:57.420> this

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
is tilted in quite a bit let me put this

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.020 
is tilted in quite a bit let me put this
up<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.890> can<00:03:59.040> see<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.370> from<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.820> end

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
up so that you can see it from the end

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.230 
up so that you can see it from the end
this<00:04:00.840> angle<00:04:01.140> here<00:04:01.320> is<00:04:01.380> tilted<00:04:01.770> in<00:04:01.920> vs.<00:04:02.850> this<00:04:03.030> is

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
this angle here is tilted in vs. this is

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.920 
this angle here is tilted in vs. this is
fairly<00:04:03.840> steep<00:04:04.290> okay<00:04:05.280> so<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:06.330> tilted<00:04:06.780> in

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
fairly steep okay so that tilted in

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.990 
fairly steep okay so that tilted in
angle<00:04:08.090> leave<00:04:09.090> support<00:04:09.660> behind<00:04:09.930> underneath

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
angle leave support behind underneath

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.520 
angle leave support behind underneath
compared<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.120> this<00:04:12.210> support<00:04:12.630> let's<00:04:13.230> look<00:04:13.410> at

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
compared to this support let's look at

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.160 
compared to this support let's look at
directly<00:04:13.980> from<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.280> back<00:04:14.520> again<00:04:15.170> this

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
directly from the back again this

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.830 
directly from the back again this
roundedness<00:04:16.680> right<00:04:17.010> here<00:04:17.430> is<00:04:18.390> going<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.630> help

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
roundedness right here is going to help

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.880 
roundedness right here is going to help
us<00:04:19.549> it's<00:04:20.549> gone<00:04:20.790> here<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.210> it's<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.930> it's<00:04:22.290> more

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
us it's gone here and it's and it's more

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.350 
us it's gone here and it's and it's more
support<00:04:23.280> over<00:04:23.460> here<00:04:23.610> and<00:04:23.730> give<00:04:23.820> us<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:24.030> fat<00:04:24.240> or

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
support over here and give us a fat or

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.750 
support over here and give us a fat or
sweet<00:04:24.570> spot<00:04:24.950> there<00:04:25.950> are<00:04:26.100> really<00:04:26.340> three

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
sweet spot there are really three

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.670 
sweet spot there are really three
configurations<00:04:27.120> of<00:04:27.780> bull<00:04:27.930> gouges<00:04:28.320> out<00:04:28.470> there

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
configurations of bull gouges out there

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.950 
configurations of bull gouges out there
are<00:04:29.160> probably<00:04:29.580> lots<00:04:29.790> of<00:04:30.000> variations<00:04:30.600> of<00:04:30.810> them

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
are probably lots of variations of them

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.879 
are probably lots of variations of them
in<00:04:31.110> between<00:04:31.470> that<00:04:31.680> but<00:04:32.220> basically<00:04:32.730> three

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
in between that but basically three

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.920 
in between that but basically three
there's<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:35.180> David<00:04:35.419> Ellsworth<00:04:35.750> of

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
there's the the David Ellsworth of

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.730 
there's the the David Ellsworth of

a nice rounded bottom to the internal
suit<00:04:43.759> configuration<00:04:44.710> there<00:04:45.710> are<00:04:45.800> some

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
suit configuration there are some

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:51.779 
suit configuration there are some
companies<00:04:46.340> that<00:04:46.729> make<00:04:47.210> a<00:04:47.240> u-shaped<00:04:49.090> okay<00:04:50.090> and

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
companies that make a u-shaped okay and

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.969 
companies that make a u-shaped okay and
that's<00:04:52.789> not<00:04:53.000> is<00:04:53.360> easy<00:04:54.020> to<00:04:54.319> grind<00:04:54.590> in<00:04:54.830> this

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
that's not is easy to grind in this

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.670 
that's not is easy to grind in this
grind<00:04:55.280> and<00:04:55.550> it<00:04:55.669> doesn't<00:04:56.060> do<00:04:56.300> the<00:04:57.169> four<00:04:57.409> cuts

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
grind and it doesn't do the four cuts

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.770 
grind and it doesn't do the four cuts
that<00:04:57.860> we<00:04:57.979> want<00:04:58.190> is<00:04:58.310> easy<00:04:58.520> so<00:04:58.940> I<00:04:59.270> would<00:04:59.569> try<00:04:59.750> to

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
that we want is easy so I would try to

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.180 
that we want is easy so I would try to
stay<00:04:59.930> away<00:05:00.199> from<00:05:00.259> that<00:05:00.500> if<00:05:00.650> you<00:05:00.770> if<00:05:01.009> you're

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
stay away from that if you if you're

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.040 
stay away from that if you if you're
gonna<00:05:01.280> buy<00:05:01.490> a<00:05:01.520> new<00:05:01.610> bowl<00:05:01.879> gouge<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.750> other<00:05:02.870> one

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
gonna buy a new bowl gouge the other one

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.390 
gonna buy a new bowl gouge the other one
is<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:03.319> old<00:05:03.440> glazier<00:05:04.840> shape<00:05:05.840> that<00:05:06.110> has<00:05:06.400> the

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
is the old glazier shape that has the

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.249 
is the old glazier shape that has the
sides<00:05:07.669> are<00:05:07.940> swept<00:05:08.210> back<00:05:08.389> but<00:05:08.690> it's<00:05:08.840> got<00:05:09.050> a

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
sides are swept back but it's got a

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.369 
sides are swept back but it's got a
really<00:05:09.620> tight<00:05:10.039> radius<00:05:10.370> at<00:05:10.729> the<00:05:10.819> bottom<00:05:11.349> okay

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379 
really tight radius at the bottom okay

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:14.589 
really tight radius at the bottom okay
that<00:05:12.740> too<00:05:13.039> is<00:05:13.219> hard<00:05:13.460> to<00:05:13.759> get<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:14.360> chip

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
that too is hard to get the chip

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:17.740 
that too is hard to get the chip
configuration<00:05:15.409> correct<00:05:15.770> so<00:05:16.539> if<00:05:17.539> you're<00:05:17.659> gonna

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
configuration correct so if you're gonna

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.839 
configuration correct so if you're gonna
get<00:05:17.930> a<00:05:17.990> new<00:05:18.139> gouge<00:05:18.319> to<00:05:18.469> try<00:05:18.680> to<00:05:18.740> get<00:05:18.949> one<00:05:19.099> that

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
get a new gouge to try to get one that

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:21.879 
get a new gouge to try to get one that
has<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.330> flute<00:05:20.539> configuration<00:05:21.169> with<00:05:21.319> looking

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
has the flute configuration with looking

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.170 
has the flute configuration with looking
like<00:05:22.039> this<00:05:22.190> as<00:05:22.340> you<00:05:22.370> look<00:05:22.610> right<00:05:22.819> down<00:05:23.000> the

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
like this as you look right down the

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.360 
like this as you look right down the
flute<00:05:23.389> if<00:05:23.930> you<00:05:24.139> can<00:05:24.289> imagine<00:05:24.500> the<00:05:24.860> pulling<00:05:25.159> cut

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
flute if you can imagine the pulling cut

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.080 
flute if you can imagine the pulling cut
with<00:05:26.000> a<00:05:26.030> big<00:05:26.300> hump<00:05:26.629> here<00:05:26.949> okay<00:05:27.949> if<00:05:28.430> I<00:05:28.669> had<00:05:28.819> a<00:05:28.849> big

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
with a big hump here okay if I had a big

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.779 
with a big hump here okay if I had a big
hump<00:05:29.300> on<00:05:29.479> the<00:05:29.599> tool<00:05:29.810> that<00:05:30.590> pulling<00:05:31.190> cut<00:05:31.550> would

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
hump on the tool that pulling cut would

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.309 
hump on the tool that pulling cut would
be<00:05:31.819> really<00:05:32.210> hard<00:05:32.419> to<00:05:32.479> do<00:05:32.719> it<00:05:32.870> would<00:05:32.990> be<00:05:33.020> really

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 
be really hard to do it would be really

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:35.920 
be really hard to do it would be really
aggressive<00:05:33.889> and<00:05:34.069> I<00:05:35.060> would<00:05:35.270> be<00:05:35.389> taking<00:05:35.690> a<00:05:35.780> whole

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
aggressive and I would be taking a whole

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.019 
aggressive and I would be taking a whole
lot<00:05:36.110> of<00:05:36.139> wood<00:05:36.349> away<00:05:36.469> and<00:05:37.129> you<00:05:37.250> saw<00:05:37.400> how<00:05:37.580> gentle

00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:38.029 
lot of wood away and you saw how gentle

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:39.790 
lot of wood away and you saw how gentle
it<00:05:38.120> was<00:05:38.330> on<00:05:38.539> my<00:05:38.690> pulling<00:05:38.990> cut<00:05:39.169> using<00:05:39.349> the<00:05:39.529> tip

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
it was on my pulling cut using the tip

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.149 
it was on my pulling cut using the tip
only<00:05:40.009> so<00:05:41.319> the<00:05:42.319> pulling<00:05:42.590> cut<00:05:42.740> would<00:05:42.860> be<00:05:42.889> more

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
only so the pulling cut would be more

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.370 
only so the pulling cut would be more
aggressive<00:05:43.580> but<00:05:44.180> more<00:05:44.659> importantly<00:05:45.110> here

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
aggressive but more importantly here

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.129 
aggressive but more importantly here
when<00:05:45.560> we're<00:05:45.710> starting<00:05:45.979> an<00:05:46.370> entry<00:05:47.090> point<00:05:47.120> of<00:05:47.569> a

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
when we're starting an entry point of a

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.100 
when we're starting an entry point of a
pushing<00:05:49.069> cut<00:05:49.310> if<00:05:49.669> we<00:05:50.000> have<00:05:50.180> a<00:05:50.210> hump<00:05:50.539> in<00:05:50.719> there

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
pushing cut if we have a hump in there

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.540 
pushing cut if we have a hump in there
what<00:05:51.860> happens<00:05:52.219> is<00:05:53.050> the<00:05:54.050> hump<00:05:54.319> we<00:05:55.159> can<00:05:55.340> get<00:05:55.520> a

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
what happens is the hump we can get a

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.110 
what happens is the hump we can get a
close-up<00:05:56.389> shot<00:05:56.810> of<00:05:56.840> this<00:05:57.139> right<00:05:58.069> now<00:05:58.310> I<00:05:58.669> have

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
close-up shot of this right now I have

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.760 
close-up shot of this right now I have
almost<00:05:59.479> immediate<00:06:01.479> entry<00:06:02.479> of<00:06:02.779> the<00:06:03.529> cut

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
almost immediate entry of the cut

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.129 
almost immediate entry of the cut
happening<00:06:04.340> and<00:06:04.550> the<00:06:05.210> bevel<00:06:05.479> support<00:06:05.840> at<00:06:06.020> the

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
happening and the bevel support at the

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:07.959 
happening and the bevel support at the
same<00:06:06.319> time<00:06:06.590> starting<00:06:07.039> to<00:06:07.159> get<00:06:07.310> support<00:06:07.729> for

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:07.969 
same time starting to get support for

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:09.969 
same time starting to get support for
itself<00:06:08.300> let<00:06:08.870> me<00:06:08.990> just<00:06:09.199> start<00:06:09.469> it<00:06:09.620> just<00:06:09.889> a

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 
itself let me just start it just a

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.809 
itself let me just start it just a
little<00:06:10.219> bit<00:06:10.310> in<00:06:10.460> to<00:06:11.270> get<00:06:12.279> so<00:06:13.279> you<00:06:13.370> get<00:06:13.460> a<00:06:13.490> start

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:13.819 
little bit in to get so you get a start

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:16.149 
little bit in to get so you get a start
of<00:06:13.909> it<00:06:14.000> okay<00:06:14.180> now<00:06:15.050> there's<00:06:15.319> a<00:06:15.409> cut<00:06:15.680> happening

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:16.159 
of it okay now there's a cut happening

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:17.830 
of it okay now there's a cut happening
and<00:06:16.340> there's<00:06:16.909> my<00:06:17.029> bevel<00:06:17.240> support<00:06:17.659> it's

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
and there's my bevel support it's

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.790 
and there's my bevel support it's
already<00:06:18.319> there

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
already there

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.670 
already there
alright<00:06:19.610> now<00:06:20.419> let's<00:06:20.930> think<00:06:21.050> of<00:06:21.199> I<00:06:21.289> had<00:06:21.440> at<00:06:21.560> home

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
alright now let's think of I had at home

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.749 
alright now let's think of I had at home
I<00:06:22.060> have<00:06:23.060> to<00:06:23.090> be<00:06:23.560> cutting<00:06:24.560> wood<00:06:24.889> cutting<00:06:25.580> wood

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 
I have to be cutting wood cutting wood

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.490 
I have to be cutting wood cutting wood
the<00:06:26.090> bevels<00:06:26.419> still<00:06:26.690> be<00:06:26.840> out<00:06:26.960> here<00:06:27.139> in<00:06:27.259> the<00:06:27.349> air

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
the bevels still be out here in the air

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.529 
the bevels still be out here in the air
cutting<00:06:28.400> wood<00:06:28.580> and<00:06:28.789> cutting<00:06:29.090> wood<00:06:29.270> and<00:06:29.300> I

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:29.539 
cutting wood and cutting wood and I

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:31.749 
cutting wood and cutting wood and I
still<00:06:29.810> have<00:06:29.960> the<00:06:30.110> bevel<00:06:30.379> out<00:06:30.500> into<00:06:30.770> air<00:06:30.949> so

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 
still have the bevel out into air so

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:34.510 
still have the bevel out into air so
people<00:06:32.180> compensate<00:06:32.900> for<00:06:33.050> that<00:06:33.229> they<00:06:33.830> can

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
people compensate for that they can

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.459 
people compensate for that they can
lower<00:06:34.789> the<00:06:35.000> handle<00:06:35.389> they<00:06:35.810> could<00:06:35.990> close<00:06:36.259> the

00:06:36.459 --> 00:06:36.469
