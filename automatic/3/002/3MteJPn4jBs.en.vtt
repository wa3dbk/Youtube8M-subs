00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the brake lever or the caliper doesn't

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.310 
the brake lever or the caliper doesn't
really<00:01:05.820> matter<00:01:06.090> they<00:01:06.330> both<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.960> exact

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
really matter they both do the exact

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.649 
really matter they both do the exact
same<00:01:07.619> thing<00:01:08.040> depending<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.060> which<00:01:09.180> setup<00:01:09.540> you

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
same thing depending on which setup you

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.380 
same thing depending on which setup you
have<00:01:10.070> but<00:01:11.070> again<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.549> want<00:01:11.670> your<00:01:12.000> brake<00:01:12.210> lever

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
have but again you want your brake lever

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.359 
have but again you want your brake lever
to<00:01:12.720> be<00:01:12.840> approximately<00:01:13.650> halfway<00:01:13.950> between

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
to be approximately halfway between

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.050 
to be approximately halfway between
neutral<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> handlebar<00:01:16.790> once<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
neutral and the handlebar once the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.800 
neutral and the handlebar once the
tension<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:20.119> approximately<00:01:21.119> where<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.540> want

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
tension is approximately where you want

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.760 
tension is approximately where you want
it<00:01:22.250> then<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.280> want<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.700> see<00:01:24.170> what<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.350> actually

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
it then you want to see what is actually

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.740 
it then you want to see what is actually
causing<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.340> noise<00:01:26.490> whether<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.450> brake

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
causing the noise whether it's the brake

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.670 
causing the noise whether it's the brake
pad<00:01:28.790> adjustment<00:01:29.790> for<00:01:30.240> gap<00:01:30.540> against<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.290> rotor

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
pad adjustment for gap against the rotor

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.340 
pad adjustment for gap against the rotor
or<00:01:32.040> whether<00:01:32.549> they're<00:01:33.030> crooked<00:01:33.600> against<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
or whether they're crooked against the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.390 
or whether they're crooked against the
rotor<00:01:36.409> once<00:01:37.409> you've<00:01:37.650> established<00:01:37.829> your

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
rotor once you've established your

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.609 
rotor once you've established your
proper<00:01:38.820> cable<00:01:39.180> tension<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:40.079> want<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.320> find<00:01:40.500> a

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
proper cable tension you want to find a

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.499 
proper cable tension you want to find a
small<00:01:40.890> gap<00:01:41.130> between<00:01:41.400> your<00:01:41.700> brake<00:01:41.909> pad<00:01:42.180> and

small gap between your brake pad and
your<00:01:42.720> rotors<00:01:43.140> within<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.740> caliper<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.759> be

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
your rotors within the caliper it can be

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.080 
your rotors within the caliper it can be
kind<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.210> tricky<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:46.579> you<00:01:47.579> can<00:01:47.729> either<00:01:47.850> use

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
kind of tricky to see you can either use

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.080 
kind of tricky to see you can either use
a<00:01:48.119> flashlight<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:49.079> shine<00:01:49.770> some<00:01:50.340> light<00:01:50.369> on<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
a flashlight to shine some light on the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.359 
a flashlight to shine some light on the
situation<00:01:51.270> or<00:01:51.869> put<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> white<00:01:52.380> backdrop<00:01:52.680> behind

situation or put a white backdrop behind

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.850 
situation or put a white backdrop behind
it<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.240> clearly<00:01:54.750> see<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.200> gap

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
it so you can just clearly see that gap

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.130 
it so you can just clearly see that gap
once<00:01:56.640> you've<00:01:56.880> established<00:01:57.060> your<00:01:57.689> line<00:01:57.899> of

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
once you've established your line of

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.789 
once you've established your line of
sight<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:59.009> want<00:01:59.250> to<00:02:00.049> diagnose<00:02:01.049> whether<00:02:01.350> it's

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
sight you want to diagnose whether it's

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.389 
sight you want to diagnose whether it's
a<00:02:02.100> brake<00:02:02.460> pad<00:02:03.079> tension<00:02:04.079> whether<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.890> pads<00:02:05.130> too

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
a brake pad tension whether the pads too

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.920 
a brake pad tension whether the pads too
close<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.060> rotor<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.540> that's<00:02:06.689> what's

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
close to the rotor and that's what's

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.320 
close to the rotor and that's what's
causing<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.469> rub<00:02:07.680> or<00:02:07.860> if<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.149> whole

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
causing it to rub or if the whole

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.559 
causing it to rub or if the whole
caliper<00:02:09.869> itself<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:10.979> little<00:02:11.370> skewed<00:02:11.819> they

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
caliper itself is a little skewed they

are mounted
with<00:02:13.990> beveled<00:02:14.710> washers<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.490> you<00:02:15.550> can<00:02:15.820> adjust

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
with beveled washers so you can adjust

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.620 
with beveled washers so you can adjust
the<00:02:16.420> skew<00:02:16.990> of<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.890> whole<00:02:18.130> caliper<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:19.420> make

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
the skew of the whole caliper to make

want to get grease on your rotor right

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.490 
want to get grease on your rotor right
now<00:06:01.580> you<00:06:01.669> can<00:06:02.030> see<00:06:02.240> that<00:06:02.449> the<00:06:02.630> rotor<00:06:02.870> is<00:06:03.139> bent

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
now you can see that the rotor is bent

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.730 
now you can see that the rotor is bent
to<00:06:03.889> the<00:06:04.130> inside<00:06:04.669> and<00:06:05.090> every<00:06:05.870> revolution<00:06:06.590> it

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
to the inside and every revolution it

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.180 
to the inside and every revolution it
will<00:06:06.919> rub<00:06:07.219> on<00:06:07.490> that<00:06:07.520> inside<00:06:08.150> pad<00:06:08.620> to<00:06:09.620> fix<00:06:09.889> that

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
will rub on that inside pad to fix that

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.140 
will rub on that inside pad to fix that
you<00:06:10.490> want<00:06:11.180> to<00:06:11.389> locate<00:06:12.520> where<00:06:13.520> it's<00:06:13.729> actually

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
you want to locate where it's actually

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.730 
you want to locate where it's actually
rubbing<00:06:14.419> and<00:06:14.750> you<00:06:14.870> find<00:06:15.110> the<00:06:15.229> center<00:06:15.590> of<00:06:15.680> the

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
rubbing and you find the center of the

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.089 
rubbing and you find the center of the
rub<00:06:15.919> so<00:06:16.219> it's<00:06:16.909> not<00:06:17.090> rubbing<00:06:17.419> here<00:06:17.810> not<00:06:18.710> rubbing

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
rub so it's not rubbing here not rubbing

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.100 
rub so it's not rubbing here not rubbing
here<00:06:19.520> so<00:06:19.789> in<00:06:19.909> the<00:06:20.000> center<00:06:20.330> that<00:06:20.509> is<00:06:20.570> the<00:06:20.810> center

less cable tension and effectively

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.810 
less cable tension and effectively
having<00:06:59.170> a<00:06:59.290> larger<00:06:59.710> gap<00:06:59.950> between<00:07:00.310> your<00:07:00.640> brake

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:00.820 
having a larger gap between your brake

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.330 
having a larger gap between your brake
pads<00:07:01.030> and<00:07:01.360> your<00:07:01.690> rotor<00:07:01.960> this<00:07:02.770> will<00:07:02.920> just<00:07:03.070> allow

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.340 
pads and your rotor this will just allow

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.120 
pads and your rotor this will just allow
for<00:07:03.370> more<00:07:04.980> flexible

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.130 
for more flexible

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.520 
for more flexible
hence<00:07:06.760> lessening<00:07:07.600> the<00:07:07.870> brake<00:07:08.080> rub<00:07:08.320> noise

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530 
hence lessening the brake rub noise
