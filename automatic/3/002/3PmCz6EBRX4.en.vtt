premiere event and let's just start with
the<00:00:15.210> action<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.800> think<00:00:16.800> we've<00:00:16.949> seen<00:00:17.190> both<00:00:17.400> these

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
the action I think we've seen both these

the action I think we've seen both these
guys<00:00:17.789> play<00:00:18.060> sand<00:00:18.869> crab<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.350> playing<00:00:22.310> dredge

and<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:24.510> believe<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.140> contagious<00:00:25.560> playing

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
and I believe it contagious playing

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.979 
and I believe it contagious playing
counterbalance<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:30.109> think<00:00:31.109> that's<00:00:31.640> been<00:00:32.640> a

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
counterbalance I think that's been a

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.819 
counterbalance I think that's been a
long<00:00:33.989> day<00:00:34.200> recording

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.549 

and<00:00:40.219> you<00:00:40.670> know<00:00:40.760> we<00:00:40.940> got<00:00:41.329> pithing<00:00:42.170> needle<00:00:42.409> on<00:00:42.530> a

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
and you know we got pithing needle on a

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.380 
and you know we got pithing needle on a
petri<00:00:43.190> attempt<00:00:43.460> if<00:00:43.670> you<00:00:43.909> missed<00:00:44.089> it<00:00:44.210> real

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
petri attempt if you missed it real

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.750 
petri attempt if you missed it real
quick<00:00:44.600> and<00:00:44.809> that's<00:00:45.440> slow<00:00:46.039> down<00:00:46.219> is<00:00:46.339> to<00:00:46.370> vomit

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
quick and that's slow down is to vomit

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.569 
quick and that's slow down is to vomit
but<00:00:46.789> he's<00:00:47.030> managed<00:00:47.420> to<00:00:48.129> cast<00:00:49.129> a<00:00:49.309> couple

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
but he's managed to cast a couple

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.669 
but he's managed to cast a couple
careful<00:00:49.879> studies<00:00:50.179> and<00:00:50.420> what<00:00:50.570> not<00:00:50.750> to<00:00:50.989> get

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:51.679 
careful studies and what not to get

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:58.689 
careful studies and what not to get
stuff<00:00:51.920> in<00:00:52.039> the<00:00:52.129> yard<00:00:52.329> but<00:00:53.329> there<00:00:53.539> is<00:00:53.659> no<00:00:57.699> fish

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.830 

it's<00:01:04.430> probably<00:01:04.640> slowing<00:01:05.239> down<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.630> dredge

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
it's probably slowing down the dredge

it's probably slowing down the dredge
deck<00:01:06.049> bit

which<00:01:13.509> next<00:01:14.509> turn<00:01:14.750> is<00:01:14.899> a<00:01:14.929> problem<00:01:15.289> because<00:01:16.149> you

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
which next turn is a problem because you

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.920 

in<00:02:38.319> an<00:02:38.560> arc<00:02:38.769> amoeba<00:02:39.370> so<00:02:40.000> dread<00:02:40.360> return<00:02:40.750> is

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
in an arc amoeba so dread return is

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.000 
in an arc amoeba so dread return is
alive<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:43.170> it's<00:02:44.170> not<00:02:44.530> really<00:02:44.860> all<00:02:44.890> that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
alive but it's not really all that

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.330 
alive but it's not really all that
problematic<00:02:46.019> all<00:02:47.019> right<00:02:47.170> think<00:02:47.709> this<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.160> the

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
problematic all right think this is the

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.160 
problematic all right think this is the
time<00:02:49.290> just<00:02:50.290> going<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:51.209> you<00:02:52.209> can<00:02:52.420> cell<00:02:52.690> block

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
time just going to you can cell block

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.080 
time just going to you can cell block
one<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.620> them<00:02:53.769> through<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.730> bridge<00:02:54.910> from

one of them through the bridge from

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.949 
one of them through the bridge from
blows<00:02:57.810> there's<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.870> pitcher<00:02:59.290> Tim<00:03:00.959> which

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
blows there's a pitcher Tim which

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.600 
blows there's a pitcher Tim which
doesn't<00:03:02.379> really<00:03:02.590> do<00:03:02.799> anything<00:03:03.040> because<00:03:03.310> you

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
doesn't really do anything because you

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.390 
doesn't really do anything because you
can't<00:03:03.910> it<00:03:04.870> guess<00:03:05.019> they<00:03:05.200> can't<00:03:05.379> block<00:03:05.709> I<00:03:06.040> guess

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
to get both the currents so that's game
