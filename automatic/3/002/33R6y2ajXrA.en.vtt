like a and a sandy you can see like

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.570 
like a and a sandy you can see like
where<00:04:55.690> they<00:04:55.810> go<00:04:55.930> and<00:04:56.290> then<00:04:56.920> you<00:04:57.250> just<00:04:57.430> peel

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
where they go and then you just peel

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.790 
where they go and then you just peel
them<00:04:57.730> off<00:04:57.820> and<00:04:58.060> then<00:04:58.210> you<00:04:58.330> just<00:04:58.480> stick<00:04:58.630> them<00:04:58.810> on

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
there and this takes finesse not four so

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.010 
there and this takes finesse not four so
just<00:05:05.050> like<00:05:05.610> gonna<00:05:06.610> put<00:05:07.330> it<00:05:07.420> on<00:05:07.480> there<00:05:07.660> lightly

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
until you know you've got it in a

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:18.590 
until you know you've got it in a
position<00:05:09.520> that<00:05:09.640> you<00:05:10.260> really<00:05:11.260> want<00:05:11.560> it<00:05:11.650> in

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.880 

like<00:05:19.600> see<00:05:19.810> that's<00:05:19.990> a<00:05:20.050> little<00:05:20.140> wonky<00:05:20.410> see<00:05:20.740> this

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
like see that's a little wonky see this

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.620 
like see that's a little wonky see this
takes<00:05:21.070> time<00:05:21.280> so<00:05:21.550> this<00:05:22.180> is<00:05:22.300> something<00:05:22.540> that

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630
