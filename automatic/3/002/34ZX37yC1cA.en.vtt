a pocket so so i recommend you guys get
a<00:01:05.250> DS<00:01:06.229> lite<00:01:08.030> because<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.330> good<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.930> many<00:01:10.170> ways

a DS lite because it's good in many ways
and<00:01:11.000> i<00:01:12.000> guess<00:01:12.930> its<00:01:13.439> way<00:01:13.950> better<00:01:14.220> they've<00:01:14.790> all

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
and i guess its way better they've all

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.190 
and i guess its way better they've all
the<00:01:15.090> other<00:01:15.270> guesses<00:01:16.460> it's<00:01:17.460> i<00:01:17.939> like<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.600> small

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the other guesses it's i like a small

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.670 
the other guesses it's i like a small
device<00:01:19.580> it's<00:01:20.580> better<00:01:21.000> than<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.479> big<00:01:21.750> one<00:01:22.020> where

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
device it's better than a big one where

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.530 
device it's better than a big one where
you<00:01:22.890> can't<00:01:23.189> take<00:01:23.490> anywhere<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.060> sit<00:01:24.299> home
