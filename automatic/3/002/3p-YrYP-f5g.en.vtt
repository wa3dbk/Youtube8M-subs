00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.450
 from our pan we put the oil 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:25.770
 we let it warm up a couple of seconds 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:28.759
 to then add our rice and 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.759
 Granarlo as usual 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.059
 that our rice is already grained 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.600
 we will proceed to pour over two cups of 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.600
 boiling water 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.699
 we add salt to taste 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:06.839
 and we stir 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.839
 we continue the simmer 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.240
 and after 20 minutes we have our 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.240
 perfectly grained roll 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.979
 then 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.259
 we prepare the games 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.220
 in our pan 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.680
 we add a portion of oil 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.150
 or not 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.150
 we invest our egg 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.960
 to 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.480
 once our game is found 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:18.120
 lasted by the traverso 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:22.940
 we add we fix 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.940
 and we started to ask 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.520
 then 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.920
 we add others 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.420
 and we continue to stir constantly 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.840
 and finally we add our 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.040
 chive 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.700
 stir over medium heat for 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.000
 approximately 3 minutes 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:12.330
 finally we will get something like 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.330
 this with the egg already quite disarmed 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.400
 and so we have finished our rice 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.140
 chaufa which can be accompanied 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.260
 of a sautÃ©ed vegetable or a chop 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.260

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:33.660
