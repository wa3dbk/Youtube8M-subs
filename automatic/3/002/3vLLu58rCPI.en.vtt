00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.270 
gonna do spoiler for that cuz come on
but<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.590> already<00:01:52.710> know<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.040> gonna<00:01:53.100> happen

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
but you already know it's gonna happen

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.499 
but you already know it's gonna happen
and<00:01:53.430> that's<00:01:53.549> what<00:01:53.759> was<00:01:53.939> actually<00:01:54.210> incredibly

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
and that's what was actually incredibly

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.230 
and that's what was actually incredibly
awkward<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:55.979> me<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.340> they<00:01:56.460> really<00:01:56.790> set<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
awkward for me like they really set the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.090 
awkward for me like they really set the
tone<00:01:57.420> on<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.600> weird<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:57.899> again<00:01:58.259> I'm<00:01:58.469> I'm<00:01:58.680> with

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
tone on a weird like again I'm I'm with

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.530 
tone on a weird like again I'm I'm with
I'm<00:01:59.340> actually<00:01:59.640> intrigued<00:02:00.180> I'll<00:02:00.360> probably

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
I'm actually intrigued I'll probably

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.360 
I'm actually intrigued I'll probably
watch<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.900> little<00:02:01.050> more<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.350> has<00:02:01.500> potential<00:02:02.010> and

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
watch a little more it has potential and

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.250 
watch a little more it has potential and
they<00:02:02.520> cool<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.970> Fox<00:02:03.240> put<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.659> lot<00:02:03.900> of<00:02:04.020> money

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
they cool like Fox put a lot of money

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.560 
they cool like Fox put a lot of money
and<00:02:04.530> time<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.400> it's<00:02:05.640> clearly<00:02:06.090> like<00:02:06.300> their

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
and time to this it's clearly like their

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.990 
and time to this it's clearly like their
get<00:02:06.960> go<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.410> the<00:02:07.500> season<00:02:07.650> but<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.820> whole

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
get go for the season but that whole

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.669 
get go for the season but that whole
scene<00:02:09.209> was<00:02:09.240> incredibly<00:02:09.810> awkward<00:02:09.990> because<00:02:10.380> we

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
scene was incredibly awkward because we

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.830 
scene was incredibly awkward because we
all<00:02:10.830> know<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.220> Bruce<00:02:11.459> Wayne<00:02:11.760> his<00:02:12.450> parents

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
all know the Bruce Wayne his parents

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.180 
all know the Bruce Wayne his parents
dying<00:02:13.050> story<00:02:13.440> we've<00:02:13.650> seen<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.980> million

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
dying story we've seen it a million

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.160 
dying story we've seen it a million
times<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.850> this<00:02:15.330> one<00:02:15.480> was<00:02:15.600> really<00:02:15.840> awkward

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
times and this one was really awkward

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.040 
times and this one was really awkward
because<00:02:16.620> like<00:02:17.280> Catwoman<00:02:17.760> as<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.209> young<00:02:18.450> girl<00:02:18.630> it

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
because like Catwoman as a young girl it

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.540 
because like Catwoman as a young girl it
hurts<00:02:19.260> on<00:02:19.410> her<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.890> she's<00:02:20.070> doing<00:02:20.220> her<00:02:20.370> little

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
hurts on her and she's doing her little

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.750 
hurts on her and she's doing her little
thieving<00:02:21.150> thing<00:02:21.480> it's<00:02:21.810> like<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.930> preteen<00:02:22.440> and

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
thieving thing it's like a preteen and

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.510 
thieving thing it's like a preteen and
she's<00:02:23.760> hiding<00:02:24.390> on<00:02:25.020> like<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:26.010> on<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
when when they die and so it's kind of

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.120 
when when they die and so it's kind of
like<00:02:33.180> you've<00:02:33.300> got<00:02:33.450> Bruce<00:02:33.750> like<00:02:34.140> trotty<00:02:34.830> of

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
have potential and they are clearly

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.810 
have potential and they are clearly
putting<00:06:28.230> an<00:06:28.380> effort<00:06:28.530> into<00:06:28.950> it<00:06:29.070> it's<00:06:29.220> it's<00:06:29.610> not
