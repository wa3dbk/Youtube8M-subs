this<00:00:00.329> is<00:00:00.480> the<00:00:00.630> birds<00:00:00.930> Cobra<00:00:01.650> Club<00:00:01.949> Series

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
this is the birds Cobra Club Series

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.889 
this is the birds Cobra Club Series
guitar<00:00:02.700> as<00:00:02.909> you<00:00:03.419> can<00:00:03.540> see<00:00:03.689> it's<00:00:03.810> really

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
guitar as you can see it's really

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.900 
guitar as you can see it's really
similar<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.440> Stratocaster<00:00:05.100> but<00:00:05.640> it's<00:00:05.759> got

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
similar to a Stratocaster but it's got

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.789 
similar to a Stratocaster but it's got
the<00:00:06.089> tri<00:00:06.299> sonic<00:00:06.690> pickups<00:00:07.049> which<00:00:07.259> are<00:00:07.410> typical

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
the tri sonic pickups which are typical

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.379 
the tri sonic pickups which are typical
of<00:00:07.830> birds<00:00:08.069> guitars<00:00:08.490> they're<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.120> little<00:00:09.210> bit

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
of birds guitars they're a little bit

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.959 
of birds guitars they're a little bit
wider<00:00:09.599> than<00:00:09.960> regular<00:00:10.740> strat<00:00:11.250> single<00:00:11.639> coils

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
wider than regular strat single coils

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.390 
wider than regular strat single coils
and<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:13.650> that<00:00:13.769> gives<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:14.009> little<00:00:14.160> bit<00:00:14.309> more

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
and so that gives a little bit more

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.910 
and so that gives a little bit more
tonal<00:00:14.670> range<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.660> they're<00:00:15.870> also<00:00:16.020> load<00:00:16.619> their

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
tonal range and they're also load their

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.980 
tonal range and they're also load their
low<00:00:17.100> output<00:00:17.340> or<00:00:17.789> relatively<00:00:18.270> low<00:00:18.480> opposite

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
low output or relatively low opposite

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.380 
low output or relatively low opposite
got<00:00:19.289> less<00:00:20.279> winding<00:00:20.789> maybe<00:00:21.000> than<00:00:21.210> regular

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
got less winding maybe than regular

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.210 
got less winding maybe than regular
strat<00:00:21.779> pickups<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.800> makes<00:00:22.949> them<00:00:23.100> really

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
strat pickups so that makes them really

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.980 
strat pickups so that makes them really
really<00:00:23.340> versatile<00:00:23.939> just<00:00:24.240> really<00:00:24.510> cool<00:00:24.660> clean

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
really versatile just really cool clean

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:39.370 
really versatile just really cool clean
sounding<00:00:25.260> pickups<00:00:26.090> here's<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.269> bridge

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:51.980 

here's<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:40.400> middle

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:01:00.180 

you

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:09.260 

you

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.399 

one<00:01:10.270> of<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.450> greatest<00:01:10.630> things<00:01:10.960> I<00:01:11.140> think<00:01:11.200> about

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
one of the greatest things I think about

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.499 
one of the greatest things I think about
this<00:01:11.649> guitar<00:01:11.979> is<00:01:12.009> that<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:12.430> tone<00:01:12.970> up<00:01:13.149> here<00:01:13.420> is

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
this guitar is that the tone up here is

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.630 
this guitar is that the tone up here is
where<00:01:13.689> to<00:01:13.899> push<00:01:14.200> full<00:01:14.470> pot<00:01:14.770> and<00:01:15.040> what<00:01:15.490> that

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
where to push full pot and what that

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.600 
where to push full pot and what that
does<00:01:15.820> is<00:01:15.880> turns<00:01:16.479> on<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:17.409> neck<00:01:17.649> pickup<00:01:17.830> so<00:01:18.520> if

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
does is turns on the neck pickup so if

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.100 
does is turns on the neck pickup so if
you've<00:01:18.729> got<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:19.000> bridge<00:01:19.210> pickup<00:01:19.450> selected

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
you've got the bridge pickup selected

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.200 
you've got the bridge pickup selected
with<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:20.680> pull<00:01:21.009> pot<00:01:21.250> with<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:21.700> push-pull<00:01:22.060> pop

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
with the pull pot with the push-pull pop

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.510 
with the pull pot with the push-pull pop
up<00:01:22.420> that<00:01:22.960> turns<00:01:23.229> on<00:01:23.380> both<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.979> bridge<00:01:24.189> and<00:01:24.430> the

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
up that turns on both the bridge and the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.249 
up that turns on both the bridge and the
neck<00:01:24.700> pickups<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.420> get<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.600> really<00:01:25.810> cool<00:01:28.259> full

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
neck pickups you get a really cool full

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:44.510 
neck pickups you get a really cool full
rich<00:01:29.710> sound

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.950 

you<00:01:45.520> can<00:01:45.670> also<00:01:45.790> turn<00:01:46.060> out<00:01:46.119> all<00:01:46.390> three<00:01:46.630> pickups

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
you can also turn out all three pickups

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.590 
you can also turn out all three pickups
with<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:47.409> pickup<00:01:47.680> selector<00:01:47.829> on<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:49.119> bridge

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
with the pickup selector on the bridge

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.510 
with the pickup selector on the bridge
at<00:01:49.930> middle<00:01:50.229> position<00:01:50.740> so<00:01:50.890> now<00:01:51.040> all<00:01:51.070> three<00:01:51.430> of

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
at middle position so now all three of

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:01.160 
at middle position so now all three of
them

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.960 

this<00:02:02.170> really<00:02:02.560> becomes<00:02:03.130> a<00:02:03.430> cool<00:02:03.640> sounding

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
this really becomes a cool sounding

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.120 
this really becomes a cool sounding
guitar<00:02:04.240> when<00:02:04.390> you<00:02:04.450> turn<00:02:04.570> on<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.750> compressor

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
guitar when you turn on the compressor

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.530 
guitar when you turn on the compressor
so<00:02:06.130> I've<00:02:06.250> got<00:02:06.430> my<00:02:06.460> soul<00:02:06.730> preacher<00:02:06.970> compressor

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
so I've got my soul preacher compressor

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.810 
so I've got my soul preacher compressor
on<00:02:07.570> set<00:02:08.050> too<00:02:08.200> fast<00:02:08.500> so<00:02:08.920> it's<00:02:09.070> got<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.280> real<00:02:09.490> funky

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
on set too fast so it's got a real funky

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.350 
on set too fast so it's got a real funky
punchy<00:02:10.270> sound<00:02:10.830> yeah<00:02:11.830> that<00:02:12.010> I've<00:02:12.130> got<00:02:12.310> my<00:02:12.580> neck

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
punchy sound yeah that I've got my neck

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.590 
punchy sound yeah that I've got my neck
and<00:02:13.690> bridge<00:02:14.170> pickups<00:02:14.590> turned<00:02:14.800> on<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.540> can

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
and bridge pickups turned on so you can

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:34.150 
and bridge pickups turned on so you can
hear<00:02:16.810> how<00:02:16.870> just<00:02:17.200> real<00:02:17.530> cool<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.100> focuses

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:42.650 

with<00:02:35.160> all<00:02:35.310> three<00:02:35.490> pickups<00:02:35.790> on<00:02:41.270> now<00:02:42.270> factoring

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
with all three pickups on now factoring

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.060 
with all three pickups on now factoring
just<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.020> bridge<00:02:43.230> pickup<00:02:43.440> odd<00:02:43.770> with<00:02:43.950> that

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
just the bridge pickup odd with that

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.830 
just the bridge pickup odd with that
same<00:02:44.280> compressor<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:45.360> can<00:02:45.480> hear<00:02:45.630> what<00:02:45.810> a

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
same compressor you can hear what a

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.230 
same compressor you can hear what a
great<00:02:46.080> sounding<00:02:46.560> pick<00:02:47.310> up<00:02:47.460> this<00:02:47.610> try<00:02:47.880> sonic

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
great sounding pick up this try sonic

00:02:48.240 --> 00:03:07.670 
great sounding pick up this try sonic
thing<00:02:48.390> is

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.860 

very<00:03:08.680> cool<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.970> also<00:03:10.180> does<00:03:10.330> really<00:03:10.540> well<00:03:10.690> with

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
very cool it also does really well with

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.180 
very cool it also does really well with
distortion<00:03:11.379> of<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.530> turn<00:03:11.769> ons<00:03:11.890> is<00:03:12.069> my

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
distortion of the turn ons is my

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.640 
distortion of the turn ons is my
standard<00:03:13.050> distortion<00:03:14.050> pedal<00:03:14.319> here<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.590> you

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
standard distortion pedal here and you

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.610 
standard distortion pedal here and you
can<00:03:14.800> hear<00:03:14.950> that

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:37.500 

does<00:03:22.620> really<00:03:22.950> really<00:03:23.280> well
