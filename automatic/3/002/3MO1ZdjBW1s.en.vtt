00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
ação me so um yes stealth rock is up but

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.570 
ação me so um yes stealth rock is up but
there<00:02:06.200> are<00:02:06.289> several<00:02:06.590> times<00:02:06.979> during<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.460> match

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
there are several times during the match

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.550 
there are several times during the match
where<00:02:07.789> I<00:02:07.820> expect<00:02:08.360> him<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.600> still<00:02:08.840> switch<00:02:09.200> just

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
where I expect him to still switch just

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.170 
where I expect him to still switch just
because<00:02:09.800> he<00:02:09.920> doesn't<00:02:10.100> want<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.369> be<00:02:10.520> in<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.940> worse

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
because he doesn't want to be in a worse

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.750 
because he doesn't want to be in a worse
situation<00:02:11.390> than<00:02:11.930> what<00:02:12.260> he<00:02:12.350> is<00:02:12.530> right<00:02:12.770> now<00:02:12.800> so

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
situation than what he is right now so

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.850 
situation than what he is right now so
instead<00:02:14.270> of<00:02:14.330> mean<00:02:14.600> looking<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:15.200> go<00:02:15.350> to<00:02:15.410> Mewtwo

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
instead of mean looking I go to Mewtwo

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.090 
instead of mean looking I go to Mewtwo
to<00:02:16.280> set<00:02:16.580> up<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.760> reflect<00:02:17.210> so<00:02:18.050> that<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.620> can<00:02:18.920> come

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
to set up a reflect so that you can come

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.750 
to set up a reflect so that you can come
on<00:02:19.220> in<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.490> start<00:02:19.700> boosting<00:02:19.910> up<00:02:20.240> but<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:21.760> think

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
on in and start boosting up but I think

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.400 
on in and start boosting up but I think
it's<00:02:22.910> still<00:02:23.090> just<00:02:23.210> a<00:02:23.360> little<00:02:23.390> bit<00:02:23.690> too<00:02:23.840> early<00:02:23.870> I

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
it's still just a little bit too early I

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.980 
it's still just a little bit too early I
should<00:02:24.680> have<00:02:24.770> mean<00:02:24.980> loped<00:02:25.190> him<00:02:25.340> first<00:02:25.640> I<00:02:26.030> mean

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
should have mean loped him first I mean

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.809 
should have mean loped him first I mean
I<00:02:27.020> guess<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.319> did<00:02:27.440> expect<00:02:27.590> him<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:27.950> switch<00:02:28.250> but<00:02:28.640> I

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
I guess I did expect him to switch but I

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.490 
I guess I did expect him to switch but I
mean<00:02:29.300> that<00:02:29.450> was<00:02:29.540> my<00:02:29.630> thought<00:02:29.810> process<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.260> he

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
mean that was my thought process that he

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.900 
mean that was my thought process that he
would<00:02:30.650> switch<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.100> I<00:02:31.220> would<00:02:31.400> switch<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.880> I

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
would switch and I would switch and I

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.640 
would switch and I would switch and I
could<00:02:32.090> get<00:02:32.210> up<00:02:32.300> my<00:02:32.390> screens<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.080> then<00:02:33.500> go<00:02:33.620> to

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
could get up my screens and then go to

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.890 
could get up my screens and then go to
MU<00:02:34.010> but<00:02:34.760> because<00:02:35.300> it<00:02:35.420> didn't<00:02:35.600> work<00:02:35.720> out<00:02:35.840> that

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
MU but because it didn't work out that

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.080 
MU but because it didn't work out that
way<00:02:36.170> i<00:02:36.200> go<00:02:36.410> back<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.680> umbreon<00:02:37.250> so<00:02:37.430> i<00:02:37.460> can<00:02:37.790> mean

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
way i go back to umbreon so i can mean

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.760 
way i go back to umbreon so i can mean
look<00:02:38.300> him<00:02:38.480> but<00:02:38.630> then<00:02:38.780> he<00:02:38.810> wakes<00:02:39.230> up<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.650> now<00:02:39.740> i

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
look him but then he wakes up and now i

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.800 
look him but then he wakes up and now i
can't<00:02:40.190> live<00:02:40.400> another<00:02:40.640> hit<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.240> this<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:41.510> all

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
can't live another hit so this is all

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
burn so I can bring in Mewtwo now and

which I believe is what I do but you
know<00:03:24.720> I<00:03:24.750> hopefully<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.650> haven't<00:03:26.040> count<00:03:26.220> there

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.100 
know I hopefully I haven't count there
haven't<00:03:26.819> been<00:03:26.879> counting<00:03:27.180> terms<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.720> reflect

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
haven't been counting terms of reflect

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.080 
haven't been counting terms of reflect
so<00:03:28.379> I'm<00:03:28.530> just<00:03:28.709> praying<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.340> God<00:03:29.519> that<00:03:29.549> reflect

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
so I'm just praying to God that reflect

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.369 
so I'm just praying to God that reflect
wears<00:03:30.330> off<00:03:30.510> in<00:03:30.540> time<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:30.959> I<00:03:30.989> can<00:03:31.140> get<00:03:31.260> another

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.589 
not looking good whatsoever I got it up
way<00:03:36.569> too<00:03:36.629> early<00:03:36.930> without<00:03:37.620> committing<00:03:38.069> and

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
way too early without committing and

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.330 
way too early without committing and
that's<00:03:39.599> that's<00:03:39.900> gonna<00:03:40.470> be<00:03:40.620> really<00:03:40.739> bad<00:03:40.980> shut

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
that's that's gonna be really bad shut

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.970 
that's that's gonna be really bad shut
until<00:03:41.489> just<00:03:41.730> made<00:03:41.880> me<00:03:41.970> go<00:03:42.090> in<00:03:42.209> circles<00:03:42.650> so<00:03:43.650> I

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
until just made me go in circles so I

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.680 
until just made me go in circles so I
think<00:03:44.670> I<00:03:44.910> go<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.060> light<00:03:45.269> screen<00:03:45.510> right<00:03:45.660> here

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
think I go a light screen right here

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.720 
think I go a light screen right here
it's<00:03:46.049> kind<00:03:46.260> of<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.560> obvious<00:03:46.709> only<00:03:47.400> thing<00:03:47.610> I

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
it's kind of the obvious only thing I

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.910 
it's kind of the obvious only thing I
have<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.299> which<00:03:49.170> is<00:03:49.260> what<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:49.440> do<00:03:49.530> which<00:03:49.890> is

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
have and which is what I do which is

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.890 
have and which is what I do which is
cool<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.459> i<00:03:51.030> believe<00:03:51.329> i<00:03:51.450> taunt<00:03:51.720> him

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
cool and i believe i taunt him

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.270 
cool and i believe i taunt him
immediately<00:03:52.380> because<00:03:52.769> i<00:03:52.860> don't<00:03:53.040> want<00:03:53.069> to<00:03:53.220> be

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
immediately because i don't want to be

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.550 
immediately because i don't want to be

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
had had a dark rye in it so thankfully

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.530 
had had a dark rye in it so thankfully
none<00:03:59.250> of<00:03:59.340> them<00:03:59.430> were<00:03:59.549> scarf<00:03:59.879> all<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.329> them<00:04:00.420> were

none of them were scarf all of them were

none of them were scarf all of them were
life<00:04:01.170> over<00:04:01.410> lefties<00:04:02.010> so<00:04:02.250> i<00:04:02.280> was<00:04:02.459> able<00:04:02.579> to

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
life over lefties so i was able to

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.030 
life over lefties so i was able to
outspeed<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.360> taunt<00:04:03.569> him<00:04:03.750> but<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:04.319> can't

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
outspeed and taunt him but I can't

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.890 
outspeed and taunt him but I can't
afford<00:04:05.220> having<00:04:05.700> this<00:04:06.090> dark<00:04:06.390> rye<00:04:06.569> around

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
afford having this dark rye around

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.900 
afford having this dark rye around
putting<00:04:07.349> me<00:04:07.500> to<00:04:07.620> sleep<00:04:07.650> ends<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.340> game<00:04:08.519> and

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
putting me to sleep ends the game and

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.330 
putting me to sleep ends the game and
his<00:04:09.840> dark<00:04:10.079> pulse<00:04:10.319> is<00:04:10.530> going<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.739> beat<00:04:10.920> up<00:04:11.069> muse

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
his dark pulse is going to beat up muse

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.550 
his dark pulse is going to beat up muse
like<00:04:11.610> ants<00:04:11.910> which<00:04:12.090> in<00:04:12.239> any<00:04:12.389> way<00:04:12.540> I<00:04:12.569> had<00:04:13.049> to<00:04:13.380> blow

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
like ants which in any way I had to blow

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.640 
like ants which in any way I had to blow
up<00:04:13.799> um<00:04:14.100> I<00:04:15.090> guess<00:04:15.600> maybe<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:15.900> could<00:04:16.200> have<00:04:16.260> wasted

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
up um I guess maybe I could have wasted

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.440 
up um I guess maybe I could have wasted
a<00:04:16.979> turn<00:04:17.280> or<00:04:17.489> two<00:04:17.519> since<00:04:17.789> I<00:04:17.910> had<00:04:18.030> light<00:04:18.209> screen

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
a turn or two since I had light screen

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.080 
a turn or two since I had light screen
up<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.720> try<00:04:19.049> to<00:04:19.380> get<00:04:19.530> reflect<00:04:19.950> I<00:04:20.280> suppose<00:04:21.060> that

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
up and try to get reflect I suppose that

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.250 
up and try to get reflect I suppose that
probably<00:04:21.539> would<00:04:21.660> have<00:04:21.720> been<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:21.959> smart

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
probably would have been the smart

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.650 
probably would have been the smart
choice<00:04:22.370> but<00:04:23.370> I<00:04:23.400> get<00:04:23.789> a<00:04:23.820> rock<00:04:24.000> polished<00:04:24.360> up<00:04:24.450> and

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
choice but I get a rock polished up and

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.839 
choice but I get a rock polished up and
there<00:04:24.750> goes<00:04:24.930> my<00:04:25.050> reflection<00:04:25.590> so<00:04:25.889> I<00:04:26.190> needed

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
there goes my reflection so I needed

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.120 
there goes my reflection so I needed
what<00:04:27.030> two<00:04:27.300> more<00:04:27.479> turns<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:28.919> would<00:04:29.070> have

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
what two more turns and I would have

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.629 
what two more turns and I would have
been<00:04:29.250> okay<00:04:29.550> but<00:04:29.930> because<00:04:30.930> reflect<00:04:31.320> is<00:04:31.470> gone<00:04:31.710> I

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
been okay but because reflect is gone I

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.779 
been okay but because reflect is gone I
don't<00:04:33.270> want<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.510> just<00:04:33.660> pass<00:04:33.930> just<00:04:34.650> speed<00:04:35.039> I'm

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
don't want to just pass just speed I'm

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.640 
don't want to just pass just speed I'm
hoping<00:04:36.090> that<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.539> don't<00:04:36.960> I<00:04:37.200> don't<00:04:37.260> know<00:04:37.500> what

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
hoping that I don't I don't know what

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.230 
hoping that I don't I don't know what
I'm<00:04:37.740> thinking<00:04:38.130> I'm<00:04:38.250> thinking<00:04:38.280> really<00:04:38.760> stupid

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
I'm thinking I'm thinking really stupid

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.120 
I'm thinking I'm thinking really stupid
I<00:04:39.389> should<00:04:39.960> have<00:04:40.020> expected<00:04:40.380> extreme<00:04:40.889> speed

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
I should have expected extreme speed

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.370 
I should have expected extreme speed
obviously<00:04:41.280> but<00:04:41.789> I<00:04:41.820> didn't<00:04:42.180> I<00:04:42.389> should<00:04:43.260> have

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
obviously but I didn't I should have

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.680 
obviously but I didn't I should have
expected<00:04:43.620> it<00:04:43.830> would<00:04:43.950> do<00:04:44.099> or<00:04:44.340> hope<00:04:44.849> I<00:04:45.240> guess<00:04:45.539> it

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
expected it would do or hope I guess it

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.440 
expected it would do or hope I guess it
would<00:04:45.780> do<00:04:45.900> less<00:04:46.080> but<00:04:46.139> it<00:04:46.440> did<00:04:46.560> a<00:04:46.590> ton<00:04:46.889> so<00:04:47.450> he's

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
would do less but it did a ton so he's

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:49.940 
would do less but it did a ton so he's
gonna<00:04:48.599> be<00:04:48.720> able<00:04:48.780> to<00:04:48.900> account<00:04:49.260> oh<00:04:49.440> yeah<00:04:49.710> because

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
gonna be able to account oh yeah because

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.860 
gonna be able to account oh yeah because
of<00:04:50.160> his<00:04:50.280> dragon<00:04:50.700> dance<00:04:50.880> i<00:04:51.060> taunt<00:04:51.330> that's<00:04:51.630> what

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
of his dragon dance i taunt that's what

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.469 
of his dragon dance i taunt that's what
because<00:04:52.530> of<00:04:52.650> his<00:04:52.770> dragon<00:04:53.130> dance<00:04:53.340> i<00:04:53.639> taunted

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
because of his dragon dance i taunted

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.690 
because of his dragon dance i taunted
him<00:04:54.630> so<00:04:54.840> he<00:04:54.960> couldn't<00:04:55.590> get<00:04:55.800> more<00:04:56.039> dances<00:04:56.550> up

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
him so he couldn't get more dances up

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.370 
him so he couldn't get more dances up
and<00:04:56.910> therefore<00:04:57.300> make<00:04:57.510> it<00:04:57.660> pointless<00:04:57.960> for<00:04:58.320> me

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
and therefore make it pointless for me

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.330 
and therefore make it pointless for me
to<00:04:58.500> keep<00:04:58.770> boosting<00:04:59.039> and<00:04:59.490> so<00:05:00.419> that<00:05:00.450> hopefully<00:05:00.750> i

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
to keep boosting and so that hopefully i

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.920 
to keep boosting and so that hopefully i
could<00:05:02.340> bring<00:05:02.520> in<00:05:02.669> something<00:05:03.210> else<00:05:03.479> and<00:05:03.810> be

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
could bring in something else and be

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.839 
could bring in something else and be
able<00:05:04.020> to<00:05:04.200> survive<00:05:04.500> with<00:05:04.889> my<00:05:05.070> +<00:05:05.370> speed<00:05:05.639> instead

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
able to survive with my + speed instead

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.480 
able to survive with my + speed instead
um<00:05:06.380> so<00:05:07.380> that<00:05:07.500> was<00:05:07.620> just<00:05:07.650> all<00:05:07.919> kinds<00:05:08.280> of<00:05:08.340> bad

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
um so that was just all kinds of bad

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.890 
um so that was just all kinds of bad
that<00:05:08.700> he<00:05:08.820> had<00:05:09.000> dragon<00:05:09.419> dance<00:05:09.599> that<00:05:09.810> was

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
that he had dragon dance that was

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.020 
that he had dragon dance that was
definitely<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.380> move<00:05:10.620> on<00:05:10.770> his

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
definitely the move on his

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.260 
definitely the move on his
are<00:05:11.150> the<00:05:12.110> game<00:05:12.320> for<00:05:12.860> the<00:05:12.950> win<00:05:13.100> on<00:05:13.250> his<00:05:13.430> part<00:05:13.670> so

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
are the game for the win on his part so

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.180 
are the game for the win on his part so
I<00:05:14.570> have<00:05:15.170> to<00:05:15.320> try<00:05:15.620> and<00:05:15.740> kill<00:05:15.890> it<00:05:15.980> with<00:05:16.070> an

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
I have to try and kill it with an

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.130 
I have to try and kill it with an
extreme<00:05:16.520> speed<00:05:16.730> of<00:05:16.820> my<00:05:16.940> own<00:05:17.090> and<00:05:17.360> I'm<00:05:17.780> not<00:05:17.930> able

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
extreme speed of my own and I'm not able

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.870 
extreme speed of my own and I'm not able
to<00:05:18.350> so<00:05:18.620> I<00:05:18.650> go<00:05:18.890> down<00:05:19.100> as<00:05:19.250> well<00:05:19.430> which<00:05:19.670> really

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
to so I go down as well which really

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.510 
to so I go down as well which really
really<00:05:20.210> really<00:05:20.390> really<00:05:20.510> really<00:05:20.780> sucks<00:05:21.520> so

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
really really really really sucks so

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.400 
really really really really sucks so
that<00:05:22.880> reflect<00:05:23.270> ending<00:05:23.600> when<00:05:23.720> it<00:05:23.840> did<00:05:23.990> was<00:05:24.230> the

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
that reflect ending when it did was the

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.620 
that reflect ending when it did was the
worst<00:05:24.560> possible<00:05:25.010> thing<00:05:25.190> so<00:05:25.550> I<00:05:25.790> get<00:05:26.330> a<00:05:26.360> little

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
worst possible thing so I get a little

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.380 
worst possible thing so I get a little
bit<00:05:26.750> of<00:05:26.780> luck<00:05:27.020> here<00:05:27.220> he<00:05:28.220> brought<00:05:28.490> an<00:05:28.700> uneven

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
bit of luck here he brought an uneven

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.270 
bit of luck here he brought an uneven
Mewtwo<00:05:29.960> he<00:05:30.200> literally<00:05:30.470> just<00:05:30.740> caught<00:05:31.010> it<00:05:31.160> and

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
Mewtwo he literally just caught it and

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.130 
Mewtwo he literally just caught it and
threw<00:05:31.340> it<00:05:31.760> in<00:05:31.910> the<00:05:32.030> battle<00:05:32.330> and<00:05:32.480> forgot<00:05:32.930> that

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
threw it in the battle and forgot that

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.800 
threw it in the battle and forgot that
that<00:05:33.170> was<00:05:33.440> not<00:05:33.470> the<00:05:33.740> correct<00:05:33.980> one<00:05:34.370> so<00:05:34.970> I'm<00:05:35.600> able

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
that was not the correct one so I'm able

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.540 
that was not the correct one so I'm able
to<00:05:36.080> obviously<00:05:36.470> survived<00:05:37.160> it<00:05:37.340> fairly

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
to obviously survived it fairly

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.220 
to obviously survived it fairly
effectively<00:05:38.090> and<00:05:38.300> finish<00:05:38.540> it<00:05:38.630> off<00:05:38.750> but<00:05:39.200> uh

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
effectively and finish it off but uh

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.890 
effectively and finish it off but uh
there<00:05:40.100> goes<00:05:40.310> light<00:05:40.550> screen<00:05:40.940> and<00:05:41.210> this<00:05:41.660> is<00:05:41.780> all

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
there goes light screen and this is all

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.310 
there goes light screen and this is all
I've<00:05:42.050> got<00:05:42.260> is<00:05:42.500> groudon<00:05:42.950> so<00:05:43.340> if<00:05:44.330> I<00:05:44.420> had<00:05:44.660> extra

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
I've got is groudon so if I had extra

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.020 
I've got is groudon so if I had extra
speed<00:05:45.560> and<00:05:45.740> extra<00:05:46.010> attack<00:05:46.310> I<00:05:46.640> could<00:05:46.850> finish

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
speed and extra attack I could finish

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.100 
speed and extra attack I could finish
off<00:05:47.330> this<00:05:47.540> thing<00:05:47.780> but<00:05:48.500> I<00:05:48.530> don't<00:05:49.040> have<00:05:49.310> it<00:05:49.520> so
