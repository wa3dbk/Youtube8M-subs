00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.150
 Hello UTB on the course and today you 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.570
 I'll tell you about the fashion city generator for 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.680
 minecraft you can download it at the bottom 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.650
 link under video 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:26.730
 installs very easily click on 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:28.439
 start in search enter date go to 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.969
 Ramenkah, go to your folder with 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:36.719
 minecraft open this folder later 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.469
 folder with the mod and copy all the files 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.950
 and replace it here really i'm doing it 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.399
 I will not do and all the mod should 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.100
 install then open the shortcut itself 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.710
 fashion 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.870
 This menu opens and such 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.780
 tabs start right away with this 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.770
 here we have all the buildings and 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.080
 objects that will be in our city 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:07.290
 the first is farms that will surround 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.409
 our city, as it were, or not 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.510
 mod and goods whether it will be around our 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.920
 cities later 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.670
 this bridges this if we allow the moat 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.490
 built 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.909
 then across the bridges we can get into our 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.360
 city 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.439
 if you do not stand and you make sense of them 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:32.880
 put no then this 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:35.159
 watchtowers this is our wall which 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.390
 will be around our city will she or 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.659
 no these are different buildings this is a shop and 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.479
 houses and so on and now this mine 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.780
 which will be in our city can 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:53.460
 a special building will be visible and 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:56.909
 so here this function is responsible for 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.250
 what will any valuable blocks in 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.280
 architecture let's say diamond blocks years 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.820
 if we remove it means for decor 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.780
 additional 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:11.340
 it will not and it is responsible for 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.040
 the city will have a lot of chests and if 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.170
 we will disable this feature then the chests are all 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.310
 will be empty if enabled on they mean 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.150
 there will always be something there 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.040
 city ​​generator here we choose which 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.060
 we want the size of the city let's say 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.180
 average 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.700
 here we choose if we ditch there 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:38.190
 have chosen to have warwick cacti 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.860
 it's dug a hole to the very well to the maximum 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.620
 it's just fire good water let us 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.930
 will this water 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.820
 then which emblem of the city is more to me 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:53.700
 like yin and yang then this is what we have 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:59.310
 the lighting will be in the city fiery or with 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.459
 torches choose a torch and then what we have 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.890
 the towers will be what 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.440
 what is shorter on the towers will be with us 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.130
 watchdog either fire burning like torches 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.860
 or let the flag be the flag and then what 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.610
 will be our wall that surrounds the city 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:22.079
 choose let's say a stone is all you need now 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:25.370
 just enter the name of the city and all 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.370
 can generate it 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.440
 Now we are waiting 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:38.590
 the whole city has almost been generated 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.870
 all now we can close open 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.220
 the game 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.960
 look here is our city first only 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:54.630
 have to wait for him for a bit 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:57.690
 progruzilsya and we will already watch it 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.280
 here we are 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.680
 we immediately appear in mode 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.650
 survival i'm probably going to go into 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.650
 another mode to show everything faster 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:18.070
 that means that's what I said about the farm 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:21.250
 that will surround our city here everything 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:27.910
 growing then now the world is loading 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:31.320
 there will be mills but in general everything you see 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:35.340
 yourself here is the emblem we have chosen 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.340
 here it is the bridge 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.410
 if moat 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.700
 if by the way not to build a bridge but even 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.280
 the entrance to the city will not have to 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.690
 build a wall well, rather like something 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:57.440
 rise to think that's the city itself 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:05:00.350
 This as I spoke ordinary buildings type 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.470
 just houses or shops in each 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:07.490
 the city has one single building with 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.450
 towers 1 ford and church here we found 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.550
 one church 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:14.390
 then somewhere must now 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:21.500
 generated in any way ford 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:24.430
 the fort itself and so here are 2 church and somewhere 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.430
 towers must be 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.969
 no in the course of the tower this time no 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.810
 generated 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:40.319
 Well, in general, you see that the houses in the city 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.710
 much they all normal here is to 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.169
 second 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:47.759
 with second floors there are three-story houses 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:53.750
 and in each chest as you see something 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:53.750
 here lies 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.320
 there are also houses with basements there is even 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.350
 houses that are connected to basements 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.890
 but just two houses can be from one mouth 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.980
 other 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.980
 and 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:13.870
 somewhere there must be a mine because 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:18.940
 what I showed you I chose mine to 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:24.280
 created a city but something i see what 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:26.590
 then there is no campaign, and it should be, and she 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:31.210
 maybe either in some ordinary house 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:33.610
 or there is such a building with a green head 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.610
 creepers there there is mine he 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:39.550
 it's closed all the iron doors and there 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.560
 no longer how can I say so 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.870
 get out of there to 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.690
 here love mines now no in general 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:53.160
 mine itself she dug a to the 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:53.160
 the last blocks can be easily 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.970
 to mine 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.970
 all necessary ore 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.240
 Yes, in general, in general, all 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:12.060
 the card is well suited these this generator 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.250
 for massive battles let's say 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.470
 10 to 10 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.930
 one side must destroy some 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:21.270
 key point is different and protect there 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:24.210
 let's say for a while and so by the way 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:26.580
 what about the lighting at night here here if 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.490
 the walls let's say you stand at night here 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.890
 light enough and 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:34.220
 could not sleep here so if 

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:40.190
 you can you can calm 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:43.190
 residents to settle in this city and how would 

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.190
 of all 

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:47.300
 like this 

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.460
 on this kind of everything 

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.630
 oh what house is it even 

00:07:58.969 --> 00:08:01.629
 and cool 

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:07.270
 but in general, that's all thanks for
