the flag on the mic like so try not to

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.300 
the flag on the mic like so try not to
break<00:01:52.649> bits<00:01:52.979> off<00:01:53.220> as<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:53.970> do<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.210> obviously<00:01:58.310> and

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
break bits off as we do it obviously and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.920 
break bits off as we do it obviously and
then<00:01:59.490> your<00:01:59.729> microphone<00:02:00.390> role<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.780> your

then your microphone role in your

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.999 
then your microphone role in your
problem<00:02:01.290> goes<00:02:01.500> away<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:04.200> when<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.560> hand<00:02:04.770> hold

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009

there<00:03:08.110> you<00:03:08.170> go<00:03:08.260> so<00:03:08.500> already<00:03:08.769> you<00:03:09.220> know<00:03:09.900> it

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
there you go so already you know it

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.870 
there you go so already you know it
looks<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.200> bit<00:03:11.230> more<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.590> bit<00:03:13.350> more<00:03:14.350> branded<00:03:14.920> I

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.390 

read<00:03:18.880> so<00:03:19.090> much<00:03:19.239> it<00:03:19.359> need<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.630> come<00:03:19.810> because<00:03:20.019> it

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
read so much it need to come because it

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.479 
read so much it need to come because it
could<00:03:21.400> or<00:03:21.820> should<00:03:21.850> go<00:03:22.420> bit<00:03:22.630> further<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:26.170> it's

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
could or should go bit further so it's

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.009 
could or should go bit further so it's
up<00:03:27.489> bit<00:03:27.700> on<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:27.940> wrong<00:03:28.060> way<00:03:28.239> as<00:03:28.299> well<00:03:28.600> which<00:03:28.900> is

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
up bit on the wrong way as well which is
