00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
 what to have fun 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.900
 the only thing about the game that is 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.220
 important is when you put them 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.660
 bumps you 'll start for the passes 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.300
 exploded behind you every time at 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:28.210
 less as much raises a tooth up that you 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.950
 step on the first day of shooting 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.050
 it was hiding what because it was necessary 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.070
 that I ask good so already myself 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.270
 if I said nothing because I have to 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.350
 to have a little impression of the guy because 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.380
 without anything like is good we are a 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.360
 good team is behind and so it's 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.010
 the detonation already it started to me 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.530
 give the atmosphere because there it was 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.250
 right from the beginning of the film what the young and 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.250
 is already fart 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.449
 so I'm running the cops live 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.379
 they do not come into question the good ones 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.570
 so I do not even have time to discuss 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.809
 or anything it's direct had 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.809
 trace 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.770
 in any case me he he me he amazed me 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.230
 because he has a physical strength he has 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.230
 a dynamism he has an incredible punch 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.320
 you pass and great ethics by 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.070
 report to what makes me he has me 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.020
 really taped on on where does his 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.260
 course and that's something he 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.220
 defends with a lot of conviction 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.220
 and pride 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.710
 beside 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.400
 course it's full of things that 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.020
 can be a lot of things it depends in 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.130
 what state of mind do you have for me 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.209
 it's already a training method 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.700
 that my father passed on to me is a 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.650
 training method that allows you to 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.150
 to face the obstacles of 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.980
 architectures what you can in 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.980
 the intriguing loire 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.980
 the goal is not to try to do 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.690
 like the other evil is against 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.610
 to find oneself and to tell yourself self before 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.990
 practice I thought I could 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.520
 do this or do that now show 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.690
 no I know what I do when I see 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.400
 a trick I know that there I can there I 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.520
 can not I dare not even imagine 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.560
 that david was able to jump from that 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.290
 it seems so extraordinary 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.250
 who did we bring him rami quickly 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.660
 on the scene then to a little puzzled 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.780
 like that I tell him that you think 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.700
 yeah that rips fucking that rips yeah 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.810
 but I think you could leave 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.730
 there and finish there in time I was watching everything 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.800
 disassemble we then looked at huawei 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.070
 absolutely in the name it rips you go 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.070
 what 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.570
 the idea that cyril had in this 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.360
 course was to make a 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.310
 moment when I make a jump and I pass I 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.020
 passes between a small roof that holds 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.970
 just by little bars like that 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.200
 this sequence there I am that it could 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.000
 really well for character 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.250
 of the vice this kind of fluidity of 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.980
 go back to a very small place jumps 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.230
 there to know in one hand and well 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.489
 put it at the last moment 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.989
 turn both struts into 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.720
 which he is here it took first 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.980
 that I really explained to david for 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.790
 who understands her of course that she is 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.900
 do well because she was when 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.400
 even a little bit dangerous it's true 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.599
 that here it was really done 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.940
 live without any special effects 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.230
 so that's a pretty specific thing when 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.489
 even because me on the worry I 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.140
 was pushing too much I was beating my head 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.180
 against control the du stuff and I 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.979
 left henry if I pushed not enough 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.449
 I was against the wall at the time 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.500
 excite and exploit my idea at once 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.389
 we really wonder how we were going 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.910
 do and then I did not say how 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.229
 we're going to do it's very simple it's 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.229
 we're going to do it even though this rap the mans 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.900
 Oh 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.330
 it's not working when the tour 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.520
 it was the first time I did 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.120
 because because I'm walking to 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.730
 instinct and body he will put himself 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.530
 in position of I do not know how 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.730
 explain that's the feeling what's that 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.470
 this is my thing a little violent but these 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.240
 civilians accessit to the con there you see I 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.320
 stop me I would have gone on the 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:02.530
 side i want to question to shit 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:05.070
 previous at war room with these civilians and 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.070
 fund policies
