00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
just get that all the way I was wrong

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.970 
just get that all the way I was wrong
just<00:00:30.179> my<00:00:30.810> reasons<00:00:31.199> were<00:00:31.349> mainly<00:00:31.590> because<00:00:31.830> of

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
just my reasons were mainly because of

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.150 
just my reasons were mainly because of
the<00:00:32.219> weight<00:00:32.399> issues<00:00:33.180> surrounding<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.690> fight

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
the weight issues surrounding the fight

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.040 
the weight issues surrounding the fight
as<00:00:35.160> with<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> lot<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:36.000> other<00:00:36.210> people<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.899> know

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
as with a lot of other people you know

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.690 
as with a lot of other people you know
concerned<00:00:37.620> with<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.770> same<00:00:37.950> thing<00:00:40.489> where<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
concerned with the same thing where the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.310 
concerned with the same thing where the
way<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.030> mark<00:00:42.239> has<00:00:42.450> gained<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.899> weight<00:00:42.930> this

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
way that mark has gained the weight this

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.819 
way that mark has gained the weight this
time<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.860> think<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.640> feel<00:00:44.850> made<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> difference

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
time I think I feel made the difference

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.330 
time I think I feel made the difference
he<00:00:46.829> was<00:00:46.950> doing<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.250> lot<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.430> explosive<00:00:49.340> training

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
he was doing a lot of explosive training

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.040 
he was doing a lot of explosive training
to<00:00:50.789> gain<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> weight<00:00:51.239> whilst<00:00:51.780> keeping

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
to gain the weight whilst keeping

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.529 
to gain the weight whilst keeping
flexibility<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:52.980> his<00:00:53.070> muscles<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.730> trying<00:00:54.449> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
flexibility in his muscles and trying to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.430 
flexibility in his muscles and trying to
maintain<00:00:54.719> speed<00:00:55.399> and<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.520> think<00:00:56.760> he<00:00:56.910> really<00:00:57.239> did

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
maintain speed and I think he really did

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.349 
maintain speed and I think he really did
benefit<00:00:58.440> from<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.070> techniques<00:00:59.489> used<00:00:59.850> to

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
benefit from that the techniques used to

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.390 
benefit from that the techniques used to
gain<00:01:00.570> weight<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.960> time<00:01:02.059> I<00:01:04.100> first<00:01:05.100> watched

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
gain weight this time I first watched

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.570 
gain weight this time I first watched
the<00:01:05.610> fight<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:06.689> my<00:01:06.869> brother<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:08.010> was<00:01:08.280> not

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
ingredients that Marquez was doing

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.679

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
rather well and that the rounds of rain

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.969 
rather well and that the rounds of rain
cloaks<00:01:29.840> when<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.049> wrong<00:01:31.229> when<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.799> fight

to<00:01:37.920> Pacquiao<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.750> thought<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.049> was<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> very

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
to Pacquiao and we thought it was a very

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.460 
to Pacquiao and we thought it was a very
close<00:01:40.770> fight<00:01:41.070> but<00:01:41.909> one<00:01:42.150> which<00:01:42.390> from<00:01:43.200> what<00:01:43.290> we

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
close fight but one which from what we

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.899 
close fight but one which from what we
could<00:01:43.619> see<00:01:44.390> Pacquiao<00:01:45.390> probably<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:46.170> nipped

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
could see Pacquiao probably just nipped

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.109 
could see Pacquiao probably just nipped
got<00:01:47.909> well<00:01:48.149> got<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.659> result<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.579> am<00:01:50.579> since<00:01:50.850> watch

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.550 
least I understand that Manny Pacquiao
was<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.240> great<00:02:23.630> more<00:02:23.810> aggressive<00:02:24.290> come

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
was the great more aggressive come

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.100 
was the great more aggressive come
forward<00:02:24.980> fighted<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.520> fight<00:02:25.700> but<00:02:26.110> for

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:05.560 
Marquez when Mayweather fourth Victor
Ortiz<00:06:01.880> I<00:06:03.250> was<00:06:04.250> a<00:06:04.310> bit<00:06:04.759> uncomfortable<00:06:04.940> watching

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
Ortiz I was a bit uncomfortable watching

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.300 
Ortiz I was a bit uncomfortable watching
Mayweather<00:06:06.110> get<00:06:06.349> pushed<00:06:06.680> back<00:06:06.770> to<00:06:07.009> the<00:06:07.099> ropes

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
Mayweather get pushed back to the ropes

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.189 
Mayweather get pushed back to the ropes
very<00:06:07.610> easily<00:06:07.820> by<00:06:08.150> Ortiz<00:06:08.419> a<00:06:08.479> couple<00:06:08.990> of<00:06:09.080> times

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
very easily by Ortiz a couple of times

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:11.529 
very easily by Ortiz a couple of times
he<00:06:09.440> adds<00:06:09.590> Ortiz<00:06:10.310> just<00:06:10.729> barged<00:06:11.180> him<00:06:11.360> and<00:06:11.449> had

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
he adds Ortiz just barged him and had

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:14.439 
he adds Ortiz just barged him and had
him<00:06:11.570> on<00:06:11.719> the<00:06:11.780> ropes<00:06:12.430> and<00:06:13.430> that<00:06:14.210> would<00:06:14.330> be<00:06:14.360> a

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:14.449 
him on the ropes and that would be a

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:17.290 
him on the ropes and that would be a
concern<00:06:14.630> for<00:06:15.020> me<00:06:15.110> is<00:06:15.139> you<00:06:15.560> know<00:06:16.310> maybe<00:06:17.030> we'll

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
concern for me is you know maybe we'll

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.180 
concern for me is you know maybe we'll
have<00:06:17.539> to<00:06:17.810> make<00:06:18.020> sure<00:06:18.080> he<00:06:18.500> doesn't<00:06:18.740> get<00:06:18.949> backed

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
have to make sure he doesn't get backed

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.360 
have to make sure he doesn't get backed
up<00:06:19.310> onto<00:06:19.520> the<00:06:19.729> ropes<00:06:19.940> and<00:06:20.860> backed<00:06:21.860> up<00:06:22.009> too<00:06:22.219> much

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
up onto the ropes and backed up too much

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.209 
up onto the ropes and backed up too much
because<00:06:22.669> that's<00:06:23.120> when<00:06:23.419> I<00:06:23.449> feel<00:06:24.219> Pacquiao

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:25.219 
because that's when I feel Pacquiao

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:30.999 
because that's when I feel Pacquiao
could<00:06:25.400> nullify<00:06:25.610> that<00:06:28.840> those<00:06:29.840> defense<00:06:30.830> in

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009 
could nullify that those defense in

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:33.399 
could nullify that those defense in
those<00:06:31.159> counter<00:06:31.520> punches<00:06:31.960> and<00:06:32.960> that's<00:06:33.199> what

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:33.409 
those counter punches and that's what

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:34.420 
those counter punches and that's what
Mayweather<00:06:33.589> would<00:06:33.860> have<00:06:33.949> to<00:06:34.070> watch<00:06:34.219> out<00:06:34.400> for

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
Mayweather would have to watch out for

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.409 
Mayweather would have to watch out for
for<00:06:34.909> me<00:06:35.440> so<00:06:36.440> they're<00:06:36.680> the<00:06:36.860> two<00:06:37.070> main

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:37.419 
for me so they're the two main

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:43.020 
for me so they're the two main
regarding<00:06:38.419> Mayweather<00:06:39.729> all<00:06:40.729> in<00:06:41.000> all<00:06:41.740> I
