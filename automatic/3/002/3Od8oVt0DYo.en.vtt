and<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:31.210> is<00:01:31.270> going<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:31.780> have<00:01:31.990> a<00:01:32.020> bunch<00:01:32.320> of

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
and this is going to have a bunch of

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.960 
and this is going to have a bunch of
load<00:01:32.620> and<00:01:32.800> you<00:01:32.890> can<00:01:33.070> see<00:01:33.280> what<00:01:33.460> it's<00:01:33.580> loading

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
load and you can see what it's loading

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.370 
load and you can see what it's loading
is<00:01:34.120> and<00:01:34.420> then<00:01:34.510> it's<00:01:34.660> finally<00:01:34.960> done

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
is and then it's finally done

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.170 
is and then it's finally done
so<00:01:35.710> it<00:01:35.770> was<00:01:35.860> learning<00:01:36.190> to<00:01:36.280> add<00:01:36.430> and<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.940> stuff

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
so it was learning to add and the stuff

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.210 
so it was learning to add and the stuff
that's<00:01:37.330> a<00:01:37.450> little<00:01:37.480> bit<00:01:37.810> more<00:01:38.220> multimedia

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
that's a little bit more multimedia

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.320 
that's a little bit more multimedia
intensive<00:01:39.970> so<00:01:40.680> clearly<00:01:41.680> it<00:01:42.520> came<00:01:42.880> down<00:01:43.150> on<00:01:43.180> the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
intensive so clearly it came down on the

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.110 
intensive so clearly it came down on the
order<00:01:43.600> it<00:01:43.720> should<00:01:43.750> have<00:01:44.400> okay<00:01:45.400> once<00:01:45.670> again<00:01:45.940> got

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
order it should have okay once again got

just saw the surge that the 4G had there
for<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:14.890> little<00:02:15.010> bit<00:02:15.420> but<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.450> was<00:02:16.810> ridiculous

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
for a little bit but that was ridiculous

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:24.690 
for a little bit but that was ridiculous
and<00:02:18.989> it<00:02:19.989> looks<00:02:20.200> like

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.930 

okay<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:25.870> one<00:02:26.020> just<00:02:26.230> finished<00:02:26.700> so<00:02:27.700> let's

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
okay that one just finished so let's

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.839 
okay that one just finished so let's
compare<00:02:28.330> Wi-Fi<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.290> oh<00:02:29.680> my<00:02:30.459> gosh<00:02:30.670> the

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
compare Wi-Fi and oh my gosh the

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.309 
compare Wi-Fi and oh my gosh the
download<00:02:31.360> speed<00:02:31.599> of<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:33.599> 4G<00:02:34.599> network<00:02:35.080> and

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
download speed of the 4G network and

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.140 
download speed of the 4G network and
upload<00:02:35.680> speed<00:02:36.120> crushed<00:02:37.319> Wi-Fi<00:02:38.319> even<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:39.150> ping

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
upload speed crushed Wi-Fi even and ping

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.870 
upload speed crushed Wi-Fi even and ping
was<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.750> little<00:02:41.140> slower<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.739> then<00:02:42.430> here<00:02:42.700> you

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
was a little slower and then here you

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.080 
was a little slower and then here you
can<00:02:43.060> see<00:02:43.239> 3G<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.500> look<00:02:44.950> at<00:02:45.130> that<00:02:45.370> difference<00:02:45.910> I

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
can see 3G so look at that difference I

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.710 
can see 3G so look at that difference I
mean<00:02:46.209> that's<00:02:46.450> absurd<00:02:47.080> not<00:02:47.890> only<00:02:48.370> did<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:49.000> 4G

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
mean that's absurd not only did the 4G

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.610 
mean that's absurd not only did the 4G
beat<00:02:50.470> 3G<00:02:51.100> it<00:02:51.340> crushed<00:02:51.730> Wi-Fi<00:02:52.360> which<00:02:53.050> is<00:02:53.200> absurd

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
beat 3G it crushed Wi-Fi which is absurd

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.589 
beat 3G it crushed Wi-Fi which is absurd
so<00:02:53.980> let's<00:02:54.220> just<00:02:54.400> do<00:02:54.519> restart<00:02:54.970> test<00:02:55.239> one<00:02:55.450> more

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
so let's just do restart test one more

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.860 
so let's just do restart test one more
time<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:55.989> make<00:02:56.140> sure<00:02:56.170> this<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.739> not<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:57.250> fluke

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
time to make sure this is not a fluke

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.229 
time to make sure this is not a fluke
restart<00:02:58.870> restart<00:02:59.850> restart<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:02.790> there<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:03.970> go

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
restart restart restart and there you go

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.100 
restart restart restart and there you go
see<00:03:04.600> it<00:03:04.750> capping<00:03:05.200> out<00:03:05.440> again<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.100> 4G<00:03:06.549> network

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
see it capping out again the 4G network

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:15.180 
see it capping out again the 4G network
so<00:03:08.940> that's<00:03:09.940> pretty<00:03:10.239> impressive<00:03:10.540> folks<00:03:14.190> that's

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
so that's pretty impressive folks that's

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.449 
so that's pretty impressive folks that's
really<00:03:15.640> impressive<00:03:16.980> that's<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.190> kind<00:03:18.400> of

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
they went in reverse order even though

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.450 
they went in reverse order even though
even<00:04:36.139> though<00:04:36.289> I<00:04:36.409> touch<00:04:36.620> the<00:04:36.770> bottom<00:04:37.039> on<00:04:37.159> first

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:42.420 
so one interesting thing to note here is
when<00:04:41.000> we<00:04:41.030> get<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.330> speed<00:04:41.539> test

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
when we get the speed test

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.779 
when we get the speed test
although<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.580> Droid<00:04:43.789> Bionic<00:04:43.939> was<00:04:44.389> quicker<00:04:45.789> it

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
although the Droid Bionic was quicker it

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.119 
although the Droid Bionic was quicker it
had<00:04:47.030> a<00:04:47.060> longer<00:04:47.300> ping<00:04:47.780> time<00:04:48.080> which<00:04:48.500> is<00:04:48.680> probably

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:49.129 
had a longer ping time which is probably

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:51.820 
had a longer ping time which is probably
the<00:04:49.310> reason<00:04:49.490> that<00:04:50.419> the<00:04:50.750> Wi-Fi<00:04:51.319> loaded<00:04:51.710> up

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
the reason that the Wi-Fi loaded up

00:04:51.830 --> 00:05:03.279 
the reason that the Wi-Fi loaded up
quicker<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:02.030> you<00:05:02.479> can<00:05:02.690> see<00:05:02.870> they're<00:05:03.050> all

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
quicker and you can see they're all

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.879 
quicker and you can see they're all
pretty<00:05:03.889> running<00:05:04.819> smoothly<00:05:05.210> which<00:05:05.770> kind<00:05:06.770> of

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
pretty running smoothly which kind of

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.249 
pretty running smoothly which kind of
just<00:05:07.129> makes<00:05:08.030> you<00:05:08.180> want<00:05:08.389> to<00:05:08.449> give<00:05:08.690> Verizon

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
just makes you want to give Verizon

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:13.749 
just makes you want to give Verizon
props<00:05:09.590> because<00:05:09.860> they're<00:05:11.530> there<00:05:12.530> for<00:05:12.830> G<00:05:13.039> and<00:05:13.219> 3G

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
props because they're there for G and 3G

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.180 
props because they're there for G and 3G
videos<00:05:14.180> are<00:05:14.509> pretty<00:05:14.750> much<00:05:14.900> displaying<00:05:15.590> HD

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
videos are pretty much displaying HD

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.010 
videos are pretty much displaying HD

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
video on a mobile device as good as

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:24.129 
video on a mobile device as good as
Wi-Fi<00:05:18.469> so<00:05:18.800> uh<00:05:21.550> I<00:05:22.550> mean<00:05:22.879> this<00:05:23.360> doesn't<00:05:23.750> give<00:05:23.990> you

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
Wi-Fi so uh I mean this doesn't give you

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:29.379 
Wi-Fi so uh I mean this doesn't give you
a<00:05:24.169> great<00:05:27.460> great<00:05:28.460> indication<00:05:29.180> of<00:05:29.300> the

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
a great great indication of the

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:34.540 
a great great indication of the
advantages<00:05:29.930> of<00:05:29.990> 4G<00:05:32.590> but<00:05:33.590> nonetheless<00:05:33.800> none<00:05:34.430> of

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
advantages of 4G but nonetheless none of

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.100 
advantages of 4G but nonetheless none of
these<00:05:34.639> are<00:05:34.849> lagging<00:05:35.090> I<00:05:35.509> want<00:05:35.810> to<00:05:35.900> find

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
these are lagging I want to find

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.240 
these are lagging I want to find
something<00:05:36.770> really<00:05:37.310> intense<00:05:37.879> that<00:05:38.240> will

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
something really intense that will

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.230 
something really intense that will
compare<00:05:40.250> the<00:05:40.370> differences<00:05:40.819> but<00:05:41.000> I<00:05:41.029> guess

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
compare the differences but I guess

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.800 
compare the differences but I guess
speedtest.net<00:05:41.810> is<00:05:42.500> it<00:05:44.139> there<00:05:45.139> you<00:05:45.319> have<00:05:45.500> it

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
speedtest.net is it there you have it

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.860 
speedtest.net is it there you have it
