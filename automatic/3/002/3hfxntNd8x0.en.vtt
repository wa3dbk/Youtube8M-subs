 super cute hear such a little one 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.570
 as long as they don't know how the TV can work 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.629
 it naturally fascinates the men little 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.430
 we 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.680
 a universal remote control 'was now 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.020
 a very handy gift but there 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.960
 than again nobody thought and 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:18.040

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.100
 will succeed 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.100
 I'm also going to get things here 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.400

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.400

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.650
 Dad finally succeeded 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.520
 the competition has already begun but jazzy 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.520

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:50.430
 so what would be up to 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.000

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.750

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.270
 Yes 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.270
 home 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.650
 For the time being Dad's score is still successful 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.580
 not so bad during the break , Barry explains 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.580
 just how that is 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:15.019
 enough of them 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.019
 youtube home 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.750
 By that you can do your best with 10 once 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.090
 you put your hand out as stupid but do 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.250
 your dream yes what do you do about it 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.780
 nothing at all if you do nothing about it 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.180
 can do it even on your birthday 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.560
 it's not about football 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.019
 game of west then they all 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.909
 other competitions that we follow is one 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.659
 match ends then the 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.430
 resume 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.599
 then a talk show starts who 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.220
 is followed by another 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.590
 talk show and then it becomes one again 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.540
 program that analyzes it all and 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.389
 Finally, the sports competition will be over 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.609
 broadcast once and true faith 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:55.620
 me he just had to look again and then 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:59.209
 I think really news that football you know 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.209
 well i'm really done with it 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.520
 then go 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.520
 Yes 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.150
 colijn a 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.760
 walked 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.810
 all support is allowed this time unfortunately 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.430
 don't help 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.710
 the match in istanbul is different then 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.140
 and hoped it could lose as a rai 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.180
 you can't always go in and that will be 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.590
 very much also in the field especially westies 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.880
 fucking mean you have so much 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.880
 matches 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.560
 so much is happening that would be very strange 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.300
 if you would always win that is possible 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.830
 not and by the times you lose 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.030
 You also realize how much fun it is 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.340
 that you think 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.020
 so yes that moment is added to it 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.390
 is not that we all agree 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:46.070
 armor and only our day is ruined 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:48.920
 or so no well that's a shame but yes sometimes 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:54.170
 losing is about signals that belong 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.980
 nevertheless we saw it go next time 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.090
 they win again 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.000
 the men have to go a few more times 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.660
 swallow and yolanthe arion that goes 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.660
 just back to work
