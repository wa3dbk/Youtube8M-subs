00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.580

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.720

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.369

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.529
 to see them good I tell you that you are 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.539

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.880
 minutes with you and that you can 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.939
 share 5 minutes with me some of 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.140
 the capsules are going to do interviews 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.720
 I want to show you things 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.430
 new places and also they 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.500
 I want to give something special like what I'm going 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.060
 to do today and I really never got 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.980
 would have happened if it had not been for 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.570
 two people who wrote to me and I 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.510
 they asked they wrote me in 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.450
 instagram and they are like mayan tree and cate 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.760
 navarro and guess what it will be though 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.040
 Do not believe it I love to cook and if a 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.020
 dessert that I am delicious and I raised the 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.460
 photo to instagram then these two 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.500
 people wrote to me and they told me 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.090
 linda tell us how the recipe is made like this 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.370
 that if you like food like me 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.439
 but on all the desserts look what 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.420
 I have you good at this moment we are 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.820
 where do i 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.350
 or is not what I believe or good so 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.240
 least that's what my husband tells me 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.310
 which is what I 'm going to teach them to do 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.500
 today I know that they will be delicious 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.450
 a banana crepe and it's not any 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.040
 believe not the density is cute and there is 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.860
 a pancake you put a banana then 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.180
 you closed and that's not why they continue 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.700
 watching the video to teach them the 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.250
 recipe 2 good the ingredients are 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.189
 bananas and mass pancakes 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.460
 butter chocolate brown sugar in 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:39.670
 powder or I'm going cousin chocolate cream 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.800
 liquid and optional babies in terms of 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.539
 mass of the pancakes to me really I 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.610
 like to buy the one that is only 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.619
 add water and it's easier and easier 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.479
 but I have a little secret that 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.549
 I'm going to show you how to work 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.470
 good to make the crepes catch a 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.390
 recipient and they put the amount of 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.920
 flour depending on the number of people 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.350
 to which I will give I have my 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.209
 secret and what I do is that I put 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.230
 almond milk so that you 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:05.670
 like or rich 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.170
 vanilla essence then if they have 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.539
 well we did but there is no 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.700
 problem then one that will stir and 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.040
 if you see it very very thick then what 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.170
 you apply a little more milk or water as 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.660
 what are you doing with in a pan what 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.280
 they put on medium high once the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.590
 pan is already hot we put a 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.150
 little butter and we put the dough 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.770
 remember that unlike the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.420
 pancakes because you have to try that the 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.160
 layer that well thin so for that 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.410
 then they can do us well and 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.300
 once in many little holes and that the 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.760
 edge is a bit like tan already 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.950
 they know they have to flip 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.100
 ready to make our banner crepe and 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.660
 now let's peel the bananas cut 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.700
 the banana well in slices like the 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.890
 I turned on the stove and put it on 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.500
 medium and meanwhile I will put the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.720
 butter and I'm going to take two tablespoons 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.000
 to put a capsule place that 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.400
 melts now I picked the brown sugar and 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.890
 I'm going to put two tablespoons in the pan 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.870
 with a spoon and scrambled for more 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.780
 portions obviously leave more 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.790
 butter and they throw more brown sugar 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.980
 this is optional in this case it's going to 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.099
 put a quarter cup of ve 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.500
 and now the bananas seen once placed 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.409
 the bananas then you stir everything for 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.840
 that is impregnated from sugar baileys 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.760
 and the butter still started that 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.040
 boil then it is because you are already 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.660
 expressing then what are we going to put in 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.400
 low so that after he does not go to him 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.129
 to tie the banana and we're going to leave it 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.980
 there and meanwhile we are going to turn on the 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:34.260
 oven hands now good we're almost going to 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.060
 finish my god cute you have the hair 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.709
 different I told them that he saw in my 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.200
 cook yes to wonders 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.540
 now let's use the oven myself instead of 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.250
 use the giant oven because you have to 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.340
 take out the 40,000 pots that one keeps 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.530
 inside and all that what I do is use my 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.870
 little hornito then we're going to 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.989
 preheat to 400 degrees but this is 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.879
 for nate it is in 205 Ossetians we are going to 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.220
 take the crepe adelita that the banana 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.230
 with his sanz and it's delicious we're going to 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.510
 use a room I want to put a little 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.060
 of 1,008 as above and now what 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:10.090
 let's double 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.090
 once when creating it I put it for 5 minutes 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:18.050
 this smells television with a plate 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.050
 nice big and they do something like that 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.500
 and now with him dies sprinkle a 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.690
 as little as milo above 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.460
 and here's my banana crepe ready 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.530
 the credible mona and now then to try 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.110

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.479
