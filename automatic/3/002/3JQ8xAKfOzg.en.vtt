00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.040
 flash i have one question for you i 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.190
 here I found out that 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.350
 t-34 85 rudi he is better in his 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.330
 characteristics not only t-34 85 m 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:23.160
 which is sold for money is 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.189
 straight tank but also t-34 85 which we 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.260
 is in the pumping branch while he 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.349
 also has the level of fights 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.660
 but increased yield and 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.520
 accordingly there he still 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.270
 there is such a unique dog 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.090
 the ball sits here such tanks again 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.090
 German Shepherd Dog Appears 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:48.180
 what is better i start with three moments 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.629
 in fact I will not touch the radio 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.480
 and the engine they are quite normal 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.320
 stock why at all this fuss 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.680
 looking for some 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.930
 guys when long ago and constantly 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.840
 after that, the developers told us about 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.960
 the fact that the technology that will be 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.689
 premium which will be sold for 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:16.189
 money it will not be better than in 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:19.920
 pumping branches but here it is not 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:23.490
 let's see we have the most running 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:31.460
 easy up what you can take like 42 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:36.390
 rotation speed at t-34 85 m 40 at t34 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.909
 top chassis 38 4 degrees speed 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.450
 turning less good 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:49.159
 4 degrees less seems to be going a little 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:54.090
 on the tower t-34 360 review 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.860
 t-34 85 for loot you tanchik 350 well, everything 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.479
 right he must be worse in 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:04.680
 characteristics and here we see it 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:11.210
 Worse attention t-34 85 gun 365 the same 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:15.320
 is the tower would have seemed but 365+ in weight 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:19.970
 tank branching pumping t-34 85 weight on 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:23.330
 800 kilograms more than the guns and a 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.630
 notch less such a feeling that somewhere 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.760
 there the tower was scraped along the sides and now 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.160
 there are 800 kilos less 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.980
 metal but why then booking 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.860
 the same remains unclear and the most 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.510
 interesting question is the trunks 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.370
 pay attention just visually here and 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:49.970
 t-34 85 m 6 level barrel 85 millimeters 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:52.070
 with 53 126 penetration choose t-34 85 see 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.530
 that he has a longer barrel and he basically 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:00.650
 another is also 85 millimeters but dpt and 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.590
 another breakthrough this one with 35 barrel he 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.950
 with the top T-34 85 with with the top 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.420
 barrel and t 34 respectively we have 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:16.280
 t-34 85 m well, so unique more 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:19.580
 armored version of the t-34 85 with pre 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.530
 top barrel and with the possibility of pharma in 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.320
 In principle, everything is in order here. 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.390
 i'm no all in balance machine 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:31.340
 weaker but farmer's like a principle but 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:36.050
 people who also farm by the way 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.990
 is 85 millimeters to 35 but for some reason, 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:45.250
 break it another and damage another and 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:50.530
 the time of the information here is comparable 85 with 30 of 53 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:55.700
 m to and kind 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.710
 144 against 124 180 against 160 sorry 1 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.620
 scatter and time information in principle not 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.460
 I want to look after this marking 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.580
 level six and gun 85 millimeters with 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.110
 53 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:11.870
 yes yes so what the fuck do they have different 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.790
 characteristics well maybe 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.280
 mistaken maybe here should be 7 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.790
 level 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.320
 guns let's find him t-34 85 but 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.180
 then why is she visually then 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.150
 looks like a sixth-level weapon well 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:30.900
 as of 53 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:32.880
 We look and here it is 144 194 180 but on 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.620
 surprise time information so what 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.490
 shit forgive your attention 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.500
 less for what people get such 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.260
 boost and that make it in fact have 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.530
 his time information is less than his review 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.450
 higher his turning speed is higher what 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.590
 there is a dog at all what are you all fast 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:56.630
 rides or this is unclear to me really 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:05:00.360
 game appeared tank which is better than 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.820
 An analogue of his branching seems to me 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.990
 that it is not right I do not know what 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.150
 thinks about it 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.160
 developers if they want they can 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.340
 unsubscribe in the comments under this video 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:14.370
 I would like to know your opinion and I'm on 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.060
 In fact if this tank for nerfed I 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:21.750
 I will be glad to start up or not vertical Rudy 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.700
 let's apat t-34 85 to the same 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.419
 characteristics that u rudy 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:29.370
 well, because it will be somehow more honest 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.860
 here if it's a mistake ok let it 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.289
 a mistake but let's and fix not 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.740
 be sure to fix it in patches before 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:41.070
 future release micro packs but me 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.460
 it seems that there is a certain 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.860
 a moment of such easy injustice 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.380
 let's understand this I have everything with 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.870
 you had a flash put like if you 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.180
 I agree to put dizlike if you co 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.660
 I do not agree and subscribe to 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.910
 channel 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.910
 anyway on this for now
