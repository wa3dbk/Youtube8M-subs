00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 we talk about it's almost almost 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.299
 running the third stage some 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.700
 categories are already ending but the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.219
 second the one that came to san juan was 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.620
 tremendous for some Argentines is the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.750
 case of orly newfoundland everything that happened 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.630
 in this report and what comes in a 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.669
 We tell you a little bit 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.070
 how the dakar has accustomed us 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:23.689
 new stage of surprises entered between 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.910
 Villa Carlos Paz and the Province of San 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.430
 Juan made clear the hardness of the 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.619
 test added to the surprise desertion 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.920
 in the first stage of Spanish nani 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.680
 roma that could return in the second the 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.809
 Qatari Prince Nasser al-Attiyah who 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.899
 started with serious difficulties in the 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.399
 first stage was affirmed in the second 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.920
 winning the first place of the stamp 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:49.070
 to mendocino newfoundland that was 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.080
 relegated after overturning suffered career 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.900
 also for the Emiliano Argentinian 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.439
 spataro the same two wheels we say 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.210
 than changing them in the middle of a dry river and 

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:01.580
 then a little later on in a 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.449
 Very heavy sand path each stand 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.670
 began to lift a little bit of 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.470
 temperature and we had to loosen it 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.440
 until the end we have to come a little 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.400
 more slowly because 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.410
 it was over 100 and we could not finish 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.750
 background, we lost a lot of time between 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.190
 two wheels and the temperature that lifted 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.320
 the car at the end but well up there 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.720
 we came very well Spanish joan for 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.450
 upstairs he was left with another laborious 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.940
 victory in motorcycles is a stage that the 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.220
 you have to catch how to finish it is 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.670
 very important because they are stages that 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.170
 crucial in the dakar and good especially 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.610
 finish what is important in the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.490
 position in fact it seems to me that 10 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.170
 Well, well, you have to go through the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.760
 days and go looking at the rivals as they go and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.400
 watching the race in four three 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.320
 South Americans among the first four 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.200
 the Chilean here comes the Uruguayan the 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.580
 source and the mendocino halpern happy to 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.680
 the stage a very hard stage I think the 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.260
 mature of everything from the cargo and mail 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.680
 very difficult to pass the motorbike I have swallowed 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.190
 a lot of land and 300 kilometers apart 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.190
 given 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.470
 so good tomorrow I hope to be a 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.810
 little more in the peloton that goes faster 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.610
 and good to run fewer risks against 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.290
 the heat an incredible temperature to 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.970
 Although you are from the area, you know 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.010
 a bit the geography of the nearby place 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.849
 at least yes yes I know the geography 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.209
 but so much heat harms the truth that 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.980
 the last kilometers cost me a lot 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.770
 concentration but good had to put 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.860
 head for 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.810
 to be able to get very hard very much 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.810
 heat had never been so hot
