I<00:00:09.900> pulled<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:12.440> just<00:00:13.440> one<00:00:13.710> two<00:00:13.980> burner<00:00:14.429> -<00:00:14.759> and

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
I pulled the just one two burner - and

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.599 
I pulled the just one two burner - and
the<00:00:15.750> pilot<00:00:16.230> assemblies<00:00:16.800> all<00:00:16.980> attached<00:00:17.400> to

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
the pilot assemblies all attached to

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.130 
the pilot assemblies all attached to
that<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:18.029> can<00:00:18.210> take<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.570> loose<00:00:18.750> from<00:00:19.050> the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
that you can take it loose from the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.929 
that you can take it loose from the
screw<00:00:19.529> here<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.869> once<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:21.990> pull<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.470> out

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
screw here and once you pull that out

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.000 
screw here and once you pull that out
the<00:00:23.939> pala<00:00:24.300> tube<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.930> flexible<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.710> bends

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
the pala tube is flexible it bends

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.910 
the pala tube is flexible it bends
around<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.910> then<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.150> can<00:00:27.300> look<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.810> see<00:00:28.590> are

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
around and then you can look and see are

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.580 
around and then you can look and see are
the<00:00:29.130> wires<00:00:29.340> connected<00:00:30.060> good<00:00:30.269> there's<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.289> flame

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
the wires connected good there's a flame

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.240 
the wires connected good there's a flame
sensor<00:00:32.130> wire<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.899> there's<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:35.059> little

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
sensor wire and there's the little

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.400 
sensor wire and there's the little
igniter<00:00:38.250> pilot<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> little<00:00:39.930> orifice

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
igniter pilot it's like a little orifice

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.430 
igniter pilot it's like a little orifice
that<00:00:40.440> shoots<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.100> gas<00:00:41.280> up<00:00:41.579> here<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.120> it's

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
that shoots the gas up here and it's

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.340 
that shoots the gas up here and it's
there<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.770> spark<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.340> start<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.350> we'll

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
there it's a spark to start it so we'll

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.540 
there it's a spark to start it so we'll
do<00:00:46.530> its<00:00:47.399> turn<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.870> sucker<00:00:49.170> back<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.710> but

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
do its turn this that sucker back on but

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.220 
do its turn this that sucker back on but
I'm<00:00:50.640> gonna<00:00:50.760> leave<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.090> gas<00:00:51.300> valve<00:00:51.690> over<00:00:52.050> here

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
I'm gonna leave the gas valve over here

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.979 
I'm gonna leave the gas valve over here
off<00:00:52.440> for<00:00:52.829> safety<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.090> look<00:00:54.239> at<00:00:54.420> my<00:00:54.570> spark

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
off for safety just to look at my spark

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.369 
off for safety just to look at my spark
first<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.210> turn<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.719> up<00:00:57.989> here<00:00:58.199> at<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
first so I turn it on up here at the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.670 
first so I turn it on up here at the
switch<00:00:59.090> and<00:01:00.090> we<00:01:00.539> see<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.989> got<00:01:01.170> any<00:01:01.350> kind<00:01:01.559> of

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
switch and we see if I got any kind of

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.660 
switch and we see if I got any kind of
real<00:01:01.859> spark<00:01:02.280> if<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.180> look<00:01:03.390> real<00:01:03.660> close<00:01:04.670> ain't

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
real spark if you look real close ain't

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.399 
real spark if you look real close ain't
got<00:01:05.909> no<00:01:06.090> spark<00:01:06.450> at<00:01:06.630> all<00:01:06.780> but<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.140> hear<00:01:07.380> a

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
got no spark at all but I hear a

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.570 
got no spark at all but I hear a
clicking<00:01:07.799> somewhere<00:01:08.400> another<00:01:10.070> so<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.100> must

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
clicking somewhere another so that must

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.039 
clicking somewhere another so that must
be<00:01:11.670> my<00:01:11.939> problem

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.399 

yeah<00:01:16.070> no<00:01:16.250> spark<00:01:16.640> there<00:01:16.909> I<00:01:17.229> definitely<00:01:18.229> hear<00:01:18.350> a

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
yeah no spark there I definitely hear a

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.760 
yeah no spark there I definitely hear a
clicking<00:01:20.469> man<00:01:21.469> so<00:01:22.070> we<00:01:22.250> went<00:01:22.549> down<00:01:22.789> here<00:01:23.119> oh<00:01:23.770> oh

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
clicking man so we went down here oh oh

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.639 
clicking man so we went down here oh oh
I<00:01:24.950> can't<00:01:25.100> show<00:01:25.700> you<00:01:25.729> for<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.090> light<00:01:26.469> you<00:01:27.469> see

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
I can't show you for the light you see

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.120 
I can't show you for the light you see
that<00:01:27.890> it's<00:01:28.789> a<00:01:28.909> very<00:01:28.939> bottom<00:01:29.689> it's<00:01:30.619> arcing

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
that it's a very bottom it's arcing

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.010 
that it's a very bottom it's arcing
across<00:01:31.960> not<00:01:32.960> only<00:01:33.020> axle<00:01:34.479> night<00:01:35.479> and<00:01:35.719> I'm<00:01:35.810> gonna

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
across not only axle night and I'm gonna

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.410 
across not only axle night and I'm gonna
try<00:01:36.319> and<00:01:36.469> get<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.590> better<00:01:36.799> pic<00:01:37.159> you<00:01:37.880> love<00:01:38.090> it<00:01:38.209> for

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
try and get a better pic you love it for

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.620 
try and get a better pic you love it for
you<00:01:38.600> yeah<00:01:39.560> when<00:01:39.799> I<00:01:39.829> move<00:01:40.100> it<00:01:40.310> but<00:01:40.939> I<00:01:41.119> got<00:01:41.390> that

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
you yeah when I move it but I got that

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.139 
you yeah when I move it but I got that
night<00:01:42.130> it's<00:01:43.130> arcing<00:01:43.759> we're<00:01:43.909> supposed<00:01:44.329> to

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
night it's arcing we're supposed to

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.029 
night it's arcing we're supposed to
arcing<00:01:47.149> across<00:01:48.429> it's<00:01:49.429> arcing<00:01:49.849> across<00:01:49.939> from

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
arcing across it's arcing across from

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.589 
arcing across it's arcing across from
whatever<00:01:52.039> reason<00:01:52.520> from<00:01:52.729> here<00:01:52.970> across<00:01:53.299> to

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
whatever reason from here across to

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:55.660 
whatever reason from here across to
there<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.049> I'm<00:01:54.890> gonna<00:01:55.009> look<00:01:55.189> into<00:01:55.399> that<00:01:55.489> a

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
there so I'm gonna look into that a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.399 
there so I'm gonna look into that a
little<00:01:55.849> bit<00:01:55.970> closer<00:01:56.329> and<00:01:56.630> probably<00:01:56.929> wrap<00:01:57.170> that

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
little bit closer and probably wrap that

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.440 
little bit closer and probably wrap that
up<00:01:57.439> with<00:01:57.770> something<00:01:58.220> put<00:01:58.970> it<00:01:59.090> back<00:01:59.270> together

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
up with something put it back together

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.309 
up with something put it back together
and<00:01:59.899> get<00:02:00.049> them<00:02:00.259> some<00:02:00.470> hot<00:02:00.619> water<00:02:00.799> back<00:02:01.159> go<00:02:01.369> on

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
and get them some hot water back go on

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.399 
and get them some hot water back go on
so<00:02:03.319> anyway<00:02:04.450> better<00:02:05.450> check<00:02:05.750> that<00:02:05.780> nighter

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
so anyway better check that nighter

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.589 
so anyway better check that nighter
be<00:02:07.219> sure<00:02:07.399> to<00:02:07.579> always<00:02:07.700> check<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:08.209> with<00:02:08.329> the<00:02:08.420> gas

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
be sure to always check it with the gas

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.100 
be sure to always check it with the gas
which<00:02:09.079> ear<00:02:09.410> off<00:02:09.819> unless<00:02:10.819> you<00:02:11.090> want<00:02:11.299> to<00:02:11.390> toss<00:02:11.780> it

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
which ear off unless you want to toss it

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.580 
which ear off unless you want to toss it
to<00:02:12.319> light<00:02:12.739> and<00:02:13.220> check<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.730> flame<00:02:14.000> sensor<00:02:14.590> all

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
to light and check the flame sensor all

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.650 
to light and check the flame sensor all
right<00:02:15.709> that's<00:02:16.579> all<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:16.940> want<00:02:17.329> to<00:02:17.450> show<00:02:17.599> you

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
right that's all I want to show you

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.280 
right that's all I want to show you
sorry<00:02:17.989> mo<00:02:18.230> films<00:02:18.620> are<00:02:18.769> so<00:02:18.950> shaky
