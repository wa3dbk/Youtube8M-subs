 the second part but then since it looks 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.710
 I used it, I bought it, so what 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.350
 more sure is that you have to read the 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.030
 first book because there are times that I do not 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.710
 agree very well the league so much so 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.050
 who is reading the first book and 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.040
 ending it with this second 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.320

 they write as more pulling to what 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.469
 year everything that is a genre that in 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.180
 Truth has still read me always 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:20.849
 focused is with books for young people 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.870

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.630
 four books and it's a book that has 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.760
 Mixed opinions people like 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.049

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.350

 I'm going to show you what I know I wanted 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.550
 understand they have a lot of time but 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.860
 Well, they had not done it because they are 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.229
 many are a bit expensive 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.360
 but for a long time also the 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.210
 I wanted to reread everything every time 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.069
 I see the movies I go to the park of desire 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.349
 to read it and I only have the last two 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:39.930

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.750
 average all boxes have the 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.279
 metro boxes with books but it's 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.289
