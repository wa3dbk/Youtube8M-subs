the hunted I was running for but I mean

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.380 
the hunted I was running for but I mean
mainly<00:04:13.350> because<00:04:13.709> of<00:04:14.190> delver<00:04:14.760> I<00:04:14.910> changed<00:04:15.330> my

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
mainly because of delver I changed my

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.000 
mainly because of delver I changed my
deck<00:04:15.630> around<00:04:15.780> because<00:04:16.260> everybody<00:04:16.769> runs

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
deck around because everybody runs

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.710 
deck around because everybody runs
delver<00:04:17.900> so<00:04:18.900> I<00:04:19.320> took<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.760> fourth<00:04:21.090> one<00:04:21.299> out<00:04:21.450> just

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
delver so I took the fourth one out just

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.300 
delver so I took the fourth one out just
because<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:22.290> wanted<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.710> get<00:04:22.919> some<00:04:23.190> more

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
because I wanted to get some more

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.900 
because I wanted to get some more
creatures<00:04:23.700> into<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.450> deck<00:04:24.830> because<00:04:25.830> if<00:04:26.760> you

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
creatures into the deck because if you

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.730 
creatures into the deck because if you
can't<00:04:27.120> have<00:04:27.300> creatures<00:04:27.870> to<00:04:28.050> cast<00:04:28.289> this<00:04:28.530> on

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
can't have creatures to cast this on

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.830 
can't have creatures to cast this on
there's<00:04:29.039> no<00:04:29.190> use<00:04:29.400> of<00:04:29.580> you<00:04:29.850> know<00:04:29.970> miracle<00:04:30.630> in<00:04:30.750> it

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
there's no use of you know miracle in it

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.020 
there's no use of you know miracle in it
so<00:04:31.080> I<00:04:31.350> went<00:04:31.919> down<00:04:32.039> to<00:04:32.310> a<00:04:32.340> three<00:04:32.610> of<00:04:32.640> and<00:04:32.970> it

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
so I went down to a three of and it

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.600 
so I went down to a three of and it
seemed<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.479> actually<00:04:33.780> work<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:34.080> lot<00:04:34.229> better

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
seemed to actually work a lot better

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.420 
seemed to actually work a lot better
then<00:04:35.610> of<00:04:35.729> course<00:04:35.940> for<00:04:36.300> green<00:04:36.840> Sun<00:04:37.110> zenith<00:04:37.440> it's

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
then of course for green Sun zenith it's

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.950 
then of course for green Sun zenith it's
basically<00:04:38.789> just<00:04:38.880> a<00:04:39.150> creature<00:04:39.390> in<00:04:39.630> your<00:04:39.720> hand

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
basically just a creature in your hand

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.350 
basically just a creature in your hand
because<00:04:40.229> everything<00:04:40.950> is<00:04:41.070> green<00:04:41.280> so<00:04:41.360> whatever

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
because everything is green so whatever

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.790 
because everything is green so whatever
you<00:04:42.510> need<00:04:42.720> if<00:04:42.900> you<00:04:42.990> have<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.229> metaphor<00:04:43.680> it

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
you need if you have the metaphor it

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.670 
you need if you have the metaphor it
there<00:04:44.190> you<00:04:44.340> go<00:04:45.470> so<00:04:46.470> that<00:04:47.010> is<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:47.430> main<00:04:47.820> board

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
there you go so that is the main board

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.860 
there you go so that is the main board
let's<00:04:49.680> go<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:50.010> sideboard<00:04:50.550> here<00:04:50.820> I've<00:04:51.660> got

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870
