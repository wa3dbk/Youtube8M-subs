00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
and it brings them all up over here off

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.929 
and it brings them all up over here off
the<00:01:40.479> side<00:01:40.929> this<00:01:41.350> is<00:01:41.590> extremely<00:01:42.490> similar<00:01:42.759> to

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
the side this is extremely similar to

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.770 
the side this is extremely similar to
how<00:01:43.539> it<00:01:43.630> would<00:01:43.749> work<00:01:43.780> in<00:01:44.229> your<00:01:45.130> actual<00:01:45.780> you

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
how it would work in your actual you

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.379 
how it would work in your actual you
know<00:01:46.810> online<00:01:47.189> computer<00:01:48.189> device<00:01:48.670> and<00:01:48.999> the

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:49.389 
know online computer device and the

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:51.029 
know online computer device and the
program<00:01:49.749> in<00:01:49.869> that<00:01:49.899> so<00:01:50.560> let's<00:01:50.709> say<00:01:50.770> I<00:01:50.829> want<00:01:51.009> to

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
program in that so let's say I want to

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.190 
program in that so let's say I want to
go<00:01:51.429> ahead<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:51.639> just<00:01:51.999> narrow<00:01:52.810> down<00:01:52.959> the<00:01:53.079> search

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
go ahead and just narrow down the search

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.349 
go ahead and just narrow down the search
and<00:01:53.499> look<00:01:53.709> for<00:01:53.889> a<00:01:53.950> specific<00:01:54.100> card<00:01:54.579> I<00:01:54.789> could<00:01:55.119> go

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
and look for a specific card I could go

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.989 
and look for a specific card I could go
ahead<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.810> start<00:01:56.020> typing<00:01:56.259> it<00:01:56.560> in<00:01:56.679> here<00:01:56.950> so<00:01:57.759> if

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:57.999 
ahead and start typing it in here so if

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:02.129 
ahead and start typing it in here so if
I<00:01:58.090> wanted<00:01:58.359> to<00:01:59.609> do<00:02:00.609> where<00:02:00.850> is<00:02:01.119> I'm<00:02:01.779> looking<00:02:02.049> at

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:02.139 
I wanted to do where is I'm looking at

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:03.510 
I wanted to do where is I'm looking at
this<00:02:02.259> upside<00:02:02.560> down<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:02.889> it's<00:02:03.009> kind<00:02:03.249> of<00:02:03.429> a

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
this upside down so it's kind of a

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.629 
this upside down so it's kind of a
little<00:02:03.759> hard<00:02:04.029> for<00:02:04.090> me<00:02:04.420> as<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:06.130> can<00:02:06.219> see<00:02:06.369> as<00:02:06.490> I

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:06.639 
little hard for me as you can see as I

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:08.249 
little hard for me as you can see as I
start<00:02:06.849> to<00:02:06.939> type<00:02:07.119> out<00:02:07.329> the<00:02:07.479> word<00:02:07.509> it<00:02:07.959> actually

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
start to type out the word it actually

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.600 
start to type out the word it actually
narrows<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.560> field<00:02:08.920> down<00:02:09.099> just<00:02:09.369> like<00:02:09.459> it

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
narrows the field down just like it

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.360 
narrows the field down just like it
would<00:02:09.729> in<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:09.970> real<00:02:10.330> program<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:12.220> way<00:02:12.340> I

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
would in the real program and that way I

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.100 
would in the real program and that way I
can<00:02:12.640> go<00:02:12.790> out<00:02:12.940> here<00:02:13.150> toward<00:02:13.480> my<00:02:13.569> treeborn<00:02:13.930> is

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
can go out here toward my treeborn is

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.350 
can go out here toward my treeborn is
and<00:02:14.349> I<00:02:14.590> can<00:02:14.740> just<00:02:14.920> slide<00:02:15.160> them<00:02:15.400> into<00:02:15.640> the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
and I can just slide them into the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.650 
and I can just slide them into the
actual<00:02:16.780> deck<00:02:17.200> which<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.890> kind<00:02:18.370> of<00:02:18.430> cool<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:18.820> go

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
actual deck which is kind of cool and go

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.030 
actual deck which is kind of cool and go
back<00:02:19.840> out<00:02:19.990> here<00:02:20.350> kind<00:02:20.620> of

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
back out here kind of

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.850 
back out here kind of
refine<00:02:21.579> my<00:02:21.730> search<00:02:21.969> it's<00:02:22.810> really<00:02:23.200> capable<00:02:23.379> of

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
refine my search it's really capable of

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.099 
refine my search it's really capable of
building<00:02:24.189> a<00:02:24.250> deck<00:02:24.459> in<00:02:24.640> any<00:02:24.909> way<00:02:25.180> shape<00:02:25.959> and

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
building a deck in any way shape and

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.619 
building a deck in any way shape and
form<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.469> you<00:02:26.650> do<00:02:26.859> on<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.219> actual<00:02:27.640> game<00:02:28.390> on

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
form that you do on the actual game on

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.360 
form that you do on the actual game on
the<00:02:28.750> computer<00:02:29.260> so<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.829> found<00:02:30.099> kind<00:02:30.250> of

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
the computer so that I found kind of

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.490 
the computer so that I found kind of
cool<00:02:30.549> the<00:02:30.700> only<00:02:30.909> gripe<00:02:31.299> I<00:02:31.450> have<00:02:31.480> really<00:02:32.290> with

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
cool the only gripe I have really with

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.229 
cool the only gripe I have really with
the<00:02:32.769> way<00:02:32.859> that<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.099> build<00:02:33.280> your<00:02:33.489> deck<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:33.939> that

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
the way that you build your deck is that

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.839 
the way that you build your deck is that
these<00:02:34.569> don't<00:02:34.780> create<00:02:34.989> a<00:02:35.079> new<00:02:35.379> open<00:02:35.950> box<00:02:36.340> bigger

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
these don't create a new open box bigger

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.280 
these don't create a new open box bigger
text<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.420> everything<00:02:37.480> that<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:37.989> can<00:02:38.109> more

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
text and everything that you can more

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.410 
text and everything that you can more
easily<00:02:38.409> move<00:02:38.859> cards<00:02:39.220> in<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.489> out<00:02:39.579> of<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:40.329> I'm

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
easily move cards in and out of so I'm

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.970 
easily move cards in and out of so I'm
going<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.569> jump<00:02:40.750> ahead<00:02:40.840> real<00:02:41.170> fast<00:02:41.409> and<00:02:41.739> build

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
going to jump ahead real fast and build

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.589 
going to jump ahead real fast and build
an<00:02:42.129> actual<00:02:42.340> deck<00:02:42.760> for<00:02:42.939> you<00:02:43.030> guys<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.329> show<00:02:43.510> you

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
an actual deck for you guys and show you

an actual deck for you guys and show you
what<00:02:43.720> that's<00:02:43.810> like<00:02:44.129> alright<00:02:45.129> so<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.340> just<00:02:45.730> built

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
what that's like alright so I just built

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.629 
what that's like alright so I just built
a<00:02:46.510> heraldic<00:02:47.139> beast<00:02:47.379> deck<00:02:47.590> here<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.189> in<00:02:48.459> all

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
a heraldic beast deck here it is in all

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.399 
a heraldic beast deck here it is in all
its<00:02:48.670> mighty<00:02:49.120> glory<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.840> does<00:02:50.049> take<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.230> little

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
its mighty glory it does take a little

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:51.990 
its mighty glory it does take a little
while<00:02:50.650> using<00:02:51.069> it<00:02:51.189> because<00:02:51.370> you're<00:02:51.579> not<00:02:51.639> on<00:02:51.819> an

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
while using it because you're not on an

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.580 
while using it because you're not on an
actual<00:02:52.150> keyboard<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:52.959> can't<00:02:53.170> really<00:02:53.349> type

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
actual keyboard so you can't really type

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.289 
actual keyboard so you can't really type
out<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:53.920> names<00:02:54.129> quite<00:02:54.579> as<00:02:54.700> fast<00:02:54.879> as<00:02:55.090> you<00:02:55.180> would

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
out the names quite as fast as you would

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:56.879 
out the names quite as fast as you would
on<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:55.659> but<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:55.930> is<00:02:56.019> still<00:02:56.170> pretty<00:02:56.349> fun<00:02:56.590> to

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:56.889 
on that but it is still pretty fun to

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:58.860 
on that but it is still pretty fun to
kind<00:02:57.069> of<00:02:57.099> go<00:02:57.220> through<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.760> make<00:02:58.329> the<00:02:58.480> deck<00:02:58.659> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
kind of go through and make the deck the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.179 
kind of go through and make the deck the
way<00:02:58.989> that<00:02:59.169> you<00:02:59.260> want<00:02:59.470> to<00:02:59.650> so<00:02:59.889> I'm<00:02:59.950> going<00:03:00.069> to<00:03:00.099> go

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:00.189 
way that you want to so I'm going to go

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.429 
way that you want to so I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:00.669> exit<00:03:01.030> right<00:03:01.180> here<00:03:01.419> and<00:03:01.599> then<00:03:02.349> we're

when it shows up but you don't ever sign
in<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:14.980> don't<00:03:15.189> have<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.879> same<00:03:16.090> stats<00:03:16.389> that

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
in you don't have the same stats that

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.849 
in you don't have the same stats that
you<00:03:16.599> would<00:03:16.780> on<00:03:16.870> your<00:03:16.900> normal<00:03:17.290> program<00:03:17.620> on<00:03:17.769> your

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
you would on your normal program on your

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.379 
you would on your normal program on your
computer<00:03:17.919> I<00:03:18.489> don't<00:03:19.030> know<00:03:19.090> if<00:03:19.180> that's<00:03:19.329> like

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
computer I don't know if that's like

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.089 
computer I don't know if that's like
going<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.750> eventually<00:03:20.230> change<00:03:20.260> but<00:03:20.709> as<00:03:20.829> it<00:03:20.980> is

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
going to eventually change but as it is

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.759 
going to eventually change but as it is
right<00:03:21.250> now<00:03:21.280> that's<00:03:21.790> not<00:03:22.299> how<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:22.659> works<00:03:22.900> so<00:03:23.590> we

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
right now that's not how it works so we

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.289 
right now that's not how it works so we
just<00:03:23.950> go<00:03:24.099> ahead<00:03:24.189> and<00:03:24.700> go<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.120> connect<00:03:25.569> and

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
just go ahead and go to connect and

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.180 
just go ahead and go to connect and
searching<00:03:28.299> for<00:03:28.479> an<00:03:28.569> opponent<00:03:28.799> so<00:03:29.799> hopefully

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
searching for an opponent so hopefully

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.129 
searching for an opponent so hopefully
we<00:03:30.280> find<00:03:30.430> someone<00:03:30.790> pretty<00:03:31.030> fast<00:03:31.269> which<00:03:31.989> it

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
we find someone pretty fast which it

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:33.960 
we find someone pretty fast which it
looks<00:03:32.290> like<00:03:32.440> we<00:03:32.590> did<00:03:32.769> and<00:03:33.129> as<00:03:33.639> you<00:03:33.760> can<00:03:33.849> see<00:03:33.940> I

just going to go so forth and so on kind

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.189 
just going to go so forth and so on kind
of<00:04:13.840> like<00:04:13.989> this<00:04:14.699> I'm<00:04:15.699> not<00:04:15.909> going<00:04:16.060> to<00:04:16.180> use<00:04:16.359> a<00:04:16.750> full

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
of like this I'm not going to use a full

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.439 
of like this I'm not going to use a full
game<00:04:17.470> so<00:04:18.430> as<00:04:18.519> you<00:04:18.609> can<00:04:18.699> see<00:04:18.880> it's<00:04:19.000> extremely

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
game so as you can see it's extremely

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.089 
game so as you can see it's extremely
similar<00:04:19.659> to<00:04:19.810> how<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.109> play<00:04:20.199> the<00:04:20.650> actual<00:04:20.979> game

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
similar to how you play the actual game

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:22.469 
similar to how you play the actual game
on<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:21.549> computer<00:04:21.880> right<00:04:21.970> I<00:04:22.090> guess<00:04:22.210> my<00:04:22.330> biggest

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
on the computer right I guess my biggest

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:23.969 
on the computer right I guess my biggest
gripe<00:04:22.780> with<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.080> program<00:04:23.349> overall<00:04:23.710> is<00:04:23.860> the

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
gripe with the program overall is the

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.080 
gripe with the program overall is the
one<00:04:24.130> that<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.280> mentioned<00:04:24.370> earlier

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
one that I mentioned earlier

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.399 
one that I mentioned earlier
I<00:04:25.240> prefer<00:04:25.659> that<00:04:25.780> whenever<00:04:26.020> you<00:04:26.199> go<00:04:26.349> to

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:26.409 
I prefer that whenever you go to

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:28.080 
I prefer that whenever you go to
activate<00:04:27.070> something<00:04:27.400> that<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:27.639> would<00:04:27.759> open<00:04:28.000> a

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
activate something that it would open a

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.850 
activate something that it would open a
separate<00:04:28.419> window<00:04:28.599> up<00:04:28.930> with<00:04:29.080> bigger<00:04:29.320> text<00:04:29.620> to

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
separate window up with bigger text to

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.440 
separate window up with bigger text to
just<00:04:30.070> make<00:04:30.219> it<00:04:30.340> that<00:04:30.490> much<00:04:30.520> easier<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.330> know

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
just make it that much easier to know

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.399 
just make it that much easier to know
what<00:04:31.479> you're<00:04:31.779> doing<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:32.139> what<00:04:32.229> you're

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:32.409 
what you're doing and what you're

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:33.310 
what you're doing and what you're
playing

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
playing

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.410 
playing
I'm<00:04:33.560> actually<00:04:33.770> on<00:04:33.950> the<00:04:34.280> Samsung<00:04:34.730> Galaxy<00:04:34.760> Note

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
I'm actually on the Samsung Galaxy Note

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.810 
I'm actually on the Samsung Galaxy Note
3<00:04:35.450> which<00:04:36.140> is<00:04:36.170> a<00:04:36.290> pretty<00:04:36.500> big<00:04:36.740> screen<00:04:37.070> too<00:04:37.340> but<00:04:37.790> I

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
3 which is a pretty big screen too but I

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.950 
3 which is a pretty big screen too but I
still<00:04:37.970> have<00:04:38.090> problems<00:04:38.180> distinguishing

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
still have problems distinguishing

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.840 
still have problems distinguishing
between<00:04:38.990> the<00:04:39.380> small<00:04:39.650> text<00:04:40.070> where<00:04:40.340> exactly<00:04:40.610> I'm

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
between the small text where exactly I'm

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.610 
between the small text where exactly I'm
supposed<00:04:41.150> to<00:04:41.210> click<00:04:41.480> I<00:04:41.720> can<00:04:41.990> only<00:04:42.140> imagine<00:04:42.410> how

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
supposed to click I can only imagine how

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.900 
supposed to click I can only imagine how
much<00:04:42.830> harder<00:04:42.890> that<00:04:43.310> would<00:04:43.430> be<00:04:43.550> for<00:04:43.760> people

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
much harder that would be for people

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.000 
much harder that would be for people
with<00:04:44.150> a<00:04:44.180> smaller<00:04:44.540> screen<00:04:44.750> phone<00:04:45.170> and<00:04:45.710> also<00:04:45.860> I

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
with a smaller screen phone and also I

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.710 
with a smaller screen phone and also I
prefer<00:04:46.400> that<00:04:46.550> you'd<00:04:46.700> be<00:04:46.790> able<00:04:46.880> to<00:04:47.030> sign<00:04:47.270> on<00:04:47.420> use

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
prefer that you'd be able to sign on use

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.090 
prefer that you'd be able to sign on use
the<00:04:47.870> same<00:04:48.020> account<00:04:48.350> that<00:04:48.410> you<00:04:48.590> would<00:04:48.830> on<00:04:49.040> your

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
the same account that you would on your
