the<00:05:25.740> actually<00:05:26.010> transform<00:05:26.550> this<00:05:26.670> Pete<00:05:26.940> I<00:05:27.060> think

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
the actually transform this Pete I think

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.610 
the actually transform this Pete I think
it's<00:05:27.810> a<00:05:27.900> very<00:05:28.020> nice<00:05:28.230> piece<00:05:29.030> full<00:05:30.030> range<00:05:30.240> of

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
very good articulation program

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.850 
very good articulation program
lengthwise<00:05:34.820> pretty<00:05:35.820> limited<00:05:36.330> but<00:05:36.480> our<00:05:37.380> cities

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
lengthwise pretty limited but our cities

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.320 
lengthwise pretty limited but our cities
it<00:05:38.340> doesn't<00:05:38.700> really<00:05:38.790> affect<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.270> overall

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
it doesn't really affect the overall

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.840 
it doesn't really affect the overall
look<00:05:39.840> of<00:05:40.050> them<00:05:40.740> body<00:05:40.980> it<00:05:41.250> comes<00:05:41.490> with<00:05:41.610> a<00:05:41.670> lot<00:05:41.820> of

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
look of them body it comes with a lot of

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.240 
look of them body it comes with a lot of
weapons<00:05:42.480> as<00:05:42.690> well<00:05:42.720> a<00:05:43.110> lot<00:05:43.440> of<00:05:43.530> physic<00:05:43.920> in<00:05:44.100> the

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
weapons as well a lot of physic in the

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.610 
weapons as well a lot of physic in the
change<00:05:44.520> with<00:05:44.730> no<00:05:45.390> were<00:05:45.570> these<00:05:45.720> are<00:05:45.930> this<00:05:46.110> this

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
change with no were these are this this

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.280 
change with no were these are this this
two-piece<00:05:47.160> fully<00:05:47.960> articulated<00:05:48.960> finger

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
two-piece fully articulated finger

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.200 
two-piece fully articulated finger
joints<00:05:49.620> these<00:05:49.890> are<00:05:50.130> very<00:05:50.580> very<00:05:50.730> interesting

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
joints these are very very interesting

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.910 
joints these are very very interesting
and<00:05:53.090> well<00:05:54.090> I<00:05:54.120> say<00:05:54.360> this<00:05:54.810> this<00:05:55.110> is<00:05:55.170> this<00:05:55.590> piece

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
and well I say this this is this piece

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.710 
and well I say this this is this piece
is<00:05:56.130> really<00:05:56.340> very<00:05:56.580> very<00:05:56.790> nice<00:05:57.060> piece<00:05:57.360> and<00:05:57.570> I'm

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
is really very very nice piece and I'm

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.570 
is really very very nice piece and I'm
doing<00:05:58.080> a<00:05:58.230> review<00:05:58.530> for<00:05:58.680> right<00:05:58.800> now<00:05:58.830> in

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
doing a review for right now in

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.880 
doing a review for right now in
anticipation<00:05:59.850> of<00:06:00.480> what's<00:06:00.750> coming<00:06:01.020> up<00:06:01.290> GX

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
anticipation of what's coming up GX

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.310 
anticipation of what's coming up GX
fifty<00:06:02.250> three<00:06:02.550> five<00:06:02.910> times<00:06:03.120> three<00:06:03.390> both<00:06:03.600> of

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
fifty three five times three both of

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.450 
fifty three five times three both of
them<00:06:04.560> gonna<00:06:04.710> complement<00:06:05.160> each<00:06:05.250> other<00:06:05.370> very

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
them gonna complement each other very

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.400 
them gonna complement each other very
well<00:06:05.670> and<00:06:05.940> I<00:06:06.000> know<00:06:06.630> that<00:06:06.810> nine<00:06:06.990> times<00:06:07.140> three<00:06:07.320> is

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
well and I know that nine times three is

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.250 
well and I know that nine times three is
going<00:06:07.590> to<00:06:07.680> be<00:06:07.770> as<00:06:07.890> tall<00:06:08.220> as<00:06:08.520> number<00:06:08.940> three<00:06:09.260> in

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
going to be as tall as number three in

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.140 
going to be as tall as number three in
case<00:06:10.530> that<00:06:10.860> so<00:06:11.070> we<00:06:11.220> might<00:06:11.370> know<00:06:11.640> them<00:06:11.970> but

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
case that so we might know them but

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.940 
case that so we might know them but
actually<00:06:12.390> represents<00:06:12.960> the<00:06:13.080> moon<00:06:13.320> and<00:06:13.590> Python

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
actually represents the moon and Python

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.950 
actually represents the moon and Python
three<00:06:14.160> represents<00:06:14.550> the<00:06:14.610> Sun<00:06:14.820> so<00:06:15.030> second<00:06:15.420> Moon

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
three represents the Sun so second Moon

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.380 
three represents the Sun so second Moon
and<00:06:16.110> Sun<00:06:16.290> attack<00:06:16.650> so<00:06:17.490> it's<00:06:17.700> really<00:06:18.030> really

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
and Sun attack so it's really really

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.960 
and Sun attack so it's really really
pretty<00:06:18.750> some<00:06:19.140> size<00:06:19.440> comparison<00:06:20.070> with<00:06:20.550> compact

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
pretty some size comparison with compact

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.470 
pretty some size comparison with compact
Lavi<00:06:21.330> as<00:06:21.540> you<00:06:21.750> can<00:06:21.870> tell<00:06:22.340> almost<00:06:23.340> the<00:06:23.970> same<00:06:24.180> in

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 
Lavi as you can tell almost the same in

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.480 
Lavi as you can tell almost the same in
terms<00:06:24.600> of<00:06:24.780> height<00:06:24.990> is<00:06:25.230> my<00:06:25.530> being<00:06:25.710> higher<00:06:26.040> but

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
terms of height is my being higher but

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.550 
terms of height is my being higher but
in<00:06:26.640> terms<00:06:26.850> of<00:06:26.910> weight<00:06:27.180> then<00:06:27.840> what<00:06:28.050> it's<00:06:28.320> a<00:06:28.410> lot

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
in terms of weight then what it's a lot

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.580 
in terms of weight then what it's a lot
heavier<00:06:28.770> and<00:06:29.400> competitively<00:06:30.440> this<00:06:31.440> is<00:06:31.560> a

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
heavier and competitively this is a

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.970 
heavier and competitively this is a
really<00:06:32.070> really<00:06:32.370> great<00:06:32.520> piece<00:06:32.880> to<00:06:33.120> own<00:06:33.980> for

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:34.980 
really really great piece to own for

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.470 
really really great piece to own for
those<00:06:35.100> of<00:06:35.220> you<00:06:35.340> haven't<00:06:35.520> got<00:06:35.790> it<00:06:36.030> do<00:06:36.180> get<00:06:36.360> it
