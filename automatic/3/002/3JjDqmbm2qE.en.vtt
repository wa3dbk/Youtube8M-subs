00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
other wasn't the issue in the other room

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.390 
other wasn't the issue in the other room
we<00:03:25.389> were<00:03:25.480> playing<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.109> we<00:03:26.859> were<00:03:26.919> both<00:03:27.040> cutting

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
we were playing and we were both cutting

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.339 
we were playing and we were both cutting
through<00:03:27.579> really<00:03:27.879> well<00:03:28.090> yeah<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.900> lows<00:03:29.109> were

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
through really well yeah the lows were

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.589
