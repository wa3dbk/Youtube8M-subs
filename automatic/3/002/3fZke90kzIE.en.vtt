 chords with seventh on piano keys 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.170
 the largest piano 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.899
 I'm starting before the two keys 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:45.270
 black glasses and remember right 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:50.250

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.910
 There are 39 of the amisom your cancer. 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.770
 with seventh only this is the seventh owner 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.350
 bigger 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.729
 Tokyo 7 smaller you take this technique is 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.659
 through it you will stay Don Juan and 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.750
 there sharp O seventh or better 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.500
 simply do with the seventh because this 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.470
 because the seventh minor is considered 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.290
 simply seventh because it is more popular 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.290
 the seventh higher than most used was 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.040
 used as preparation for example of the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:35.700
 brain is for those who are in speech 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:41.070
 up to where the seventh largest of the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:44.420
 more traditional shape with fingers 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:50.850
 the biggest is to do exactly the problem 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:52.800
 nobody's going to think it's bad you did 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.050
 piatan does not even know that since 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:01.500
 placing here is important the key 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:04.979
 right then immediately seventh largest reverse this 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.040
 way is with seven but I'll show you the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.220
 Wake up once the staff is with 7 or it 's 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:20.700

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:22.760
 now take me with the seventh with seven a knife 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:30.390
 the seventh 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:33.050
 It's only joined you with seventh that I 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:38.250
 I pray back, there's sunshine here. 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:55.049
 also appears in but the fact is the seventh 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:59.880
 here with seventh it was seventh largest 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:03.180
 then the seventh prepares her 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.980
 to the sea will be the name can be 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.310
 used in some other situations 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:13.579
