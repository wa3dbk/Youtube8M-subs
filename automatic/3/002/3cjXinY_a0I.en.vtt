00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.859
 hello her dear was welcome 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.469
 my recipes i had told you yes 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.490
 that many delicious recipes here 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.949
 and one of them is fierce and that is 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.529
 has perhaps come because in 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.350
 made an ill that is 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.510
 really delicious is easy to do 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.109
 Of course, I think this is done in the oven 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.140
 but the original will be in stone oven 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.590
 baked or in a wood oven in turkey 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.469
 There is the possibility of fierce hip hop 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.230
 Just bring it to the baker and wait 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.010
 because it is going to be in big ones 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.420
 sheet prepared for that and so large oven 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.579
 one has not at home 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.340
 then you just bring it to the baker 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.399
 and les bas then for very little money 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.219
 bake and that will be in antakya 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.710
 Today I want to show you how 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.710
 you can bake it in the oven at home 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.489
 but in the wood-burning oven that tastes natural 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.470
 much better 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.049
 And of course you have to get that recipe in 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.479
 but we did not break africa 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.270
 We can do that after flying to Antalya 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.630
 here at home 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:21.020
 we need five grams of minced meat one 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:25.860
 pepperoni a onion halbach and 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.030
 parsley salt pepper leaf paprika 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.310
 and thyme 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.650
 We will all be in one now 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.560
 kitchen machine nice to do together 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.390
 after that we need potatoes ever 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.700
 after how much you want me to have 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.680
 have peeled and split into long 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.030
 cut a tomato on a onion and 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.840
 one up his sleeve and I probably 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.719
 forget about it afterwards 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.600
 we need another tablespoon 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:55.920
 tomato marrow it will chew paprika me 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.710
 have it all in a kitchen machine 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.109
 given after all the little one 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.590
 has cut me has that has 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:09.000
 maybe metal and the whole thing 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.370
 you can also use spices right away 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.370
 Put it in and I'll do it again 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.489
 the whole is nice together 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.630
 mixed anne c club la costa pure hab 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.870
 I forget that you can of course 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.610
 also with in the kitchen machine 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.280
 pour in 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.000
 I do not do that at all now 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.709
 problem 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.579
 and then maybe look again 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:39.620
 Maybe we have to salt it that way 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:43.019
 As far as the first time here would be finished 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.599
 Now you can just make a round tin 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.709
 you see a vettel camp 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:54.019
 Turkish shop in all sizes 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:57.019
 and the day before quickly mend just about 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.019
 distributed 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.230
 if we just take the potatoes 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.230
 give it over 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:23.129
 The onion is then simply in big 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:23.129
 cities expect then also on it 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:38.870
 and the tomato will also be sliced 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:41.390
 I cut and peppone then in 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.329
 cut long pieces and thus becomes 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.329
 then just decorate the whole thing 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.880
 usually I will be so many 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.900
 taken potatoes but I do that 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.820
 I like it because it's with a lot of vegetables 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.760
 have now taken more but it 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.190
 then only one potato is taken like that 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.900
 Now we come to the tomato market 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:18.109
 Just go with other olive oil 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.660
 sear 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.760
 for the original recipe to mass market 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.190
 not fried but easy with 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.290
 water and oil for me and above 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.250
 given that it is in Turkey 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.560
 Wood stove is cooked or gives cooks 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.050
 Of course it will be delicious 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.500
 and in the normal open I find that then 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.060
 not so practical for that reason 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.669
 Tomato mark and practitioner market to the 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.419
 We then have 200 milliliters of water left 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.750
 about that 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.070
 but who wants to have it in liquid 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.930
 Of course, a little bit more 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.030
 than 100 meters 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.050
 because the whole cooks I will 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.850
 just give it over and at 200 degrees 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.430
 45 minutes in the oven until the 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:06.080
 Potatoes then become even now 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.080
 it just comes over it 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:15.760
 and in the oven escapist means out 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.090
 of course you can of course then 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.220
 make a delicious Turkish price 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.860
 Of course I wish you all that 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.560
 You know what the lawyer is attacking 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.380
 can eat because then you will 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.870
 know what I mean and are you 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:35.340
 Of course, have fun trying it out 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.340
 this is a video
