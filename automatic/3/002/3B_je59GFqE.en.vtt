00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.860
 hello 3d games of 3 2015 we continue with the 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.860
 coverage now with alejandro pascual 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.480
 cataldi already good is the custom is that 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.529
 you have to get used to changing the tab 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.500
 in the head 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.710
 God the card changing the date finally 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.170
 I already because a 4 up of eternum 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.880
 in any case, mirror's edge has passed 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.590
 peace that trained we have lost that 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.180
 the box to try and we have been able to play is 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.550
 happy after others I can try 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.750
 since I had a lot of faith and that faith has 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.550
 given its fruits 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.370
 great tell us a little bit of what 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.590
 it would come to be the campaign itself wants 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.570
 say that a changed concept that good 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.770
 something as it has changed nothing has not 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.450
 changed a party that has not 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.030
 changed for good I mean it has been 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.950
 changed many things I guess what 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.870
 main would be that we now have is the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.610
 open world that we had more or less 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.699
 promised what is important 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.680
 change of course the one that presents is 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.620
 It is also phenomenal that the system of 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.609
 navigation that in these open worlds 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.800
 how many open worlds is played in 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.080
 this you put on the gps and you have there 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.430
 as the line to go is only about the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.290
 background in a donkey sets 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.930
 it does not work because it's a game that 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.880
 you go through rooftops those routes are not so 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.160
 direct are not roads lights how 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.440
 you do that because they have done it as more or 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.170
 least in drums is one we had those 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.460
 roads we were going on did not mark you 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.830
 in red a pipe that in the background does not 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.350
 it was red because it is marking you more or less 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.420
 those those roads and you can orient yourself and 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.700
 at the same time it 's a very intuitive way and 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.070
 very integrated into the game and well then to 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.260
 level of animations for example at level 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.060
 of the movements themselves there have been 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.310
 great changes in that field 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.540
 neither believe because the movements 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.759
 we had to see if one was maybe already 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.740
 quite deep because it was not limited 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.300
 we just had to run when we already 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.130
 you played a little bit expert on everything 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.619
 the centrals, you had to do 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.990
 things a little more complicated how to do 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.430
 those sudden changes when you're 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.009
 traversing a wall both vertically 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.450
 as horizontal as well as by 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.220
 example pick up the feet have to 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.140
 press the button more works the scheme 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.060
 control follows exactly the same and 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.739
 where more new animations are seen and 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.290
 new movements sat down to that part 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.560
 of combat 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.659
 so it's much more improved because the 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.420
 enemies in see 11 81 were there for 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.670
 bother but the enemies of mirror's 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.069
 edge catalyst be there to continue 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.400
 the flow are like another obstacle in the 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.379
 that is integrated as if it were a puzzle and 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.750
 you can say then look at this me what 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.420
 charge pushing you this is better to jump 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.250
 above him and take advantage of that to 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.379
 climb an obstacle then they are fine 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.909
 positioned to not have to fight 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.500
 let say 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.359
 to the point of even having to 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.640
 pick up a gun or something like that are 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.230
 integrated to follow the flow that is 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.239
 obviously the key to the game itself 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.280
 of course and challenges issues and such more than 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.510
 if they are they have won what they like 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.340
 electronics have been hooked me 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.829
 delighted also in meters is one 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.989
 we had all these trailers for 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.000
 say it so I liked it 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.590
 very much this to see the ghost of 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.730
 better player and follow host as has 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.140
 caught this route 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.299
 that is integrated very well within the 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.129
 open world that deep down you notice that 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.440
 silly example I'll put you as 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.940
 what is this kind of mission that we look at 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.290
 for example in a written session which 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.670
 until it was written what we have with 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.380
 this kind of career 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.900
 and things like that but clear in mirror's edge 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.030
 it works because we're going to certain 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.650
 points and then you get for example a 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.860
 runner that tells you to see if he gets 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.420
 surpass my mark in this circuit or 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.340
 you take a something that you have to deliver 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.800
 before you have to take it here in 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.680
 this time and there you get two enemies 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.890
 there is a ship mini missions of these 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.390
 secondary options that you feel 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.269
 great game and it's a way to 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.620
 integrate these time trailers that also 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.690
 you can repeat at the moment example you have 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.239
 and failed and you get directly 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.280
 restart button so you do not have to 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.650
 go back to that point to start the race 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.810
 it's all like very arcade not inside a 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:02.190
 open world is clear nailed is great 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.989
 Now that's cool and dates so what 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.420
 we will be playing for February 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.459
 2000 and February 23 we will arrive if you are 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.049
 you warn you think you see it advanced everything 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.060
 what have you seen if I see him kill and 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.350
 advanced to tÃ¡dic or is it that my 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.709
 error sets is also good 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.600
 this design so white and such is not a 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.850
 I play as very powerful but 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.830
 obviously the open world then 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.030
 It has its complication and this I think 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.280
 it is quite advanced 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.130
 you could see things like lack of polish in 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.590
 some textures or for example if I've 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.120
 seen as a lot of aliases and little things so 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.190
 I think that they are going to be the most 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.930
 polish but I think the game is already 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.240
 can play practically from start to 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.889
 order the company also a story that 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.360
 I know that you had some problems with the 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.340
 history and it seems understandable to me in the 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.169
 first virus is more than anything in what 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.060
 it's a universe that I think was very rich 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.250
 and maybe you'll make us a bazan 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.590
 here they have not clearly said that 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.500
 they want to expand the world the lore within 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.410
 of the game this dystopian city that 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.780
 they also call glass city in the 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.790
 that good there is neither freedom nor 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.470
 democracy and which have also been 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.320
 invented as a kind of factions 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.790
 apart from this totalitarian government that 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.860
 would be the runners in which he programmed 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.150
 we part and a kind of added 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.370
 like the kabbalah that is a kind of 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.020
 terrorists were like more aggressive not 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.090
 against against this government then 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.680
 Well, those doubts that I told you that you 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.840
 you could have with the first one and that as 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.700
 I said they are justified I think that with 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.220
 this whole system a little more like 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.410
 political have always have even a 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.720
 little message can come 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.820
 very good the game 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.770
 1 had a universe that could have 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.700
 had a message or had something 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.260
 but then after the moment of truth 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.580
 it's not like you had a lot in that 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.290
 set aside when you've just 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.970
 built the story that I think that 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.830
 could be interested in a world that could 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.110
 be interesting and if it is not appear to 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.600
 because yes yes yes but good 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.090
 mirror 62 I think that for now I do not 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.800
 roll seeds 2 never so many and catalysis 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.450
 damn it catalyst can be 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.300
 quietly one of the games of this 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:59.360
 32 thousand for me I know perfect so 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.760
 We will continue moving forward in this 3 2015 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.130
 you know here in 3d games dotcom in 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.080
 the youtube channel of 3dgames if a 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.420
 your service always throughout 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.640
 this week that the news does not stop in 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.250
 3d games we are in the hashtag of 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:17.260
 3dgames and see you in the next 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.260
 video goes through that until then
