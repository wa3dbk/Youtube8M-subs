 happy and I noticed that a lot of people have really enjoyed the 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.970
 first idea about the game 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.609

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.749
 not bad on the game 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:35.180
 I took this scale you will tell me 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.620
 the enemies to lay them throw I did not even notice of course 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.730
