00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
really really down because if you have

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.380 
really really down because if you have
that<00:02:23.500> previous<00:02:24.010> step<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.430> writing<00:02:24.910> is<00:02:25.060> already

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
that previous step of writing is already

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.810 
that previous step of writing is already
in<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:26.020> then<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.710> can<00:02:26.920> just<00:02:27.100> Ollie<00:02:27.340> wall

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
in and then you can just Ollie wall

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.270 
in and then you can just Ollie wall
writing<00:02:28.330> because<00:02:28.990> you're<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:30.010> good<00:02:30.250> at

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
writing because you're so good at

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.670 
writing because you're so good at
writing<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:31.030> you're<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:31.959> good<00:02:32.170> at<00:02:32.200> all<00:02:32.470> ways

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
writing and you're so good at all ways

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.510 
writing and you're so good at all ways
that<00:02:33.160> Ollie<00:02:33.610> while<00:02:34.360> writing<00:02:34.660> is<00:02:35.070> no<00:02:36.070> problem

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
that Ollie while writing is no problem

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.210 
that Ollie while writing is no problem
at<00:02:36.670> all<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.930> other<00:02:38.080> main<00:02:38.620> point<00:02:38.980> that<00:02:39.190> I

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
at all the other main point that I

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.670 
at all the other main point that I
wanted<00:02:39.520> to<00:02:39.580> make<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.850> very<00:02:40.480> big<00:02:40.600> emphasis<00:02:41.410> on

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
wanted to make a very big emphasis on

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.980 
wanted to make a very big emphasis on
doing<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.280> tricks<00:02:42.580> in<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:42.880> exact<00:02:43.330> order<00:02:43.600> is

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
doing the tricks in that exact order is

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.620 
doing the tricks in that exact order is
because<00:02:44.950> you're<00:02:45.280> going<00:02:45.610> straight<00:02:45.850> from<00:02:46.239> the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
because you're going straight from the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.860 
because you're going straight from the
alley<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.739> kickflip<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.640> don't<00:02:49.540> know<00:02:49.690> if

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
alley to the kickflip I don't know if

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.930 
alley to the kickflip I don't know if
you<00:02:50.020> actually<00:02:50.200> learned<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:50.920> 180<00:02:51.280> or<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.730> pop

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
you actually learned the 180 or the pop

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.330 
you actually learned the 180 or the pop
shove-it<00:02:52.330> or<00:02:52.450> anything<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:53.140> don't<00:02:53.380> recall<00:02:53.920> you

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
shove-it or anything I don't recall you

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.130 
shove-it or anything I don't recall you
mentioning<00:02:54.370> anything<00:02:55.090> about<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.780> and

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
mentioning anything about that and

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.840 
mentioning anything about that and
obviously<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.980> didn't<00:02:57.250> show<00:02:57.459> it<00:02:57.489> in<00:02:57.730> your

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
obviously you didn't show it in your

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.100 
obviously you didn't show it in your
video<00:02:58.380> but<00:02:59.380> yeah<00:02:59.560> that's<00:02:59.920> a<00:03:00.280> huge<00:03:00.940> step<00:03:01.390> and

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
video but yeah that's a huge step and

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.740 
video but yeah that's a huge step and
that's<00:03:02.440> going<00:03:03.070> to<00:03:03.280> be<00:03:03.459> really<00:03:03.790> hard<00:03:04.330> for<00:03:04.450> you

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
that's going to be really hard for you

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.690 
that's going to be really hard for you
to<00:03:04.900> just<00:03:05.110> go<00:03:05.320> straight<00:03:05.680> into<00:03:05.860> kick<00:03:06.190> flips<00:03:06.459> like

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
to just go straight into kick flips like

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.470 
to just go straight into kick flips like
that<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:08.700> just<00:03:09.700> getting<00:03:09.970> into<00:03:10.150> your<00:03:10.270> kick

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
that so just getting into your kick

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.680 
that so just getting into your kick
flips<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:10.900> little<00:03:11.170> bit<00:03:11.350> um<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:13.060> got<00:03:13.270> to<00:03:13.390> work<00:03:13.540> on

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
flips a little bit um you got to work on

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.630 
flips a little bit um you got to work on
your<00:03:13.750> flick<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.590> flick<00:03:14.860> is<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.160> main<00:03:15.370> thing

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
your flick the flick is the main thing

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.210 
your flick the flick is the main thing
you<00:03:15.670> need<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.940> work<00:03:16.209> on<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.780> that's<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.980> step

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
you need to work on and that's the step

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.270 
you need to work on and that's the step
that<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.430> could<00:03:18.670> do<00:03:18.790> right<00:03:19.150> there<00:03:19.620> just<00:03:20.620> work

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
that you could do right there just work

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.300 
that you could do right there just work
on<00:03:21.489> flicking<00:03:22.269> your<00:03:22.660> front<00:03:23.019> foot<00:03:23.110> up<00:03:23.530> off<00:03:23.890> the

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
on flicking your front foot up off the

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.120 
on flicking your front foot up off the
board<00:03:24.610> and<00:03:24.790> keeping<00:03:25.450> your<00:03:25.989> front<00:03:26.440> foot<00:03:26.500> above

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
board and keeping your front foot above

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.449 
board and keeping your front foot above
the<00:03:27.190> board<00:03:27.910> you<00:03:28.870> can<00:03:29.019> practice<00:03:29.590> jumping<00:03:30.280> off

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
the board you can practice jumping off

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.979 
the board you can practice jumping off
with<00:03:30.670> your<00:03:30.760> back<00:03:31.030> foot<00:03:31.330> and<00:03:31.450> keeping<00:03:31.870> your

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
with your back foot and keeping your

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.710 
with your back foot and keeping your
front<00:03:32.290> foot<00:03:32.380> above<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:32.860> board<00:03:33.480> but<00:03:34.480> yeah<00:03:34.660> you

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
front foot above the board but yeah you

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.840 
front foot above the board but yeah you
got<00:03:35.019> to<00:03:35.110> get<00:03:35.230> that<00:03:35.260> flick<00:03:35.709> down<00:03:35.890> because<00:03:36.430> your

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
got to get that flick down because your

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.250 
got to get that flick down because your
front<00:03:37.090> foot<00:03:37.150> is<00:03:37.420> going<00:03:37.510> straight<00:03:38.049> to<00:03:38.200> the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
front foot is going straight to the

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.550 
front foot is going straight to the
ground<00:03:38.590> which<00:03:39.459> is<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:40.390> most<00:03:40.570> common<00:03:40.840> problem

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
ground which is the most common problem

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.590 
ground which is the most common problem
and<00:03:41.829> then<00:03:42.310> once<00:03:42.489> you've<00:03:42.670> got<00:03:42.940> your<00:03:42.970> front<00:03:43.510> foot

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
and then once you've got your front foot

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.330 
and then once you've got your front foot
landing<00:03:44.019> on<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.230> board<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.890> can<00:03:44.920> begin

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
landing on the board you can begin

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.100 
landing on the board you can begin
learning<00:03:45.670> to<00:03:46.030> land<00:03:46.239> with<00:03:46.360> your<00:03:46.540> back<00:03:46.720> foot<00:03:46.750> on

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
learning to land with your back foot on

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.229 
learning to land with your back foot on
the<00:03:47.230> board<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:47.769> your<00:03:48.489> back<00:03:48.670> foot<00:03:48.910> is<00:03:49.000> going<00:03:49.060> to

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
the board and your back foot is going to

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.850 
the board and your back foot is going to
be<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.480> foot<00:03:49.690> that's<00:03:49.840> actually<00:03:50.440> going<00:03:50.650> to

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
be the foot that's actually going to

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.699 
be the foot that's actually going to
catch<00:03:51.130> that<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.720> don't<00:03:52.720> even<00:03:52.840> want<00:03:53.260> to<00:03:53.410> cover

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
catch that I don't even want to cover

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.400 
catch that I don't even want to cover
the<00:03:54.250> kickflip<00:03:54.700> into<00:03:55.000> grade<00:03:55.630> of<00:03:55.780> detail<00:03:56.200> with

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
the kickflip into grade of detail with

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.490 
the kickflip into grade of detail with
you<00:03:56.620> because<00:03:57.480> by<00:03:58.480> looking<00:03:58.840> at<00:03:58.959> your<00:03:59.110> video<00:03:59.320> I

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
you because by looking at your video I

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.910 
you because by looking at your video I
can<00:03:59.860> tell<00:04:00.100> that<00:04:00.579> you<00:04:00.730> have<00:04:01.030> skipped<00:04:01.870> way<00:04:02.860> too

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
can tell that you have skipped way too

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.759 
can tell that you have skipped way too
many<00:04:03.250> steps<00:04:03.640> in<00:04:03.880> between<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.840> ollie<00:04:05.049> and<00:04:05.440> the

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
many steps in between the ollie and the

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.520 
many steps in between the ollie and the
kickflip<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:07.120> I<00:04:07.150> highly<00:04:07.750> highly<00:04:08.019> highly

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
kickflip so I highly highly highly

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.520 
kickflip so I highly highly highly
recommend<00:04:09.480> going<00:04:10.480> back<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:10.989> just<00:04:11.140> really

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
recommend going back and just really

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.009 
recommend going back and just really
really<00:04:11.980> getting<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.640> basics<00:04:13.000> of<00:04:13.420> riding<00:04:13.810> down

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
really getting the basics of riding down

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.080 
really getting the basics of riding down
and<00:04:14.320> then<00:04:14.590> learning<00:04:14.950> to<00:04:15.280> do<00:04:15.880> you're<00:04:16.060> always

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
and then learning to do you're always

between the ollie and the kickflip like

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.040 
between the ollie and the kickflip like
I<00:05:07.620> said<00:05:07.830> there's<00:05:08.040> a<00:05:08.100> lot<00:05:08.370> of<00:05:08.400> steps<00:05:08.910> so<00:05:09.750> doing

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
I said there's a lot of steps so doing

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.960 
I said there's a lot of steps so doing
each<00:05:10.260> one<00:05:10.620> of<00:05:10.650> those<00:05:10.890> steps<00:05:11.250> in<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:11.550> proper

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
each one of those steps in the proper

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.690 
each one of those steps in the proper
order<00:05:12.230> will<00:05:13.230> not<00:05:13.410> only<00:05:13.590> make<00:05:13.950> you<00:05:14.310> progress

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
order will not only make you progress

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.440 
order will not only make you progress
faster<00:05:15.450> but<00:05:16.230> they'll<00:05:16.440> just<00:05:17.210> increase<00:05:18.210> your

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
faster but they'll just increase your

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.560 
faster but they'll just increase your
overall<00:05:19.260> skill<00:05:19.919> of<00:05:20.220> controlling<00:05:21.030> your<00:05:21.180> board

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
overall skill of controlling your board

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.050 
overall skill of controlling your board

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
so when you get to those harder steps

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.570 
so when you get to those harder steps
like<00:05:24.270> the<00:05:24.450> kickflip<00:05:24.900> it's<00:05:25.169> not<00:05:25.620> as<00:05:25.890> hard<00:05:26.280> for

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580
