00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
all those years ago we thought that it

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.070 
all those years ago we thought that it

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
a few years and that the revolution

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.200 
a few years and that the revolution
would<00:01:27.720> come<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.230> so<00:01:28.410> forth<00:01:28.760> so<00:01:29.760> I've<00:01:29.970> never

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
sort of a harbinger

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.620 
sort of a harbinger
some<00:02:03.950> of<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.159> problems<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:05.060> LGBT

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
some of the problems that the LGBT

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.260 
some of the problems that the LGBT

community still faces do you do you

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.230 
community still faces do you do you
really<00:02:08.330> think<00:02:08.780> that<00:02:08.840> it's<00:02:09.709> it<00:02:10.160> there's<00:02:11.060> that

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
really think that it's it there's that

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.930 
really think that it's it there's that
much<00:02:11.420> danger<00:02:11.840> there's<00:02:12.140> that<00:02:12.319> much<00:02:12.530> threat<00:02:13.459> out

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
much danger there's that much threat out

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.880 
much danger there's that much threat out
there<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:14.840> advances<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.410> LGBTQ

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
there to the advances the LGBTQ

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.370 
there to the advances the LGBTQ
community<00:02:15.920> has<00:02:16.400> made<00:02:16.550> in<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.790> last<00:02:16.940> 30<00:02:17.180> years

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
community has made in the last 30 years

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.840 
community has made in the last 30 years
well<00:02:18.380> I<00:02:18.410> think<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.890> real<00:02:19.040> problem<00:02:19.640> there<00:02:19.730> in

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
well I think the real problem there in

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.580 
well I think the real problem there in
the<00:02:19.910> danger<00:02:20.300> is<00:02:20.450> that<00:02:20.480> we<00:02:20.720> don't<00:02:20.959> know<00:02:21.230> the

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
the danger is that we don't know the

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.270 
the danger is that we don't know the
answer<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.069> question<00:02:22.660> we<00:02:23.660> haven't

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
answer to that question we haven't

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.740 
answer to that question we haven't
looked<00:02:25.280> very<00:02:25.550> closely<00:02:25.850> at<00:02:26.180> forward<00:02:26.450> nation

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
looked very closely at forward nation

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.930 
looked very closely at forward nation
our<00:02:26.870> media<00:02:27.170> has<00:02:27.350> not<00:02:27.500> very<00:02:28.160> closely<00:02:28.459> at<00:02:28.700> Ford

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
our media has not very closely at Ford

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.600 
our media has not very closely at Ford
nation<00:02:29.420> it's<00:02:30.080> been<00:02:30.319> treated<00:02:30.739> as<00:02:30.890> sort<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.280> an

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
nation it's been treated as sort of an

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.790 
nation it's been treated as sort of an
off<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.819> stage<00:02:32.330> thing<00:02:32.959> that<00:02:33.230> accounts<00:02:33.739> for

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
off the stage thing that accounts for

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.280 
off the stage thing that accounts for
Rob<00:02:34.580> Ford<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.360> certainly<00:02:35.690> don't<00:02:35.900> for<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.170> as

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
Rob Ford and certainly don't for it as

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.330 
Rob Ford and certainly don't for it as
well

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
well

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.910 
well
and<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:38.810> know<00:02:38.930> I've<00:02:39.050> scanned<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.680> media

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
and you know I've scanned the media

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.790 
and you know I've scanned the media
looking<00:02:40.310> for<00:02:40.700> studies<00:02:41.330> of<00:02:41.470> explanations<00:02:42.470> of

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
looking for studies of explanations of

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.710 
looking for studies of explanations of
the<00:02:42.980> people<00:02:43.310> who<00:02:43.459> make<00:02:43.670> up<00:02:43.880> his<00:02:44.120> following

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
the people who make up his following

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.080 
the people who make up his following
they're<00:02:45.380> not<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:45.860> easy<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.430> find<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.000> they

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
they're not that easy to find and they

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.080 
they're not that easy to find and they
tend<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.360> be<00:02:47.709> focused<00:02:48.709> on<00:02:48.860> what<00:02:49.519> I<00:02:49.550> would<00:02:49.670> think

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
tend to be focused on what I would think

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.210 
tend to be focused on what I would think
mainly<00:02:50.450> irrelevant<00:02:51.260> demographics<00:02:52.040> like

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
mainly irrelevant demographics like

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.720 
mainly irrelevant demographics like
their<00:02:52.370> age<00:02:52.519> groups<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:53.750> on<00:02:53.989> so<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.680> do<00:02:55.250> think

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
their age groups and so on so I do think

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.809 
their age groups and so on so I do think
that<00:02:55.819> we'd<00:02:56.090> be<00:02:56.120> foolish<00:02:56.690> not<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:57.730> think<00:02:58.730> about

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
that we'd be foolish not to think about

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.380 
that we'd be foolish not to think about
that

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.780 

has<00:03:02.390> there<00:03:02.569> been<00:03:02.599> an<00:03:03.019> issue<00:03:03.290> that<00:03:04.040> extras

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
has there been an issue that extras

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.489 
has there been an issue that extras
coverage<00:03:05.209> of<00:03:05.359> it<00:03:05.480> has<00:03:05.599> made<00:03:05.629> you<00:03:05.900> particularly

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:06.499 
coverage of it has made you particularly

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:09.339 
coverage of it has made you particularly
proud<00:03:06.969> I<00:03:07.969> think<00:03:08.389> there's<00:03:08.540> been<00:03:08.689> a<00:03:08.719> lot<00:03:09.079> of<00:03:09.109> the

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
proud I think there's been a lot of the

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.470 
proud I think there's been a lot of the
issues<00:03:09.680> over<00:03:09.859> the<00:03:10.249> time<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:10.879> I'm<00:03:11.239> not<00:03:11.359> going

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
issues over the time and I'm not going

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.940 
issues over the time and I'm not going
to<00:03:11.540> point<00:03:11.689> to<00:03:11.749> any<00:03:11.900> one<00:03:12.170> particular<00:03:12.319> they've

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
to point to any one particular they've

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.440 
to point to any one particular they've
been<00:03:13.099> different<00:03:13.489> in<00:03:13.579> different<00:03:13.700> communities

and<00:03:14.480> whether<00:03:15.200> that's<00:03:15.409> mobilizing<00:03:16.189> change

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
and whether that's mobilizing change

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.550 
and whether that's mobilizing change
within<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:16.879> community<00:03:17.239> organization<00:03:17.989> whether

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
within a community organization whether

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.679 
within a community organization whether
it's<00:03:18.680> fighting<00:03:19.250> some<00:03:20.000> sort<00:03:20.239> of<00:03:20.269> level<00:03:20.599> of

it's fighting some sort of level of

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
views together to work on a common issue

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.869 
views together to work on a common issue
where<00:03:44.329> we<00:03:44.419> agree<00:03:45.099> it's<00:03:46.099> been<00:03:46.340> kind<00:03:46.639> of<00:03:46.699> the

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
where we agree it's been kind of the

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.689 
where we agree it's been kind of the
broader<00:03:47.409> impact<00:03:48.409> of<00:03:48.620> extra<00:03:49.010> that<00:03:49.250> is<00:03:49.310> always

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
broader impact of extra that is always

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.250 
broader impact of extra that is always
resonated<00:03:50.269> with<00:03:50.449> me<00:03:50.629> and<00:03:50.750> I<00:03:50.810> think<00:03:50.870> that's<00:03:51.079> why

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
resonated with me and I think that's why

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.689 
resonated with me and I think that's why
it's<00:03:51.409> still<00:03:51.530> here<00:03:51.829> 30<00:03:52.099> years<00:03:52.310> later<00:03:52.489> you<00:03:54.699> have

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:55.699 
it's still here 30 years later you have

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.890

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
I've been trying to it's a little

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.509

overwhelming in the archive room because

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.330 
overwhelming in the archive room because
it's<00:04:19.729> just<00:04:19.909> towers<00:04:20.419> of<00:04:20.720> old<00:04:21.349> issues<00:04:21.889> that<00:04:22.220> are

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
it's just towers of old issues that are

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.740 
it's just towers of old issues that are
there<00:04:22.550> and<00:04:23.289> I<00:04:25.030> really<00:04:26.030> just<00:04:26.270> scratched<00:04:26.570> the

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
there and I really just scratched the

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.439 
there and I really just scratched the
surface<00:04:26.840> but<00:04:27.590> we've<00:04:28.370> been<00:04:28.820> trying<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.090> scan

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
surface but we've been trying to scan

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.860 
surface but we've been trying to scan
stuff<00:04:29.810> and<00:04:30.229> you<00:04:30.770> know<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:30.949> long-term<00:04:31.159> goal<00:04:31.639> is

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
stuff and you know the long-term goal is

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.810 
stuff and you know the long-term goal is
be<00:04:32.870> nice<00:04:32.990> to<00:04:33.199> have<00:04:33.349> everything<00:04:33.620> digitized<00:04:34.310> but

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
be nice to have everything digitized but

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.230 
be nice to have everything digitized but
it's<00:04:35.419> a<00:04:35.539> huge<00:04:35.810> task<00:04:36.560> in<00:04:36.919> itself<00:04:37.039> because<00:04:37.849> this

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
it's a huge task in itself because this

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.029 
it's a huge task in itself because this
should<00:04:38.870> be<00:04:39.050> preserved<00:04:39.470> it's<00:04:39.740> really<00:04:39.979> a

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
should be preserved it's really a

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.680 
should be preserved it's really a
history<00:04:40.460> of<00:04:41.889> gay<00:04:42.889> rights<00:04:43.130> and<00:04:43.580> each<00:04:44.180> issues

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
like a little snapshot of what was going

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.230 
like a little snapshot of what was going
on<00:04:46.789> at<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.659> time<00:04:48.400> no<00:04:49.400> I<00:04:49.430> just<00:04:49.550> in<00:04:49.789> terms<00:04:49.969> of<00:04:50.090> gay

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
on at the time no I just in terms of gay

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.459 
on at the time no I just in terms of gay
rights<00:04:50.449> but<00:04:50.630> also<00:04:50.750> in<00:04:51.050> terms<00:04:51.259> of<00:04:51.380> the

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:51.469 
rights but also in terms of the

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:53.439 
rights but also in terms of the
publishing<00:04:51.979> technology<00:04:52.759> it<00:04:53.030> was<00:04:53.180> available

publishing technology it was available

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.960 
publishing technology it was available
in<00:04:53.930> them<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.830> way<00:04:54.979> that<00:04:55.009> extra

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
in them the way that extra

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.190 
in them the way that extra
I<00:04:56.000> mean<00:04:56.450> the<00:04:56.720> axes<00:04:57.410> this<00:04:58.310> actually<00:04:59.030> was<00:04:59.900> I

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
I mean the axes this actually was I

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.040 
I mean the axes this actually was I
think<00:05:00.470> it<00:05:00.650> was<00:05:00.680> Rick<00:05:01.100> through<00:05:01.820> her<00:05:02.330> usual<00:05:02.720> body

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
think it was Rick through her usual body
