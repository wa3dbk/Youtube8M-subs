00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
within the current gen and when I say

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.980 
within the current gen and when I say
different<00:02:20.130> it's<00:02:20.459> more<00:02:20.730> like<00:02:21.150> oven<00:02:21.510> hybrid

to<00:03:47.579> build<00:03:47.760> up<00:03:47.850> their<00:03:47.970> powers<00:03:48.299> all<00:03:48.510> those

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
to build up their powers all those

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.229 
to build up their powers all those
powers<00:03:49.049> are<00:03:49.320> going<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.530> be<00:03:49.910> made<00:03:50.910> through<00:03:51.090> like

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
powers are going to be made through like

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.490 
powers are going to be made through like
kinetic<00:03:51.630> movements<00:03:52.140> with<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.380> wii

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
kinetic movements with the wii

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.780 
kinetic movements with the wii
controller<00:03:52.829> so<00:03:53.070> if<00:03:53.220> you're<00:03:53.370> going<00:03:53.579> to<00:03:53.670> be

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
controller so if you're going to be

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.520 
controller so if you're going to be
charging<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.810> controller<00:03:55.170> you<00:03:55.320> might<00:03:55.440> be

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
charging the controller you might be

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.750 
charging the controller you might be
doing<00:03:55.709> something<00:03:55.890> like<00:03:56.040> this<00:03:56.190> we<00:03:56.489> might<00:03:56.579> kind

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
doing something like this we might kind

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.330 
doing something like this we might kind
of<00:03:56.790> like<00:03:56.940> this<00:03:57.530> those<00:03:58.530> like<00:03:58.739> building<00:03:59.160> up<00:03:59.250> the

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
of like this those like building up the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.800 
of like this those like building up the
energy<00:03:59.670> obviously<00:04:00.209> works<00:04:00.359> that<00:04:00.510> way<00:04:00.630> there's

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
energy obviously works that way there's

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.330 
energy obviously works that way there's
a<00:04:00.900> lot<00:04:01.019> of<00:04:01.049> minigames<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:01.680> involve<00:04:02.010> pushing

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
a lot of minigames that involve pushing

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.890 
a lot of minigames that involve pushing
and<00:04:02.430> pulling<00:04:02.609> they're<00:04:03.150> obviously<00:04:03.359> going<00:04:03.810> to

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
and pulling they're obviously going to

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.880 
and pulling they're obviously going to
really<00:04:04.230> take<00:04:04.380> advantage<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.769> weak

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
really take advantage of the weak

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:05.880 
really take advantage of the weak
controller<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.310> they're<00:04:05.400> all<00:04:05.459> going<00:04:05.549> to<00:04:05.640> be

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
controller and they're all going to be

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.059 
controller and they're all going to be
the<00:04:06.790> game<00:04:07.030> is<00:04:07.590> fundamentally<00:04:08.590> very<00:04:08.770> different

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
the game is fundamentally very different

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.870 
the game is fundamentally very different
from<00:04:09.130> xtreme<00:04:09.430> Legends<00:04:09.840> mainly<00:04:10.840> because<00:04:10.870> I

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
from xtreme Legends mainly because I

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.640 
from xtreme Legends mainly because I
x-men<00:04:12.880> legends<00:04:13.270> the<00:04:13.540> whole<00:04:13.690> series<00:04:14.020> focused

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
x-men legends the whole series focused

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.680 
x-men legends the whole series focused
on<00:04:14.770> more<00:04:14.980> of<00:04:15.010> a<00:04:15.130> traditional<00:04:15.340> RPG<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:16.450> power

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
on more of a traditional RPG the power

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.599 
on more of a traditional RPG the power
sets<00:04:17.079> were<00:04:17.290> like<00:04:17.620> really<00:04:17.829> straightforward<00:04:18.220> in

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
sets were like really straightforward in

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.490 
sets were like really straightforward in
terms<00:04:18.730> of<00:04:18.910> you<00:04:19.060> would<00:04:19.180> have<00:04:19.299> like<00:04:19.540> a<00:04:19.570> radial

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
terms of you would have like a radial

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.520 
terms of you would have like a radial
attack<00:04:20.799> or<00:04:21.160> a<00:04:21.220> straight<00:04:21.790> melee<00:04:22.570> attack<00:04:22.930> or<00:04:23.260> you

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
attack or a straight melee attack or you

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.890 
attack or a straight melee attack or you
would<00:04:23.680> have<00:04:23.710> like<00:04:24.120> traditional<00:04:25.120> ranged

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
would have like traditional ranged

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.590 
would have like traditional ranged
attack<00:04:26.169> and<00:04:26.470> it<00:04:26.860> really<00:04:27.160> like<00:04:27.580> drawn<00:04:27.970> upon<00:04:28.270> was

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
attack and it really like drawn upon was

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.810 
attack and it really like drawn upon was
considered<00:04:29.230> classic<00:04:29.800> in<00:04:29.980> and<00:04:30.280> i<00:04:30.490> would<00:04:30.640> say<00:04:30.760> an

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
considered classic in and i would say an

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.030 
considered classic in and i would say an
action<00:04:31.060> RPG<00:04:31.380> with<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.560> strengths<00:04:32.860> of<00:04:32.919> the

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
gave us a foundation of understanding

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.420 
gave us a foundation of understanding
like<00:04:43.480> what's<00:04:43.720> cool<00:04:43.900> about<00:04:43.930> of<00:04:44.110> the<00:04:44.169> game<00:04:44.430> and

what what could be different and for
Marvel<00:04:47.620> Legends<00:04:47.890> we've<00:04:48.040> really<00:04:48.280> taken<00:04:48.430> in<00:04:48.610> the

game in its own unique direction from

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.710 
game in its own unique direction from
action<00:04:50.530> RPGs<00:04:50.980> the<00:04:51.760> game<00:04:51.970> is<00:04:52.120> really<00:04:52.360> focused

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
action RPGs the game is really focused

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.440 
action RPGs the game is really focused
on<00:04:52.780> combat<00:04:53.290> and<00:04:54.190> when<00:04:54.340> I<00:04:54.370> say<00:04:54.610> that<00:04:54.790> basically

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
on combat and when I say that basically

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.330 
on combat and when I say that basically
what<00:04:55.660> we're<00:04:55.810> trying<00:04:55.990> to<00:04:56.110> do<00:04:56.320> is<00:04:56.530> supplement

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
what we're trying to do is supplement

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.550 
what we're trying to do is supplement
like<00:04:57.520> a<00:04:57.550> fighter<00:04:57.960> mechanic<00:04:58.960> into<00:04:59.230> an<00:04:59.320> action

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
like a fighter mechanic into an action

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.409 
like a fighter mechanic into an action
RPG<00:04:59.640> with<00:05:00.640> that<00:05:00.820> said<00:05:01.060> though<00:05:01.090> there's

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
RPG with that said though there's

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.210 
RPG with that said though there's
obviously<00:05:01.780> incredible<00:05:02.290> RPG<00:05:02.650> aspects<00:05:03.130> it

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
obviously incredible RPG aspects it

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.280 
obviously incredible RPG aspects it
really<00:05:03.430> tie<00:05:03.700> together<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.090> game<00:05:04.360> players<00:05:05.169> are

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
really tie together the game players are

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.570 
really tie together the game players are
gonna<00:05:05.380> be<00:05:05.470> able<00:05:05.530> to<00:05:05.680> assemble<00:05:05.980> their<00:05:06.460> own
