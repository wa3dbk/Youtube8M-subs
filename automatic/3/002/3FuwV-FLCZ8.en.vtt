00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.060
 Yes 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.490
 hello to all and here I am again for a 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.529
 new tutorial so you rate expected with 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.029
 the chocolate bar so I just apply 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.250
 my foundation so for the time being for 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.570
 my part is the draw is therefore of 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.430
 at my four forever and I come 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.869
 applied with himself pinches himself he is 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.070
 dense enough so I bought them on 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.870
 help for those who will ask me 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.550
 what I like in this foundation 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.590
 it's the finite part of its infinite 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.440
 super matifying is a super good 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.610
 So coverage here please 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.239
 try it in stores since it is 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.280
 really top 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.980
 I recommend it for skins a little 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.360
 a problem because it covers a lot 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.980
 I then use my anti-dark circles 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.690
 at urban decay so this one is the 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.149
 naked skins and the little novelty of 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.710
 in urban and for morning is the hue 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.110
 light so I want the master 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.430
 especially around the eye 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.170
 then I come faded with my 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.670
 beauty blender world do not hesitate to 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.440
 put two layers to have a small 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.049
 little more coverage since the finish of the 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.070
 noise the blender tube is very natural 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.259
 then I come to take the powder 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.939
 so compact from urban decay who 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.610
 is very covering I come to take 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.649
 also a bull brush and I come to 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.049
 leave my powder all over my face 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.569
 so to come mattify and cover in 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.429
 plus i also believe my brothers 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:24.829
 of which two at lancÃ´me and I use 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:26.630
 still my big bull brush and I come 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.709
 divide the material into three 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.479
 so that is to say at the level of 

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:31.789
 cheekbones will last two jaws at 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.289
 level of the temples I sweep the nose and the 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.840
 front to have a face a little bit 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.939
 more carved and that's the good side 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.670
 mine that will bring precisely this side 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.619
 carved then I come to finish with a 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.240
 trio so from stick so it's a 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.340
 contouring palette I take the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.509
 tint the brown influx in fact there you 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.130
 really needs a brown hue for 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.229
 do some touring tale and I come 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.049
 apply it to the level of my 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:58.179
 So I'm going to party until 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.179
 temples and I leave pump afterwards 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.280
 I come to take this little block 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.230
 there that is just beautiful so it's 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.450
 a rose gold and I 'm going to apply 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.950
 all stupidly on my palm is for 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.750
 give a little bit of dimension and 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.380
 bring this shot to the very nice that 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.090
 I really like 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.770
 so you can find this 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.860
 palette also on the site coin make 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.330
 up that's where I got supplies 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.190
 then I have just drawn my eyebrows more 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.200
 that yes we see that they are nonexistent 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.950
 I take my little kit from gasoline 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.350
 and a little eyeliner brush I come 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.880
 then take my fixed more schema 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.460
 in fact it's a fixing haze 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.560
 refreshing that I apply to my 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.690
 eyebrows naked like that it will come in 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.640
 adhere the pigment will come adhere 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.680
 to the eyebrows so I dig into the 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.810
 small palette essence and I come 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.060
 decidedly eyebrows with the brush 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.440
 eyeliner so see I'm doing some 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.580
 very marked thing it's just 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.260
 because I do not have a lot of 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.370
 eyebrows and that I like it well I like 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.560
 a lot the eyebrows a little bit 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.430
 Lebanese so that's really the result 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.430
 I'm looking for 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.959
 Then I come to take my beautiful 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.390
 illuminate at her 2 the bold so the one 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.800
 this is the husband lumana isr and I 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.270
 applying it on all areas 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.920
 shaded that is to say at the level of 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.350
 the bridge of the nose at the level of the arcade 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.790
 brow bone like here and then I 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.230
 just apply it with a blush brush 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.580
 at the level of the cheekbones what will give 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.440
 really the very bright side and 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.390
 i love husband wifeizer 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.530
 I then take a white pencil 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.540
 I apply in the mucosa for 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.700
 enlarge the eye I love the result of 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.230
 white pencil in me digs then I come 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.670
 apply my home base from urban decay 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.530
 on the entire eyelid 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.250
 I do not forget also below 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.600
 sources it is below the lash line 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.950
 then I stick small labels 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.360
 you can also do it with 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.330
 scotch it's just that I find some 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.890
 small labels - less aggressive at 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.900
 skin level after it's a choice 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.910
 staff 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.100
 I come then took the color the 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.110
 cleaner the palette so the more 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.370
 plum it's a nice plum a little bit 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.739
 maths and I just apply it with a 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.190
 jump of balls at precisely the level of 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.080
 outer corner of the eye I come 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.730
 then faded with a brush and have 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.459
 scared this one comes from the chain for my 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.690
 so I do not hesitate to support and 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.900
 make circular motions for 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.150
 blur and diffuse the material I 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.069
 then resume my brush precisely 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.480
 dish and I will come 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.189
 the lightest color and the most 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.989
 mother-of-pearl and natal is sure that both 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.400
 bad and I support it in inner corner 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.000
 just look at the whole 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.829
 mobile eyelid 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.449
 so I actually come to fill everything 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.900
 stupidly where I have not yet put 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.900
 two lighthouses 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.710
 I then take my bull brush and then 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.090
 I just picked this color 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.190
 if that's a little bit not been it's 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.750
 also a nice plum and I actually come 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.510
 give dimension to my eye 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.260
 since I'm applying gets stuffed in the 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.150
 hollow of the eye 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.890
 simply to give some 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:01.100
 dimension as I was able to tell you and 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:03.740
 intensify the look I come next 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.630
 blurred and disseminate both materials 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.860
 between them so do not hesitate to do 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.720
 circular movements this is the 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.830
 easiest way to actually fade 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.540
 all stupidly I add again then 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.970
 with my bull brush a little bit of 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.040
 this glittery plum color all 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.960
 simply to redefine the eye since 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.090
 inevitably we fade and we arrive from the 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.590
 matter that's the same thing for the 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:29.420
 the lightest color since gesture 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.710
 pay and color is gone then 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.390
 I must remove my little ones 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.890
 labels and I 'm coming back to my 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.120
 foundation brush from the beginning 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.130
 necessarily he has it is a little bit of 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.410
 matter and I just apply the eye 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.290
 I then take a brush really 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.450
 all the end I emir traced under my mourning 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.430
 a little bit of walleye to give a 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.980
 little bit of color is a little bit 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.440
 from show to look I also come 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.060
 do the same with the color not been a 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.830
 little plums so I'm applying it 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.270
 made in rade cl to give still some 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.270
 dimension and enlarge the eye 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.210
 so here is the result then I come 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.729
 draw a line of liner so very fine 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.039
 with the in kleiner so from make up 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:10.870
 to ever really get stuck if he 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:12.520
 is something very very good in 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.259
 fact that will come to serve as a basis for 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.210
 paste our fossils 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:17.919
 so it just takes something pretty 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.449
 end and not too bright I come 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.039
 then apply my base so my 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:23.349
 mascara or very just girl from 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:25.180
 sephora that I really like that makes 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:28.680
 a crazy taf really helped really 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.680
 very well so at the level of my eyelashes 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:33.880
 so that's the result we could 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:34.990
 stop there if you want me 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.750
 personally I chose to put 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.000
 fossils so I do not stop there 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.190
 while my glue dries I apply 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.990
 then on my lips a pencil 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.120
 universal so from sephora so 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.590
 totally transparent and will come to me 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.530
 serve as a base and avoid that at mount 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.030
 lipstick art in high folds 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.009
 level so lipstick I 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.320
 chosen from all faced the mail ted 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:57.310
 purple color that I love it is 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.500
 really beautiful 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.849
 it is very very flash and I love the 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.130
 rendering of this one since the super 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:05.460
 comfortable to wear and modulables to 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.460
 wish 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.860
 here are the fossils so I chose 

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:14.090
 this is number 15 so from my house 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.830
 four forever you can use them 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.360
 if this time they are really 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.979
 awesome and I apply it with my collar 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.380
 hard both at mac 

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:24.530
 so me what I recommend is 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:26.509
 to start at level 2 of the outer corner 

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.949
 in fact the eye and then to glue your 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:29.660
 target in the inner corner this is 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:31.669
 really important since it's the corner 

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.919
