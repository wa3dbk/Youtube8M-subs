playing the game badly so you can see
what<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:13.799> looks<00:00:13.830> like

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.450

oh yeah this is a twin-turbo v8 on the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.929 
oh yeah this is a twin-turbo v8 on the
codemasters<00:00:23.119> label<00:00:23.509> on<00:00:23.929> the<00:00:24.529> amstrad<00:00:25.250> CPC<00:00:26.470> 464

codemasters label on the amstrad CPC 464
and<00:00:30.070> predictably<00:00:31.070> this<00:00:31.430> looks<00:00:31.669> nothing<00:00:32.000> like

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
and predictably this looks nothing like

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.100 
and predictably this looks nothing like
it<00:00:32.900> looked<00:00:33.110> on<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.379> label<00:00:34.040> with<00:00:34.220> foot<00:00:34.489> whoops

would have been them the graphics from

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.840 
would have been them the graphics from
other<00:00:40.159> systems<00:00:40.489> shall<00:00:41.210> we<00:00:41.329> say<00:00:42.519> it<00:00:43.519> did<00:00:43.699> look

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
other systems shall we say it did look

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.310 
other systems shall we say it did look
really<00:00:44.059> nice<00:00:44.600> on<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.140> case<00:00:45.350> further<00:00:47.320> this

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
really nice on the case further this

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
the Y very odd I I mean I'm getting used

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.169 
the Y very odd I I mean I'm getting used
to<00:01:11.539> what<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.750> amstrad<00:01:12.170> can<00:01:12.440> do<00:01:12.649> and<00:01:15.850> it<00:01:16.850> can<00:01:17.030> do

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
to what the amstrad can do and it can do

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:19.630 
to what the amstrad can do and it can do
better<00:01:17.360> than<00:01:17.479> this<00:01:17.659> so<00:01:18.320> much<00:01:18.590> better<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.520> this

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
better than this so much better and this

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.029 
better than this so much better and this
was<00:01:19.880> done<00:01:20.030> in<00:01:20.060> 1980<00:01:20.780> a<00:01:20.959> it's<00:01:21.410> not<00:01:21.530> like<00:01:21.709> it's<00:01:21.890> an

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.250 
over I'm not going to play anymore that
is<00:04:16.859> that's<00:04:17.859> not<00:04:18.070> very<00:04:18.190> good<00:04:18.340> really

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
is that's not very good really

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.140 
is that's not very good really

chunky<00:04:22.720> blocky<00:04:22.960> graphics<00:04:23.500> I<00:04:23.650> suppose<00:04:23.979> they

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
chunky blocky graphics I suppose they

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.879 
chunky blocky graphics I suppose they
get<00:04:24.340> more<00:04:24.460> colors<00:04:24.910> in<00:04:25.300> that<00:04:25.750> screen<00:04:26.020> mode<00:04:26.290> but

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
get more colors in that screen mode but

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.370 
get more colors in that screen mode but
it<00:04:27.010> ends<00:04:27.580> up<00:04:27.700> looking<00:04:27.729> like<00:04:28.090> an<00:04:28.419> Atari<00:04:28.720> 2600

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
it ends up looking like an Atari 2600

game albeit one with huge sprites and it

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.320 
game albeit one with huge sprites and it
plays<00:04:34.030> worse<00:04:34.660> I<00:04:35.020> mean<00:04:35.650> in<00:04:35.860> Euro<00:04:36.100> on<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.610> 2600

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330

is<00:04:37.450> more<00:04:37.660> enjoyable<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:38.229> play<00:04:38.290> than<00:04:38.590> that<00:04:38.620> and

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
is more enjoyable to play than that and

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.610 
is more enjoyable to play than that and
graphically<00:04:39.610> probably<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.240> part<00:04:41.200> on<00:04:41.260> the<00:04:41.380> sides

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620

of<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.889> sprites<00:04:42.330> graphically<00:04:43.330> probably

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
of the sprites graphically probably

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.680 
of the sprites graphically probably
about<00:04:44.139> on<00:04:44.350> a<00:04:44.380> par<00:04:44.650> really<00:04:45.450> no<00:04:46.650> so<00:04:47.700> turbo<00:04:48.700> twin

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
about on a par really no so turbo twin

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.260 
about on a par really no so turbo twin
turbo<00:04:50.169> v8<00:04:50.470> that's<00:04:51.250> what<00:04:51.460> that's<00:04:51.669> called<00:04:51.760> by

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
turbo v8 that's what that's called by

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:58.230 
turbo v8 that's what that's called by
codemasters<00:04:56.760> almost<00:04:57.760> certainly<00:04:58.030> would<00:04:58.180> have

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
codemasters almost certainly would have

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.770 
codemasters almost certainly would have
been<00:04:58.360> a<00:04:58.510> budget<00:04:58.960> tight<00:04:59.200> off<00:04:59.440> and<00:05:00.419> just<00:05:01.419> as<00:05:01.570> well

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
been a budget tight off and just as well

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.029 
been a budget tight off and just as well
because<00:05:01.900> I<00:05:02.020> think<00:05:02.229> anyone<00:05:02.560> if<00:05:02.680> they're<00:05:02.830> to<00:05:02.889> pay

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
because I think anyone if they're to pay

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.940 
because I think anyone if they're to pay
before<00:05:03.190> for<00:05:03.760> like<00:05:04.470> full<00:05:05.470> price<00:05:05.680> for<00:05:05.710> that

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
before for like full price for that

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.350 
before for like full price for that
would<00:05:06.100> have<00:05:06.190> felt<00:05:06.400> incredibly<00:05:06.940> ripped<00:05:07.210> off

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
would have felt incredibly ripped off

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.340 
would have felt incredibly ripped off
