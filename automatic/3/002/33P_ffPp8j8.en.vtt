00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello we continue multicolored 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.950
 knitting today we will be learning to knit 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.710
 such here 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.330
 horizontal stripes are different 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.730
 different colors but we will have stripes 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:20.699
 not straight horizontally but slightly 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:24.539
 bent and like zigzags to such as 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:29.539
 tie us the top little corner of the zigzag and 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:34.320
 bottom corner zigzag sedan for this 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:38.640
 we need top here 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.739
 part of this angle tie from one 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.149
 loops from one eyelet 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.350
 2 columns and make one between them 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:53.760
 air loop 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:57.230
 let's see how we do it 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.230
 I see further sample 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.590
 so here 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.980
 I reach the air loops which I 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:28.030
 tied up here bottom row 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:32.080
 I drive there the hook through the minute I drive 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:37.930
 crochet hook and crochet 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:40.960
 further do the air loop and one more 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.210
 double crochet i mean i increase 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.030
 I increase one air loop 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:50.009
 the number of loops and this way 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:55.619
 curving bends our line 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:02:02.310
 knitting found no pattern further we 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:07.679
 go down to the bottom of our little corner 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.540
 knit 5 nakida posts 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.959
 This pattern can be knitted as columns with 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.290
 nakida as nakida I am now with one 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.790
 nakidom biju columns to be 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.090
 clearer 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.390
 looked better so here we are 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.760
 have reached the bottom corner up now what are you 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:33.640
 do we knit here one column 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.610
 but not until the end not until the end further 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.580
 skip the loop skip 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:43.540
 we need to remove the loop 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:49.620
 hide and knit one loop missed 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:52.870
 knit the next column with double crochet 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.860
 there are three loops on the hook 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.140
 now we connect one loop 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.980
 we have that upper corner 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.799
 add 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:11.549
 loops but in the bottom we diminish 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:11.549
 loop and then knit again 5 columns 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:19.500
 top means we make a corner increase 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:26.480
 but about low points we turn 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:30.660
 subtraction and so we are now past 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.670
 about knit column and then we came to 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.330
 loops 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.970
 we recruited additional types 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:45.210
 the air loop of the bottom row of her we 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:47.580
 we enter a hook and we tie a column 1 with 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:51.180
 nakida then do the air loop and 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:57.210
 the second bar, that is, we increase 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:04:01.080
 here loops to go down 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:05.160
 corner lower corner we decrease by one 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:08.640
 loop and to knit the top corner we 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:12.830
 on the contrary we add an air loop 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:16.010
 so we do it 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.010
 zigzag pattern 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.979
 you see what we have here 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.469
 these are even corners 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.159
 I hope you understand, you can 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:36.610
 to repeat 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:41.069
 link such a pattern subscribe to my 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:43.810
 the channel will receive new lessons and 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:46.110
 share with your friends to new 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.110
 meeting
