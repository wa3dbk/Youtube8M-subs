00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.780 

finally<00:00:00.539> if<00:00:00.780> the<00:00:01.770> idea<00:00:02.100> of<00:00:02.280> plugging<00:00:02.700> the

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
finally if the idea of plugging the

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.700 
finally if the idea of plugging the
ducts<00:00:03.000> is<00:00:03.179> good<00:00:03.389> but<00:00:03.780> the<00:00:03.899> plugs<00:00:04.140> themselves

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
ducts is good but the plugs themselves

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.710 
ducts is good but the plugs themselves
are<00:00:04.920> not<00:00:05.040> tolerated<00:00:05.700> well<00:00:05.850> we<00:00:06.359> can<00:00:06.569> then

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
are not tolerated well we can then

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.169 
are not tolerated well we can then
surgically<00:00:07.319> close<00:00:07.649> these<00:00:07.890> ducts<00:00:08.309> by<00:00:08.910> using

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
surgically close these ducts by using

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.089 
surgically close these ducts by using
cautery<00:00:09.719> just<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.139> little<00:00:10.349> bit<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.620> eyelid<00:00:10.980> is

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
cautery just a little bit the eyelid is

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.129 
cautery just a little bit the eyelid is
numbed<00:00:11.340> up<00:00:11.490> so<00:00:11.700> you<00:00:11.820> don't<00:00:11.969> feel<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.389> at<00:00:12.509> all<00:00:12.630> we

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
numbed up so you don't feel it at all we

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.870 
numbed up so you don't feel it at all we
heat<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.500> up<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.830> duct<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.370> shrinks<00:00:14.639> up

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
heat it up the duct and it shrinks up

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.650 
heat it up the duct and it shrinks up
the<00:00:15.089> ducts<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.529> it's<00:00:16.890> closed<00:00:17.160> for<00:00:17.460> good

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
the ducts and and it's closed for good

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.700 
the ducts and and it's closed for good
that's<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.900> disadvantage<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.680> that

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
that's the disadvantage of that

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.380 
that's the disadvantage of that
technique<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.670> cannot<00:00:21.000> easily

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
technique is that you cannot easily

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.689 
technique is that you cannot easily
reverse<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.230> but<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.980> advantage<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.490> there's

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
reverse it but the advantage is there's

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.700 
reverse it but the advantage is there's
no<00:00:23.850> side-effects<00:00:24.720> from<00:00:24.779> irritation<00:00:25.350> from<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
no side-effects from irritation from the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.830 
no side-effects from irritation from the
plug<00:00:26.010> let's<00:00:26.789> talk<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> little<00:00:27.090> bit<00:00:27.390> about<00:00:27.420> wrist

water deficiency another thing you can

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.149 
water deficiency another thing you can
do<00:01:56.579> is<00:01:56.670> take<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:56.909> once<00:01:57.210> daily<00:01:57.890> many<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.040> my

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
do is take it once daily many of my

do is take it once daily many of my
patients<00:01:59.340> even<00:01:59.670> take<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.060> every<00:02:00.270> other<00:02:00.299> day

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570

after they've been on it for a period of
time<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.820> think<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.299> need<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:03.689> those

time I think you need to have those
first<00:02:04.170> three<00:02:04.380> months<00:02:04.649> where<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:04.860> take<00:02:05.070> it

first three months where you take it
twice<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.579> day<00:02:05.759> according<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.390> the

a lot of patients who take restiess is

after<00:02:15.250> three<00:02:15.520> months<00:02:15.820> they<00:02:15.940> say<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.510> know

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
after three months they say you know

after three months they say you know
gosh<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:16.930> can't<00:02:17.200> tell<00:02:17.440> if<00:02:17.530> it's<00:02:17.680> helping<00:02:18.070> I

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
gosh I can't tell if it's helping I

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.070 
gosh I can't tell if it's helping I
think<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:18.970> may<00:02:19.120> be<00:02:19.150> better<00:02:19.450> but<00:02:19.660> I'm<00:02:19.780> not<00:02:19.900> sure

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
think it may be better but I'm not sure

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.600 
think it may be better but I'm not sure
if<00:02:20.200> it's<00:02:20.320> just<00:02:20.470> because<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.860> weather<00:02:21.010> changed

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
if it's just because the weather changed

if it's just because the weather changed
it's<00:02:22.240> been<00:02:22.390> three<00:02:22.630> months

it's been three months
you<00:02:24.220> can<00:02:24.370> try<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:24.700> experiment<00:02:24.970> just<00:02:25.360> take<00:02:25.480> it

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
you can try and experiment just take it

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.420 
you can try and experiment just take it
in<00:02:25.690> one<00:02:25.870> eye<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.290> it's<00:02:26.830> not<00:02:26.980> going<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.220> heart

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
in one eye and it's not going to heart

not going to hurt to do that you'll

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.260 
not going to hurt to do that you'll
learn<00:02:30.100> fairly<00:02:30.490> quickly<00:02:30.730> whether<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.180> was

learn fairly quickly whether it was

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.550 
learn fairly quickly whether it was
helping<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.720> eye<00:02:31.750> that's<00:02:32.020> taking<00:02:32.350> it<00:02:32.470> or

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
helping the eye that's taking it or

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.890 
helping the eye that's taking it or
whether<00:02:33.010> it's<00:02:33.190> not<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:34.000> you're<00:02:34.300> welcome<00:02:34.540> to

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
as we get older that conjunctiva becomes

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.670 
as we get older that conjunctiva becomes
thicker<00:04:49.310> and<00:04:49.520> it<00:04:49.580> becomes<00:04:49.850> looser<00:04:50.150> like<00:04:50.720> much

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
thicker and it becomes looser like much

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.200 
thicker and it becomes looser like much
of<00:04:51.710> our<00:04:51.949> skin<00:04:53.110> actually<00:04:54.729> it<00:04:55.729> becomes<00:04:56.000> thicker

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
of our skin actually it becomes thicker

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.520 
of our skin actually it becomes thicker
in<00:04:56.360> some<00:04:56.510> places<00:04:56.720> and<00:04:56.990> like<00:04:57.080> our<00:04:57.229> skin<00:04:57.440> it

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
in some places and like our skin it

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.750 
in some places and like our skin it
becomes<00:04:57.620> thinner<00:04:58.070> in<00:04:58.280> other<00:04:58.430> places

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
becomes thinner in other places

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.370 
becomes thinner in other places
typically<00:04:59.389> as<00:04:59.479> we<00:04:59.510> age<00:04:59.780> our<00:04:59.930> skin<00:04:59.990> gets

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
typically as we age our skin gets

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.230 
typically as we age our skin gets
thinner<00:05:00.710> doesn't<00:05:01.130> it<00:05:01.190> gets<00:05:01.400> more<00:05:01.580> fragile<00:05:01.850> and

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
thinner doesn't it gets more fragile and

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.020 
thinner doesn't it gets more fragile and
the<00:05:02.630> same<00:05:02.810> is<00:05:02.990> true<00:05:03.139> here<00:05:03.520> but<00:05:04.520> what<00:05:04.639> happens

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
the same is true here but what happens

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.370 
the same is true here but what happens
and<00:05:05.150> what<00:05:05.240> causes<00:05:05.450> the<00:05:05.720> problem<00:05:05.840> is<00:05:06.260> a

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
and what causes the problem is a

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.430 
and what causes the problem is a
bunching<00:05:07.250> up<00:05:07.400> of<00:05:07.580> this<00:05:08.240> mucous<00:05:08.750> membrane<00:05:09.229> at

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
bunching up of this mucous membrane at

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.290 
bunching up of this mucous membrane at
the<00:05:09.590> lower<00:05:09.830> corner<00:05:10.460> of<00:05:10.490> the<00:05:10.610> island<00:05:11.150> a

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
the lower corner of the island a

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.240 
the lower corner of the island a
bunching<00:05:12.110> up<00:05:12.260> so<00:05:12.380> that<00:05:12.560> when<00:05:12.680> the<00:05:12.800> eyelid

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
bunching up so that when the eyelid

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.909 
bunching up so that when the eyelid
moves<00:05:13.610> this<00:05:14.240> skin<00:05:14.960> like<00:05:15.200> tissue<00:05:15.440> which<00:05:15.889> is

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
moves this skin like tissue which is

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.340 
moves this skin like tissue which is
designed<00:05:16.430> to<00:05:16.669> stay<00:05:16.940> talked<00:05:17.300> and<00:05:17.630> stretched

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
designed to stay talked and stretched

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.990 
designed to stay talked and stretched
over<00:05:18.710> the<00:05:18.800> surface<00:05:19.190> of<00:05:19.310> the<00:05:19.370> eyeball<00:05:19.820> it

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
over the surface of the eyeball it

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.330 
over the surface of the eyeball it
bunches<00:05:20.570> up<00:05:20.630> it<00:05:20.930> folds<00:05:21.320> over<00:05:21.440> and<00:05:21.800> when<00:05:22.220> our

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
bunches up it folds over and when our

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.029 
bunches up it folds over and when our
eye<00:05:22.490> moves<00:05:22.820> it<00:05:23.000> gets<00:05:23.150> pinched<00:05:23.710> between<00:05:24.710> the

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
eye moves it gets pinched between the

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:26.950 
eye moves it gets pinched between the
eyelid<00:05:25.430> and<00:05:25.520> the<00:05:25.610> eyeball<00:05:26.000> and<00:05:26.180> that<00:05:26.360> pinching

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
eyelid and the eyeball and that pinching

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.610 
eyelid and the eyeball and that pinching
causes<00:05:27.710> a<00:05:27.740> very<00:05:28.039> distinct<00:05:28.699> painful<00:05:29.620> foreign

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
causes a very distinct painful foreign

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.550 
causes a very distinct painful foreign
body<00:05:30.860> sensation<00:05:31.190> and<00:05:31.789> burning<00:05:32.270> and<00:05:32.450> so<00:05:33.080> it

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
body sensation and burning and so it

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.400 
body sensation and burning and so it
typically<00:05:34.370> occurs<00:05:34.729> in<00:05:34.910> people<00:05:35.060> over<00:05:35.360> 50<00:05:35.900> who

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
typically occurs in people over 50 who

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.680 
typically occurs in people over 50 who
have<00:05:36.620> typically<00:05:37.460> been<00:05:37.550> previously<00:05:38.120> diagnosed

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
have typically been previously diagnosed

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.360 
have typically been previously diagnosed
with<00:05:38.870> dry<00:05:39.110> eye<00:05:39.139> I<00:05:39.560> think<00:05:40.130> there's<00:05:40.310> a

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
with dry eye I think there's a

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.210 
with dry eye I think there's a
relationship<00:05:41.120> to<00:05:41.330> prior<00:05:41.750> ocular<00:05:42.560> surgery

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
relationship to prior ocular surgery

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.400 
relationship to prior ocular surgery
because<00:05:44.090> what<00:05:44.300> happens<00:05:44.660> very<00:05:44.780> often<00:05:45.200> when<00:05:45.320> we

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
because what happens very often when we

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.409 
because what happens very often when we
do<00:05:45.530> surgery<00:05:45.830> on<00:05:46.039> the<00:05:46.280> eye<00:05:46.310> is<00:05:46.639> what's<00:05:47.090> shown<00:05:47.389> in

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
do surgery on the eye is what's shown in

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.150 
do surgery on the eye is what's shown in
this<00:05:47.630> picture<00:05:47.840> there's<00:05:48.229> swelling<00:05:48.590> of<00:05:48.979> this

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
this picture there's swelling of this

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.070 
this picture there's swelling of this
mucous<00:05:49.550> membrane<00:05:50.000> can<00:05:50.389> you<00:05:50.510> appreciate<00:05:50.780> in

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
mucous membrane can you appreciate in

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.170 
mucous membrane can you appreciate in
that<00:05:51.200> picture<00:05:51.470> how<00:05:51.800> the<00:05:51.860> the<00:05:52.460> mucous<00:05:52.820> membrane

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
that picture how the the mucous membrane

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.779 
that picture how the the mucous membrane
is<00:05:53.330> bub<00:05:53.840> bubbled<00:05:54.440> up<00:05:54.560> it's<00:05:54.889> not<00:05:55.099> flat<00:05:55.490> on<00:05:55.700> the

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
is bub bubbled up it's not flat on the

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:57.580 
is bub bubbled up it's not flat on the
white<00:05:56.000> of<00:05:56.150> the<00:05:56.180> eye<00:05:56.270> this<00:05:56.750> is<00:05:56.900> called<00:05:57.110> chemo

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
white of the eye this is called chemo

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.529 
white of the eye this is called chemo
psious<00:05:57.919> and<00:05:58.130> when<00:05:58.580> this<00:05:58.729> happens<00:05:59.120> we<00:05:59.270> think

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
psious and when this happens we think

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.990 
psious and when this happens we think
that<00:05:59.720> it<00:05:59.870> it<00:06:00.260> stretches<00:06:00.860> the<00:06:00.889> the<00:06:01.340> tissue<00:06:01.729> that

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
that it it stretches the the tissue that

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.839 
that it it stretches the the tissue that
holds<00:06:02.720> down<00:06:02.960> the<00:06:03.340> mucous<00:06:04.340> membrane<00:06:04.729> the

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
holds down the mucous membrane the

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.540 
holds down the mucous membrane the
conjunctiva<00:06:05.240> and<00:06:05.750> allows<00:06:06.560> this<00:06:06.950> process<00:06:07.400> to

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
conjunctiva and allows this process to

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.310 
conjunctiva and allows this process to
begin<00:06:07.700> where<00:06:08.060> the<00:06:08.210> tissue<00:06:08.720> gets<00:06:08.930> stretched

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
begin where the tissue gets stretched

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.379 
begin where the tissue gets stretched
and<00:06:09.590> loosened<00:06:10.039> and<00:06:10.160> then<00:06:10.580> it'll<00:06:10.760> pinch<00:06:11.030> on<00:06:11.270> the

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
and loosened and then it'll pinch on the

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.870 
and loosened and then it'll pinch on the
surface<00:06:11.750> of<00:06:11.900> the<00:06:11.990> eye<00:06:12.020> we<00:06:12.919> can<00:06:13.130> treat<00:06:13.370> this<00:06:13.610> and

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
surface of the eye we can treat this and

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.760 
surface of the eye we can treat this and
in<00:06:14.120> fact<00:06:14.150> there's<00:06:14.599> a<00:06:14.690> fairly<00:06:15.110> simple<00:06:15.530> surgery

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
in fact there's a fairly simple surgery

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.370 
in fact there's a fairly simple surgery
where<00:06:16.430> we<00:06:16.610> remove<00:06:17.060> the<00:06:17.270> excess<00:06:17.380> mucus

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
where we remove the excess mucus

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.770 
where we remove the excess mucus
membrane<00:06:19.070> in<00:06:19.310> the<00:06:19.460> area<00:06:19.849> that's<00:06:20.000> irritated

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
membrane in the area that's irritated

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.370 
membrane in the area that's irritated
and<00:06:20.900> when<00:06:21.500> we<00:06:21.710> do<00:06:21.950> this<00:06:22.190> it<00:06:22.460> is<00:06:23.090> dramatic<00:06:23.750> this

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
and when we do this it is dramatic this

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.430 
and when we do this it is dramatic this
is<00:06:24.530> a<00:06:24.560> patient<00:06:25.180> before<00:06:26.180> and<00:06:26.599> one<00:06:26.810> month<00:06:27.020> after

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
is a patient before and one month after

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.409 
is a patient before and one month after
surgery<00:06:27.650> what<00:06:28.430> you<00:06:28.550> see<00:06:28.729> on<00:06:28.820> the<00:06:28.940> right<00:06:29.120> side

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419 
surgery what you see on the right side

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:31.390 
surgery what you see on the right side
it's<00:06:29.750> hard<00:06:29.960> to<00:06:30.139> photograph<00:06:30.650> this<00:06:30.889> but<00:06:31.130> you<00:06:31.250> can

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
it's hard to photograph this but you can

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.620 
it's hard to photograph this but you can
see<00:06:31.550> there's<00:06:31.760> this<00:06:31.910> sort<00:06:32.150> of<00:06:32.240> pinkish

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
see there's this sort of pinkish

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.200 
see there's this sort of pinkish
redundant<00:06:33.260> tissue<00:06:33.470> here<00:06:34.219> after<00:06:34.729> one<00:06:35.000> month

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
redundant tissue here after one month
