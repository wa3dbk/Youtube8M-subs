now<00:00:21.600> I've<00:00:22.109> said<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.560> many<00:00:23.010> times<00:00:23.100> up<00:00:24.000> till

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
now I've said that many times up till

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.400 
now I've said that many times up till
this<00:00:24.300> point<00:00:24.570> but<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.840> never<00:00:25.019> really<00:00:25.199> got<00:00:25.289> into

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
this point but I never really got into

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.540 
this point but I never really got into
how<00:00:25.619> exactly<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.130> was<00:00:26.220> going<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.400> happen

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
how exactly that was going to happen

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.759 
how exactly that was going to happen
yeah<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.359> briefly<00:00:27.689> touched<00:00:28.019> on<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.529> mount

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
yeah I briefly touched on it and mount

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.339 
yeah I briefly touched on it and mount
mechanic<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.310> gonna<00:00:29.490> help<00:00:29.960> the<00:00:30.960> health<00:00:31.109> globe

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
mechanic is gonna help the health globe

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.900 
mechanic is gonna help the health globe
system<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.769> going<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.980> help<00:00:32.160> but<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.700> biggest

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
system is going to help but the biggest

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.280 
system is going to help but the biggest
factor<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.480> encouraging<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.020> early

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
factor in encouraging that early

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.510 
factor in encouraging that early
team-based<00:00:34.559> aggression<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.160> gonna<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
team-based aggression is gonna be the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.280 
team-based aggression is gonna be the
new<00:00:35.640> tower<00:00:35.880> mechanic<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.450> Blizzard<00:00:36.690> all-stars

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
new tower mechanic in Blizzard all-stars

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.889 
new tower mechanic in Blizzard all-stars
so<00:00:37.860> specifically<00:00:38.399> towers<00:00:39.300> are<00:00:39.510> actually

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
so specifically towers are actually

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.660 
so specifically towers are actually
going<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.079> have<00:00:40.290> slowly<00:00:40.980> regenerating

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
going to have slowly regenerating

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.860 
going to have slowly regenerating
limited<00:00:42.210> ammunition

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
limited ammunition

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.200 
limited ammunition
so<00:00:43.350> what<00:00:43.469> does<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.649> mean<00:00:43.890> as<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.760> Terra<00:00:44.940> fires

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
so what does this mean as it Terra fires

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.430 
so what does this mean as it Terra fires
more<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.600> more<00:00:45.719> bullets<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.230> eventually

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
more and more bullets it's eventually

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.549 
more and more bullets it's eventually
just<00:00:46.710> gonna<00:00:46.829> run<00:00:47.039> out<00:00:47.329> so<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.809> actually<00:00:49.410> if

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
just gonna run out so it actually if

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.319 
just gonna run out so it actually if
it's<00:00:49.710> firing<00:00:50.160> at<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.399> rate<00:00:50.550> faster<00:00:50.850> than<00:00:51.180> its

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
it's firing at a rate faster than its

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.639 
it's firing at a rate faster than its
regenerating<00:00:51.840> obviously<00:00:52.289> you're<00:00:52.379> gonna<00:00:52.469> hit

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
regenerating obviously you're gonna hit

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.200 
regenerating obviously you're gonna hit
zero<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.370> at<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.610> point<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.969> tower<00:00:54.149> just

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
zero and at that point the tower just

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.000 
zero and at that point the tower just
shrinks<00:00:54.629> down<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> ground<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.620> you're

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
shrinks down to the ground and you're

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.830 
shrinks down to the ground and you're
free<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.460> take<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.789> out<00:00:56.910> yes<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.690> still

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
free to just take it out yes it's still

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.270 
free to just take it out yes it's still
gonna<00:00:57.989> be<00:00:58.079> regenerating<00:00:58.649> ammo<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.129> might

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
gonna be regenerating ammo so it might

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.459 
gonna be regenerating ammo so it might
pop<00:00:59.699> back<00:00:59.730> up<00:00:59.940> shoot<00:01:00.359> off<00:01:00.480> one<00:01:00.719> missile<00:01:01.350> and

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
pop back up shoot off one missile and

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.170 
pop back up shoot off one missile and
then<00:01:01.590> drop<00:01:01.829> back<00:01:02.010> down<00:01:02.219> which<00:01:02.760> case<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.059> can

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
then drop back down which case you can

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.030 
then drop back down which case you can
just<00:01:03.359> freely<00:01:03.629> take<00:01:03.870> tower<00:01:04.140> out<00:01:04.409> why<00:01:04.860> don't<00:01:04.979> you

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
just freely take tower out why don't you

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.649 
just freely take tower out why don't you
take<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> little<00:01:05.369> look<00:01:05.580> at<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.760> video<00:01:05.939> stiches

they<00:01:33.840> took<00:01:33.960> out<00:01:34.140> because<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.500> dropped<00:01:34.710> back

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
they took out because it dropped back

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.310 
they took out because it dropped back
down<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.670> because<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.180> stitches<00:01:36.930> was

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
down so because of that stitches was

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.560 
down so because of that stitches was
kinda<00:01:37.799> sort<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.070> screwed<00:01:38.369> there<00:01:39.060> very<00:01:39.270> early

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
kinda sort of screwed there very early

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.850 
kinda sort of screwed there very early
into<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.750> game<00:01:39.990> they've<00:01:40.290> already<00:01:40.439> lost<00:01:40.650> their

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
into the game they've already lost their

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.530 
into the game they've already lost their
tier<00:01:41.009> 1<00:01:41.159> tower<00:01:41.340> stitches<00:01:41.820> might<00:01:42.060> die<00:01:42.299> because

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
tier 1 tower stitches might die because

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.510 
tier 1 tower stitches might die because
of<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.930> he<00:01:43.170> kind<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.740> looks<00:01:44.070> like<00:01:44.130> he's<00:01:44.310> afk

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
of this he kind of looks like he's afk

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.340 
of this he kind of looks like he's afk
they're<00:01:44.850> not<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> big<00:01:45.509> deal<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> point<00:01:46.200> is

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
they're not a big deal but the point is

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.620 
they're not a big deal but the point is
this<00:01:46.890> tower<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.310> now<00:01:47.430> down<00:01:47.640> very<00:01:48.030> very<00:01:48.329> early

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
this tower is now down very very early

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.350 
this tower is now down very very early
into<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.840> game<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.860> think<00:01:50.040> about<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.490> if<00:01:50.759> you

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
into the game so think about that if you

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.330 
into the game so think about that if you
team<00:01:51.689> up<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.409> push<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.740> lane<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> full

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
team up and you push the lane as a full

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.940 
team up and you push the lane as a full
team<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.909> five<00:01:54.299> we<00:01:55.170> were<00:01:55.350> gonna<00:01:55.439> be<00:01:55.590> taking<00:01:55.860> out

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
team of five we were gonna be taking out

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.139 
team of five we were gonna be taking out
terrorists<00:01:56.280> pretty<00:01:56.579> quick

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
terrorists pretty quick

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.459 
terrorists pretty quick
it's<00:01:57.270> gonna<00:01:57.420> make<00:01:57.570> things<00:01:57.719> much<00:01:57.990> much<00:01:58.259> easier

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
it's gonna make things much much easier

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.080 
it's gonna make things much much easier
and<00:01:58.829> you're<00:01:58.979> obviously<00:01:59.159> gonna<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.939> big

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
and you're obviously gonna have that big

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.670 
and you're obviously gonna have that big
advantage<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.869> push<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.170> lane<00:02:01.290> all<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.590> way

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
advantage you push the lane all the way

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.200 
advantage you push the lane all the way
down<00:02:01.920> well<00:02:02.399> now<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.820> do<00:02:02.939> things<00:02:03.090> like

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
down well now you can do things like

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.940 
down well now you can do things like
jungle<00:02:03.570> take<00:02:03.899> out<00:02:04.049> those<00:02:04.170> jungle<00:02:04.560> creeps<00:02:04.740> get

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
jungle take out those jungle creeps get

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.429 
jungle take out those jungle creeps get
the<00:02:05.070> neutral<00:02:05.369> teams<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:05.729> on<00:02:06.000> your<00:02:06.119> side

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
the neutral teams on on your side

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.199 
the neutral teams on on your side
there's<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.740> opens<00:02:08.069> up<00:02:08.190> many<00:02:08.489> options<00:02:09.030> and

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
there's it opens up many options and

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.580 
there's it opens up many options and
actually<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.539> believe<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.899> touched<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.319> this<00:02:10.410> and

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
actually I believe I touched on this and

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.890 
actually I believe I touched on this and
last<00:02:10.800> week's<00:02:11.039> episode<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.690> tower

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
also gonna be five different types of

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.020 
also gonna be five different types of
towers<00:02:19.210> they<00:02:19.750> are<00:02:19.870> men<00:02:20.110> upon<00:02:20.590> Knight<00:02:21.310> rook<00:02:21.790> and

then of course the healing pad which is

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.690 
then of course the healing pad which is
kind<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:23.950> just<00:02:24.070> like<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.280> fountain<00:02:24.490> it's

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
kind of just like the fountain it's

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.000 
kind of just like the fountain it's
beginning<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.240> base<00:02:25.560> now<00:02:26.560> I'm<00:02:26.650> not<00:02:26.800> sure<00:02:26.920> if

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
beginning the base now I'm not sure if

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.410 
beginning the base now I'm not sure if
this<00:02:27.100> information<00:02:27.340> is<00:02:27.730> outdated<00:02:27.880> at<00:02:28.300> this

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
point whether or not it's been changed

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.710 
point whether or not it's been changed
not<00:02:29.890> entirely<00:02:30.190> sure<00:02:30.310> we<00:02:31.240> also<00:02:31.390> don't<00:02:31.630> know

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
it concealer we'll see you buy it you

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.710 
it concealer we'll see you buy it you
can<00:02:48.310> only<00:02:48.520> use<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:48.790> once<00:02:48.820> you<00:02:49.209> can<00:02:49.360> continue

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
can only use it once you can continue

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.750 
can only use it once you can continue
buying<00:02:49.930> them<00:02:50.110> so<00:02:50.830> works<00:02:51.130> similar<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.610> how<00:02:51.730> a

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
buying them so works similar to how a

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.150 
buying them so works similar to how a
ward<00:02:52.120> would<00:02:52.240> work<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:52.540> DotA<00:02:52.750> 2

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
ward would work in DotA 2

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.860 
ward would work in DotA 2
so<00:02:54.459> you<00:02:54.550> purchase<00:02:54.970> this<00:02:55.120> auto<00:02:55.330> turret<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:55.780> you

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
so you purchase this auto turret and you

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.060 
so you purchase this auto turret and you
can<00:02:56.020> actually<00:02:56.110> drop<00:02:56.380> it<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.620> lane<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:56.980> it

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
can actually drop it in a lane and it

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.790 
can actually drop it in a lane and it
acts<00:02:57.220> very<00:02:58.209> much<00:02:58.690> like<00:02:58.990> a<00:02:59.050> tower<00:02:59.290> so<00:02:59.620> you<00:02:59.680> can

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
acts very much like a tower so you can

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.050 
acts very much like a tower so you can
drop<00:02:59.950> in<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.160> lane<00:03:00.310> wherever<00:03:00.550> you'd<00:03:00.700> like<00:03:00.850> and

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
drop in the lane wherever you'd like and

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.640 
drop in the lane wherever you'd like and
it<00:03:01.120> just<00:03:01.150> sits<00:03:01.420> there<00:03:01.510> does<00:03:01.930> damage<00:03:02.320> until<00:03:02.530> it

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
it just sits there does damage until it

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.680 
it just sits there does damage until it
dies<00:03:02.800> works<00:03:03.520> out<00:03:03.730> pretty<00:03:03.850> well<00:03:04.000> especially

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
dies works out pretty well especially

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.150 
dies works out pretty well especially
for<00:03:04.810> that<00:03:04.900> team<00:03:05.110> that's<00:03:05.290> losing<00:03:05.500> tower<00:03:05.950> is

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
for that team that's losing tower is

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.160 
for that team that's losing tower is
very<00:03:06.550> very<00:03:06.820> quickly<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:07.660> keep<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:07.990> in<00:03:08.050> mind

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
very very quickly so keep that in mind

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.870 
very very quickly so keep that in mind
otherwise<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.100> last<00:03:09.310> thing<00:03:09.520> I<00:03:09.580> wanted<00:03:09.790> to

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
otherwise the last thing I wanted to

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.020 
otherwise the last thing I wanted to
point<00:03:10.060> out<00:03:10.270> was<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:11.590> actual<00:03:12.040> counter<00:03:12.550> to

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
point out was the actual counter to

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.840 
point out was the actual counter to
towers<00:03:13.450> so<00:03:14.020> yeah<00:03:14.350> sure<00:03:14.709> towers<00:03:15.310> do<00:03:15.550> pretty

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
towers so yeah sure towers do pretty

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.240 
towers so yeah sure towers do pretty
good<00:03:15.940> DPS<00:03:16.590> aside<00:03:17.590> from<00:03:17.709> the<00:03:17.800> fact<00:03:17.980> that<00:03:18.040> their

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
good DPS aside from the fact that their

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.790 
good DPS aside from the fact that their
ammunition<00:03:18.580> does<00:03:19.180> indeed<00:03:19.570> run<00:03:19.840> out<00:03:19.989> there's

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
ammunition does indeed run out there's

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.370 
ammunition does indeed run out there's

his attack he's actually out ranging the
tower<00:03:40.330> right<00:03:40.570> now<00:03:40.600> similar<00:03:41.080> to<00:03:41.260> something

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
tower right now similar to something

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.910 
tower right now similar to something
like<00:03:41.830> sniper<00:03:42.299> with<00:03:43.299> his<00:03:43.450> skill<00:03:43.750> at<00:03:44.260> level<00:03:44.560> 4<00:03:44.739> in

not<00:04:01.780> raging<00:04:02.049> the<00:04:02.230> tower<00:04:02.440> so<00:04:02.980> he's<00:04:03.100> doing<00:04:03.280> a

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
not raging the tower so he's doing a

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.500 
not raging the tower so he's doing a
really<00:04:03.549> good<00:04:03.730> job<00:04:03.790> so<00:04:03.970> you<00:04:04.150> actually<00:04:04.239> have<00:04:04.450> to

really good job so you actually have to

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.850 
really good job so you actually have to
be<00:04:04.600> careful<00:04:04.959> about<00:04:05.110> this<00:04:05.290> because<00:04:05.350> if<00:04:05.830> you

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
be careful about this because if you

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.130 
be careful about this because if you
actually<00:04:06.100> set<00:04:06.910> up<00:04:06.940> a<00:04:07.060> great<00:04:07.360> team<00:04:07.690> you<00:04:07.989> get
