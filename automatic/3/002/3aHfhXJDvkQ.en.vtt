a<00:04:45.420> d20<00:04:45.900> for<00:04:46.350> you<00:04:46.830> look<00:04:47.640> at<00:04:47.760> the<00:04:47.850> back<00:04:48.030> of<00:04:48.270> this

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
a d20 for you look at the back of this

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.980 
a d20 for you look at the back of this
d24<00:04:49.830> there's<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:50.580> ring<00:04:50.820> it's<00:04:51.180> like<00:04:51.360> something

so<00:05:03.630> you<00:05:03.780> damara

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
so you damara

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.800 
so you damara
basically<00:05:05.460> is<00:05:05.670> a<00:05:05.700> very<00:05:06.000> old<00:05:06.210> tree<00:05:06.450> design

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
basically is a very old tree design

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.300 
basically is a very old tree design
around<00:05:07.080> 25<00:05:07.620> so<00:05:07.920> 3<00:05:08.630> mi<00:05:09.630> good<00:05:09.870> around<00:05:10.170> 3<00:05:10.740> to<00:05:10.890> 4<00:05:10.920> kg

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
around 25 so 3 mi good around 3 to 4 kg

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.050 
around 25 so 3 mi good around 3 to 4 kg
I<00:05:11.700> guess<00:05:12.090> this<00:05:12.300> is<00:05:12.450> only<00:05:12.570> around<00:05:13.190> 2<00:05:14.190> kg<00:05:14.610> or<00:05:14.760> one

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
I guess this is only around 2 kg or one

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.320 
I guess this is only around 2 kg or one

then the Asia is around the tips you got
a<00:05:24.180> bit<00:05:24.450> of<00:05:24.570> line<00:05:24.780> here<00:05:25.140> it's<00:05:25.560> very<00:05:25.620> wrong<00:05:26.070> so

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
a bit of line here it's very wrong so

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.000 
a bit of line here it's very wrong so
this<00:05:27.060> is<00:05:27.150> a<00:05:27.210> Google<00:05:27.330> Mira

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
so in order to make sure it's pretty

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.700 
so in order to make sure it's pretty
flash<00:05:32.430> we<00:05:32.940> see<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:33.270> stem<00:05:33.510> the<00:05:33.720> stem<00:05:33.780> is<00:05:34.140> a<00:05:34.169> bit

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
flash we see the stem the stem is a bit

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.940 
flash we see the stem the stem is a bit
sticky<00:05:35.010> that<00:05:35.280> means<00:05:35.550> the<00:05:36.240> foot<00:05:36.810> just<00:05:37.320> drop
