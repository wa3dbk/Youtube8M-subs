huge<00:01:20.050> implants<00:01:20.830> I<00:01:21.040> mean<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.210> thing<00:01:22.480> is<00:01:22.510> if<00:01:23.080> you

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
huge implants I mean the thing is if you

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.080 
huge implants I mean the thing is if you
don't<00:01:23.260> mind<00:01:23.410> but<00:01:23.740> I<00:01:23.860> think<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.460> thing<00:01:24.670> is<00:01:24.820> for

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
don't mind but I think the thing is for

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.690 
don't mind but I think the thing is for
us<00:01:25.180> is<00:01:25.480> the<00:01:25.720> variables<00:01:26.230> are<00:01:26.500> a<00:01:26.830> Billy

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
us is the variables are a Billy

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.210 
us is the variables are a Billy
difficulty<00:01:28.600> in<00:01:28.720> fixing<00:01:29.080> them<00:01:29.200> number<00:01:29.530> one<00:01:29.560> the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
difficulty in fixing them number one the

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.750 
difficulty in fixing them number one the
risks<00:01:30.760> involved<00:01:31.150> and<00:01:31.570> how<00:01:32.230> bad<00:01:32.770> their<00:01:33.310> problem

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
risks involved and how bad their problem

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.240 
risks involved and how bad their problem
is<00:01:33.940> what<00:01:34.450> unwatched<00:01:34.930> what's<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.890> number<00:01:36.220> one

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
is what unwatched what's the number one

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.780 
is what unwatched what's the number one
reason<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.700> turn<00:01:36.910> people<00:01:37.240> away<00:01:38.790> unrealistic

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
reason you turn people away unrealistic

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.730 
reason you turn people away unrealistic
expectations<00:01:40.660> seriously<00:01:41.260> even<00:01:41.440> on<00:01:41.560> botched

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
expectations seriously even on botched

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.710 
expectations seriously even on botched
like<00:01:42.100> when<00:01:42.250> they<00:01:42.370> have<00:01:42.460> that<00:01:42.700> much<00:01:43.000> damage

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
like when they have that much damage

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.170 
like when they have that much damage
already<00:01:44.260> okay<00:01:45.100> so<00:01:45.160> if<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.610> patient<00:01:46.000> comes

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
already okay so if a patient comes

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.290 
already okay so if a patient comes

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
yeah as I said it's the antithesis of it

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.540 
yeah as I said it's the antithesis of it
because<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:47.440> have<00:02:47.590> someone<00:02:47.890> basically<00:02:48.130> comes

in and say this is what you have to not

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.740 
in and say this is what you have to not
do<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:51.430> we're<00:02:51.610> trying<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.910> protect<00:02:52.090> people<00:02:52.480> out
