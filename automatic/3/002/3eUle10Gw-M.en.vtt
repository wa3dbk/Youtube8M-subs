00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.830
 I can't have an iPhone for an hour. 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.110
 To shut up! 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.360
 Where is my alarm clock going? 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.150
 If you rely on all the technology products... 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.990
 Where is his X computer? 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.870
 ...has never existed? 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.480
 Mom, what about my computer? 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.990
 What is yours? 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.490
 My computer, Mom! 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.860
 Don't make fun of me again. 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.700
 Where is my phone dead? 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.070
 Just there, little fool 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.530
 What is this rotten thing? 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.930
 I don't remember the address book now. 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.600
 All in the phone 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.340
 hate! 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.300
 Oh dear 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.800
 Why don't you stir the cream? 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.490
 This always makes you calm down 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.270
 Do not... 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.010
 no no... 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.380
 A boy with a very hairy... 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.380
 Fight for survival 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.500
 Oh my God 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.490
 I'm lost! 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.200
 Hey, how can I get to No. 343, Spark Road? 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.230
 No problem, you turn left at Stubs Road. How can I get to No. 343, Spark Road? 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.950
 No problem, you turn left at Stubs Road. 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.860
 Go to Luver Street and turn right 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.480
 Go to the first traffic light and turn right. 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.850
 But don't turn the first intersection 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:07.620
 You will get lost 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.220
 After that, you will go this way again... 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.000
 How do I remember this? 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.180
 No problem. 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.630
 Give you a map 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.690
 How is this ghost thing used? 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.110
 ...to be integrated into a world thirty years ago 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.200
 What happened to the dude? 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.940
 What happened to Ian? 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.460
 No one has GPS here. 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.070
 My toothbrush won’t vibrate 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.100
 I can't complain about my life on Twitter. 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.090
 Brother calm down 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.850
 I have two tickets for the Skrillex concert. 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.740
 Want to go together? 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.790
 My God...of course! Please, do you want to go together? 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.720
 My God...of course! please 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.700
 Dude, I almost went crazy. 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.170
 Wonderful to come 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.040
 Do not 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.680
 This is not at all 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.770
 Skrillex, you are great!! 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.900
 How long can you live? 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.660
 Come and have something to eat. 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.990
 How can I eat it? 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.230
 I haven't sent the photo to Instagram yet. 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.530
 It’s right to eat. 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.860
 My own cream 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.620
 Especially delicious 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.840
 A world without a touch screen... 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.450
 How do you turn the page? 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.070
 A world where you can't share your life with your friends 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.390
 I started to be afraid of my dude. 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.890
 Everything is not working properly 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.610
 Just like what Gandhi said 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.670
 Nothing to fear except fear itself 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.400
 Hey... is Roosevelt saying? 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.400
 No... I’m sure it’s sweet. 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.230
 Ok, let's see how the wiki is written. 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.230
 Who is the wiki? 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.330
 My god, if there is no Wikipedia. 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.890
 How do we prove that others are wrong? 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.660
 Oh, then I think what I said should be right. 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.380
 No... no... no... 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.790
 Do not! ! ! I must prove that you are wrong! 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.530
 I must! 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.900
 Anthony! 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.990
 Here is the British King General 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.580
 The experiment has failed 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.930
 Can I stop the experiment? 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.670
 Hey....okay. 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.000
 Thanks 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.480

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.270

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.690
 The movie version of our era is rotten by Smosh 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.570
 Wait, no iPod, how can I run? 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.060
