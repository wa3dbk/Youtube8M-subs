00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.070
 how friends are I juanca and in this 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.400
 I'll show you how to collect 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.910
 cypress seeds so let's go with 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.920
 the video 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.510
 to collect cypress seeds 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.969
 The first thing we have to look for is 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.340
 the fruits that the cypress gives to here 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.250
 we have these pineapples or calculations like 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.349
 it's also called we have to look for the 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.939
 more mature possible these than just 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.430
 they are starting that they still have a color 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.019
 greenish this is not worth it 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.869
 we have to find some that are 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.869
 completely mature in their entirety 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.149
 we look for the pineapples in the cypress 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:44.059
 are more mature and we can start them 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.550
 with your hand directly or with some 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.680
 scissors but it's easy to cut so 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.739
 really some ciphers does not either 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.899
 much missing this yes that we are worth has 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.510
 have a brown tone with our 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.190
 it is grayish it is quite mature and 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.870
 Now we just have to take out the 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.320
 seeds that are found is a 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.409
 inside so let's go to it here 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.780
 we have the pineapple that we just cut 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.700
 there are many ways of Ã¡vila to look 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.140
 the seed there are ones that are very 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.270
 impatient and what they do is 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.979
 just cut it in half and 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.979
 wait a little while to dry 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.319
 inside to be able to take out the seeds 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.649
 others simply put them to boil a 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:27.619
 couple of minutes while going to go see 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.590
 the water this also tends to open up 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.859
 but the best way 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.750
 leave them in the sun, leave them in one place 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:40.270
 where from the sun all day 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:43.250
 completely and the sun will begin to 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.880
 ripening the ies will cause it to go 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.860
 opening after about two more weeks or 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.440
 less will start to look like this 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.040
 here you see that this is already starting to 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.430
 move and inside you start to see a 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.220
 little seeds 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.780
 you let spend a little more time already 3-4 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.450
 weeks will already have this aspect open 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.370
 almost completely the seeds are already 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:17.220
 in there and just to get them out 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.209
 you start to hit to move it and you go 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.209
 Seeing how they are falling 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.170
 came a single pineapple come out many 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.640
 seeds 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.370
 the only bad thing is that of those seeds 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.930
 only 40 percent as much 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:42.410
 so you see that more than half 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.300
 they are not worth at all we have already taken almost 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:51.550
 all the seeds of this pineapple 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.819
 that's why it's good to have several seeds 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.170
 Over there 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.170
 how will you see a little 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.319
 they are falling 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.410
 in this way we get the seeds 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.140
 of the cypresses 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.180
 now how to know what the seeds are 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.670
 that really will be worth to us 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.650
 cultivate for this there is a very trick 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.530
 simple we just look for a glass of 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.710
 Water 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.820
 and we throw the seeds inside him 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.820
 let's go throwing 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:36.890
 and we have to let a moment pass 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.890
 let them soak 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.230
 that they are putting with the water 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:52.830
 wait a bit or move it 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.830
 to accelerate the process 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.970
 with what we are doing with this 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.700
 we are discarding what are the 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.160
 seeds that are worth us and those that do not 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.800
 as you can appreciate the ones that sink 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.810
 are the ones that interest us, these are the 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.989
 that have some seed inside 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:15.410
 the breaks are hollow they have nothing 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:18.320
 and that 's why they float as you can see 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.530
 of all that we have taken out only 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.480
 we have a few others we do not 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.270
 they are worth nothing so this we can 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.400
 throw the others are ready to be 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.430
 cultivated crops can also go through the 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.650
 process to stratify but that's already 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.650
 in another video thank you very much
