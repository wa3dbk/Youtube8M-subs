00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.900
 because now we can work here in tip-top and attend patients 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.909
 in our clinic 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:28.750
 with a new technology 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.720
 available in major centers 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.960
 and in more developed countries than Brazil 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.460
 it is the microscopy 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.870
 it is an investment that we have brought here to our day-to-day in 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.090
 our clinic 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.970
 with the purpose of improving the quality of care we offer to 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.950
 our patients 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.550
 this quality is offered by the fact that with a microscope 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.940
 the dental professional manages to fill the expensive procedure that is 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.510
 doing with a magnification and up to 24 times more than exists within give 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.590
 captured people 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.580
 so the diagnosis is much more accurate 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.810
 since we have been able to see much greater completeness 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.110
 in the same way that the neurosurgeons with whom the 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.550
 ophthalmologists use in their surgical and clinical procedures 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.540
 besides a more reliable diagnosis 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.110
 effectiveness in service 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.280
 because it is an investidura effectiveness in the service 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.280
 small problems can be installed now 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.200
 the mikrotik instruments then 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.100
 tiny versions of cars are treated with ever smaller tipping 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.930
 less invasive, which makes the treatment lighter 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.760
 softer and softer pib too condom 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.840
 the person to the patient then that technology that offers a diagnosis and 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.950
 a more appropriate treatment 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.930
 also 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.280
 the fact that we are working 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.530
 with the microscopy system 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.780
 makes the old aged job's life clearer because we 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.490
 we were able to observe with fidelity the dating of the works being 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.149
 performed 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:18.529
 excesses 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:22.539
 he has a saving grace are removed little between precision 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.659
 and in the field of surgery then the advances are paulo steps 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.429
 because that way we can work 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:30.760
 suture wires 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.790
 lennon the surgical techniques quite conservative 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.459
 we call this the microscopic copy of the high logic action surgeries with 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.189
 great magnification of vision for both 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.099
 the actual surgeries 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.229
 as for dental implant surgeries 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:52.139
 From now on, we here in Punta Gorda have the technology of the 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.359
 use of optical microscopy to improve the quality of care of our patients. 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.359
 patients 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.459
 Why are we doing a demonstration? 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.979
 of the application of the microscope 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.879
 the professional wave even has a great advantage in this a good advantage 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.879
 especially for spectators who are 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:19.419
 who wishes to make an apology to students and dentistry 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.719
 than with microscopy technology 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.739
 we can work here in a much more 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.329
 comfortable 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.419
 so we do not have the posture problem here 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.709
 since the posture of the dental surgeon's work in a posture 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:34.919
 little 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.349
 complex in the physiotherapeutic aspect is often under 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.369
 spinal dysfunctions muscle and joint dysfunctions 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.739
 by the working position 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.929
 and in microscopy we have a field of 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:52.259
 of a more rectilinear vision, then we have been able to stay in a position well 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:54.039
 more ergonomic 

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:55.539
 so what we have 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:58.599
 several types of light sources we are going to change here 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.349
 a source of light here to show you that we can increase the 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.349
 using special filters 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:09.499
 for all these resources in the field 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.209
 are intended for the purpose 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.209
 to improve the quality of our service 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:20.090
 so see to yourselves that the goal here of microscopy will improve 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:25.099
 the quality of the river service that we are doing is a job that the 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.240
 people do here together with the team 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.539
 here is a feature that today is 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.449
 fully available here 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.520
 in the thick tip town with pm all our patients 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.300
 and also of the whole region here where we receive 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.150
 it's not people who are looking for us other cities also from other states 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.249
 and even some 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:47.249
 the country today was in the funds that our service system 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.889
 then it can be a resource 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.830
 in dental microscopy 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.219
 for service 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.650
 two patients also has a working philosophy 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.180
 the most technologically advanced possible
