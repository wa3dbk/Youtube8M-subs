00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
analog sticks which allow us to move

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.450 
analog sticks which allow us to move
really<00:00:39.960> smoothly<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.590> aim<00:00:40.980> accurately

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
gray tech which is our mechanism for

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.289 
gray tech which is our mechanism for
giving<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.040> player<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.460> flexibility<00:01:15.090> on

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
in various resistance games in this case

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.570 
in various resistance games in this case

change the shape and the nature of the
grey<00:01:33.990> tech<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.439> then<00:01:34.740> slot<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.220> directly<00:01:35.549> into

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
grey tech and then slot it directly into

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.120 
grey tech and then slot it directly into
one<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.030> his<00:01:36.180> weapons<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.860> here<00:01:38.009> we're<00:01:38.100> going

and<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.950> come<00:01:56.159> back<00:01:56.340> into<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> game<00:01:56.790> we<00:01:57.000> can

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
and we come back into the game we can

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.730 
and we come back into the game we can
see<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.509> chain<00:01:57.719> guns<00:01:57.930> been<00:01:58.079> powered<00:01:58.409> up<00:01:58.530> and

we have even more powerful shots and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.780 
we have even more powerful shots and
this<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.680> useful<00:02:01.860> for<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.250> next<00:02:02.490> room<00:02:02.640> which
