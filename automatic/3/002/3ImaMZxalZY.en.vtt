edit poly modifier with that new entry
in<00:03:37.960> place<00:03:38.260> we'll<00:03:38.800> open<00:03:39.010> up<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.370> modifier

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
in place we'll open up the modifier

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.050 
in place we'll open up the modifier
getting<00:03:40.420> down<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.930> edge<00:03:41.050> level<00:03:42.060> okay

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
getting down to the edge level okay

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.210 
getting down to the edge level okay

to<00:06:01.130> be<00:06:01.250> cut<00:06:01.430> out<00:06:01.780> to<00:06:02.780> do<00:06:02.960> that<00:06:03.170> I'll<00:06:03.470> make<00:06:03.770> a

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
to be cut out to do that I'll make a

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.490 
to be cut out to do that I'll make a
smaller<00:06:04.160> copy<00:06:04.520> of<00:06:04.820> the<00:06:04.940> object<00:06:05.330> created<00:06:05.660> then

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
smaller copy of the object created then

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.260 
smaller copy of the object created then
cut<00:06:06.800> that<00:06:06.980> out<00:06:07.040> using<00:06:07.700> the<00:06:07.940> boolean

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
cut that out using the boolean

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.560 
cut that out using the boolean
subtraction<00:06:08.990> command<00:06:09.670> let's<00:06:10.670> do<00:06:10.850> this<00:06:11.030> will

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
subtraction command let's do this will

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.440 
subtraction command let's do this will
activate<00:06:11.960> the<00:06:12.200> scale<00:06:12.440> command<00:06:12.850> then<00:06:13.850> verify

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
activate the scale command then verify

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.220 
activate the scale command then verify
that<00:06:14.840> the<00:06:14.960> %<00:06:15.320> snap<00:06:15.560> toggle<00:06:15.800> is<00:06:16.220> still<00:06:16.460> on

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:17.230 
that the % snap toggle is still on

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
in the gold triangle on the gizmo we can

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.940 
in the gold triangle on the gizmo we can
then<00:06:22.190> make<00:06:22.490> our<00:06:22.700> copy<00:06:23.200> now<00:06:24.200> you<00:06:24.500> might<00:06:24.710> be<00:06:24.740> able

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
then make our copy now you might be able

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.740 
then make our copy now you might be able
to<00:06:25.100> see<00:06:25.280> that<00:06:25.520> a<00:06:25.550> little<00:06:25.910> bit<00:06:26.000> easier<00:06:26.030> if<00:06:26.660> we

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
to see that a little bit easier if we

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.600 
to see that a little bit easier if we
change<00:06:27.200> from<00:06:27.380> shade<00:06:27.740> to<00:06:27.920> wireframe<00:06:28.400> mode

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
change from shade to wireframe mode

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.530 
change from shade to wireframe mode
let's<00:06:29.270> do<00:06:29.480> that<00:06:29.660> typing<00:06:30.140> f3<00:06:31.330> okay

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.540 
let's do that typing f3 okay

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.440 
let's do that typing f3 okay
let's<00:06:32.750> go<00:06:32.900> ahead<00:06:32.990> and<00:06:33.110> make<00:06:33.260> our<00:06:33.290> copy<00:06:34.450> working

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450 
let's go ahead and make our copy working

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.210 
let's go ahead and make our copy working
with<00:06:35.570> the<00:06:35.690> values<00:06:36.110> down<00:06:36.350> below<00:06:36.590> the<00:06:36.740> timeline

with the values down below the timeline

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.330 
with the values down below the timeline
will<00:06:37.730> again<00:06:38.060> make<00:06:38.450> our<00:06:38.630> copy<00:06:38.900> about<00:06:39.280> 70%<00:06:40.280> of

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
will again make our copy about 70% of

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.880 
will again make our copy about 70% of
the<00:06:40.430> size<00:06:40.610> of<00:06:40.880> the<00:06:40.970> original<00:06:41.770> when<00:06:42.770> our

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.890 
the size of the original when our

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.650 
the size of the original when our
numbers<00:06:43.220> are<00:06:43.370> in<00:06:43.460> place<00:06:43.700> and<00:06:44.150> the<00:06:44.270> dialogue

now we do want our copied object to be a

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.320 
now we do want our copied object to be a
bit<00:06:50.630> longer<00:06:50.930> up<00:06:51.290> and<00:06:51.560> down<00:06:51.790> or<00:06:52.790> that<00:06:53.000> will

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
bit longer up and down or that will

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.780 
bit longer up and down or that will
scale<00:06:53.600> it<00:06:53.780> one<00:06:53.990> more<00:06:54.170> time<00:06:54.410> locking<00:06:55.040> down<00:06:55.400> to

the y-direction on our gizmo once we've
done<00:06:59.300> that<00:06:59.360> we'll<00:06:59.900> change<00:07:00.260> its<00:07:00.410> wireframe

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:00.890 
done that we'll change its wireframe

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.800 
done that we'll change its wireframe
color<00:07:01.130> to<00:07:01.310> something<00:07:01.520> lighter<00:07:01.880> then<00:07:02.450> go<00:07:02.600> back
