00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
chuckle in the UAV and shit like that I

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.800 
chuckle in the UAV and shit like that I
might<00:02:44.460> have<00:02:44.610> another<00:02:44.790> class<00:02:45.090> too<00:02:45.360> depending

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
might have another class too depending

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.510 
might have another class too depending
on<00:02:45.930> how<00:02:46.140> small<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.560> Matthews<00:02:46.860> etc<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.430> I

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
on how small the Matthews etc and I

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.860 
on how small the Matthews etc and I
might<00:02:47.670> actually<00:02:47.820> put<00:02:48.120> on<00:02:48.210> flak<00:02:48.480> jacket

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
might actually put on flak jacket

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.210 
might actually put on flak jacket
because<00:02:48.990> there<00:02:49.200> could<00:02:49.680> be<00:02:49.740> a<00:02:49.860> lot<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.070> a

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
because there could be a lot of a

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
didn't know kill streaks actually do

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.370 
didn't know kill streaks actually do
help<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.300> look<00:03:18.450> like<00:03:18.660> if<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:18.930> get<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:19.200> first

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
help to look like if you get you first

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.810 
help to look like if you get you first
when<00:03:19.620> they<00:03:19.709> do<00:03:19.769> help<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.190> get<00:03:20.250> your<00:03:20.400> second<00:03:20.760> and

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
when they do help to get your second and

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.520 
when they do help to get your second and
third<00:03:20.880> etc<00:03:21.269> that's<00:03:21.810> why<00:03:22.050> I've<00:03:22.110> gone<00:03:22.260> looks

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
third etc that's why I've gone looks

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.160 
third etc that's why I've gone looks
like<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.709> low<00:03:22.980> middle<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:24.090> higher<00:03:24.330> one<00:03:24.600> so

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
like a low middle the higher one so

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.229 
like a low middle the higher one so
that's<00:03:25.320> my<00:03:25.530> theory<00:03:26.190> there<00:03:26.519> but<00:03:26.820> anyway<00:03:27.060> guys<00:03:27.180> I

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
that's my theory there but anyway guys I

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.670 
that's my theory there but anyway guys I
