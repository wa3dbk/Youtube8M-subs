the shortcuts you can go to the Edit tab
and<00:01:18.700> click<00:01:19.330> keyboard<00:01:19.870> shortcuts

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.450 

I<00:01:25.900> usually<00:01:26.900> start<00:01:27.440> by<00:01:27.500> referencing<00:01:28.280> the

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
I usually start by referencing the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.820 
I usually start by referencing the
colors<00:01:28.760> I<00:01:29.060> plan<00:01:29.660> to<00:01:29.690> use<00:01:29.900> on<00:01:30.350> a<00:01:30.770> separate<00:01:31.280> layer

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
colors I plan to use on a separate layer

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.790 
colors I plan to use on a separate layer
in<00:01:33.830> that<00:01:34.340> case<00:01:34.790> white<00:01:35.300> fuzzy<00:01:35.660> highlights<00:01:36.050> blue

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
in that case white fuzzy highlights blue

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.550 
in that case white fuzzy highlights blue
for<00:01:37.010> the<00:01:37.130> sky<00:01:37.340> turn<00:01:37.580> red<00:01:38.330> for<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.720> car<00:01:38.930> gray

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
for the sky turn red for the car gray

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.950 
for the sky turn red for the car gray
for<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:39.860> background<00:01:40.370> and<00:01:40.550> finally<00:01:41.360> black<00:01:41.630> for

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
for the background and finally black for

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.870 
for the background and finally black for
the<00:01:42.050> shadows<00:01:44.560> then<00:01:45.560> I<00:01:45.800> set<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.369> blending<00:01:46.670> mode

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
the shadows then I set the blending mode

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.530 
the shadows then I set the blending mode
of<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.240> sketch<00:01:47.479> layer<00:01:47.750> on<00:01:48.200> multiply<00:01:49.040> and

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
of the sketch layer on multiply and

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.300 
of the sketch layer on multiply and
create<00:01:50.540> another<00:01:50.900> layer<00:01:51.140> behind<00:01:51.530> for<00:01:52.010> the<00:01:52.130> gray

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
create another layer behind for the gray

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.030 
create another layer behind for the gray
background

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.600 

I<00:01:55.690> like<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:56.810> pixel<00:01:57.140> transparency<00:01:57.860> of<00:01:57.890> the

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
I like the pixel transparency of the

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.360 
I like the pixel transparency of the
background<00:01:59.000> layer<00:01:59.380> therefore<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:00.590> allows<00:02:00.950> me

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
background layer therefore it allows me

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.170 
background layer therefore it allows me
to<00:02:01.400> use<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:02.870> eraser<00:02:03.350> tool<00:02:04.010> as<00:02:04.220> if<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:04.640> were<00:02:04.880> a

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
to use the eraser tool as if it were a

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.500 
to use the eraser tool as if it were a
brush<00:02:08.020> for<00:02:09.020> example<00:02:09.410> in<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.770> case<00:02:10.070> my<00:02:11.000> eraser

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
brush for example in that case my eraser

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.920 
brush for example in that case my eraser
tool<00:02:11.990> is<00:02:12.320> a<00:02:12.860> soft<00:02:13.190> brush<00:02:13.460> that<00:02:14.120> will<00:02:14.480> paint<00:02:14.750> in

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
tool is a soft brush that will paint in

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.310 
tool is a soft brush that will paint in
red<00:02:15.100> whereas<00:02:16.100> my<00:02:16.340> actual<00:02:17.030> brush<00:02:17.360> is<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:17.930> sharp

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
red whereas my actual brush is a sharp

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.400 
red whereas my actual brush is a sharp
worm<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.800> will<00:02:19.010> paint<00:02:19.250> in<00:02:19.490> gray<00:02:20.080> now<00:02:21.080> it's

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
worm that will paint in gray now it's

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.510 
worm that will paint in gray now it's
easy<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:21.950> switch<00:02:22.670> from<00:02:22.970> great<00:02:23.570> red<00:02:24.110> by<00:02:25.040> using

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.870 

I<00:02:56.750> flip<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.710> picture<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:58.250> have<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.460> new<00:02:58.610> point

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
I flip the picture to have a new point

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.510 
I flip the picture to have a new point
of<00:02:59.000> view<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.450> then<00:03:00.200> I<00:03:00.470> start<00:03:00.830> refining<00:03:01.160> the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
of view and then I start refining the

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.220 
of view and then I start refining the
surfaces

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.760 

at<00:03:05.010> this<00:03:05.730> stage<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:06.720> good<00:03:07.050> enough<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.319> walk

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
at this stage it is good enough to walk

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.150 
at this stage it is good enough to walk
on<00:03:08.010> white<00:03:08.400> reflections<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:10.050> I<00:03:10.410> create<00:03:10.800> a<00:03:10.830> black

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
on white reflections so I create a black

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.610 
on white reflections so I create a black
layer<00:03:11.340> over<00:03:11.910> my<00:03:12.060> sketch<00:03:12.360> I<00:03:12.660> lock<00:03:13.500> the

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
layer over my sketch I lock the

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.400 
layer over my sketch I lock the
transparency<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:15.330> turn<00:03:15.750> it's<00:03:15.930> blending

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
transparency and I turn it's blending

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.530 
transparency and I turn it's blending
mode<00:03:16.680> on<00:03:17.010> screen<00:03:17.640> so<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.180> black<00:03:18.360> disappears<00:03:18.870> I

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
mode on screen so the black disappears I

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.540 
mode on screen so the black disappears I
use<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.780> eraser<00:03:22.050> tool<00:03:22.470> as<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.769> soft<00:03:23.310> white

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
use the eraser tool as a soft white

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.870 
use the eraser tool as a soft white
brush<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.709> apply<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.769> color<00:03:26.069> in<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.670> very

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
brush and apply the color in a very

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.400 
brush and apply the color in a very
rough<00:03:27.390> way<00:03:27.680> everywhere<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:28.860> want<00:03:29.190> reflection

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.620 

now<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.680> can<00:03:35.010> start<00:03:35.250> refining<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:36.000> white<00:03:36.240> areas

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
now I can start refining the white areas

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:47.610 
now I can start refining the white areas
with<00:03:37.320> a<00:03:37.350> black<00:03:37.770> shop<00:03:38.070> brush

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.360 

so<00:03:48.810> why<00:03:49.810> am<00:03:49.959> i<00:03:50.050> creating<00:03:50.500> a<00:03:50.620> lock<00:03:50.830> transparent

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
so why am i creating a lock transparent

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.220 
so why am i creating a lock transparent
black<00:03:51.580> layer<00:03:51.790> instead<00:03:52.209> of<00:03:52.480> just<00:03:52.959> walking

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
black layer instead of just walking

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.320 
black layer instead of just walking
straight<00:03:53.680> with<00:03:53.980> a<00:03:54.010> white<00:03:54.340> brush<00:03:54.670> on<00:03:54.910> a<00:03:54.970> blank

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
straight with a white brush on a blank

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.100 
straight with a white brush on a blank
layer<00:03:55.980> there<00:03:56.980> are<00:03:57.069> three<00:03:57.370> reasons<00:03:57.810> first<00:03:58.810> it

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
layer there are three reasons first it

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.110 
layer there are three reasons first it
is<00:03:59.349> faster<00:03:59.680> to<00:03:59.709> switch<00:04:00.160> from<00:04:00.400> surf<00:04:00.730> to<00:04:00.910> shop

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
is faster to switch from surf to shop

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.550 
brush in that way and the brush of the
eraser<00:04:03.849> can<00:04:04.180> play<00:04:04.390> both<00:04:04.629> roles<00:04:04.750> depending<00:04:05.230> on

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
eraser can play both roles depending on

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.390 
eraser can play both roles depending on
the<00:04:05.680> fact<00:04:05.980> you<00:04:06.400> walk<00:04:06.700> with<00:04:06.940> black<00:04:07.360> or<00:04:07.569> white

have to think in terms of capacity but

you

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.860 

okay<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:43.560> white<00:04:43.710> perfection<00:04:44.190> is<00:04:44.340> done<00:04:44.550> now<00:04:44.870> in

order to enhance contrast and realism I

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.840 
order to enhance contrast and realism I
create<00:04:49.200> a<00:04:49.230> new<00:04:49.380> layer<00:04:49.560> for<00:04:49.890> the<00:04:50.220> shading<00:04:50.640> and

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
create a new layer for the shading and

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.380 
create a new layer for the shading and
the<00:04:50.880> dark<00:04:51.210> parts<00:04:51.480> of<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.720> car<00:04:51.930> I<00:04:53.120> usually<00:04:54.120> put

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.530 

and<00:05:29.650> then<00:05:30.650> I<00:05:30.860> create<00:05:31.220> a<00:05:31.250> layer<00:05:31.520> in<00:05:31.910> multiply

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
and then I create a layer in multiply

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.170 
and then I create a layer in multiply
mud<00:05:32.810> and<00:05:33.080> I<00:05:33.620> paint<00:05:33.920> in<00:05:34.070> blue<00:05:34.280> all<00:05:34.550> the<00:05:34.790> surfaces

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
mud and I paint in blue all the surfaces

mud and I paint in blue all the surfaces
that<00:05:35.360> are<00:05:35.600> sky<00:05:35.990> oriented<00:05:37.090> and<00:05:39.460> I<00:05:40.460> finally

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
that are sky oriented and I finally

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.080 
that are sky oriented and I finally
modifies<00:05:41.630> blue<00:05:42.110> with<00:05:42.530> a<00:05:42.560> hue<00:05:42.950> saturation<00:05:43.190> tool

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
modifies blue with a hue saturation tool

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.720 
modifies blue with a hue saturation tool
a<00:05:44.590> shortcut<00:05:45.590> is<00:05:45.860> command<00:05:46.370> you<00:05:48.370> the<00:05:49.370> sky<00:05:49.550> tone
