00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.500
 eleventh race in the championship 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.480
 here pirelli brings the combination hard and 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.269
 average between the fastest tracks in 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.190
 calendar but it is very demanding for 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.870
 covers that have to cope with 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.390
 lateral energy loads e 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.130
 very high longitudinal 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.410
 think of the high compression of the ea 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.510
 rouge where the front tires 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.560
 withstand the highest vertical load 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.990
 of the season 1000 kg for this reason 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.690
 before taking to the track 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.790
 Pirelli tires are subjected to 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.399
 a thorough series of gold testing 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.059
 that verify the resistance and the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.040
 performance are three methodologies 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.410
 standard of texts that prove stress 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.899
 of roofs in extreme conditions 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.030
 high speed tire mines 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.410
 crushed and spun on a drum 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.050
 at very high speeds 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.360
 subsequently the loads are tested 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.879
 vertical on each cover comes 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.000
 unloaded a vertical force up to a 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.949
 maximum of 1000 kg finally occur 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.080
 kamber angles up to a maximum 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.659
 of 5 degrees 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.220
 to these standard tests that simulate the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.120
 tire behavior in 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.280
 straight 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.310
 a type of test is added 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.750
 special, which serves instead to reproduce 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.510
 cornering behavior 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.330
 in this case the rubber is made 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.620
 turn and apply high angles 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.600
 of drift 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.940
 then there is a second category of 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.190
 deep that serves to measure the 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.560
 tire performance these 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.750
 tests serve to compare different 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.910
 tire variants and to understand ad 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.770
 example which tire you keep in 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.560
 curve with which it provides the attraction 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.380
 higher to replicate as faithfully 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.380
 possible conditions that cover 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.470
 find the track before the test 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.790
 tires are kept on the electric blankets 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.010
 just like in the grand prizes 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.830
 the data that pirelli will derive these tests 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.930
 they are fundamental for the teams because 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.600
 allow you to have a forecast of 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.950
 tire behavior in all 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.950
 the conditions of use
