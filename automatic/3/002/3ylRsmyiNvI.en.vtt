00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.030

then the second offer was a really poor
second-half<00:02:29.960> performance<00:02:30.110> so<00:02:30.980> we<00:02:31.070> headed

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
second-half performance so we headed

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.680 
second-half performance so we headed
straight<00:02:31.430> into<00:02:31.460> extra<00:02:31.820> time<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.240> this<00:02:32.540> is<00:02:32.660> a

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690

it<00:04:00.560> against<00:04:01.040> all<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:01.670> shot<00:04:01.820> town<00:04:02.030> I<00:04:02.060> think<00:04:02.300> it

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
it against all the shot town I think it

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.180 
it against all the shot town I think it
is<00:04:02.480> 23rd<00:04:03.230> in<00:04:03.410> the<00:04:03.440> league<00:04:03.680> they<00:04:03.860> are<00:04:03.980> at<00:04:04.100> the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
is 23rd in the league they are at the

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.380 
is 23rd in the league they are at the
moment<00:04:04.310> so<00:04:04.670> it<00:04:04.790> is<00:04:04.850> a<00:04:04.880> really<00:04:05.209> good

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
moment so it is a really good

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.930 
moment so it is a really good
opportunity<00:04:05.630> for<00:04:05.990> us<00:04:06.290> to<00:04:06.470> kind<00:04:07.400> of<00:04:07.490> get<00:04:07.730> some

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
opportunity for us to kind of get some

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.940 
opportunity for us to kind of get some
goals<00:04:08.150> and<00:04:08.420> you<00:04:08.780> know<00:04:08.900> just<00:04:09.230> do<00:04:09.560> whatever<00:04:09.739> we

about<00:04:18.350> it<00:04:18.650> in<00:04:18.859> this<00:04:19.190> game<00:04:19.430> one<00:04:20.150> thing<00:04:20.330> you<00:04:20.450> do

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
about it in this game one thing you do

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.490 
about it in this game one thing you do
have<00:04:20.720> to<00:04:20.840> remember<00:04:21.020> those<00:04:21.229> when<00:04:21.410> you're

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
have to remember those when you're

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.110 
have to remember those when you're
playing<00:04:21.680> against<00:04:21.919> those<00:04:22.040> lower<00:04:22.400> sides<00:04:22.729> or<00:04:23.000> the

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
playing against those lower sides or the

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.460 
playing against those lower sides or the
weaker<00:04:23.390> sides<00:04:23.600> in<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:23.810> league<00:04:23.990> they<00:04:24.169> tend<00:04:24.410> to

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
weaker sides in the league they tend to

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.440 
weaker sides in the league they tend to
go<00:04:24.590> defensive<00:04:25.130> so<00:04:25.460> I<00:04:25.490> thought<00:04:25.910> initially<00:04:26.120> it

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
go defensive so I thought initially it

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.650 
go defensive so I thought initially it
would

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
would

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.780 
would
quite<00:04:26.900> difficult<00:04:27.110> to<00:04:27.350> break<00:04:27.560> them<00:04:27.740> down<00:04:27.790> you

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
quite difficult to break them down you

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.220 
quite difficult to break them down you
can<00:04:28.940> see<00:04:29.090> currently<00:04:29.390> we're<00:04:29.720> sitting<00:04:29.960> in<00:04:30.050> about

past<00:04:48.320> the<00:04:48.440> goalkeeper<00:04:48.620> finally<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.640> make<00:04:49.790> it

one nil and to end his goal drought it's

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.860 
one nil and to end his goal drought it's
been<00:04:52.670> too<00:04:52.880> long<00:04:52.910> since<00:04:53.090> he<00:04:53.360> scored<00:04:53.600> a<00:04:53.690> league

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.420 
been too long since he scored a league
goal<00:04:54.110> I<00:04:54.290> think<00:04:54.440> it's<00:04:54.800> even<00:04:55.010> been<00:04:55.220> a<00:04:55.250> while

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
goal I think it's even been a while

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.010 
goal I think it's even been a while
since<00:04:55.550> he's<00:04:55.760> called<00:04:55.940> last<00:04:56.150> Cup<00:04:56.390> goal<00:04:56.600> but<00:04:56.960> a

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
since he's called last Cup goal but a

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.170 
since he's called last Cup goal but a
fantastic<00:04:57.710> finish<00:04:57.890> they're<00:04:58.280> really<00:04:58.670> emphatic

double<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.550> lead<00:05:16.730> there<00:05:17.000> so<00:05:17.390> we<00:05:17.480> did<00:05:17.630> go<00:05:17.780> into

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
double the lead there so we did go into

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.960 
double the lead there so we did go into
them<00:05:18.230> half<00:05:18.500> time<00:05:18.710> with<00:05:18.740> the<00:05:18.890> score<00:05:18.950> at<00:05:19.160> one<00:05:19.730> nil
