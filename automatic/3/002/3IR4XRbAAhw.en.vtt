00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
for I'll move on to the articulation did

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.850 
for I'll move on to the articulation did
show<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:12.240> yeah<00:01:12.420> okay<00:01:12.810> his<00:01:13.049> cranium<00:01:13.530> shell

show but yeah okay his cranium shell
here<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.310> thing<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:15.119> moves<00:01:15.509> up<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:16.590> that

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
here this thing it moves up like that

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.580 
here this thing it moves up like that
but<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.159> not<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:18.150> knew<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.630> unified<00:01:19.170> one<00:01:19.380> is

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
but it's not a you knew a unified one is

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.020 
but it's not a you knew a unified one is
it's<00:01:19.950> like<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.340> close<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.759> have

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
it's like you can close this and have

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.810 
it's like you can close this and have
this<00:01:21.180> open<00:01:22.040> something<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:23.580> yeah

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
this open something like that so yeah

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.670 
this open something like that so yeah
you<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.150> close<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.840> that's<00:01:25.170> one<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
you can close this and that's one of the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.950 
you can close this and that's one of the
articulations<00:01:26.310> its<00:01:26.729> arms<00:01:27.150> can<00:01:27.420> rotate<00:01:27.450> 360

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
articulations its arms can rotate 360

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.999 
articulations its arms can rotate 360
but<00:01:28.560> his<00:01:28.920> shell<00:01:29.250> he<00:01:29.430> blocks<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.110> so<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.710> can

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
but his shell he blocks it so but it can

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.590 
but his shell he blocks it so but it can
because<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.579> go<00:01:32.850> all<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> way<00:01:33.119> back<00:01:33.360> here

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
because it can go all the way back here

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.740 
because it can go all the way back here
as<00:01:33.810> well<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.920> yeah<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.180> possible

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
as well so yeah and so it is possible

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.219 
as well so yeah and so it is possible
and<00:01:37.100> his<00:01:38.100> feet<00:01:38.610> don't<00:01:39.090> articulate<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.960> snort

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and his feet don't articulate the snort

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.990 
and his feet don't articulate the snort
equation<00:01:40.710> here<00:01:40.890> but<00:01:41.100> they're<00:01:41.520> done<00:01:41.970> in

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
equation here but they're done in

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.749 
equation here but they're done in
rubbery<00:01:42.570> plastic<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.710> they<00:01:43.829> don't<00:01:44.130> break<00:01:44.430> any

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
rubbery plastic so they don't break any

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.460 
rubbery plastic so they don't break any
ships<00:01:45.750> go<00:01:46.409> around<00:01:46.619> 360<00:01:47.250> degrees<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:48.470> that's

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
ships go around 360 degrees so that's

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.780 
ships go around 360 degrees so that's
pretty<00:01:49.740> much<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.979> for<00:01:50.250> brainstorms

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
whether should I not take this guy and

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.220 
whether should I not take this guy and
take<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.799> defender<00:03:35.579> version<00:03:36.000> 18<00:03:36.359> X<00:03:36.630> but<00:03:36.959> then

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
take the defender version 18 X but then

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.009

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
I got over and I just took this guy

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.720

repulsion<00:03:42.150> in<00:03:42.299> X<00:03:42.630> didn't<00:03:43.230> have<00:03:43.410> all<00:03:43.620> these

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
repulsion in X didn't have all these

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
it looks like in the picture so that

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.000 
it looks like in the picture so that
kind<00:03:51.269> of<00:03:51.329> sucks<00:03:51.630> for<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.049> Omni<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.799> next

kind of sucks for the Omni the next

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.710 
kind of sucks for the Omni the next
defender<00:03:53.340> version<00:03:53.669> but<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.180> in<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.480> next

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
defender version but the in the next

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.210 
defender version but the in the next
defender<00:03:55.109> version<00:03:55.380> does<00:03:55.620> have<00:03:55.889> the<00:03:56.040> white

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
defender version does have the white

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.580 
defender version does have the white
outlined<00:03:56.730> here<00:03:57.000> on<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.870> hand<00:03:58.079> but<00:03:58.319> this

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
outlined here on the hand but this

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.170 
outlined here on the hand but this
doesn't<00:03:58.859> so<00:03:59.160> there's<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.459> plus<00:03:59.669> point<00:03:59.849> for<00:03:59.970> that

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
doesn't so there's a plus point for that

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.930 
doesn't so there's a plus point for that
but<00:04:00.720> in<00:04:00.870> last<00:04:01.109> points<00:04:01.739> because<00:04:02.519> it<00:04:02.669> doesn't

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
but in last points because it doesn't

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.909 
but in last points because it doesn't
have<00:04:03.060> stars<00:04:03.419> so<00:04:03.720> it's<00:04:03.900> not<00:04:04.079> very<00:04:04.319> few<00:04:04.530> accurate

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
have stars so it's not very few accurate

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:08.420 
have stars so it's not very few accurate
but<00:04:05.459> this<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.599> has<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.230> stars<00:04:07.530> which<00:04:07.829> makes<00:04:08.190> it

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
but this it has the stars which makes it

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.460 
but this it has the stars which makes it
make<00:04:09.000> this<00:04:09.180> figure<00:04:09.450> look<00:04:09.690> really<00:04:10.079> good<00:04:10.290> and

tubular does that come with a long faith

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.540 
tubular does that come with a long faith
in<00:05:52.540> X<00:05:52.690> but<00:05:53.350> overall<00:05:53.680> it's<00:05:53.919> a<00:05:53.980> good<00:05:54.160> figure<00:05:54.400> and

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
in X but overall it's a good figure and

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.470 
in X but overall it's a good figure and
I<00:05:54.850> recommend<00:05:55.330> you<00:05:55.390> get<00:05:55.570> it<00:05:55.630> so<00:05:56.490> it<00:05:57.490> breaks<00:05:58.240> down

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480 
I recommend you get it so it breaks down

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.100 
I recommend you get it so it breaks down
8.5<00:05:59.169> and<00:05:59.200> 18<00:05:59.830> x<00:06:00.010> ma<00:06:00.270> so<00:06:01.270> pick<00:06:01.600> them<00:06:01.720> up<00:06:01.840> if<00:06:02.020> you

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
8.5 and 18 x ma so pick them up if you

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.010 
8.5 and 18 x ma so pick them up if you
find<00:06:02.380> them<00:06:02.590> since<00:06:03.340> Ben<00:06:04.120> 10<00:06:04.300> alien<00:06:04.480> forces

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
find them since Ben 10 alien forces
