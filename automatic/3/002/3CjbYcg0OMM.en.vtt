it's always well know we have to hold
onto<00:04:11.120> these<00:04:11.510> assets<00:04:12.140> but<00:04:12.860> if<00:04:13.430> it's<00:04:14.150> not<00:04:14.390> money

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720

a<00:04:16.370> gold<00:04:16.580> standard<00:04:16.669> I<00:04:17.270> mean<00:04:17.959> I<00:04:18.400> would<00:04:19.400> think

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
a gold standard I mean I would think

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.849 
a gold standard I mean I would think
that<00:04:19.789> they<00:04:20.090> shouldn't<00:04:20.359> be<00:04:20.479> holding<00:04:20.630> it<00:04:20.960> the

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
that they shouldn't be holding it the

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:22.800 
that they shouldn't be holding it the
reason<00:04:22.190> I<00:04:22.280> asked

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
reason I asked

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.220 
reason I asked
is<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:24.070> truth<00:04:24.370> is<00:04:24.639> is<00:04:24.970> goal<00:04:25.180> his<00:04:25.450> money<00:04:25.870> and

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
is the truth is is goal his money and

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.409 
is the truth is is goal his money and
people<00:04:26.440> don't<00:04:26.860> throw<00:04:27.280> it<00:04:27.400> away<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:27.910> people<00:04:28.270> do

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
people don't throw it away and people do

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:29.580 
people don't throw it away and people do
cling<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:29.169> it

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
cling to it

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.580 
cling to it
and<00:04:29.919> but<00:04:30.520> I<00:04:30.550> would<00:04:30.970> be<00:04:31.240> really<00:04:32.139> there's<00:04:32.350> a<00:04:32.410> lot

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
and but I would be really there's a lot

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.440 
and but I would be really there's a lot
of<00:04:32.680> people<00:04:32.919> who<00:04:33.040> suspect<00:04:33.610> because<00:04:33.850> of<00:04:34.330> this

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
of people who suspect because of this

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.870 
of people who suspect because of this
lack<00:04:34.840> of<00:04:35.020> transparency<00:04:35.500> that<00:04:36.430> there's<00:04:36.639> been<00:04:36.850> a

at the economic statistics now they're

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.219 
at the economic statistics now they're
horrible<00:05:22.810> and<00:05:23.880> in<00:05:24.880> these<00:05:25.630> people<00:05:25.960> who<00:05:26.020> lost

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
horrible and in these people who lost

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:28.740 
horrible and in these people who lost
their<00:05:26.530> jobs<00:05:26.820> they're<00:05:27.820> still<00:05:28.150> unemployed<00:05:28.390> the

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
their jobs they're still unemployed the

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.719 
their jobs they're still unemployed the
people<00:05:28.990> who<00:05:29.140> bought<00:05:29.440> stocks<00:05:29.919> in<00:05:30.430> the<00:05:30.520> year

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
people who bought stocks in the year

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.930 
people who bought stocks in the year
2000<00:05:31.560> if<00:05:32.560> they<00:05:32.710> held<00:05:32.950> on<00:05:33.160> they<00:05:33.729> probably

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
2000 if they held on they probably

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.029 
2000 if they held on they probably
haven't<00:05:34.150> even<00:05:34.660> broken<00:05:34.960> even<00:05:35.500> they<00:05:35.710> probably

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
haven't even broken even they probably

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:39.600 
haven't even broken even they probably
lost<00:05:36.250> purchasing<00:05:36.880> power<00:05:37.120> so<00:05:38.080> eventually<00:05:39.070> I

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
lost purchasing power so eventually I

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.090 
lost purchasing power so eventually I
think<00:05:40.240> I<00:05:40.390> know<00:05:40.450> this<00:05:40.690> is<00:05:40.870> off<00:05:41.110> the<00:05:41.289> subject<00:05:41.320> a

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
think I know this is off the subject a
