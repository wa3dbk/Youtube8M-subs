you've seen how incredibly powerful this
tool<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.800> for<00:00:11.010> learning<00:00:11.190> anatomy<00:00:11.790> but<00:00:12.420> now<00:00:12.630> let

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
tool is for learning anatomy but now let

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.140 
tool is for learning anatomy but now let
me<00:00:13.410> show<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.679> how<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.190> can<00:00:14.340> use<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:14.700> app<00:00:14.940> to

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.290 
me show you how you can use this app to
make<00:00:15.299> some<00:00:15.540> amazing<00:00:16.410> imagery<00:00:17.180> so<00:00:18.180> I've

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
make some amazing imagery so I've

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.519 
make some amazing imagery so I've
started<00:00:18.539> with<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.750> scene<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.199> I've<00:00:19.289> brought

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
started with the scene that I've brought

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.340 
started with the scene that I've brought
in<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.890> thorax<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.000> head<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.810> digestive

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
in the thorax the head the digestive

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.650 
in the thorax the head the digestive
system<00:00:22.380> just<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.980> couple<00:00:23.220> pieces<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:24.480> show

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
system just a couple pieces to just show

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.179 
system just a couple pieces to just show
you<00:00:24.720> some<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:24.990> these<00:00:25.109> tools<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.590> by<00:00:25.740> default

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
you some of these tools and by default

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.160 
you some of these tools and by default
everything<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.849> brought<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.630> with<00:00:27.930> what<00:00:28.080> we

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
everything is brought in with what we

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.040 
everything is brought in with what we
call<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> solid<00:00:28.859> shader<00:00:29.099> which<00:00:29.880> makes<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.990> all

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
call the solid shader which makes it all

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.770 
call the solid shader which makes it all
look<00:00:31.199> realistic<00:00:32.099> down<00:00:32.880> at<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.210> bottom<00:00:33.540> you've

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
look realistic down at the bottom you've

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.680 
look realistic down at the bottom you've
got<00:00:33.809> your<00:00:34.200> other<00:00:34.440> rendering<00:00:35.070> tools<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.510> right

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
got your other rendering tools so right

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.750 
got your other rendering tools so right
now<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.200> know<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.530> if<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.710> click<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:37.980> one

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
now you know that if you click on one

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.200 
now you know that if you click on one
object<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.540> can<00:00:39.660> always<00:00:39.780> delete<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.210> go

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
object you can always delete it and go

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.610 
object you can always delete it and go
deeper<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.600> deeper<00:00:42.870> into<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.200> anatomy<00:00:43.590> that

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
deeper and deeper into the anatomy that

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.209 
deeper and deeper into the anatomy that
way<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:44.969> also<00:00:45.149> click<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:46.219> objects

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
way but you can also click on objects

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.910 
way but you can also click on objects
and<00:00:47.399> make<00:00:47.550> them<00:00:47.760> clear<00:00:48.379> so<00:00:49.379> now<00:00:49.530> they're<00:00:49.739> kind

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
and make them clear so now they're kind

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.130 
and make them clear so now they're kind
of<00:00:50.070> showing<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:50.760> you're<00:00:51.360> able<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:51.809> deeper

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
of showing but you're able to see deeper

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.180 
of showing but you're able to see deeper
into<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> anatomy<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.520> that's<00:00:53.699> how<00:00:54.360> clear<00:00:54.809> is

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
into the anatomy so that's how clear is

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.970 
into the anatomy so that's how clear is
used<00:00:56.190> if<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.969> could<00:00:57.180> select<00:00:57.329> all<00:00:57.660> go<00:00:58.649> back<00:00:58.829> to

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
used if I could select all go back to

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.939 
used if I could select all go back to
solid<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.520> get<00:01:00.149> back<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.449> my<00:01:00.539> default<00:01:00.600> solid<00:01:01.350> now

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
solid I get back to my default solid now

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.299 
solid I get back to my default solid now
if<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.250> select<00:01:02.609> all<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.809> click<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.170> x-ray<00:01:05.100> I

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
if I select all and I click on x-ray I

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.670 
if I select all and I click on x-ray I
get<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.090> really<00:01:06.689> interesting<00:01:07.049> rendering

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
get this really interesting rendering

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.469 
get this really interesting rendering
style<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.610> now<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:08.970> see<00:01:09.180> how<00:01:09.330> you're

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
style so now you can see how you're

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.289 
style so now you can see how you're
starting<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.900> see<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.490> you<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.640> see<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> heart

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
starting to see in you can see the heart

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.060 
starting to see in you can see the heart
you<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.080> see<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> brain<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
you can see the brain and the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.060 
you can see the brain and the
circulatory<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:14.939> see<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.270> neck<00:01:15.950> just<00:01:16.950> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
circulatory you can see the neck just a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.810 
circulatory you can see the neck just a
really<00:01:17.549> cool<00:01:17.790> way<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.479> render<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:18.960> models

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
really cool way to render your models

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.710 
really cool way to render your models
now<00:01:20.820> let<00:01:20.939> me<00:01:21.030> show<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.330> difference

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
now let me show you the difference

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.810 
now let me show you the difference
between<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:22.380> white<00:01:22.979> background<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.640> black

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
between a white background and a black

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.270 
between a white background and a black
background<00:01:24.560> extremely<00:01:25.560> different<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.070> now<00:01:26.220> we

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
background extremely different so now we

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.219 
background extremely different so now we
have<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.729> same<00:01:26.939> exact<00:01:27.299> rendering<00:01:27.720> effect<00:01:28.020> but

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
have the same exact rendering effect but

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.730 
have the same exact rendering effect but
with<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.680> white<00:01:29.520> background<00:01:30.439> I'm<00:01:31.439> going<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.650> go

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
with a white background I'm going to go

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.789 
with a white background I'm going to go
back<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.130> black<00:01:34.970> now<00:01:35.970> that's<00:01:36.210> if<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.479> do

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
back to black now that's if you do

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.710 
back to black now that's if you do
everything<00:01:37.799> rendered<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.880> certain<00:01:39.150> style<00:01:39.360> but

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
everything rendered a certain style but

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.359 
everything rendered a certain style but
where<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.259> becomes<00:01:40.680> really<00:01:40.860> fun<00:01:41.220> and

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
where this becomes really fun and

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.499 
where this becomes really fun and
interesting<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.850> when<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.090> select<00:01:42.420> just

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
interesting is when you select just

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.020 
interesting is when you select just
certain<00:01:42.810> pieces<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:44.280> make<00:01:44.579> them<00:01:44.820> different

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
certain pieces and make them different

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.819 
certain pieces and make them different
rendering<00:01:45.450> styles<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:45.869> let<00:01:45.990> me<00:01:46.110> let<00:01:46.530> me<00:01:46.560> show

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
rendering styles so let me let me show

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.200 
rendering styles so let me let me show
you<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.130> I'm<00:01:47.460> going<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.640> start<00:01:47.880> with<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> clean

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
you that I'm going to start with a clean

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.660 
you that I'm going to start with a clean
slate<00:01:48.329> here<00:01:49.460> do<00:01:50.460> all<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.240> remove<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.520> my

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
slate here do all and remove and in my

Anatomy icon I'm going to bring in a
couple<00:01:56.670> different<00:01:56.909> systems<00:01:57.619> first<00:01:58.619> I'll

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
couple different systems first I'll

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.560 
couple different systems first I'll
bring<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.100> skeletal<00:01:59.549> system<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.060> you'll

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
bring in the skeletal system and you'll

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.300 
bring in the skeletal system and you'll
see<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.020> by<00:02:01.140> default<00:02:01.200> when<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.799> bring<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.189> an

tools and change the muscles to look

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.200 
tools and change the muscles to look
clear<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.460> now<00:02:44.550> since<00:02:44.760> they<00:02:44.910> were<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.120> only

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
clear so now since they were the only

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.350 
clear so now since they were the only
things<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:46.020> only<00:02:46.230> model<00:02:47.010> selected<00:02:47.490> they

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
things the only model selected they

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.620 
things the only model selected they
become<00:02:48.660> clear<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:48.990> everything<00:02:49.290> else<00:02:49.440> remains

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
become clear and everything else remains

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.530 
become clear and everything else remains
solid<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:52.050> click<00:02:52.650> on<00:02:52.770> x-ray<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.210> get<00:02:54.360> some

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
solid I click on x-ray and I get some

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.440 
solid I click on x-ray and I get some
really<00:02:54.810> interesting<00:02:54.960> looks<00:02:56.060> by<00:02:57.060> leaving<00:02:57.420> some

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
really interesting looks by leaving some

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.430 
really interesting looks by leaving some
piece<00:02:57.840> of<00:02:57.960> solid<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.590> other<00:02:59.370> pieces<00:03:00.350> with<00:03:01.350> the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
piece of solid and other pieces with the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.010 
piece of solid and other pieces with the
x-ray<00:03:01.830> shader<00:03:02.330> so<00:03:03.330> that's<00:03:03.600> just<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.840> fun

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
x-ray shader so that's just a fun

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.330 
x-ray shader so that's just a fun
looking<00:03:05.240> image<00:03:06.410> now<00:03:07.410> when<00:03:07.860> I'm<00:03:07.980> ready<00:03:08.160> to

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
though up at the top right we went over

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.570 
though up at the top right we went over
some<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.450> these<00:03:24.540> in<00:03:24.720> another<00:03:24.959> video<00:03:25.260> but<00:03:25.580> one

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
some of these in another video but one

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.550 
some of these in another video but one
of<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.760> options<00:03:27.300> here<00:03:27.360> is<00:03:27.690> high<00:03:27.900> resolution

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
of the options here is high resolution

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.320 
of the options here is high resolution
when<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.160> click<00:03:29.340> on<00:03:29.489> that<00:03:29.520> I'm<00:03:29.910> not<00:03:30.060> sure<00:03:30.209> how

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
when you click on that I'm not sure how

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.400 
when you click on that I'm not sure how
well<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:30.570> can<00:03:30.660> see<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:30.870> in<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.110> video<00:03:31.380> but

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
well you can see it in the video but

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.020 
well you can see it in the video but
everything<00:03:32.010> becomes<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.400> little<00:03:32.640> bit<00:03:32.760> sharper

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
everything becomes a little bit sharper

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.660 
everything becomes a little bit sharper
and<00:03:33.420> cleaner<00:03:34.170> now<00:03:34.890> you<00:03:34.920> lose<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.220> little<00:03:35.400> bit<00:03:35.520> of

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
and cleaner now you lose a little bit of

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.790 
and cleaner now you lose a little bit of
performance<00:03:36.440> depending<00:03:37.440> on<00:03:37.560> what<00:03:37.680> device

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
performance depending on what device

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.620 
performance depending on what device
you're<00:03:38.100> on<00:03:38.160> so<00:03:38.760> usually<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.060> keep<00:03:39.270> that<00:03:39.450> off

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
you're on so usually I keep that off

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.850 
you're on so usually I keep that off
until<00:03:39.959> I'm<00:03:40.050> ready<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.290> actually<00:03:40.470> take<00:03:40.830> some

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
until I'm ready to actually take some

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.160 
until I'm ready to actually take some
pictures<00:03:41.340> but<00:03:41.489> once<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:41.820> are<00:03:41.850> ready<00:03:42.209> turn

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
pictures but once you are ready turn

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.979 
pictures but once you are ready turn
that<00:03:43.290> on<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.940> take<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:44.970> beautiful<00:03:45.300> snapshot<00:03:45.959> of

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
that on and take a beautiful snapshot of

any one of these everything about my
scene<00:04:02.550> is<00:04:02.700> swapped<00:04:02.970> for<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.989> models<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.350> I

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
scene is swapped for the models that I

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.250 
scene is swapped for the models that I
had<00:04:04.530> selected<00:04:04.920> when<00:04:05.910> I<00:04:05.940> saved<00:04:06.330> it<00:04:06.510> including

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
had selected when I saved it including

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.530 
had selected when I saved it including
how<00:04:07.530> they<00:04:07.739> were<00:04:07.800> rendered<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.150> can<00:04:09.330> easily

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
how they were rendered so I can easily

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.759 
how they were rendered so I can easily
go<00:04:09.810> back<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.310> previous<00:04:11.760> scene<00:04:12.530> or<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.560> could

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
go back to a previous scene or I could

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.590 
go back to a previous scene or I could
save<00:04:14.070> new<00:04:14.280> scenes<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:14.790> this<00:04:15.060> is<00:04:15.209> just<00:04:15.360> an<00:04:15.450> easy

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
scenes that you want to use later so

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.620 
scenes that you want to use later so
show<00:04:22.289> people<00:04:22.500> later<00:04:22.940> so<00:04:23.940> those<00:04:24.210> are<00:04:24.419> some<00:04:24.539> of

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.810 
the really powerful rendering tools that
you<00:04:26.250> find

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
you find

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.320 
you find
