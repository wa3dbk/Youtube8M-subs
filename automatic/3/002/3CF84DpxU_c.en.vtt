the last time these gates will be

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.600 
the last time these gates will be
standing<00:01:34.869> and<00:01:35.020> ringing<00:01:35.350> after<00:01:36.130> this<00:01:36.280> I'll<00:01:36.490> be

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
standing and ringing after this I'll be

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.160 
standing and ringing after this I'll be
back<00:01:36.790> when<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.060> crossing<00:01:37.450> is<00:01:37.570> no<00:01:37.690> longer<00:01:37.930> here

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
back when the crossing is no longer here

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.010 
back when the crossing is no longer here
to<00:01:38.290> film<00:01:38.530> after<00:01:38.920> it's<00:01:39.070> gone<00:01:39.159> like<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.810> said<00:01:40.990> I

comes<00:01:49.899> two<00:01:50.110> Silver<00:01:50.500> Star<00:01:50.770> let's<00:01:51.369> watch<00:01:51.640> this

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
comes two Silver Star let's watch this

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.940 
comes two Silver Star let's watch this
is<00:01:52.539> the<00:01:52.630> crossing<00:01:52.869> that<00:01:53.170> has<00:01:53.289> the<00:01:53.470> hinge<00:01:53.590> gate

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
is the crossing that has the hinge gate

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.310 
is the crossing that has the hinge gate
on<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.220> top<00:01:54.429> of<00:01:54.610> stabilizer<00:01:55.119> bar<00:01:55.450> which<00:01:56.170> I

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
on the top of stabilizer bar which I

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.389 
on the top of stabilizer bar which I
could<00:01:56.470> have<00:01:56.649> this<00:01:56.830> when<00:01:57.009> they<00:01:57.100> take<00:01:57.280> the

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
could have this when they take the

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.460 
could have this when they take the
crossing<00:01:57.820> down<00:01:57.970> but<00:01:58.149> I<00:01:58.210> doubt<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.659> here<00:01:59.380> he

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
crossing down but I doubt it here he

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:28.830 
crossing down but I doubt it here he

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.089 

we're<00:02:58.550> back<00:02:59.530> gates<00:03:00.530> are<00:03:00.739> gone

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
we're back gates are gone

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.610 
we're back gates are gone
