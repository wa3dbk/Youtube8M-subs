awesome<00:01:32.189> right<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.640> I'm<00:01:32.759> not<00:01:32.790> really<00:01:33.030> sure<00:01:33.150> if

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
awesome right and I'm not really sure if

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.450 
awesome right and I'm not really sure if
you<00:01:33.509> guys<00:01:33.659> know<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.049> or<00:01:34.229> not<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:34.409> now<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.250> you

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
you guys know this or not but now if you

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.609 
you guys know this or not but now if you
block<00:01:35.759> it's<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.240> different<00:01:36.390> animation<00:01:37.290> from

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
block it's a different animation from

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.440 
block it's a different animation from
what<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.979> used<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.820> that's<00:01:39.000> pretty<00:01:39.210> cool

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
what it used to be so that's pretty cool

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.760 
what it used to be so that's pretty cool
right<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.810> looks<00:01:40.020> pretty<00:01:40.200> cool<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.409> think<00:01:40.710> it

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
right it looks pretty cool I think it

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.260 
right it looks pretty cool I think it
looks<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:41.070> lot<00:01:41.280> better<00:01:41.490> than<00:01:41.970> what<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.180> was

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
looks a lot better than what it was

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.120 
looks a lot better than what it was
before<00:01:42.630> because<00:01:43.170> before<00:01:43.200> when<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.770> blocked

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
before because before when you blocked

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.190 
before because before when you blocked
it<00:01:44.280> covered<00:01:44.610> your<00:01:44.700> whole<00:01:44.759> body<00:01:45.180> but<00:01:45.689> now<00:01:45.869> it

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
it covered your whole body but now it

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.870 
it covered your whole body but now it
only<00:01:46.409> goes<00:01:46.740> off<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> side<00:01:47.430> which<00:01:47.700> i<00:01:47.820> think

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
only goes off to the side which i think

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.789 
only goes off to the side which i think
is<00:01:48.090> pretty<00:01:48.270> damn<00:01:48.540> awesome<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.200> last<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:49.619> not

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
is pretty damn awesome and last but not

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.870 
is pretty damn awesome and last but not
least<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.130> don't<00:01:50.250> know<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.490> know<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.640> or

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
least I don't know if you know this or

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.090 
least I don't know if you know this or
not<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.689> put<00:01:51.899> maps<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.530> item<00:01:52.829> frames

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
not but if you put maps and item frames

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.010 
not but if you put maps and item frames
now<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.549> actually<00:01:53.850> takes<00:01:54.270> up<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.570> full<00:01:54.750> block

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
now it actually takes up a full block

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.810 
now it actually takes up a full block
pretty<00:01:55.320> awesome<00:01:55.680> right<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.009> what<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.549> means

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
pretty awesome right and what that means

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.280 
pretty awesome right and what that means
is<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.000> if<00:01:57.390> you're<00:01:57.689> on<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.810> next<00:01:58.140> gen

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
is that if you're on the next gen

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.050 
is that if you're on the next gen

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.880 
version of Minecraft where you have huge
worlds<00:02:00.570> what<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.930> can<00:02:01.079> do<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.290> put<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> bunch<00:02:01.770> of

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
time you go explore something or

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.869 
time you go explore something or
somewhere<00:02:07.590> else<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:08.099> will<00:02:08.250> actually<00:02:08.489> show<00:02:08.849> up

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
somewhere else it will actually show up

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.609 
somewhere else it will actually show up
on<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.179> map<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.750> actually<00:02:09.989> looks<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:10.560> a

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
on the map and it actually looks like a

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.710 
on the map and it actually looks like a
full-on<00:02:11.069> map<00:02:11.310> pretty<00:02:11.640> awesome<00:02:12.120> right<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.540> this

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
full-on map pretty awesome right so this

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.520 
full-on map pretty awesome right so this
feature<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.080> really

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
feature is really

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.350 
feature is really
for<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.980> next<00:02:14.100> gen<00:02:14.370> however<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.120> previous

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
for the next gen however in the previous

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.420 
for the next gen however in the previous
gen<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.810> really<00:02:16.170> not<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.470> useful<00:02:16.650> because<00:02:16.980> we

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
gen is really not that useful because we

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.160 
gen is really not that useful because we
don't<00:02:17.640> have<00:02:17.700> really<00:02:18.060> big<00:02:18.209> worlds<00:02:18.600> but<00:02:18.870> apart

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
don't have really big worlds but apart

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.300 
don't have really big worlds but apart
from<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.319> I<00:02:19.590> think<00:02:19.620> it's<00:02:19.890> still<00:02:20.040> pretty

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
from that I think it's still pretty

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.100 
from that I think it's still pretty
awesome<00:02:20.819> and<00:02:21.030> another<00:02:21.270> thing<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.600> noticed<00:02:21.959> was

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
awesome and another thing I noticed was

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.809 
awesome and another thing I noticed was
playing<00:02:22.470> today<00:02:22.709> is<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.220> think<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.550> mobs

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
playing today is that I think the mobs

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.790 
playing today is that I think the mobs
got<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.120> little<00:02:24.390> bit<00:02:24.600> more<00:02:24.900> smarter<00:02:25.080> I<00:02:25.590> don't

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
got a little bit more smarter I don't

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.260 
got a little bit more smarter I don't
know<00:02:25.890> maybe<00:02:26.040> I'm<00:02:26.190> crazy<00:02:26.400> or<00:02:26.700> something<00:02:27.030> but

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270
