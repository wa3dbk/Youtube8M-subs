00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260 
connected to USB and you download this

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.320 
connected to USB and you download this
program<00:00:26.500> the<00:00:27.040> link<00:00:27.250> of<00:00:27.369> being<00:00:27.550> a<00:00:27.640> subpar<00:00:28.060> it's

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
program the link of being a subpar it's

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.500 
program the link of being a subpar it's
called<00:00:28.630> diskaid<00:00:29.170> it's<00:00:30.040> on<00:00:30.220> a<00:00:30.250> 14-day<00:00:31.000> trial

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
called diskaid it's on a 14-day trial

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.270 
called diskaid it's on a 14-day trial
but<00:00:32.020> this<00:00:32.680> I<00:00:32.980> got<00:00:33.970> 13<00:00:34.270> days<00:00:34.420> left<00:00:34.629> but<00:00:35.280> whatever

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
but this I got 13 days left but whatever

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.590 
but this I got 13 days left but whatever
squared<00:00:36.760> okay<00:00:37.239> um<00:00:38.699> so<00:00:39.699> if<00:00:39.760> you<00:00:39.820> know<00:00:39.910> the<00:00:40.059> ssh

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
squared okay um so if you know the ssh

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.900 
squared okay um so if you know the ssh
you<00:00:40.840> read<00:00:41.019> the<00:00:41.140> exact<00:00:41.500> same<00:00:41.739> files<00:00:42.100> or<00:00:42.580> where

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
you read the exact same files or where

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.570 
you read the exact same files or where
it's<00:00:43.030> located<00:00:43.120> for<00:00:43.629> example<00:00:44.050> if<00:00:44.140> you<00:00:44.230> want<00:00:44.379> to

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
it's located for example if you want to

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.280 
it's located for example if you want to
find<00:00:45.580> your<00:00:45.640> applications<00:00:46.269> and<00:00:46.449> stuff<00:00:46.540> your
