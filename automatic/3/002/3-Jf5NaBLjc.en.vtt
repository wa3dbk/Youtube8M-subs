00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
we test a lot of cars and they usually

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.090 
we test a lot of cars and they usually
are<00:00:52.690> two<00:00:52.839> places<00:00:52.959> for<00:00:53.199> infotainment<00:00:53.589> in<00:00:53.889> cars

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
are two places for infotainment in cars

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.099 
are two places for infotainment in cars
it<00:00:54.459> generally<00:00:54.879> is<00:00:54.999> not<00:00:55.030> very<00:00:55.510> good<00:00:55.929> because

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
it generally is not very good because

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:57.569 
it generally is not very good because
like<00:00:56.319> these<00:00:56.379> car<00:00:56.619> manufacturers<00:00:57.010> they<00:00:57.459> know

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
like these car manufacturers they know

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.099 
like these car manufacturers they know
how<00:00:57.639> to<00:00:57.670> make<00:00:57.819> engines<00:00:58.179> and<00:00:58.329> suspensions<00:00:58.839> and

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
how to make engines and suspensions and

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:00.539 
how to make engines and suspensions and
and<00:00:59.289> drive<00:00:59.679> trains<00:00:59.949> but<00:01:00.129> they<00:01:00.219> aren't<00:01:00.429> very

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
and drive trains but they aren't very

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:02.279 
and drive trains but they aren't very
good<00:01:00.819> at<00:01:00.940> making<00:01:01.029> that<00:01:01.299> infotainment<00:01:01.839> system

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
and the cell phone makers they do know

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:05.039 
and the cell phone makers they do know
that<00:01:04.600> stuff

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
that stuff

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:06.929 
that stuff
well<00:01:05.259> we<00:01:05.500> test<00:01:05.710> a<00:01:05.770> lot<00:01:05.799> of<00:01:05.920> cell<00:01:06.130> phones<00:01:06.369> and<00:01:06.729> I

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
well we test a lot of cell phones and I

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.459 
well we test a lot of cell phones and I
can<00:01:07.090> tell<00:01:07.270> you<00:01:07.329> that<00:01:07.479> Apple<00:01:07.840> is<00:01:07.990> definitely

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:08.469 
can tell you that Apple is definitely

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.010 
can tell you that Apple is definitely
one<00:01:08.740> of<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:09.310> best<00:01:09.549> user<00:01:09.880> interface<00:01:10.450> companies

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
one of the best user interface companies

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.050 
one of the best user interface companies
but<00:01:11.229> it's<00:01:11.590> an<00:01:11.740> interesting<00:01:11.920> question<00:01:12.700> as<00:01:13.000> to

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
but it's an interesting question as to

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.490 
but it's an interesting question as to
whether<00:01:13.329> or<00:01:13.390> not<00:01:13.479> they<00:01:13.689> can<00:01:13.750> port<00:01:14.049> that<00:01:14.229> to<00:01:14.469> a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
whether or not they can port that to a

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.740 
whether or not they can port that to a
car<00:01:14.799> driving<00:01:15.280> at<00:01:15.640> 60<00:01:16.060> miles<00:01:16.179> an<00:01:16.329> hour

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
car driving at 60 miles an hour

car driving at 60 miles an hour
what<00:01:17.079> about<00:01:17.170> driver<00:01:17.469> distraction<00:01:17.710> is<00:01:18.159> this

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
what about driver distraction is this

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.399 
what about driver distraction is this
gonna<00:01:18.369> make<00:01:18.520> us<00:01:18.700> more<00:01:19.060> or<00:01:19.450> less<00:01:19.810> distracted

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
gonna make us more or less distracted

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:21.569 
gonna make us more or less distracted
than<00:01:20.530> we<00:01:20.619> already<00:01:20.829> are<00:01:21.039> behind<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:21.490> wheel

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
than we already are behind the wheel

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:22.910 
than we already are behind the wheel
well<00:01:22.030> we're<00:01:22.149> only<00:01:22.240> going<00:01:22.359> to<00:01:22.420> see<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.719> final

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
well we're only going to see the final

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.200 
well we're only going to see the final
implementation<00:01:23.920> but<00:01:24.429> it<00:01:24.640> has<00:01:24.729> a<00:01:24.820> potential<00:01:25.090> of

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
implementation but it has a potential of

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.910 
implementation but it has a potential of
making<00:01:25.359> this<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.659> little<00:01:25.869> bit<00:01:26.079> less<00:01:26.320> distracted

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
making this a little bit less distracted

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.410 
making this a little bit less distracted
I'll<00:01:27.009> tell<00:01:27.189> you<00:01:27.280> why<00:01:27.399> a<00:01:27.549> lot<00:01:27.700> of<00:01:27.729> people<00:01:28.000> now<00:01:28.119> to

I'll tell you why a lot of people now to

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.580 
I'll tell you why a lot of people now to
get<00:01:28.539> the<00:01:28.630> functionality<00:01:28.990> they<00:01:29.229> need<00:01:29.380> they're

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
get the functionality they need they're

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.660 
get the functionality they need they're
looking<00:01:29.770> at<00:01:29.829> traffic<00:01:30.100> whatever<00:01:30.249> they're

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
looking at traffic whatever they're

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.279 
looking at traffic whatever they're
using<00:01:31.030> your<00:01:31.119> smart<00:01:31.450> phones<00:01:31.630> while<00:01:31.840> they<00:01:31.960> drive

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
using your smart phones while they drive

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.349 
using your smart phones while they drive
you<00:01:32.829> don't<00:01:32.950> do<00:01:33.159> this<00:01:33.429> but<00:01:33.969> this<00:01:34.149> has<00:01:34.210> the

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
you don't do this but this has the

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:35.789 
you don't do this but this has the
potential<00:01:34.659> of<00:01:34.840> getting<00:01:34.929> that<00:01:35.140> functionality

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
potential of getting that functionality

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.080 
potential of getting that functionality
and<00:01:35.890> having<00:01:36.159> it<00:01:36.249> on<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.369> big<00:01:36.520> screen<00:01:36.549> your<00:01:36.880> car

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
and having it on the big screen your car

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.330 
and having it on the big screen your car
using<00:01:37.780> voice<00:01:37.929> controls<00:01:38.320> talking<00:01:38.799> to<00:01:38.859> Siri<00:01:39.039> and

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
using voice controls talking to Siri and

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.160 
using voice controls talking to Siri and
making<00:01:39.820> that<00:01:39.909> all<00:01:40.060> work<00:01:40.270> together<00:01:40.539> so<00:01:41.049> what

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
making that all work together so what

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.239 
making that all work together so what
does<00:01:41.259> it<00:01:41.350> mean<00:01:41.439> if<00:01:41.560> you're<00:01:41.649> an<00:01:41.740> Android<00:01:42.100> user

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:42.249 
does it mean if you're an Android user

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:45.599 
does it mean if you're an Android user
well<00:01:43.090> it's<00:01:44.049> a<00:01:44.140> little<00:01:44.259> hazy<00:01:44.469> actually<00:01:45.100> we

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609 
well it's a little hazy actually we

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:46.770 
well it's a little hazy actually we
presume<00:01:45.939> that<00:01:46.090> you'll<00:01:46.179> still<00:01:46.359> be<00:01:46.450> able<00:01:46.600> to<00:01:46.659> use

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
presume that you'll still be able to use

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.480 
presume that you'll still be able to use
things<00:01:47.020> like<00:01:47.079> Bluetooth<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:48.009> you<00:01:48.280> know<00:01:48.369> do

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
things like Bluetooth and you know do

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.550 
things like Bluetooth and you know do
hands-free<00:01:48.789> calling<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.299> stuff<00:01:49.479> but<00:01:49.869> you're

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
hands-free calling and stuff but you're

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.660 
hands-free calling and stuff but you're
not<00:01:50.649> gonna<00:01:50.770> get<00:01:50.950> a<00:01:50.979> lot<00:01:51.130> of<00:01:51.219> a<00:01:51.280> high<00:01:51.429> level

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
not gonna get a lot of a high level

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.419 
not gonna get a lot of a high level
functionality<00:01:52.390> that<00:01:52.689> Apple<00:01:53.560> iOS<00:01:53.740> users<00:01:54.340> are

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
functionality that Apple iOS users are

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.429 
functionality that Apple iOS users are
gonna<00:01:54.490> get<00:01:54.789> through<00:01:54.969> this<00:01:55.149> device<00:01:55.749> so<00:01:56.020> in<00:01:56.289> the

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
gonna get through this device so in the

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:57.899 
gonna get through this device so in the
end<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:56.679> may<00:01:56.799> end<00:01:56.950> up<00:01:57.069> having<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.399> pick<00:01:57.639> your
