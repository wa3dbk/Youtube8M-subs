00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.420 
when you first sign into a gamertag for
me<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:24.900> connects<00:02:25.230> me<00:02:25.380> some<00:02:25.710> I<00:02:25.890> think<00:02:26.160> it's

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
me this connects me some I think it's

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.180 
me this connects me some I think it's
just<00:02:26.550> because<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.880> my<00:02:27.060> internet<00:02:27.420> speeds<00:02:28.190> but

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
just because of my internet speeds but

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.540 
just because of my internet speeds but
yeah<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.960> just<00:02:31.440> wanted<00:02:31.710> to<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.400> know<00:02:32.430> let

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
yeah so I just wanted to you know let

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.000 
yeah so I just wanted to you know let
you<00:02:32.820> guys<00:02:33.000> know<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.810> files<00:02:34.110> are<00:02:34.380> really<00:02:34.830> good

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
you guys know the files are really good

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.400 
you guys know the files are really good
really<00:02:35.520> epic<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.330> know<00:02:36.450> I've<00:02:36.660> lost<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.200> long

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
really epic you know I've lost it a long

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.860 
really epic you know I've lost it a long
time<00:02:37.440> on<00:02:38.160> these<00:02:38.640> files<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.300> know<00:02:39.390> as<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.690> just

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
time on these files you know as you just

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.770 
time on these files you know as you just
saw<00:02:40.050> they<00:02:40.230> disconnected<00:02:41.010> me<00:02:41.570> but<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.660> does

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
saw they disconnected me but it does

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.000 
saw they disconnected me but it does
that<00:02:42.960> all<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.080> time<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.530> think<00:02:43.740> that's<00:02:43.890> just

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
that all the time I think that's just

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.400 
that all the time I think that's just
related<00:02:44.460> to<00:02:44.490> dashboard<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:45.390> think<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.080> might

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
related to dashboard I think that might

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.320 
related to dashboard I think that might
be<00:02:46.790> some<00:02:47.790> sort<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:49.070> spoofing<00:02:50.070> thing<00:02:50.580> these

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
be some sort of spoofing thing these

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330 
be some sort of spoofing thing these
offline<00:02:51.810> files<00:02:52.170> have<00:02:52.290> really<00:02:52.740> good<00:02:52.860> spoofing

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
offline files have really good spoofing

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.110 
offline files have really good spoofing
it<00:02:53.550> has<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:54.930> ton<00:02:55.320> of<00:02:55.350> GTA<00:02:55.860> needs<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.310> spoof<00:02:56.580> like
