00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.870 
so for making a tennis shoe you're going
to<00:00:25.470> have<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.769> use<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.099> right<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.609> left

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
to have to use the right on the left

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.050 
to have to use the right on the left
I've<00:00:27.150> tried<00:00:27.449> using<00:00:27.750> one<00:00:28.320> size<00:00:29.310> for<00:00:29.670> both<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.519 
I've tried using one size for both the
right<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.570> left<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.140> just<00:00:31.349> doesn't

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
right and the left and it just doesn't

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
right in the left shoe okay so I got my

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.610 
right in the left shoe okay so I got my
foot<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.450> basically<00:00:39.899> what<00:00:40.140> I'm<00:00:40.230> going<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.469> do

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.080 
foot so basically what I'm going to do
is<00:00:40.739> I'm<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:40.920> going<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:42.590> draw<00:00:43.640> around<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
is I'm just going to draw around the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.160 
is I'm just going to draw around the
foot<00:00:46.910> into<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:49.039> shape<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> tennis<00:00:50.670> shoe

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.170 
foot into a shape of the tennis shoe
okay<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.559> don't<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.160> be<00:00:53.280> perfect<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.030> you

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
okay I don't have to be perfect and you

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.590 
okay I don't have to be perfect and you
know<00:00:54.329> why<00:00:54.510> because<00:00:55.460> if<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.640> use<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.000> same<00:00:57.270> base

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
know why because if I use the same base

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.040 
know why because if I use the same base
on<00:00:57.989> both<00:00:58.609> shoes<00:00:59.609> it<00:01:00.120> doesn't<00:01:00.510> matter<00:01:00.690> what<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
on both shoes it doesn't matter what the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.920 
on both shoes it doesn't matter what the
shape<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.609> might<00:01:02.940> bend<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.690> out<00:01:03.899> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
shape is so I might bend that out a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.560 
shape is so I might bend that out a
little<00:01:04.229> bit<00:01:04.729> so<00:01:05.729> now<00:01:05.760> I'm<00:01:05.939> just<00:01:06.090> going<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.330> cut

that
I<00:04:19.070> am<00:04:19.790> created<00:04:20.360> a<00:04:20.450> piece<00:04:20.690> of<00:04:20.900> plastic<00:04:21.590> that<00:04:21.799> I

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
I am created a piece of plastic that I

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.630 
I am created a piece of plastic that I
can<00:04:22.340> insert<00:04:22.790> inside<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:24.650> tongue<00:04:24.890> once<00:04:25.280> I<00:04:25.430> turn

can insert inside the tongue once I turn

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.390 
can insert inside the tongue once I turn
it<00:04:25.760> inside<00:04:26.150> out<00:04:26.180> so<00:04:26.600> I<00:04:26.660> get<00:04:26.900> that<00:04:27.080> nice

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
it inside out so I get that nice

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.620 
it inside out so I get that nice
finished<00:04:28.400> edge<00:04:29.260> to<00:04:30.880> the<00:04:31.880> tennis<00:04:32.210> shoe<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:32.540> it

finished edge to the tennis shoe and it

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.050 
finished edge to the tennis shoe and it
holds<00:04:32.930> itself<00:04:33.230> up<00:04:33.530> on<00:04:33.830> its<00:04:34.040> own<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:34.880> only

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
holds itself up on its own the only

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.880 
holds itself up on its own the only
thing<00:04:35.270> I'm<00:04:35.420> concerned<00:04:35.630> with<00:04:35.990> really<00:04:36.530> on<00:04:36.680> this

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
thing I'm concerned with really on this

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.860 
thing I'm concerned with really on this
is<00:04:37.160> that<00:04:37.460> if<00:04:37.730> my<00:04:37.760> granddaughter<00:04:38.360> takes<00:04:38.690> the

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
is that if my granddaughter takes the

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.960 
is that if my granddaughter takes the
shoes<00:04:39.170> on<00:04:39.380> and<00:04:39.590> off<00:04:39.710> over<00:04:39.740> and<00:04:40.250> over<00:04:40.490> again

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.240 

this<00:04:43.970> might<00:04:44.210> get<00:04:44.540> bent<00:04:44.930> and<00:04:45.230> then<00:04:45.410> once<00:04:46.100> it

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
this might get bent and then once it

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.950 
this might get bent and then once it
gets<00:04:46.370> bent<00:04:46.700> I<00:04:46.880> don't<00:04:47.090> know<00:04:47.240> what<00:04:47.660> it's<00:04:47.780> going

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
gets bent I don't know what it's going

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.800 
gets bent I don't know what it's going
to<00:04:48.050> look<00:04:48.290> like<00:04:48.350> so<00:04:49.060> what<00:04:50.060> I<00:04:50.090> did<00:04:50.330> is<00:04:50.480> I<00:04:50.600> bought

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
to look like so what I did is I bought

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.320 
to look like so what I did is I bought
some<00:04:51.790> Pelin<00:04:53.470> pellon<00:04:54.970> interfacing<00:04:55.970> and<00:04:56.180> this

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
some Pelin pellon interfacing and this

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.220 
some Pelin pellon interfacing and this
is<00:04:57.640> the<00:04:58.640> thick<00:04:58.940> stuff<00:04:59.240> that<00:04:59.480> they<00:04:59.630> use<00:04:59.870> in<00:05:00.110> a

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
is the thick stuff that they use in a

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.020 
is the thick stuff that they use in a
post<00:05:00.470> in<00:05:01.690> draperies<00:05:02.690> so<00:05:03.620> I'm<00:05:03.770> going<00:05:04.010> to<00:05:04.190> try

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
post in draperies so I'm going to try

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.140 
post in draperies so I'm going to try
this<00:05:05.170> and<00:05:06.170> see<00:05:07.010> if<00:05:07.130> this<00:05:07.310> works<00:05:07.580> so<00:05:07.850> this<00:05:08.000> is

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
this and see if this works so this is

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.920 
this and see if this works so this is
Pelin<00:05:08.600> this<00:05:09.140> is<00:05:09.350> the<00:05:09.560> victor<00:05:10.340> korban<00:05:10.940> and<00:05:11.420> it's

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
Pelin this is the victor korban and it's

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.690 
Pelin this is the victor korban and it's
got<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:12.230> iron-on<00:05:12.620> backing<00:05:13.160> with<00:05:13.310> extra

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
got the iron-on backing with extra

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.410 
got the iron-on backing with extra
Crispus<00:05:14.210> so<00:05:15.020> this<00:05:15.230> might<00:05:15.500> work<00:05:15.940> just<00:05:16.940> as<00:05:17.390> well

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
Crispus so this might work just as well

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.420 
Crispus so this might work just as well
as<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:17.870> plastic<00:05:18.080> if<00:05:18.530> not<00:05:18.740> better<00:05:18.920> so<00:05:19.340> I'm

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
as the plastic if not better so I'm

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.370 
as the plastic if not better so I'm
going<00:05:19.550> to<00:05:19.610> try<00:05:19.850> it<00:05:19.910> because<00:05:20.750> this<00:05:21.050> is<00:05:21.110> what

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
going to try it because this is what

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.830 
going to try it because this is what
they<00:05:21.530> use<00:05:21.770> for<00:05:21.800> a<00:05:22.130> fabric<00:05:22.460> flower<00:05:22.940> soft<00:05:23.510> books

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
they use for a fabric flower soft books

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.540 
they use for a fabric flower soft books
calendars<00:05:24.380> toys<00:05:25.360> luggage<00:05:26.360> purses<00:05:27.370> so<00:05:28.370> this

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
calendars toys luggage purses so this

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.670 
calendars toys luggage purses so this
might<00:05:28.790> be<00:05:28.820> exactly<00:05:29.780> what<00:05:29.990> I'm<00:05:30.110> looking<00:05:30.440> for

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
might be exactly what I'm looking for

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.680 
might be exactly what I'm looking for
but<00:05:31.460> we're<00:05:31.700> going<00:05:31.790> to<00:05:31.850> try<00:05:32.060> it<00:05:32.120> on<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.480> next

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
but we're going to try it on the next

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.150 
but we're going to try it on the next
I'm<00:05:33.020> gonna<00:05:33.170> try<00:05:33.380> it<00:05:33.440> on<00:05:33.530> the<00:05:33.680> next<00:05:33.860> set<00:05:34.070> of

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
I'm gonna try it on the next set of

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.660 
I'm gonna try it on the next set of
shoes<00:05:34.400> I<00:05:34.580> do<00:05:34.640> and<00:05:35.000> see<00:05:35.240> how<00:05:35.450> how<00:05:36.230> it<00:05:36.410> works

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
shoes I do and see how how it works

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.080 
shoes I do and see how how it works
because<00:05:37.670> it's<00:05:37.940> the<00:05:38.030> same<00:05:38.270> sort<00:05:39.080> of<00:05:39.200> like<00:05:39.410> that

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
because it's the same sort of like that

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.090 
because it's the same sort of like that
wonder<00:05:41.090> under<00:05:41.300> sort<00:05:41.930> of<00:05:42.080> but<00:05:42.290> only<00:05:42.650> thick

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
wonder under sort of but only thick

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.680 
wonder under sort of but only thick
so<00:05:45.100> we'll<00:05:45.280> try<00:05:45.520> that<00:05:45.550> and<00:05:45.970> see<00:05:46.030> what<00:05:46.300> happens

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
so we'll try that and see what happens

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.810 
so we'll try that and see what happens
with<00:05:46.870> that<00:05:47.050> okay<00:05:48.040> so<00:05:48.070> now<00:05:48.340> we've<00:05:48.520> got<00:05:48.700> the

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
with that okay so now we've got the

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.490 
with that okay so now we've got the
basis<00:05:49.330> and<00:05:50.970> we're<00:05:51.970> ready<00:05:52.150> to<00:05:52.450> figure<00:05:53.020> out<00:05:53.290> how

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
basis and we're ready to figure out how

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.400 
basis and we're ready to figure out how
we're<00:05:53.740> going<00:05:53.860> to<00:05:54.160> do<00:05:54.370> the<00:05:56.130> tennis<00:05:57.130> shoe<00:05:57.340> tops
