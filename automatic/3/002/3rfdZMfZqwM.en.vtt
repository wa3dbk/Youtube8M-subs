00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:13.110
 the galley connected in the channel brazil clash 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.410
 beauty people 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.800
 I'm bringing a video today that was 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.350
 a request from me and my 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.869
 mateus as you can see on the screen and 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.580
 he ended up asking for a topic that I 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.699
 I found very interesting that I think 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.099
 Most of you are not supposed to know me. 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.750
 I did not know do not even know about 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.270
 how was the head of a sum 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.230
 research and brought it to you see how 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.440
 that the trophy count is made for the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.840
 Parsnip then guys thank you and mateus 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.570
 anyone who has questions has an interest in 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.030
 videos comment below always tolerated 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.140
 always taking your ideas because 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.829
 you guys doing or channeling beauty though 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.100
 explain to you how it works is 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.390
 The count of clebÃ£o the count is 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.909
 made very simply is not 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.090
 exactly that percentage any 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.340
 The easier number we can get 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.650
 an idea but if you do the math 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.110
 with these numbers the tour will give 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.280
 always a value higher than the value 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.930
 that you have 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.020
 But you can have more or less 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.689
 idea of how it works 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.180
 so how can you see on the screen and I 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.909
 I put it for you, it works 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.579
 number 1 to the number 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.729
 10 from your clan 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.689
 You're the clown get 50 percent of the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.590
 trophies then you have 2 thousand trophies 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:51.659
 then are ten people with 2000 trophies 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.509
 50% and there is a part of the 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:59.969
 for the clan trophy and then in the 10 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:03.299
 then it is 50% from 11 to 20 is 25% of 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:09.149
 number 21 galley trophies until the 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:12.810
 number 30 12% from number 31 to 40 10% 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.129
 and finally from number 41 to number 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.280
 50 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.200
 it's only three 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.770
 hence the trophies they buy for 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.240
 plan score 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.030
 So you can see it's one thing. 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.370
 very simple, as I told you if you 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.819
 make this table this population there 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.730
 in your club will give a little bigger 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.620
 I do not know but the logic of the mind 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.319
 more will give a always a number one 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.670
 little bigger trophy compared to what 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.260
 you have 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.450
 But you can still take it anyway. 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.440
 a base I think you can already 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.810
 understand how it works in s 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.390
 this counting scheme that I think 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.220
 A lot of people did not even know I wanted to. 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.560
 thank the matheus again because I 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.980
 I did not even do how it worked 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.260
 this count and then it just me 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.980
 playing I told you it's a time theme 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.050
 cool topic that nobody knows 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.580
 so I decided to bring the channel still and I 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.280
 I hope you liked the 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.630
 video super fast just to say it there 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.080
 For folks because there's not much 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.209
 information to give in relation to this but 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.040
 I hope you have already liked it. 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.160
 Do you know if you have already liked that? 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.950
