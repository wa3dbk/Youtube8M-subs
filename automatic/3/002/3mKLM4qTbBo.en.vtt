 now 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.320
 significant part of our fellow citizens 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.090
 in conditions of such a shortage of money 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.400
 what do you have with these products if available 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.400

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.749
 essential categories 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.909
 understand and even if someone thinks 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.889
 what is present will be 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.100

 man, but only very short-sighted 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.670
 because sooner or later 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.119
 when mothers understand 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:32.199

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.699
 and we will see another country as they say 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:40.560
 earlier 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.170
 what's going to happen back to the plan 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.500

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:50.769

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:51.709
 wherein 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:52.579
 freedom 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.749

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.409
 I understand that the clock is ticking 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:08.370
 no time 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.450
 too little left
