00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
to embarrass myself these are the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.760 
to embarrass myself these are the
controls<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.079> push<00:00:34.260> forward<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.649> go<00:00:34.739> forward

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
controls you push forward to go forward

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.209 
controls you push forward to go forward
back<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.640> go<00:00:35.760> back<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.440> you<00:00:37.440> push<00:00:37.649> off<00:00:37.860> and

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
back to go back and you push off and

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.799 
back to go back and you push off and
then<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.030> simply<00:00:39.890> fall<00:00:40.890> on<00:00:41.010> your<00:00:41.129> face<00:00:41.750> no<00:00:42.750> you

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
then you simply fall on your face no you

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.410 
then you simply fall on your face no you
push<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.260> thing<00:00:43.920> forward<00:00:47.120> I'll<00:00:48.120> do<00:00:48.300> that

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
push the thing forward I'll do that

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.229 
push the thing forward I'll do that
again<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.350> much<00:00:49.530> more<00:00:49.739> cool<00:00:49.980> way<00:00:50.190> right<00:00:50.940> yeah

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
again in a much more cool way right yeah

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.819 
again in a much more cool way right yeah
you<00:00:51.420> push<00:00:51.600> off<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.050> now<00:00:52.350> suddenly<00:00:52.590> you're

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
you push off and now suddenly you're

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.290 
you push off and now suddenly you're
moving<00:00:53.129> along<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.489> actually<00:00:53.730> quite<00:00:53.940> easy<00:00:53.969> to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
moving along it's actually quite easy to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.250 
moving along it's actually quite easy to
ride<00:00:54.570> despite<00:00:55.320> my<00:00:55.469> ham<00:00:56.010> fisted<00:00:56.250> attempts<00:00:57.260> it

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
ride despite my ham fisted attempts it

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.799 
ride despite my ham fisted attempts it
has<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> range<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.190> about<00:00:59.399> 18<00:00:59.850> miles<00:01:00.090> which<00:01:00.660> is

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
has a range of about 18 miles which is

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.110 
has a range of about 18 miles which is
pretty<00:01:00.989> cool<00:01:01.289> because<00:01:01.530> most<00:01:01.770> people<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.969> get

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
pretty cool because most people can get

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.640 
pretty cool because most people can get
to<00:01:03.270> work<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.660> back<00:01:03.899> without<00:01:04.080> having<00:01:04.379> to

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
to work and back without having to

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.500 
to work and back without having to
recharge<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.250> if<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.850> do<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.210> recharge

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
recharge it if you do have to recharge

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.359 
recharge it if you do have to recharge
it<00:01:06.630> reach<00:01:06.900> attack<00:01:07.200> recharge<00:01:07.590> time<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.010> about

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
it reach attack recharge time is about

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.609 
it reach attack recharge time is about
three<00:01:09.270> hours<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.840> it's<00:01:09.960> not<00:01:10.049> too<00:01:10.229> bad<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.500> can

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
three hours so it's not too bad you can

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.570 
three hours so it's not too bad you can
get<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.860> work

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
get to work

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.490 
get to work
plug<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.299> by<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.900> end<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> day

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
plug it in and by the end of the day

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.830 
plug it in and by the end of the day
you'll<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:13.920> good<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.189> go<00:01:14.310> once<00:01:14.640> again<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:15.450> terms

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
you'll be good to go once again in terms

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.859 
you'll be good to go once again in terms
of<00:01:15.960> speed<00:01:16.200> well<00:01:16.710> they<00:01:16.799> tell<00:01:17.009> me<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.220> will<00:01:17.280> reach

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
of speed well they tell me it will reach

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.270 
of speed well they tell me it will reach
13<00:01:18.869> miles<00:01:19.170> an<00:01:19.320> hour

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
13 miles an hour

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.399 
13 miles an hour
so<00:01:20.759> let<00:01:20.880> me<00:01:20.909> see<00:01:21.119> if<00:01:21.210> that's<00:01:21.360> true<00:01:21.689> I'm<00:01:22.290> gonna

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
so let me see if that's true I'm gonna

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.709 
so let me see if that's true I'm gonna
push<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.799> forward<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.220> hard<00:01:23.369> as<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.549> can

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.969 

yeah<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:26.770> I<00:01:26.859> built<00:01:27.070> up<00:01:27.189> a<00:01:27.490> good<00:01:27.729> speed<00:01:28.979> I

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
yeah and I built up a good speed I

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.109 
yeah and I built up a good speed I
should<00:01:30.280> probably<00:01:30.429> stay<00:01:30.670> closer<00:01:30.909> to<00:01:31.030> the

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
should probably stay closer to the

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.480 
should probably stay closer to the
cameraman<00:01:31.859> the<00:01:32.859> good<00:01:33.009> thing<00:01:33.130> about<00:01:33.189> it<00:01:33.340> it's

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
cameraman the good thing about it it's

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.800 
cameraman the good thing about it it's
also<00:01:33.609> got<00:01:33.819> a<00:01:33.850> break<00:01:34.179> you<00:01:34.299> can<00:01:34.390> actually<00:01:34.659> pull

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
also got a break you can actually pull

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.539 
also got a break you can actually pull
back<00:01:35.020> on<00:01:35.170> this<00:01:35.289> thing<00:01:35.530> and<00:01:35.740> it<00:01:36.130> will<00:01:36.250> slow<00:01:36.490> you

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
back on this thing and it will slow you

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.029 
back on this thing and it will slow you
down<00:01:36.840> now<00:01:37.840> I'm<00:01:37.960> riding<00:01:38.140> in<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:38.439> parking<00:01:39.009> lot

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039
