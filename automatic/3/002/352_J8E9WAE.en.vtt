00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
picture we see some medical pills I

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.420 
picture we see some medical pills I
don't<00:00:41.489> know<00:00:41.550> for<00:00:41.790> what<00:00:42.050> then<00:00:43.129> here<00:00:44.129> we<00:00:44.219> got<00:00:44.309> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
don't know for what then here we got the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.340 
don't know for what then here we got the
final<00:00:44.820> once<00:00:45.000> one<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.390> those<00:00:45.480> hospital<00:00:46.079> things

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
final once one of those hospital things

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.590 
final once one of those hospital things
you<00:00:46.530> know<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.860> bag<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:48.000> house<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.539> don't

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
you know the bag the house like I don't

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.290 
you know the bag the house like I don't
know<00:00:48.750> water<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.289> keeping<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.800> alive<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.820> my

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
know water just keeping you alive and my

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.810 
know water just keeping you alive and my
theory<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.870> if<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.260> see<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:53.039> think<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
theory is if you see I think it's the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.080 
theory is if you see I think it's the
bad<00:00:54.000> ending<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:56.010> bad<00:00:56.190> ending<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.760> where

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
bad ending the bad ending is where

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.540 
bad ending the bad ending is where
you're<00:00:57.840> with<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.350> group<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.739> kids<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.340> then

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
you're with this group of kids and then

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.729 
you're with this group of kids and then
they<00:01:00.239> came<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> foxy<00:01:01.079> mess<00:01:01.289> picks<00:01:01.590> you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
they came with the foxy mess picks you

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.920 
they came with the foxy mess picks you
up<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.660> basically<00:01:03.660> fredbear<00:01:04.470> jumps<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.159> and

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
up and basically fredbear jumps in and

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.010 
up and basically fredbear jumps in and
from<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> stage<00:01:07.290> he<00:01:07.680> bites<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.670> kid<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.659> kids

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
from the stage he bites the kid the kids

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.960 
from the stage he bites the kid the kids
frontal<00:01:10.500> lobe<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.920> which<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.340> basically<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
frontal lobe of which is basically the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.770 
frontal lobe of which is basically the
bite<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.150> 87<00:01:12.770> so<00:01:13.770> then<00:01:13.920> after<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.780> basically

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
bite of 87 so then after that basically

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.359 
bite of 87 so then after that basically
I<00:01:15.810> think<00:01:16.049> what<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.290> all<00:01:16.409> means<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:16.920> I

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
I think what it all means is that I

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.219 
I think what it all means is that I
don't<00:01:17.850> know<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.210> taking<00:01:18.689> place<00:01:18.840> I

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
don't know if this is taking place I

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.600 
don't know if this is taking place I
don't<00:01:19.650> know<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.830> game<00:01:19.979> takes<00:01:20.220> place<00:01:20.280> after

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
don't know if the game takes place after

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.200 
don't know if the game takes place after
you<00:01:21.150> get<00:01:21.299> bitten<00:01:21.770> maybe<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.460> don't<00:01:24.060> know<00:01:24.150> if

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
you get bitten maybe I don't know if

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.429 
you get bitten maybe I don't know if
it's<00:01:24.299> before<00:01:25.020> or<00:01:25.320> after<00:01:26.810> but<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.049> since<00:01:28.259> it's

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
it's before or after but it since it's

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.109 
it's before or after but it since it's
like<00:01:28.530> five<00:01:28.770> days<00:01:29.009> left<00:01:29.250> four<00:01:29.490> days<00:01:29.670> left<00:01:29.909> three

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
like five days left four days left three

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.230 
like five days left four days left three
days<00:01:30.240> left<00:01:30.479> two<00:01:30.990> days<00:01:31.170> left<00:01:31.520> if<00:01:32.520> it's<00:01:32.790> if<00:01:33.119> it's

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
days left two days left if it's if it's

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.620 
days left two days left if it's if it's
after<00:01:33.540> or<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.650> it's<00:01:34.799> there<00:01:35.040> maybe<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.240> kid<00:01:36.479> is

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
after or if it's there maybe the kid is

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.690 
after or if it's there maybe the kid is
in<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.900> hospital<00:01:37.470> recovering<00:01:37.860> from<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
in the hospital recovering from the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.910 
in the hospital recovering from the
frontal<00:01:39.270> lobe<00:01:39.450> accident<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.380> hospital

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
frontal lobe accident in the hospital

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.520 
frontal lobe accident in the hospital
that's<00:01:41.610> why<00:01:41.820> maybe<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.390> whole<00:01:42.570> game<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.200> his

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
that's why maybe this whole game is his

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.770 
that's why maybe this whole game is his
nightmare<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.520> nightmare<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:45.329> him<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.659> his

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
nightmare a nightmare just him in his

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.219 
nightmare a nightmare just him in his
house<00:01:45.960> seeing<00:01:46.680> all<00:01:46.860> these<00:01:46.979> animatronics<00:01:48.229> but

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
house seeing all these animatronics but

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.260 
house seeing all these animatronics but
yeah<00:01:49.380> fredbear<00:01:49.860> did<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.220> bite<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.520> 87<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.240> I

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
yeah fredbear did the bite of 87 so I

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.420 
yeah fredbear did the bite of 87 so I
think<00:01:51.720> my<00:01:51.869> theory<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:53.070> reason<00:01:53.340> you

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
think my theory is that the reason you

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.760 
think my theory is that the reason you
see<00:01:53.579> these<00:01:53.700> three<00:01:54.000> objects<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.990> because<00:01:55.290> he's

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
see these three objects is because he's

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.830 
see these three objects is because he's
hallucinating<00:01:56.070> them<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.880> his<00:01:57.299> nightmare

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
hallucinating them in his nightmare

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.920 
hallucinating them in his nightmare
because<00:01:58.829> right<00:01:59.040> now<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.219> think<00:01:59.399> he's<00:01:59.820> either<00:02:00.090> in

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
because right now I think he's either in

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.350 
because right now I think he's either in
his<00:02:01.200> home<00:02:01.500> recovering<00:02:02.250> or<00:02:02.399> most<00:02:02.850> likely<00:02:03.149> he's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
his home recovering or most likely he's

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.359 
his home recovering or most likely he's
in<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.570> hospital<00:02:04.020> recovering<00:02:04.290> from<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
in the hospital recovering from the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.490 
in the hospital recovering from the
frontal<00:02:05.790> lobe<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.240> think<00:02:06.360> it's<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.960> that's

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
frontal lobe so I think it's that that's

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.199 
frontal lobe so I think it's that that's
why<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:07.799> see<00:02:08.220> these<00:02:08.369> three<00:02:08.550> objects<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
why we see these three objects the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.559 
why we see these three objects the
flowers<00:02:09.629> mean<00:02:09.840> get<00:02:10.530> well<00:02:10.709> flowers<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:12.300> pills

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
flowers mean get well flowers the pills

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.360 
flowers mean get well flowers the pills
I<00:02:12.840> don't<00:02:13.020> know<00:02:13.080> how

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
I don't know how

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.130 
I don't know how
he<00:02:13.790> would<00:02:13.940> take<00:02:14.150> them<00:02:14.330> in<00:02:14.480> if<00:02:14.690> he's<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:15.110> don't

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
he would take them in if he's I don't

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.220 
he would take them in if he's I don't
know<00:02:15.349> you<00:02:15.860> know<00:02:16.330> concussion<00:02:17.330> like<00:02:17.450> he<00:02:17.629> can't

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
know you know concussion like he can't

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.309 
know you know concussion like he can't
think<00:02:18.549> I<00:02:19.569> don't<00:02:20.569> know<00:02:20.720> how<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:20.900> would<00:02:21.140> work

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
think I don't know how that would work

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.930 
think I don't know how that would work
but<00:02:21.500> that's<00:02:21.650> my<00:02:21.769> thing<00:02:21.799> and<00:02:22.310> like<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.760> bag

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
but that's my thing and like the bag

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.920 
but that's my thing and like the bag
think<00:02:23.269> that's<00:02:23.420> what<00:02:23.540> they<00:02:23.629> have<00:02:23.750> in<00:02:23.780> the

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
think that's what they have in the

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.660 
think that's what they have in the
hospitals<00:02:24.409> that's<00:02:24.920> keeping<00:02:25.280> him<00:02:25.340> alive<00:02:25.459> so

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
hospitals that's keeping him alive so

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.509 
hospitals that's keeping him alive so
that's<00:02:26.599> my<00:02:26.840> theory<00:02:27.140> on<00:02:27.470> this<00:02:27.739> these<00:02:28.280> three

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
that's my theory on this these three

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.339 
that's my theory on this these three
objects<00:02:28.970> I<00:02:29.269> know<00:02:29.540> it's<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.720> pretty<00:02:29.870> short<00:02:30.170> video

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
objects I know it's a pretty short video

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.180 
objects I know it's a pretty short video
but<00:02:31.340> I'll<00:02:31.430> make<00:02:31.549> more<00:02:31.760> theories<00:02:32.209> for<00:02:33.170> fnaf<00:02:33.620> 4<00:02:33.860> I

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
but I'll make more theories for fnaf 4 I

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.920 
but I'll make more theories for fnaf 4 I
know<00:02:34.519> I<00:02:34.640> haven't<00:02:34.909> beaten<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.269> whole<00:02:35.510> game<00:02:35.750> but

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
know I haven't beaten the whole game but

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.539 
know I haven't beaten the whole game but
it<00:02:36.049> is<00:02:36.170> seriously<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.620> hard<00:02:36.860> game<00:02:37.010> I<00:02:37.069> might<00:02:37.370> not

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
it is seriously a hard game I might not

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.430 
it is seriously a hard game I might not
beat<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.879> whole<00:02:38.030> thing<00:02:38.269> but<00:02:38.720> I<00:02:38.780> will<00:02:39.019> do<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.200> lot

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
beat the whole thing but I will do a lot

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.440 
beat the whole thing but I will do a lot
of<00:02:39.500> videos<00:02:39.920> on<00:02:40.099> it<00:02:40.159> so<00:02:40.549> think<00:02:41.239> you<00:02:41.329> got

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
of videos on it so think you got

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.509 
of videos on it so think you got
something<00:02:41.720> for<00:02:41.810> watching<00:02:42.260> I'll<00:02:42.739> do<00:02:43.340> more

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
something for watching I'll do more

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.520 
something for watching I'll do more
theories<00:02:43.970> like<00:02:44.450> comment<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.019> subscribe<00:02:45.140> and

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
theories like comment and subscribe and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.900 
theories like comment and subscribe and
tell<00:02:45.709> me<00:02:45.829> it<00:02:45.920> comes<00:02:46.040> below<00:02:46.400> if<00:02:46.519> you<00:02:46.609> want<00:02:46.790> me<00:02:46.879> to

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
tell me it comes below if you want me to

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.640 
tell me it comes below if you want me to
do<00:02:47.090> it<00:02:47.209> more<00:02:47.420> theories<00:02:47.870> because<00:02:48.079> I<00:02:48.170> have<00:02:48.349> more

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
do it more theories because I have more

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.009 
do it more theories because I have more
thing<00:02:49.549> guys<00:02:49.670> for<00:02:50.060> watching<00:02:50.120> this<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:50.599> kgs
