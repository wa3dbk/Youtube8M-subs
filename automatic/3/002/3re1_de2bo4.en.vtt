00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.600
 hello everyone my name is orlando tabaré 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.930
 We'm workshop will nativity scenes 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.969
 work a manger in cardboard is very 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.940
 Easy, very easy, everyone can do it 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.949
 At home we will use cardboard 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.070
 This is a recycled cardboard and we can 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.630
 see if what we have to take into account 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.740
 is that it is not broken that is not 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.020
 bent and we will use rule one 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.760
 metal rule and a scalpel first thing 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.140
 what you must do to make the manger 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.390
 is to transfer the molds that you have 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.840
 previously downloaded from internet to 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.840
 paperboard 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.670
 well here we have all the molds 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:47.379
 what we require for our work 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.769
 these molds can get them in 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:53.589
 our facebook page that is called 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.170
 orla tabares cardona or in a group that 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.049
 we have what is called a crib workshop 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.530
 Colombia always take into account 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:05.080
 that the doors and windows remain 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.670
 chords to our characters with the 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.630
 Ready pieces start assembling the 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.640
 manger 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.240
 Well, here I have the largest base 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.149
 I'm going to paste it 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.480
 this part as it is recycled has 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:23.490
 thrown out 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:26.310
 then we go for this lateral we are going to 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.950
 hit with this other then we go with this 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.060
 another part of the arch 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.060
 we are going to included here 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.960
 here we have a small part that is the 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.640
 We're going to put something on the roof now 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.990
 to paste everything was like that in our 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.990
 in the 11th 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.429
 and then we have this little part that 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:58.219
 it is a small floor that is internal 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.120
 same base from below the largest the 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.190
 we have cut 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.630
 the only portal 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.319
 so that the highlight 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.299
 let's use a stucco 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.680
 This is your very easy to get 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.850
 you can get it at any 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.220
 hardware store 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.000
 if not 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.240
 This is your elbow, add a 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.110
 teaspoon of glue and a teaspoon 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.820
 little 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:32.000
 to make a ring once our piece is dry 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.910
 about two hours later we're going to paint it 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.100
 everything in good white is already dry 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.580
 white paint and we're going to use a 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.490
 color this color is called tan 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.930
 which is a translucent color that is 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.040
 very 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.459
 very clear that we are going to join with a 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.459
 Brush 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.690
 and we remove it with a cloth 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:04.050
 good some parts like some 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.050
 corners we can apply again 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.970
 and this helps us to give depth to the 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.460
 project what 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:18.120
 I will paint the entire part of the floor 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.120
 with this painting that is yellow ocher 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:27.770
 once dry the yellow ocher we are going to 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:30.120
 give the tan an aged 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:35.250
 after getting old we are going to do 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:38.489
 shadows the shadows we make them with 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.959
 black vinyl water of quite water 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:46.010
 then we will apply in the corners 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.010
 and we are going to blur it 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.770
 this also gives a lot of realism are going 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.900
 locating the figures what we have the 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.370
 idea of ​​all these projects services 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.370
 go telling stories 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:08.240
 as life 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:11.480
 it does not have to be all that strict 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.370
 and looking and so finally it will be 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.960
 Ready your pc if like Orlando
