 hi friends from youtube I am carnal and 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:07.620
 2222 and today I bring you a new video 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.860
 tutorial on how to make a source in 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.230
 Minecraft 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.410
 The peculiarity of this source is that of a 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.849
 corner is infinite water that is water 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.210
 that never ends 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:21.570
 let's start we will occupy one for the land 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.630
 necessarily and a material that we like 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.669
 chosen copper stones or stone 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.579
 The first thing we have to do is a 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:33.840
 3 x 3 box like the one we did in 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:36.829
 the floating from with the drum in the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.829
 description in case you want to see it 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.440
 we will do everything tower of three genes of the 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.440
 medium 3 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.340
 and here also three and then they start 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.340
 to also remove this layer 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.790
 Then I saw why 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.329
 we remove it and with the material that 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.960
 we choose I grabbed the copper tolo 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.680
 stone we begin to fill the second 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.680
 layer that we removed 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.340
 and excuse guys 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.050
 we keep filling all this this layer 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.510
 and to delimit to make the limits 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.910
 from our source 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.730
 and we would also need two buckets of 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.520
 wash the buckets of the lava buckets 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.969
 excuse the water buckets 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.619
 what happens today the water buckets the 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:39.880
 buckets are made with three ingots of 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:44.909
 shaped iron v shaped very well 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.909
 we will do a type l in this way 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.480
 and we remove the one below 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.830
 with the water buckets are going to put a 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.440
 here in the corner and another in another 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.800
 corner and so its infinite water what 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.800
 we check 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.509
 following the cuvettes 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.929
 the water never ends well it is 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.929
 enough 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.890
 Now that we know it's water 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:23.530
 infinite down we grab another pellet to 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.530
 notice the body we remove this 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.410
 and now if we enter we put it today 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.020
 excuse me 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.380
 this failure was best calculated we put a 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.380
 little step 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.370
 our fountain is very beautiful 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.710
 the source I like a lot can do 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.470
 as decorative and also serves them 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.960
 because it 's water and fruit come from that 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.920
 corner was opposite also for 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.920
 this 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.739
 yes because he took his voice because the juice 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.310
 leaves a space and that's why he took off the 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.819
 water well 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.709
 seized sometimes that is not this 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.329
 they are not going to confuse destiny because that 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.569
 I say it you can not grab that I've 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.569
 checked 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.540
 all right 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.849
 good to do the height you want 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.300
 but be careful with the water 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.180
 because a despapaye was done 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:28.040
 I had already recorded this video but dirty 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.190
 a problem and then here it is again 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.470
 and be a greeting 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.690
 a subscriber of mine called Carlos 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.920
