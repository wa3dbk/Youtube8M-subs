can hold circle to Peter way so this is

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.150 
can hold circle to Peter way so this is
pretty<00:00:43.500> cool<00:00:43.680> because<00:00:43.740> you<00:00:43.920> don't<00:00:44.070> always

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
pretty cool because you don't always

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.040 
pretty cool because you don't always
want<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.550> use<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.880> touch<00:00:45.090> screen<00:00:45.150> to<00:00:45.930> navigate

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
want to use the touch screen to navigate

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.230 
want to use the touch screen to navigate
through<00:00:46.470> the<00:00:46.560> menu<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.490> quite<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.970> feature

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.240 
through the menu so quite like a feature

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.960 
through the menu so quite like a feature
and<00:00:48.570> also<00:00:48.750> they<00:00:49.020> added<00:00:49.550> scrolling<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> web

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
and also they added scrolling on the web

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.180 
and also they added scrolling on the web
browser<00:00:51.240> with<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> back<00:00:51.900> touchpad<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.980> you

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
browser with the back touchpad and you

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.800 
browser with the back touchpad and you
thought<00:00:53.400> I'd<00:00:53.490> turn<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.970> on<00:00:54.240> the<00:00:54.420> settings

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:54.810 
thought I'd turn this on on the settings

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.230 
thought I'd turn this on on the settings
and<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.380> allows<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.010> use<00:00:56.310> back<00:00:56.820> touchpad

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 
and this allows you to use back touchpad

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.370 
and this allows you to use back touchpad
to<00:00:57.360> scroll<00:00:57.630> and<00:00:57.720> I<00:00:57.810> think<00:00:57.990> this<00:00:58.080> is<00:00:58.170> cool

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
to scroll and I think this is cool

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.360 
to scroll and I think this is cool
because<00:00:58.470> your<00:00:58.710> fingers<00:00:58.980> don't<00:00:59.070> get<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.310> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
because your fingers don't get in the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.640 
because your fingers don't get in the
way<00:00:59.490> of<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> screen<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:01.050> while<00:01:01.200> you<00:01:01.380> scroll

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
way of the screen and while you scroll

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.069 
way of the screen and while you scroll
so<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.040> can<00:01:02.220> see<00:01:02.370> using<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.480> backtracking

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:04.079 
so you can see using the backtracking

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.070 
so you can see using the backtracking
endeth<00:01:05.000> webpages<00:01:06.000> were<00:01:06.360> scrolling<00:01:06.690> up<00:01:06.990> and

endeth webpages were scrolling up and

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
down so that was a pretty cool feature

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.410

it<00:01:44.520> stretches<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.909> out<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.299> be<00:01:45.390> full<00:01:45.659> screen

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
it stretches it out to be full screen

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.730 
it stretches it out to be full screen
zoom<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.820> basically<00:01:48.330> just<00:01:48.450> zooms<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:49.049> there

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
zoom it is basically just zooms in there

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.320 
zoom it is basically just zooms in there
are<00:01:49.860> quite<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.190> for<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.640> best<00:01:50.850> because<00:01:51.150> it

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
are quite like for the best because it

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.710 
are quite like for the best because it
keeps<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.400> fills<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.520> whole<00:01:53.820> screen<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.570> can

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
keeps it fills the whole screen you can

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.410 
keeps it fills the whole screen you can
have<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.900> all<00:01:54.960> normal<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.440> original<00:01:56.190> and

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
have it all normal and original and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.550 
have it all normal and original and
that's<00:01:57.420> pretty<00:01:57.720> cool<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.080> can<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.350> set

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
that's pretty cool so you can just set

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.990 
that's pretty cool so you can just set
whichever<00:01:59.040> one<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.369> or<00:01:59.610> keep<00:01:59.760> it<00:01:59.909> on

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
whichever one you like or keep it on

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.420 
whichever one you like or keep it on
normal<00:02:00.450> for<00:02:00.600> now<00:02:00.720> and<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.710> can<00:02:01.740> also<00:02:02.010> set

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
normal for now and you can also set

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.120 
normal for now and you can also set
William<00:02:02.760> disk<00:02:03.060> load<00:02:03.420> speed<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.830> can<00:02:04.890> also

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
William disk load speed and you can also

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.890 
William disk load speed and you can also
turn<00:02:05.760> this<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.119> which<00:02:06.270> actually<00:02:06.630> makes<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
turn this on which actually makes the

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.380 
turn this on which actually makes the
game<00:02:07.049> look<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.290> little<00:02:07.380> bit<00:02:07.530> there<00:02:07.759> so<00:02:08.759> let<00:02:09.360> us

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
game look a little bit there so let us

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.449 
game look a little bit there so let us
start<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> game<00:02:09.959> here<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.950> can<00:02:11.190> also

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
start the game here so you can also

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.320 
start the game here so you can also
change<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.940> controls<00:02:12.330> as<00:02:12.540> well<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:12.810> this

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
change the controls as well in this

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.750 
change the controls as well in this
by<00:02:14.140> holding<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.560> touchscreen<00:02:14.830> going<00:02:15.340> down<00:02:15.580> to

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
by holding the touchscreen going down to

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.480 
by holding the touchscreen going down to
control<00:02:16.150> sangs<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:17.590> can<00:02:17.740> assign<00:02:18.130> your<00:02:18.280> bonds

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
control sangs you can assign your bonds

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.580 
control sangs you can assign your bonds
to<00:02:18.790> be<00:02:18.940> however<00:02:19.630> you<00:02:19.750> like<00:02:19.960> it<00:02:20.170> or<00:02:20.320> just<00:02:20.560> keep

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
to be however you like it or just keep

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.890 
to be however you like it or just keep
on<00:02:20.890> standard<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:22.120> I'm<00:02:22.240> just<00:02:22.390> going<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.600> keep<00:02:22.780> it

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
on standard so I'm just going to keep it

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.050 
on standard so I'm just going to keep it
on<00:02:22.960> standard<00:02:23.440> right<00:02:23.590> here<00:02:23.740> you<00:02:24.460> can<00:02:24.610> assign

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
on standard right here you can assign

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.620 
on standard right here you can assign
which<00:02:25.330> controller<00:02:25.840> port<00:02:26.550> when<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:27.850> obviously

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
which controller port when you obviously

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.690 
which controller port when you obviously
need<00:02:28.810> I'll<00:02:28.960> get<00:02:29.350> solve<00:02:29.560> it<00:02:29.680> because<00:02:29.890> it<00:02:30.070> tells

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
need I'll get solve it because it tells

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.970 
need I'll get solve it because it tells
you<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:30.940> change<00:02:31.230> control<00:02:32.230> at<00:02:32.410> one<00:02:32.560> point<00:02:32.770> and

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
you to change control at one point and

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.700 
you to change control at one point and
you<00:02:33.670> can<00:02:34.090> set<00:02:34.420> digital<00:02:34.930> mode<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.290> analog<00:02:35.560> mode

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
you can set digital mode and analog mode

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.770 
you can set digital mode and analog mode
so<00:02:36.040> I'm<00:02:36.130> gonna<00:02:36.250> go<00:02:36.400> with<00:02:36.520> analog<00:02:36.970> that's

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
so I'm gonna go with analog that's

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.880 
so I'm gonna go with analog that's
pretty<00:02:38.020> cool<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.410> can<00:02:38.470> change<00:02:38.740> on

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
pretty cool that you can change on

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.580 
pretty cool that you can change on
control<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:39.370> now<00:02:39.400> use<00:02:39.700> an<00:02:39.790> analog<00:02:40.210> to<00:02:40.590> move

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
control so now use an analog to move

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.640 
control so now use an analog to move
around<00:02:42.330> also<00:02:43.330> pretty<00:02:43.750> cool<00:02:43.900> use<00:02:44.200> for<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.440> back

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
around also pretty cool use for the back

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.470 
around also pretty cool use for the back
touchpad<00:02:45.160> when<00:02:45.340> playing<00:02:45.550> ps1<00:02:46.000> games<00:02:46.240> is<00:02:46.390> you

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
touchpad when playing ps1 games is you

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.750 
touchpad when playing ps1 games is you
can<00:02:46.630> actually<00:02:46.810> assign<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.470> be<00:02:47.560> l2<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:48.340> r2

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
can actually assign it to be l2 and r2

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.700 
can actually assign it to be l2 and r2
so<00:02:49.180> I<00:02:49.210> can<00:02:49.450> open<00:02:49.750> up<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.930> items<00:02:50.260> menu<00:02:50.470> like

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
so I can open up the items menu like

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.890 
so I can open up the items menu like
that<00:02:50.890> select<00:02:51.760> through<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.240> items<00:02:52.570> with

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
that select through the items with

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.930 
that select through the items with
analog<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.410> also<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.190> weapons<00:02:54.490> menu<00:02:54.730> just

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
analog and also the weapons menu just

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.310 
analog and also the weapons menu just
touch<00:02:55.150> on<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.540> right<00:02:55.660> side<00:02:55.960> of<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.140> back

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
touch on the right side of the back

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.010 
touch on the right side of the back
touch<00:02:56.560> like<00:02:57.220> that<00:02:57.460> like<00:02:57.970> that<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.930> will

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
touch like that like that so that will

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.730 
touch like that like that so that will
that<00:02:59.260> would<00:02:59.770> take<00:03:00.010> place<00:03:00.280> for<00:03:00.550> not<00:03:00.850> having<00:03:01.740> l2

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
that would take place for not having l2

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.910 
that would take place for not having l2
and<00:03:02.980> r2<00:03:03.190> on<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.450> PS<00:03:04.660> Vita<00:03:04.870> cells<00:03:05.140> people<00:03:05.290> try

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
and r2 on the PS Vita cells people try

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:20.380 
and r2 on the PS Vita cells people try
not<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.160> get<00:03:06.250> caught

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.789 

there's<00:03:20.960> a<00:03:21.050> guard<00:03:21.320> right<00:03:21.530> there

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.960 

right<00:03:28.799> go<00:03:29.010> on<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.219> lift<00:03:29.430> here

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.240 

[Applause]

[Applause]

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.980 
[Applause]
so<00:03:36.090> as<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.270> can<00:03:36.390> see<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.630> game<00:03:36.810> actually

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
so as you can see the game actually

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.140 
so as you can see the game actually
doesn't<00:03:37.380> look<00:03:37.500> too<00:03:37.680> bad<00:03:37.860> on<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.220> PS<00:03:38.700> Vita<00:03:38.940> soil

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
doesn't look too bad on the PS Vita soil

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.610 
doesn't look too bad on the PS Vita soil
that<00:03:39.300> screen<00:03:39.600> actually<00:03:39.840> makes<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:40.290> look<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.470> lot

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
that screen actually makes it look a lot

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.640 
that screen actually makes it look a lot
better<00:03:41.330> so<00:03:42.330> that's<00:03:42.570> pretty<00:03:42.780> cool<00:03:45.440> right<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:46.620> I

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
better so that's pretty cool right so I

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.470 
better so that's pretty cool right so I
finally<00:03:46.890> just<00:03:47.100> go<00:03:47.250> through<00:03:47.490> a<00:03:47.580> bunch<00:03:47.790> of<00:03:47.910> long

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
finally just go through a bunch of long

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.870 
finally just go through a bunch of long
codex<00:03:49.050> things<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:49.470> stuff<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:50.400> actually<00:03:50.700> get

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
codex things and stuff so actually get

00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:02.970
