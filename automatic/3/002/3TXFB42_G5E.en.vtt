are<00:02:02.330> crowded<00:02:02.900> and<00:02:03.049> pushing<00:02:03.560> up<00:02:03.710> out<00:02:03.890> of<00:02:04.130> the

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
are crowded and pushing up out of the

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.749 
are crowded and pushing up out of the
soil<00:02:05.020> we're<00:02:06.020> gonna<00:02:06.110> divide<00:02:06.799> these<00:02:07.100> so<00:02:07.670> we

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
soil we're gonna divide these so we

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:08.979 
soil we're gonna divide these so we
could<00:02:07.880> spread<00:02:08.119> them<00:02:08.270> out<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.420> little<00:02:08.600> bit<00:02:08.780> more

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
could spread them out a little bit more

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.080 
could spread them out a little bit more
but<00:02:09.679> before<00:02:10.009> we<00:02:10.100> do<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.429> we<00:02:10.610> need<00:02:10.789> to<00:02:10.880> cut

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
but before we do that we need to cut

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.170 
but before we do that we need to cut
back<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:12.260> foliage<00:02:12.709> to<00:02:13.100> about<00:02:13.310> six<00:02:13.700> inches

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
back the foliage to about six inches

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.670 
back the foliage to about six inches
from<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.660> ground<00:02:15.040> this<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.250> going<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.520> help<00:02:16.790> to

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
from the ground this is going to help to

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.470 
from the ground this is going to help to
retain<00:02:18.680> some<00:02:19.160> of<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.340> moisture<00:02:19.400> in<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.090> plant

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
retain some of the moisture in the plant

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.960 
retain some of the moisture in the plant
and<00:02:21.290> it<00:02:21.530> also<00:02:21.680> makes<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.220> little<00:02:22.430> bit<00:02:22.550> easier

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
and it also makes it a little bit easier

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.400 
and it also makes it a little bit easier
to<00:02:23.569> lift<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.110> move<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.709> plants<00:02:26.050> using<00:02:27.050> a

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
to lift and move the plants using a

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.509 
to lift and move the plants using a
shovel<00:02:28.130> or<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:29.080> fork<00:02:30.080> you<00:02:30.319> want<00:02:31.069> to<00:02:31.160> dig<00:02:31.370> around

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
shovel or a fork you want to dig around

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.670 
shovel or a fork you want to dig around
all<00:02:31.970> four<00:02:32.269> sides<00:02:32.330> of<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.930> plant<00:02:35.200> it's<00:02:36.200> good<00:02:36.500> to

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
all four sides of the plant it's good to

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.430 
all four sides of the plant it's good to
dig<00:02:37.489> about<00:02:37.700> four<00:02:38.180> inches<00:02:38.600> away<00:02:38.660> from<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.170> base

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
dig about four inches away from the base

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.350 
dig about four inches away from the base
of<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.709> plant<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:40.850> you<00:02:40.940> don't<00:02:41.120> damage

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
of the plant so that you don't damage

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.009 
of the plant so that you don't damage
the<00:02:41.720> roots<00:02:41.989> beneath<00:02:43.510> irises<00:02:44.510> are<00:02:44.540> fairly

the roots beneath irises are fairly
shallow<00:02:45.350> rooted<00:02:46.000> so<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.060> don't<00:02:47.209> have<00:02:47.330> to<00:02:47.450> dig

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
shallow rooted so you don't have to dig

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.900 
shallow rooted so you don't have to dig
down<00:02:47.810> too<00:02:48.140> deep<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.560> get<00:02:48.680> them<00:02:48.830> out<00:02:48.950> some<00:02:49.790> other

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910

plants<00:02:50.360> you're<00:02:50.480> going<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.660> need<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.959> dig<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.380> bit

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.870 
plants you're going to need to dig a bit
deeper<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:54.200> can<00:02:54.380> lift<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:55.160> plants<00:02:55.519> up<00:02:55.670> out<00:02:55.790> of

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
deeper you can lift the plants up out of

the ground either with your shovel or
with<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.880> fork<00:02:59.980> before<00:03:00.980> we<00:03:01.310> divide<00:03:01.610> this

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
with the fork before we divide this

with the fork before we divide this
clump<00:03:02.239> of<00:03:02.450> iris<00:03:03.049> we<00:03:03.260> need<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.500> remove<00:03:03.739> some<00:03:03.950> of

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
clump of iris we need to remove some of

clump of iris we need to remove some of
the<00:03:04.100> excess<00:03:04.640> soil<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.720> can<00:03:05.750> shake<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.230> off

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
the excess soil you can shake it off

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.550 
the excess soil you can shake it off
sometimes<00:03:08.239> you<00:03:08.600> can<00:03:08.780> lift<00:03:08.959> it<00:03:09.079> up<00:03:09.200> in<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.410> air

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
sometimes you can lift it up in the air

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.199 
sometimes you can lift it up in the air
and<00:03:09.799> just<00:03:09.950> drop<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:10.700> that'll<00:03:11.060> loosen

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
and just drop it and that'll loosen

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.430 
and just drop it and that'll loosen
large<00:03:11.930> chunks<00:03:12.440> of<00:03:12.560> soil<00:03:12.890> off<00:03:14.049> some<00:03:15.049> plants<00:03:15.380> are

large chunks of soil off some plants are

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.690 
large chunks of soil off some plants are
a<00:03:15.500> little<00:03:15.650> more<00:03:15.769> tender<00:03:16.070> so<00:03:16.400> you're<00:03:16.519> not<00:03:16.579> going

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
a little more tender so you're not going

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.380 
a little more tender so you're not going
to<00:03:16.760> want<00:03:16.910> to<00:03:16.970> drop<00:03:17.239> them<00:03:17.510> too<00:03:17.720> high

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
to want to drop them too high

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.610 
to want to drop them too high
we're<00:03:20.390> gonna<00:03:20.510> just<00:03:20.780> loosen<00:03:21.140> this<00:03:21.230> it'll<00:03:21.500> make

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
we're gonna just loosen this it'll make

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.650 
we're gonna just loosen this it'll make
us<00:03:21.769> easy<00:03:22.010> make<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.519> easier<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:23.030> see<00:03:23.329> where<00:03:23.630> the

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
us easy make it easier to see where the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.210 
us easy make it easier to see where the
rhizomes<00:03:24.320> themselves<00:03:24.920> are<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.480> also<00:03:27.220> make

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
rhizomes themselves are and also make

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.759 
rhizomes themselves are and also make
the<00:03:28.370> job<00:03:28.549> a<00:03:28.579> little<00:03:28.760> bit<00:03:28.940> easier<00:03:29.560> okay<00:03:30.560> that

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
the job a little bit easier okay that

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.229 
the job a little bit easier okay that
looks<00:03:30.890> pretty<00:03:31.040> good<00:03:31.280> for<00:03:31.609> now<00:03:33.940> now<00:03:34.940> that<00:03:35.120> we've

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
looks pretty good for now now that we've

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.060 
looks pretty good for now now that we've
lifted<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.690> plant<00:03:35.989> it's<00:03:36.440> time<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:36.890> make<00:03:37.040> our

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
lifted the plant it's time to make our

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.970 
lifted the plant it's time to make our
divisions<00:03:37.989> some<00:03:38.989> of<00:03:39.109> the<00:03:39.170> pieces<00:03:39.560> broke<00:03:39.769> off

into nice sets already but others will

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.550 
into nice sets already but others will
have<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.340> cut<00:03:43.579> use<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.510> sharp<00:03:44.900> knife<00:03:44.959> to<00:03:45.440> make

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
want the hole deep enough so that the

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.870 
want the hole deep enough so that the
