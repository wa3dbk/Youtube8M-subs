spraying the hair first so I'm just

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.729 
spraying the hair first so I'm just
using<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.180> medium<00:01:00.570> hold<00:01:00.719> hairspray<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.500> hold

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
using a medium hold hairspray you hold

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.100 
using a medium hold hairspray you hold
hairspray<00:01:01.920> bring<00:01:02.460> each<00:01:02.820> section<00:01:03.420> okay<00:01:04.049> you

never want to take a section bigger than
your<00:01:06.150> curling<00:01:06.450> iron<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.170> really<00:01:07.560> key<00:01:08.189> to

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
your curling iron so it's really key to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.580 
your curling iron so it's really key to
clamp<00:01:09.180> down<00:01:09.330> at<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> root<00:01:10.110> area

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
clamp down at the root area

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.440 
clamp down at the root area
you<00:01:11.010> wouldn't<00:01:11.280> clamp<00:01:11.549> down<00:01:11.820> at<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> root<00:01:12.240> area

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
you wouldn't clamp down at the root area

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.410 
you wouldn't clamp down at the root area
and<00:01:13.170> then<00:01:13.920> ease<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.549> hair<00:01:14.760> through<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.090> hair

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and then ease the hair through the hair

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.070 
and then ease the hair through the hair
top<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:16.290> let<00:01:16.409> me<00:01:16.530> show<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.159> side

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
top so let me show you on this side

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.140 
top so let me show you on this side
you<00:01:19.010> got<00:01:19.160> to<00:01:19.250> take<00:01:19.520> your<00:01:19.640> glasses<00:01:19.760> off<00:01:20.090> for

this<00:01:20.450> one<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:21.590> you've<00:01:21.740> clamped<00:01:22.130> down<00:01:22.160> near<00:01:22.610> the

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
this one so you've clamped down near the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.440 
this one so you've clamped down near the
roof<00:01:22.970> okay

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
roof okay

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.480 
roof okay
and<00:01:23.660> work<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.650> hair<00:01:24.800> through<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.130> tongs

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
and work the hair through the tongs

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.340 
and work the hair through the tongs
because<00:01:26.000> what's<00:01:26.210> that<00:01:26.390> that's<00:01:26.780> doing<00:01:27.050> is

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
because what's that that's doing is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.340 
because what's that that's doing is
creating<00:01:27.800> volume<00:01:28.460> at<00:01:28.640> our<00:01:28.790> base<00:01:29.210> let's<00:01:30.140> just

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
creating volume at our base let's just

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.320 
creating volume at our base let's just
hold<00:01:30.530> it<00:01:30.650> for<00:01:30.680> a<00:01:30.860> few<00:01:30.890> seconds<00:01:31.400> release<00:01:31.910> and

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
hold it for a few seconds release and

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.230 
hold it for a few seconds release and
then<00:01:32.540> you<00:01:32.660> just<00:01:32.840> put<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.350> paper<00:01:33.950> clip<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:34.580> the

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
then you just put a paper clip and the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.880 
then you just put a paper clip and the
reason<00:01:35.540> why<00:01:35.660> I<00:01:35.690> like<00:01:36.080> to<00:01:36.230> put<00:01:36.410> a<00:01:36.440> pin<00:01:36.710> curl

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
reason why I like to put a pin curl

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.470 
reason why I like to put a pin curl
clipping<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:37.460> it's<00:01:37.910> because<00:01:38.240> it's<00:01:38.390> gonna

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
clipping it it's because it's gonna

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.170 
clipping it it's because it's gonna
allow<00:01:38.720> it<00:01:38.900> to<00:01:39.080> set<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:39.770> cool<00:01:40.160> so<00:01:40.910> when<00:01:41.060> it

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
allow it to set and cool so when it

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.850 
allow it to set and cool so when it
cools<00:01:41.450> down<00:01:41.600> and<00:01:42.080> you<00:01:42.140> release<00:01:42.380> those<00:01:42.620> pink

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
cools down and you release those pink

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.290 
cools down and you release those pink
