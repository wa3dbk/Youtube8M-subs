branch will pretty much do it for you
don't<00:01:43.210> really<00:01:43.450> need<00:01:43.749> a<00:01:44.020> hard<00:01:44.439> brush<00:01:44.770> if<00:01:45.009> your

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
don't really need a hard brush if your

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.010 
don't really need a hard brush if your
hair<00:01:45.429> is<00:01:45.579> soft<00:01:45.939> because<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:48.189> brush<00:01:48.490> is

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
hair is soft because this brush is

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.179 
hair is soft because this brush is
definitely<00:01:50.020> strong<00:01:50.319> enough<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.710> take<00:01:50.920> care<00:01:51.130> of

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
definitely strong enough to take care of

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.429 
definitely strong enough to take care of
it<00:01:51.429> like<00:01:51.609> I<00:01:51.729> don't<00:01:51.939> need<00:01:52.179> a<00:01:52.420> hard<00:01:52.719> brush<00:01:53.079> I

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
it like I don't need a hard brush I

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.440 
it like I don't need a hard brush I
probably<00:01:54.100> won't<00:01:54.340> get<00:01:54.549> a<00:01:54.609> hard<00:01:54.909> crown<00:01:55.210> brush

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
probably won't get a hard crown brush

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.959 
probably won't get a hard crown brush
because<00:01:55.840> this<00:01:56.049> can<00:01:56.319> do<00:01:56.579> everything<00:01:57.579> I<00:01:57.729> needed

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
because this can do everything I needed
