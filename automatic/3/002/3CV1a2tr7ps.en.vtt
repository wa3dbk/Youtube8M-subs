00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.750
 Hi everyone in this video I will show you how to do the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.310
 dog or little dog with mouldable balloons 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.240
 the little dog is one of the basic figures in fact it is fast and very simple to do 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.540
 to make it happen we need only one balloon 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:32.449
 you can choose the color you prefer the balloon must be inflated leaving 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:39.449
 a deflated part of six fingers the first part to do is the head 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.980
 calculate about 4 fingers and make a twist then we pass to the ears 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.100
 to make ears we have to make two round balls 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.610
 these two round balls should be joined in this way 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.900
 and a twist has to be made here so far we have the dog's head 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.100
 and the ears for the neck we take a distance of 4 fingers 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:25.100
 let's make a twist to make the legs take a distance of 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.000
 4 fingers this is the first one and this is the second one 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 leg and let's get them together like this 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.900
 now is the time of the body you can take the distance you prefer 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.299
 if we make a longer body there will be a dachshund 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:57.299
 while if we keep the body shorter another breed of dog 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.560
 it's time to do the back legs like the front ones, 4 fingers long 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:19.100
 here is the first leg and then the second and we are going to unite them in this way 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.180
 making a twist and finally there remains the tail 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.330
 we can choose to keep the tail so long 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.330
 or to shorten it you decide the length of your tail 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.620
 with the scissors cut the excess we make the air come out and make a knot 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:51.019
 cut off the part left deflated and here is our little dog!
