00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
your hand to hold the back of the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.490 
your hand to hold the back of the
keyboard<00:01:11.690> as<00:01:13.119> you<00:01:14.119> remove<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.690> single<00:01:15.080> screw

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
keyboard as you remove the single screw

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.460 
keyboard as you remove the single screw
that<00:01:16.490> holds<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:17.000> keyboard<00:01:17.510> in<00:01:17.690> right<00:01:18.140> here<00:01:18.380> in

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
that holds the keyboard in right here in

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.270 
that holds the keyboard in right here in
the<00:01:18.560> center

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.070 

and<00:01:25.400> then<00:01:25.910> the<00:01:26.030> keyboard<00:01:26.480> will<00:01:26.660> just<00:01:26.870> pop

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
and then the keyboard will just pop

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.410 
and then the keyboard will just pop
right<00:01:27.350> up<00:01:27.410> like<00:01:27.830> that<00:01:28.100> now<00:01:29.030> what<00:01:29.240> we're

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
right up like that now what we're

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.830 
right up like that now what we're
looking<00:01:29.450> for<00:01:29.810> here<00:01:30.380> is<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:31.040> CMOS<00:01:31.490> battery

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
looking for here is the CMOS battery

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.390 
looking for here is the CMOS battery
right<00:01:32.840> here<00:01:32.900> you're<00:01:33.890> going<00:01:34.010> to<00:01:34.070> need<00:01:34.310> to

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
right here you're going to need to

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.810 
right here you're going to need to
disconnect<00:01:35.030> it<00:01:35.240> from<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:36.229> motherboard<00:01:39.820> okay

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
disconnect it from the motherboard okay

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.219 
disconnect it from the motherboard okay
so<00:01:40.880> once<00:01:41.180> you've<00:01:41.330> got<00:01:41.479> it<00:01:41.600> disconnected<00:01:42.110> from

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
so once you've got it disconnected from

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.800 
so once you've got it disconnected from

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
the motherboard I used was a pic and I

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.900 
the motherboard I used was a pic and I
just<00:01:45.200> pulled<00:01:45.440> it<00:01:45.560> up<00:01:45.680> you<00:01:46.280> need<00:01:46.460> some<00:01:46.670> tweezers

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
just pulled it up you need some tweezers

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.160

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
power from the system board then which

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.700 
power from the system board then which
one<00:01:57.380> we<00:01:57.500> could<00:01:57.649> do<00:01:57.770> is<00:01:58.240> attach<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.710> power

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
one we could do is attach the power

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.120 
one we could do is attach the power
supply<00:02:01.660> you<00:02:02.660> can<00:02:02.899> use<00:02:03.110> a<00:02:03.140> battery<00:02:03.470> your

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
supply you can use a battery your

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.999 
supply you can use a battery your
battery<00:02:04.430> as<00:02:04.610> charged

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.250 

attach<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.759> power<00:02:09.910> supply<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.720> turn<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:11.020> on

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
attach the power supply and turn it on

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.180 
attach the power supply and turn it on
and<00:02:12.780> then<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:13.810> will<00:02:14.140> go<00:02:14.290> through<00:02:14.500> post<00:02:14.830> once

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
and then it will go through post once

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.540 
and then it will go through post once
you've<00:02:15.370> turned<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.790> on<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.440> if<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:18.129> have<00:02:18.160> no
