that<00:00:33.870> kind<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.110> stuff<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.280> thought<00:00:35.670> this

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
that kind of stuff so I thought this

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.220

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
because I don't have a lot of tutorials

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.270

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.500 
time so you guys can see how long I'm
holding<00:04:42.070> each<00:04:42.190> strand<00:04:42.520> on<00:04:42.760> top<00:04:42.970> of<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.240> barrel

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
holding each strand on top of the barrel

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.240 
holding each strand on top of the barrel
so<00:04:44.140> all<00:04:44.289> you're<00:04:44.410> gonna<00:04:44.470> do<00:04:44.680> is<00:04:44.770> take<00:04:44.800> a<00:04:44.979> section

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
so all you're gonna do is take a section

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.370 
so all you're gonna do is take a section
of<00:04:45.430> hair<00:04:45.640> and<00:04:45.820> wrap<00:04:46.030> it<00:04:46.240> around<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.840> leave

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
of hair and wrap it around and leave

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.730 
of hair and wrap it around and leave
probably<00:04:48.010> a<00:04:48.039> couple<00:04:48.430> inches<00:04:48.640> off<00:04:48.850> the<00:04:49.240> end<00:04:49.740> or

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
probably a couple inches off the end or

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.290 
probably a couple inches off the end or
maybe<00:04:50.950> like<00:04:51.190> an<00:04:51.310> inch<00:04:51.490> inch<00:04:51.760> and<00:04:51.850> a<00:04:51.970> half<00:04:52.000> off

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
maybe like an inch inch and a half off

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.060 
maybe like an inch inch and a half off
the<00:04:52.510> end<00:04:52.660> of<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.260> barrel<00:04:53.440> so<00:04:53.680> that's<00:04:53.860> not

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
the end of the barrel so that's not

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.180 
the end of the barrel so that's not
curled<00:04:54.400> so<00:04:54.580> what<00:04:54.700> will<00:04:54.880> remain<00:04:55.060> straight<00:04:55.630> and

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
curled so what will remain straight and

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.710 
curled so what will remain straight and
then<00:04:57.190> all<00:04:57.340> you're<00:04:57.490> gonna<00:04:57.610> do<00:04:57.850> is<00:04:58.030> release<00:04:58.419> and

you're gonna get this curl that's
straight<00:05:00.310> at<00:05:00.430> the<00:05:00.550> end<00:05:00.700> which<00:05:00.880> is<00:05:01.030> what<00:05:01.150> you
