00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
remember throughout this video is the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
remember throughout this video is the
body's<00:02:38.400> answer<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.209> pollution<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:40.380> dilution

so<00:02:42.000> what<00:02:42.150> do<00:02:42.209> I<00:02:42.239> mean<00:02:42.299> by<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:42.810> mean<00:02:43.079> the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
so what do I mean by that I mean the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.800 
so what do I mean by that I mean the
body<00:02:43.410> will<00:02:43.620> hold<00:02:43.890> on<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.549> water<00:02:44.819> weight<00:02:45.150> it

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
body will hold on to water weight it

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.680

will<00:02:45.959> hold<00:02:46.170> on<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.500> water<00:02:46.680> in<00:02:47.130> order<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.690> dilute

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
will hold on to water in order to dilute

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.380

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
much toxicity not only high fat calories

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.400

you're<00:03:13.950> taking<00:03:14.370> in<00:03:14.549> toxicity<00:03:15.540> as<00:03:15.840> well<00:03:16.049> so<00:03:16.290> the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
you're taking in toxicity as well so the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.860 
you're taking in toxicity as well so the
body<00:03:16.650> has<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:17.250> hold<00:03:17.489> all<00:03:17.819> this<00:03:18.090> extra<00:03:18.450> water

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
body has to hold all this extra water

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.690 
body has to hold all this extra water
way<00:03:19.109> so<00:03:19.500> we<00:03:19.590> get<00:03:19.709> bigger<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.220> bigger<00:03:20.459> and

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
way so we get bigger and bigger and

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.629 
way so we get bigger and bigger and
bigger<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.480> that's<00:03:21.930> fat<00:03:22.319> and<00:03:22.650> salt<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.310> fluid

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639
