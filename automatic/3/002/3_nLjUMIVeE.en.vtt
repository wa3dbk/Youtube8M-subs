plush is that I kind of wish it had a

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.860 
plush is that I kind of wish it had a
sound<00:03:54.639> off<00:03:55.060> mode<00:03:57.150> so<00:03:58.150> that<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:58.450> could<00:03:58.599> just

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
sound off mode so that you could just

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.259

see the cutie mark light up without the

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.659 
see the cutie mark light up without the
sound<00:04:02.549> but<00:04:03.549> it<00:04:03.609> doesn't<00:04:03.909> have<00:04:04.060> that<00:04:04.739> so<00:04:05.739> I<00:04:06.280> also

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
sound but it doesn't have that so I also

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.429 
sound but it doesn't have that so I also
kind<00:04:07.030> of<00:04:07.060> wish<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.419> songs<00:04:07.689> were<00:04:07.959> a<00:04:07.989> little<00:04:08.200> bit

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:08.439

longer<00:04:09.389> but<00:04:10.389> other<00:04:10.569> than<00:04:10.720> that<00:04:10.840> I<00:04:11.139> think

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
longer but other than that I think

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.879 
longer but other than that I think
that's<00:04:11.709> a<00:04:11.919> pretty<00:04:12.190> good<00:04:12.430> buy<00:04:12.609> for<00:04:12.930> $21.99<00:04:13.930> so

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
that's a pretty good buy for $21.99 so

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.860
