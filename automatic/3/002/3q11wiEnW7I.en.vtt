00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 
textures and the hammer didn't move it

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.679

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
the emotion and now it is stolen the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.039 
the emotion and now it is stolen the
foundations<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:37.909> it<00:00:38.150> actually<00:00:38.330> looks<00:00:38.780> pretty

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:39.049 
foundations so it actually looks pretty

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:40.810 
foundations so it actually looks pretty
nice<00:00:39.320> so<00:00:39.860> we<00:00:40.010> should<00:00:40.159> make<00:00:40.309> a<00:00:40.339> whole<00:00:40.549> bunch<00:00:40.729> of

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
nice so we should make a whole bunch of

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.329 
nice so we should make a whole bunch of
them<00:00:40.940> though<00:00:41.510> so<00:00:41.659> you<00:00:41.720> guys<00:00:41.900> can<00:00:42.140> see<00:00:42.309> all<00:00:43.309> the

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339 
them though so you guys can see all the

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.280 
them though so you guys can see all the
new<00:00:43.640> stuff<00:00:43.699> see<00:00:44.089> their<00:00:44.269> animations<00:00:44.960> actually

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
new stuff see their animations actually

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.460 
new stuff see their animations actually
it's<00:00:45.440> not<00:00:45.559> just<00:00:46.030> pops<00:00:47.030> up<00:00:47.299> randomly<00:00:47.869> so<00:00:48.260> that

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
it's not just pops up randomly so that

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.880 
it's not just pops up randomly so that
makes<00:00:48.949> it<00:00:49.070> look<00:00:49.280> a<00:00:49.489> lot<00:00:49.729> nicer<00:00:50.769> also<00:00:51.769> the

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890

this<00:01:18.590> was<00:01:18.770> not<00:01:18.920> like<00:01:19.130> this<00:01:19.340> last<00:01:19.610> time<00:01:19.850> it<00:01:20.000> only

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
this was not like this last time it only

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.930 
this was not like this last time it only
had<00:01:20.240> a<00:01:20.270> couple<00:01:20.360> things<00:01:21.730> unnaturally<00:01:22.730> shows

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
had a couple things unnaturally shows

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.870 
had a couple things unnaturally shows
pictures<00:01:23.210> now<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:24.650> they're<00:01:25.010> having<00:01:25.430> a<00:01:25.550> lot<00:01:25.850> of

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
pictures now so they're having a lot of

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.850 
pictures now so they're having a lot of
improvements<00:01:26.780> on<00:01:26.930> this<00:01:27.080> entire<00:01:27.410> thing<00:01:27.680> in

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
improvements on this entire thing in

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.090 
improvements on this entire thing in
general<00:01:28.120> so<00:01:29.120> this<00:01:29.360> game<00:01:29.600> is<00:01:29.870> getting<00:01:30.680> there

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
general so this game is getting there

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.580 
general so this game is getting there
but<00:01:31.430> it's<00:01:31.670> not<00:01:31.760> close<00:01:32.300> it's<00:01:33.080> kind<00:01:33.230> of<00:01:33.350> hard<00:01:33.530> to

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
but it's not close it's kind of hard to

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.210 
but it's not close it's kind of hard to
explain<00:01:33.770> it's<00:01:34.700> like<00:01:34.940> a<00:01:35.860> quarter<00:01:36.860> of<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.100> way

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
explain it's like a quarter of the way

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.700 
explain it's like a quarter of the way
there<00:01:37.780> because<00:01:38.780> now<00:01:39.050> that<00:01:39.080> they<00:01:39.409> have<00:01:39.440> all

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
there because now that they have all

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.290 
there because now that they have all
these<00:01:39.800> textures<00:01:40.400> and<00:01:40.760> games<00:01:41.060> actually

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
these textures and games actually

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.680 
these textures and games actually
running<00:01:41.690> smooth<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:42.680> it<00:01:43.580> doesn't<00:01:44.240> lag<00:01:44.420> cuz

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
running smooth and it doesn't lag cuz

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.120 
running smooth and it doesn't lag cuz
when<00:01:44.840> i<00:01:44.870> first<00:01:45.170> played<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.650> was<00:01:45.740> I<00:01:45.830> really

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
when i first played it was I really

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.610 
when i first played it was I really
laggy<00:01:46.570> I'm<00:01:47.570> walking<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.080> tree<00:01:48.290> with<00:01:48.440> this

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
laggy I'm walking the tree with this

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.270 
laggy I'm walking the tree with this
hammer<00:01:49.400> it<00:01:50.330> looks<00:01:50.510> really<00:01:50.690> kind<00:01:50.930> of<00:01:50.990> funny<00:01:51.280> Wow

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
hammer it looks really kind of funny Wow

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.860 
hammer it looks really kind of funny Wow
the<00:01:52.340> map<00:01:52.700> actually<00:01:52.909> looks<00:01:53.180> really<00:01:53.270> nice

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
the map actually looks really nice

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.450 
the map actually looks really nice
because<00:01:54.080> like<00:01:54.260> when<00:01:54.650> you<00:01:54.800> play<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.310> other

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
because like when you play the other

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.370 
because like when you play the other
rust<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:56.180> then<00:01:56.390> you<00:01:56.450> try<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.690> experimental

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
rust and then you try the experimental

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.170 
rust and then you try the experimental
it's<00:01:57.770> like<00:01:57.920> a<00:01:57.950> whole<00:01:58.280> different<00:01:58.700> game<00:01:58.940> it

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
it's like a whole different game it

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.180 
it's like a whole different game it
doesn't<00:01:59.360> even<00:01:59.420> feel<00:01:59.659> like<00:01:59.720> rust<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.950> that's<00:02:01.100> I

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
like I don't know it's maybe glitch or

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.280 
like I don't know it's maybe glitch or
something<00:03:48.250> but<00:03:48.850> so<00:03:49.420> I<00:03:49.450> have<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:49.959> fix<00:03:50.170> that

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
something but so I have to fix that

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.080 
something but so I have to fix that
obviously<00:03:51.040> when<00:03:51.220> it's<00:03:51.250> finished<00:03:51.549> but<00:03:51.819> it

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
obviously when it's finished but it

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.050 
obviously when it's finished but it
works<00:03:52.299> so<00:03:52.870> much<00:03:52.930> better<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:54.519> can<00:03:54.700> tell<00:03:55.030> a

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
works so much better you can tell a

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.160 
works so much better you can tell a
difference<00:03:55.150> from<00:03:55.510> that<00:03:55.660> like<00:03:55.780> if<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.019> watch

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
difference from that like if you watch

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.650 
difference from that like if you watch
my<00:03:56.200> other<00:03:56.349> video<00:03:56.829> my<00:03:57.069> pvp<00:03:57.370> montage<00:03:57.670> it<00:03:58.269> doesn't

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
my other video my pvp montage it doesn't

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.809 
my other video my pvp montage it doesn't
show<00:03:58.900> enough<00:03:59.139> gameplay<00:03:59.560> but<00:03:59.769> I<00:04:00.010> have<00:04:00.670> another

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
show enough gameplay but I have another

show enough gameplay but I have another
previous<00:04:01.420> video<00:04:01.690> and<00:04:01.959> if<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:02.560> watch<00:04:02.859> that<00:04:03.099> one
