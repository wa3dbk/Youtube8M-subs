 poor security 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.660
 at two elektrogrills globen test hot 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.880
 broken glass through the air but there were 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.890
 also good devices in the test many 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.830
 Electric grills are better than your call 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.349
 a juicy steak in about seven 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.109
 minutes perfectly grilled with some 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.269
 Contact grills is that possible 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.730
 the testing institute has the time, among other things 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.610
 determines the devices need to 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.989
 a 25 centimeter thick steak on a 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.670
 core temperature of 85 degrees to bring 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.170
 well grilled, for example, has the 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.170
 tefal opti grill 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.799
 He works with automatic programs and 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.510
 even shows the cooking state 

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:53.390
 other than contact grills need 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.420
 Area grills with 17 to 22 minutes 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.519
 much longer for a steak 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.470
 uniformity of tanning is with 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.430
 help from toast bread divorced 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.080
 this device can convince less 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.299
 At two of the contact fungus is the 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.259
 grill area so severely limited 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.329
 Slightly roll down the sausages 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.979
 Buyers should also be careful

 the grill area is for cleaning 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.990
 can be removed 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.240
 many area grills have one today 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.909
 glass lid that ensures shorter 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.800
 times a serious shortage showed 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.750
 yourself in the safety checks at 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.680
 philips hd 63 60 and the severin pg 85 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.320
 27 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.590
 In the test becomes a defective thermostat 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.979
 this is simulated by the temperature controller 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.540
 is bridged by a test engineer 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.000
 then the grill as from the provider 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.130
 recommended with closed disc and

 maximum regulator setting heated up 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.869
 the glass pane is already heating up 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.479
 a few minutes so strong that at 2 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.920
 Test equipment shatters hot splinters 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.259
 fly through the room 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.240
 the built-in temperature fuse 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:07.840
 does not interrupt the power supply 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:09.459
 Everybody gets the verdict in time 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.790
 the grills of philips and 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.910
