00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.310 
just comes across as very very funny
where<00:01:48.150> we<00:01:48.240> do<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.690> dialogue<00:01:48.870> that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
where we do have the dialogue that

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.980 
where we do have the dialogue that
allows<00:01:49.620> us<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.160> have<00:01:50.340> proper<00:01:51.330> jokes<00:01:51.570> so

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
allows us to have proper jokes so

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.380 
allows us to have proper jokes so
there's<00:01:52.350> some<00:01:52.620> references<00:01:53.460> like<00:01:53.730> you<00:01:53.880> say<00:01:54.090> and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
there's some references like you say and

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.560 
there's some references like you say and
just<00:01:54.720> some<00:01:54.870> actual<00:01:55.590> jokes<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.390> might<00:01:57.390> go

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
just some actual jokes that might go

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.420 
just some actual jokes that might go
over<00:01:57.690> kids<00:01:57.990> heads<00:01:58.050> but<00:01:58.620> parents<00:01:59.070> will<00:01:59.220> get

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
over kids heads but parents will get

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.310 
over kids heads but parents will get
them<00:01:59.580> so<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.060> allows<00:02:00.300> us<00:02:00.480> to<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:00.990> of

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
them so that allows us to do this of

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.050 
them so that allows us to do this of
jewell<00:02:01.920> kheema<00:02:02.250> like<00:02:02.370> you<00:02:02.490> say<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.820> it's

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
jewell kheema like you say and it's

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.830 
jewell kheema like you say and it's
something<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.420> were<00:02:03.510> very

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
something that were very

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.540 
something that were very
well<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.049> lego<00:02:04.229> games<00:02:05.960> every<00:02:06.960> game<00:02:07.140> has<00:02:07.560> a

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
well in lego games every game has a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.790 
well in lego games every game has a
different<00:02:09.269> approach<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.929> but<00:02:10.379> where<00:02:10.619> we're

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
different approach to it but where we're

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.530 
different approach to it but where we're
working<00:02:10.920> with<00:02:11.190> Lego<00:02:11.519> is<00:02:12.239> in<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.420> relationship

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
working with Lego is in a relationship

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.150 
working with Lego is in a relationship
that<00:02:13.080> we've<00:02:13.200> built<00:02:13.319> up<00:02:13.530> over<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.860> number<00:02:13.920> of

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
that we've built up over a number of

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.089 
that we've built up over a number of
years<00:02:14.599> we<00:02:15.599> work<00:02:15.810> very<00:02:16.230> well<00:02:16.319> together<00:02:16.709> with

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
years we work very well together with

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.150 
years we work very well together with
Legos<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:17.780> approaching<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:18.930> game<00:02:19.230> with<00:02:19.830> them

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
Legos so approaching this game with them

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.780 
Legos so approaching this game with them
is<00:02:20.430> an<00:02:20.819> exciting<00:02:21.360> opportunity<00:02:21.660> because

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
is an exciting opportunity because

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.250 
is an exciting opportunity because
there's<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:24.030> lot<00:02:24.269> of<00:02:24.390> stuff<00:02:24.629> that<00:02:25.019> they're

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
there's a lot of stuff that they're

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.600 
there's a lot of stuff that they're
creating<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.890> we<00:02:25.980> want<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.190> get<00:02:26.340> into<00:02:26.459> this

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
creating that we want to get into this

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.289 
creating that we want to get into this
game<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:28.560> is<00:02:28.709> it<00:02:28.920> different<00:02:29.209> sort<00:02:30.209> of

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
game and it is it different sort of

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.420 
game and it is it different sort of
dynamic<00:02:31.200> where<00:02:31.500> it's<00:02:31.709> just<00:02:32.010> working<00:02:32.340> with

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
dynamic where it's just working with

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.270 
dynamic where it's just working with
Lego<00:02:32.959> but<00:02:33.959> it's<00:02:34.379> also<00:02:34.560> it's<00:02:34.890> just<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.129> great

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
Lego but it's also it's just a great
