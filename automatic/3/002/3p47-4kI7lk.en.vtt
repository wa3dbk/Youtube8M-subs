00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:13.560
You can either use cardstock or thinner paper. I would recommend thinner paper, because it´s easier to cut.

00:00:14.593 --> 00:00:19.373
What you´ll also need is a butterfly punch

00:00:19.373 --> 00:00:23.593
or you can cut out the butterfies manually.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.020
Therefore you´ll need to draw a template.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:35.160
You fold the paper and draw half of a butterfly.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.140
Then you cut it out.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.960
Now I use this as a template and I draw the edge onto my paper.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.840
Then you cut this out.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.140
You can repeat this in various forms.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:34.500
After cutting the butterflies you make a score line between wing and fuselage.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.280
So the wings are easier to fold.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.780
You do the same with the other buttterflies.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.600
Before attaching the butterflies onto the wall, I arranged them on the table. 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.140
At the beginning the distance between the butterflies is smaller and then it is getting bigger.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:53.780
You can attach the butterflies with Patafix, adhesive pads or simple sticky tape onto the wall.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.100
All in all I made about 100 butterflies.
