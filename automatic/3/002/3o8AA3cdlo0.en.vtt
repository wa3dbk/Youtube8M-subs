to<00:02:17.890> their<00:02:18.040> top<00:02:18.250> grade<00:02:18.549> and<00:02:18.909> it's<00:02:19.060> one<00:02:19.299> of

to their top grade and it's one of
slightly<00:02:20.620> lesser<00:02:20.950> grades<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.610> think<00:02:21.849> is

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
slightly lesser grades that I think is

interesting about this and this is the

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.819 
interesting about this and this is the
only<00:02:51.730> little<00:02:52.000> test<00:02:52.269> I've<00:02:52.510> done<00:02:52.810> just<00:02:53.530> kind<00:02:53.769> of

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
only little test I've done just kind of

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.430 
only little test I've done just kind of
a<00:02:53.980> watercolor<00:02:54.730> doodle<00:02:55.209> it<00:02:55.659> acts<00:02:56.079> almost

exactly<00:02:57.190> like<00:02:57.400> watercolor<00:02:58.030> paper<00:02:58.329> you<00:02:59.170> can<00:02:59.319> be

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
exactly like watercolor paper you can be

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.240 
exactly like watercolor paper you can be
wet<00:02:59.739> and<00:02:59.889> wet<00:03:00.040> washes<00:03:00.609> you<00:03:00.970> can<00:03:01.150> do<00:03:01.299> glazes<00:03:02.250> you

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
wet and wet washes you can do glazes you

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.460 
wet and wet washes you can do glazes you
can<00:03:03.489> lift<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.359> your<00:03:04.510> heart's<00:03:04.720> content<00:03:04.959> you<00:03:05.260> can

go in there and lift back to white and

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.509 
go in there and lift back to white and
not<00:03:07.870> damage<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:08.739> at<00:03:08.859> all<00:03:08.980> like<00:03:09.220> you<00:03:09.340> would

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
not damage it at all like you would

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.910 
not damage it at all like you would
paper<00:03:09.760> it's<00:03:10.359> actually<00:03:10.780> probably<00:03:11.349> a<00:03:11.590> pretty

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
paper it's actually probably a pretty

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.890 
paper it's actually probably a pretty
cool<00:03:12.159> thing<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.549> practice<00:03:12.730> on<00:03:13.209> if<00:03:13.540> you're<00:03:13.690> just

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
cool thing to practice on if you're just

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.500 
cool thing to practice on if you're just
getting<00:03:14.200> started<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.670> it's<00:03:15.909> neat<00:03:16.150> if<00:03:16.359> you

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
getting started and it's neat if you

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.960 
getting started and it's neat if you
perhaps<00:03:17.199> have<00:03:17.590> a<00:03:17.799> piece<00:03:18.609> that's<00:03:18.819> really

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
perhaps have a piece that's really

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.330 
perhaps have a piece that's really
special<00:03:19.690> maybe<00:03:19.930> your<00:03:20.290> portrait<00:03:20.799> or<00:03:20.919> something

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
special maybe your portrait or something

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.069 
special maybe your portrait or something
and<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:22.840> want<00:03:23.109> infinite<00:03:23.859> correct<00:03:24.370> ability

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
and you want infinite correct ability

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.360 
and you want infinite correct ability
but<00:03:26.079> you<00:03:26.260> want<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:26.680> look<00:03:26.799> like<00:03:27.069> a

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
but you want it to look like a

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.809 
but you want it to look like a
watercolor<00:03:28.090> this<00:03:28.599> is<00:03:28.810> really<00:03:29.769> cool<00:03:30.010> you<00:03:30.730> ought

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
watercolor this is really cool you ought

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.610 
watercolor this is really cool you ought
to<00:03:30.849> get<00:03:31.030> some<00:03:31.269> in<00:03:31.389> experiment<00:03:31.989> with<00:03:32.109> it<00:03:32.230> now

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
to get some in experiment with it now

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.849 
to get some in experiment with it now
practicing<00:03:33.370> for<00:03:33.609> the<00:03:33.699> sake<00:03:33.940> of<00:03:34.680> emulating<00:03:35.680> the

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
practicing for the sake of emulating the

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.800 
practicing for the sake of emulating the
paper<00:03:36.099> you<00:03:36.370> would<00:03:36.430> normally<00:03:36.879> use<00:03:37.150> let's<00:03:37.720> say

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
paper you would normally use let's say

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.479 
paper you would normally use let's say
if<00:03:37.959> you're<00:03:38.049> going<00:03:38.169> to<00:03:38.290> use<00:03:38.440> arch<00:03:38.650> 300-pound

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
if you're going to use arch 300-pound

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.300 
if you're going to use arch 300-pound
and<00:03:39.910> you<00:03:40.329> want<00:03:40.510> to<00:03:40.599> practice<00:03:40.870> on<00:03:41.230> that<00:03:41.440> it

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
and you want to practice on that it

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.210 
and you want to practice on that it
doesn't<00:03:42.819> act<00:03:43.030> exactly<00:03:43.629> the<00:03:43.989> same<00:03:44.260> so<00:03:44.799> you

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
doesn't act exactly the same so you

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.430 
doesn't act exactly the same so you
don't<00:03:45.549> want<00:03:45.699> to<00:03:45.760> use<00:03:45.970> it<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.419> practice<00:03:47.079> and

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
don't want to use it to practice and

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.619 
don't want to use it to practice and
emulate<00:03:48.129> a<00:03:48.340> paper<00:03:48.730> that<00:03:49.060> you<00:03:49.180> might<00:03:49.359> end<00:03:49.510> up

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
emulate a paper that you might end up

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.020 
emulate a paper that you might end up
using<00:03:50.010> but<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.129> can<00:03:51.310> practice<00:03:51.519> certain

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
using but you can practice certain

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.420 
using but you can practice certain
things<00:03:52.269> so<00:03:52.629> just<00:03:52.900> get<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:53.769> try<00:03:53.859> it<00:03:53.980> it's

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
things so just get it and try it it's

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.670 
things so just get it and try it it's
really<00:03:54.970> neat<00:03:55.299> this<00:03:55.690> is<00:03:55.750> my<00:03:56.049> triple<00:03:57.569> well<00:03:58.680> water

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
really neat this is my triple well water

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.039 
really neat this is my triple well water
bucket<00:04:00.489> and<00:04:00.669> I<00:04:01.209> like<00:04:01.419> this<00:04:01.599> this<00:04:01.780> is<00:04:01.900> really

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
bucket and I like this this is really

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:02.640 
bucket and I like this this is really
cool

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
cool

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.399 
cool
if<00:04:02.829> you<00:04:03.069> watercolor<00:04:03.639> you<00:04:03.909> want<00:04:04.419> at<00:04:04.569> least<00:04:04.629> two

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
if you watercolor you want at least two

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.890 
if you watercolor you want at least two
containers<00:04:05.829> of<00:04:05.980> water<00:04:06.299> one<00:04:07.299> so<00:04:07.510> that<00:04:07.659> you<00:04:07.780> can

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
containers of water one so that you can

containers of water one so that you can
wash<00:04:08.049> your<00:04:08.260> brush<00:04:08.500> out<00:04:08.709> in<00:04:08.979> and<00:04:09.190> one<00:04:09.340> that<00:04:09.489> you

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
wash your brush out in and one that you

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.460 
wash your brush out in and one that you
can<00:04:09.699> go<00:04:10.239> to<00:04:10.269> for<00:04:10.810> clean<00:04:11.019> water

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
can go to for clean water
