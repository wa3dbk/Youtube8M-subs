00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:07.779
 Hi, guys, I'm OtÃ¡vio, I'm putting together a 3D printer and in this third step I 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:17.219
 I just need to highlight these pieces of wood. I have here a map of who's who 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.620
 and they have some identification, 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:30.240
 but I'm going to write in the pieces who's who to make my life easier later. 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.000
 It says there on the site that it is only you to wear a stylus 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.170
 or something like that for a little bit here. 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160
 That's what I'm going to do. 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.300
 In fact, it's harder than it looks. 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.280
 There's a hole in my desk! 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.200
 Here we go! 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.880
 So folks, I ended up, almost, 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.280
 these are the parts after highlighted. 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.880
 I left the last one to show you the difficulty. 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.859
 The wood is very hard and the connection between them 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:54.079
 is firm, there is a large piece of wood left over. 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.880
 This is two pieces here and both are useful. 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.180
 You can not cut it anyway. 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.460
 because the other half you will enjoy too 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.620
 You have to come here with care and strength. 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.810
 This mixture of care and strength is that it's weird. 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:34.020
 And so the force, when you put it, you hurt your furniture. 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.279
 Did you see? You have to do a good deal of strength. 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:49.019
 because the wood resists enough. 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.700
 We cut all the pieces and, in the next step 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.909
 we already begin to fit into each other. 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.720
 Beauty? Let's go, then! Said!
