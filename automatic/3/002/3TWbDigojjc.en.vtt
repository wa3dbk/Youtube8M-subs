 we have here then the mix we're going 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.910
 to start making the vinaigrette that 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.410
 consists of the orange juice we have the 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.079
 ginger finally fix we have the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.000
 thyme here we are going to incorporate then 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.820
 the Orange juice 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.150
 we have already overcome with thyme 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.030
 I will incorporate then also here 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.610
 ginger 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.690
 let's incorporate the robot when it was 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.220
 a lime we incorporated about 10 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.409
 cubic centimeters what is a 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.350
 half teaspoon we will incorporate 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.570
 a little sugar what we're going to do 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.369
 is to incorporate slow pulp from the 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.159
 fruit indicated in this case the 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.840
 grenadine we will process the pulp a 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.970
 little to integrate with others 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.490
 ingredients 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.890
 how easy it is we know that here we have 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.930
 then the flavor mixture when we go 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.780
 to make a vinaigrette that passes part 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.700
 of taste we need true fat in 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.250
 this in this obviously at this time 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.210
 oil we are going to incorporate then the 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.390
 fat little by little and let's see how it goes 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:02.170
 changing ready because this is what is 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.540
 flame is an emulsion emulsions when 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.560
 the oil and the acid medium or the medium 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.620
 lithium begin to work they start to 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.390
 integrate in a wonderful way 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:16.510
 who says to me that this vinaigrette 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.240
 has the body of something I learn that a 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.800
 I like light as mayonnaise if 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.670
 I like it lighter where it is more 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.470
 compact 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.470
 I am choosing that we are going to prepare 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.590
 we have the mixture of the diet attacks here 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.180
 what are we going to do to mix the onion and 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.350
 It is what it is not doing anything yet you 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.739
 missing here we will continue then with 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:00.489
 the baby ears that we are going to incorporate 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:03.040
 also the fruits if they are observing 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.010
 changes through opas 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.610
 and that's what we 're missing out there 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.610
 dogmatics are given 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.580
 to Carlos 0 and we incorporate a 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.590
 little thyme 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.810
 this puts us a bit above because 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.500
 yes I will incorporate the salt and then 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.500
 I'm going to mix them 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.189
 and we're going to start mixing it 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:32.439
 mix with a spatula or a clamp 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:48.159
 or how I put favorite exile that 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:51.389
 are the hands and at the end 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.389
 we incorporated the vinaigrette 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.819
 if you add it is a protein like 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.280
 chicken can replace with a salad 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.010
 a meal I hope you liked it 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:15.049
