00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.790 
I just wanted to talk about a few things
I<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.970> wanted<00:01:54.330> to<00:01:54.390> say<00:01:54.480> a<00:01:54.659> few<00:01:54.840> reasons<00:01:55.260> why<00:01:55.680> I

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
I just wanted to say a few reasons why I

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.950 
I just wanted to say a few reasons why I
like<00:01:56.130> being<00:01:56.370> a<00:01:56.460> mark<00:01:56.610> representative<00:01:57.210> number

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
like being a mark representative number

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.810 
like being a mark representative number
one<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.470> that<00:01:58.650> you<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:59.070> be<00:01:59.190> financially

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
one is that you can be financially

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.300 
one is that you can be financially
completely<00:02:00.420> independent<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.800> is<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.159> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
completely independent so this is like a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.890 
completely independent so this is like a
totally<00:02:02.760> separate<00:02:03.030> business<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.720> have
