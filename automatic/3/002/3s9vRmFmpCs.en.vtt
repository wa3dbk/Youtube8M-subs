00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.690
 peggy 18 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.859
 then first of all I am 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.320
 particularly happy to have 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.390
 participated in the realization of this 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.710
 important video game I am a lot 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.140
 tied to splinter cell 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.759
 made me for the money and i am 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.379
 particularly attached to this 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.870
 character especially for all that 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:41.239
 that has been created around in the moment in 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.239
 which my voice was no longer simple 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.370
 the rest is not discussed 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.070
 there is also an important thing to say a 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.320
 level of how it works the most 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.989
 like a video game than for example 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.570
 to a traditional film we come into 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.489
 a dubbing room and the movie 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.559
 let's see we have the images in front 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.199
 to the screen those actors acting 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.180
 they move they do things things 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.009
 so we already have great ones 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.700
 suggestions regarding the 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.310
 video game 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.380
 we do not see the images 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.840
 we work on the frame they come to us from 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.630
 tract American journey these beats 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.850
 and we must stay within their times 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.590
 certainly it is not easy it is much more 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.590
 difficult to make a film 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.380
 will need cover from the top behind though 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.310
 to the splinter cell war machine 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.680
 but there is the man I like these 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.080
 characters so my friends identify 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.900
 a lot because loyalty has always done 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.240
 part of my life and splinter cell 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.520
 I find it as if I find courage again 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.170
 I have always been a brave man and 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.600
 I've always thrown my life over it 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.940
 always taken by the horns and the same 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.860
 what he does when he gets into action there 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.600
 puts the heart to the soul 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.759
 of course it's a war machine 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.180
 therefore often to act anyway with 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.160
 coolness with detachment from the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.670
 death I do not know if I would be able to 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.670
 do the same 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.940
 received 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.520
 then I want to give thanks 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.210
 special to all of you all those 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.670
 who followed me in the first ones 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.770
 splinter cell episodes and all of you that 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.570
 you will follow me now in this new one 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.540
 episode made me particularly 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.310
 nice to come back, I hope for later 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.740
 will be the same 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.950
 continue to follow us anyway on 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.830
 our official facebook and me page 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.090
 at this point I could perhaps give away a 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:52.130
 appointment to the fun day that day 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.130
 most likely we'll meet there 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.890
 few presidents have granted the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.480
 fifth freedom 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.680
 and the right to defend ours 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.940
 read by breaking them to protect the 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.840
 secrets stealing them 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.800
 to save lives by eliminating them 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.260
 some 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.490
 to do anything to protect the 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.540
 our country i am sam fisher i am a 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.540
 phantom cell
