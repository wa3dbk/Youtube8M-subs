that<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.360> work<00:01:06.660> with<00:01:06.960> are<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.530> captive

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
that you work with are a captive

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.430 
that you work with are a captive
audience<00:01:08.490> they<00:01:09.120> don't<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.810> place<00:01:10.170> to

audience they don't have a place to
escape<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.610> many<00:01:12.120> cases<00:01:12.630> you're<00:01:12.780> working

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
escape to in many cases you're working

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.040

with<00:01:13.350> animals<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.190> pen<00:01:14.630> therefore<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.870> can

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
with animals in a pen therefore you can

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.780 
with animals in a pen therefore you can
heighten<00:01:16.470> their<00:01:16.590> fear<00:01:16.890> response<00:01:17.340> very

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
heighten their fear response very

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.300 
heighten their fear response very
quickly<00:01:18.150> by<00:01:18.479> invading<00:01:18.930> their<00:01:19.290> flight<00:01:19.979> zone

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
quickly by invading their flight zone

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.359 
quickly by invading their flight zone
too<00:01:20.520> quickly<00:01:20.790> by<00:01:21.540> making<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.050> motion<00:01:22.920> z'<00:01:23.190> and

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
too quickly by making a motion z' and

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.050 
too quickly by making a motion z' and
movements<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.420> by<00:01:25.350> signaling<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.880> are

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
movements and by signaling that you are

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.090 
movements and by signaling that you are
in<00:01:27.210> fact<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.780> threat<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.380> those<00:01:28.530> animals<00:01:28.770> and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
in fact a threat to those animals and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.440 
in fact a threat to those animals and
they<00:01:29.220> need<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.490> understand<00:01:29.940> that<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.210> don't

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
they need to understand that you don't

with it it makes it for example
easier<00:02:00.120> for<00:02:00.360> us<00:02:00.510> to<00:02:00.720> move<00:02:00.900> animals

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
easier for us to move animals

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200 
easier for us to move animals
collectively<00:02:02.070> than<00:02:02.370> having<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.850> move<00:02:03.000> them

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
collectively than having to move them

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.180 
collectively than having to move them
alone<00:02:03.510> it's<00:02:04.200> really<00:02:04.560> an<00:02:04.650> important<00:02:05.070> principle

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190
