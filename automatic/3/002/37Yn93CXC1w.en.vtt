00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:18.599
 20 tuned especially well yes dynamo 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.160
 rival is not a simple champion wanted 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:24.560
 win very much and got today 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:28.730
 win everything turned out 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.039
 but won means it turned out great 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.809
 a little less all in Moscow at all 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.970
 a little bit 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:40.850
 but I think there is no difference today 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:43.160
 overdone and victory remained another 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.170
 why at a glance when it already seems to be 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.480
 on account everything was again I turned this 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.980
 episode with rude to the country of Dynamo 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.199
 removal to the end of the match, that is, it 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.600
 internal stress so splashed out 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.489
 I do not know just a struggle was for 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.400
 the whole game is just so clever 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.100
 that hitting your knees is nothing good 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.290
 it seems more or less everything is fine with me 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.750
 nothing is okay now but I think yes 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.119
 Well, why is it so important? 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.290
 happened here by the dynamo by 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.909
 whence such a surge of neighbors dynamo 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.860
 there was no desire for revenge 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.860
 partners on dag you score they revenge 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.780
 last 2 matches yes to love the form and 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.780
 their fans home Kirin 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:36.409
 crisis difficult our on prepare for 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.789
 games now let's go do you 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.880
 did not repent to train for more 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.710
 and our office will be nice to you not 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.020
 surprised that this particular goalkeeper from the first 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.640
 minutes behind them 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.619
 in the scope of the warranty is worth one she apparently 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.689
 such a decision the coaches took them a 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:57.340
 as far as our glance 2 on goalkeeper dynamo 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:59.819
