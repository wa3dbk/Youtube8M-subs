00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
it's got a one at the top and then you

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.960 
it's got a one at the top and then you
can<00:02:37.299> fill<00:02:37.569> out<00:02:37.750> over<00:02:38.079> and<00:02:38.319> there's<00:02:38.470> two<00:02:38.970> round

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
can fill out over and there's two round

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.660 
can fill out over and there's two round
number<00:02:40.209> two<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.930> that's<00:02:41.079> a<00:02:41.170> little<00:02:41.349> different

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
number two and that's a little different

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.360 
number two and that's a little different
what<00:02:42.670> we<00:02:42.700> have<00:02:42.879> in<00:02:42.970> round<00:02:43.150> two<00:02:43.360> well<00:02:44.319> into<00:02:44.980> if

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
what we have in round two well into if

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.940 
what we have in round two well into if
you<00:02:45.579> leave<00:02:46.060> these<00:02:46.390> dots<00:02:46.810> open<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.590> ones<00:02:47.769> with

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
you leave these dots open the ones with

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.520 
you leave these dots open the ones with
numbers<00:02:48.280> that's<00:02:49.090> how<00:02:49.299> many<00:02:49.480> points<00:02:49.780> you<00:02:49.989> get

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
numbers that's how many points you get

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.309 
numbers that's how many points you get
oh<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.799> get<00:02:50.980> bonus<00:02:51.459> points<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:52.120> like<00:02:52.870> it<00:02:53.049> so<00:02:53.200> you

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
oh you get bonus points I like it so you

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.229 
oh you get bonus points I like it so you
move<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.890> round<00:02:54.069> two<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.640> collect<00:02:55.030> points

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
move on to round two and collect points

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.199 
move on to round two and collect points
but<00:02:56.079> twist<00:02:56.829> on<00:02:57.069> it<00:02:57.099> is<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:57.489> once<00:02:57.819> you<00:02:57.939> slide

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
but twist on it is that once you slide

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.530 
but twist on it is that once you slide
this<00:02:58.480> down<00:02:58.590> yeah<00:02:59.590> and<00:03:00.280> then<00:03:00.640> you<00:03:00.819> got<00:03:01.000> this<00:03:01.269> one

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
this down yeah and then you got this one

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.180 
this down yeah and then you got this one
you<00:03:02.019> have<00:03:02.109> to<00:03:02.170> slide<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:02.620> down<00:03:02.650> from<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.159> top

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
you have to slide it down from the top

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.050 
you have to slide it down from the top
yeah

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
yeah

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.580 
yeah
and<00:03:04.150> at<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.420> last<00:03:04.599> second<00:03:05.019> you<00:03:05.109> can't<00:03:05.349> go<00:03:05.470> like

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
and at the last second you can't go like

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.559 
and at the last second you can't go like
this<00:03:05.769> so<00:03:06.220> you<00:03:06.340> can<00:03:06.549> slide<00:03:06.790> over<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.120> have<00:03:07.239> so

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
this so you can slide over you have so

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.289 
this so you can slide over you have so
that's<00:03:07.690> different<00:03:08.260> tip<00:03:08.470> 2<00:03:08.590> that<00:03:08.769> is<00:03:09.159> how<00:03:09.459> you

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
that's different tip 2 that is how you

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.119 
that's different tip 2 that is how you
and<00:03:10.510> lose<00:03:11.440> so<00:03:12.220> they<00:03:12.370> only<00:03:12.639> come<00:03:13.299> down<00:03:13.510> straight

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
and lose so they only come down straight

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.830 
and lose so they only come down straight
yeah<00:03:15.129> we<00:03:15.310> can't<00:03:15.579> slide<00:03:15.849> them<00:03:15.970> over<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:16.659> that's

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
yeah we can't slide them over so that's

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.030 
yeah we can't slide them over so that's
the<00:03:16.930> difference<00:03:17.079> but<00:03:17.379> that's<00:03:17.500> how<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:17.739> leave

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
the difference but that's how you leave

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.160 
the difference but that's how you leave
dots<00:03:18.310> open<00:03:18.760> and<00:03:18.970> try<00:03:19.599> to<00:03:19.659> leave<00:03:19.840> some<00:03:20.019> of<00:03:20.049> your

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
dots open and try to leave some of your

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.479 
dots open and try to leave some of your
bonus<00:03:20.470> all<00:03:20.650> right<00:03:20.769> so<00:03:20.889> that's<00:03:21.010> wrong<00:03:21.250> too

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
bonus all right so that's wrong too

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.360 
bonus all right so that's wrong too

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.850 
complex of thinking a lot of brainpower
trying<00:05:00.840> to<00:05:00.930> figure<00:05:01.170> how<00:05:01.260> you<00:05:01.320> want<00:05:01.590> a<00:05:01.650> piece

trying to figure how you want a piece

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.470 
trying to figure how you want a piece
you're<00:05:02.130> gonna<00:05:02.250> want<00:05:02.580> a<00:05:02.700> certain<00:05:02.970> piece<00:05:03.240> it's

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
you're gonna want a certain piece it's

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.670 
you're gonna want a certain piece it's
like<00:05:03.570> well<00:05:03.720> I<00:05:03.750> think<00:05:03.810> it's<00:05:04.140> like<00:05:04.230> this<00:05:04.500> piece

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
like well I think it's like this piece

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.680 
like well I think it's like this piece
that<00:05:04.860> would<00:05:04.980> be<00:05:05.070> perfect<00:05:05.490> and<00:05:06.000> then<00:05:06.420> you<00:05:06.510> flip

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
that would be perfect and then you flip

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.070 
that would be perfect and then you flip
over<00:05:06.840> the<00:05:06.990> card<00:05:07.260> and<00:05:08.000> it's<00:05:09.000> the<00:05:09.210> wrong<00:05:09.450> piece

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
over the card and it's the wrong piece

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.110 
over the card and it's the wrong piece
it's<00:05:10.380> like<00:05:10.500> God<00:05:10.710> dang<00:05:11.250> I<00:05:11.670> don't<00:05:11.910> want<00:05:12.030> that

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
it's like God dang I don't want that

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.040 
it's like God dang I don't want that
plus<00:05:12.390> so<00:05:12.980> do<00:05:13.980> you<00:05:14.100> have<00:05:14.280> to<00:05:14.430> use<00:05:14.580> every<00:05:14.850> piece

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
plus so do you have to use every piece

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.090 
plus so do you have to use every piece
no<00:05:16.610> but<00:05:17.610> you<00:05:17.670> have<00:05:17.820> to<00:05:18.060> think<00:05:18.090> of<00:05:18.540> that<00:05:18.720> like

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
no but you have to think of that like

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.240 
no but you have to think of that like
heart<00:05:20.120> because<00:05:21.230> if<00:05:22.230> you<00:05:22.470> don't<00:05:22.680> want<00:05:22.950> to<00:05:23.070> plate

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
heart because if you don't want to plate

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.130 
heart because if you don't want to plate
you<00:05:23.370> can<00:05:23.550> put<00:05:23.580> it<00:05:23.790> off<00:05:23.910> to<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.090> side<00:05:24.360> but<00:05:24.990> it's

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
you can put it off to the side but it's

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.820 
you can put it off to the side but it's
taking<00:05:25.470> your<00:05:25.620> chances<00:05:26.070> cuz<00:05:26.370> it's<00:05:26.550> a<00:05:26.970> higher
