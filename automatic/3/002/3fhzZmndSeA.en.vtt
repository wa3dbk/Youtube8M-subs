00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:14.600
 the tv host receiving the doctor here 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.100
 martyn bolzoni 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.630
 to talk a little bit about the 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.699
 James suffered during the goalkeeper 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.460
 training in the field of 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.650
 valentine's day flamengo here 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.200
 can you tell about thiago's injury and 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.800
 What is the procedure from now on? 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:36.079
 James fell in a bad way yesterday. 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.429
 sprain knee inflection and we did 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.609
 at night a resonance examination 

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:42.769
 magnetic response with eggs that 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:46.519
 found that an injury to the ligament 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:49.539
 that connects the fibula team to the next 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:52.819
 knee and also at an ankle level 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.829
 a moderate injury is not 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:58.940
 It is an injury that requires 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.309
 surgical treatment at first but it is 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.129
 it will certainly take some time for us 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.380
 we estimate at least 30 days until he 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.110
 can resume training 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.350
 normal and how and when it is decided whether 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.710
 need the surgical procedure or not 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:19.100
 We are going over that week to 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.280
 evaluate the evolution pain improvement 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.520
 the possible need for further examinations 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.549
 apparently from what I could see from the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.490
 yesterday's exam should not need to 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.320
 surgery but it's like a print 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.000
 initial we still have to wait for the 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:41.539
 the improvement of pain and through the 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 physical therapy and we can not 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.939
 that it is a definitive decision but 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.729
 it is more likely that 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.560
 need today, James stays here in 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.090
 bento gonçalves he returns to porto 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.179
 cheerful to perform treatment 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:00.590
 he stays and we have the structure 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:02.600
 all difficult therapy here and it's the like 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.090
 he is able to rest 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.640
 proper food treatment 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.429
 we have access to the hotel pool 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.260
 which also allows us in certain 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.280
 initial moment to this type of 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.800
 treatment 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.780
 then surely for him the best is 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.970
 stay 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.710
