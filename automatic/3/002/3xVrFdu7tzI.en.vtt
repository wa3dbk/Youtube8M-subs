 minecraft as you can see they have a channel 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.930
 pretty nicely decorated on every 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.930
 the video is pretty funny 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.779
 interesting picture and video about them not 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.550
 less interesting than their not and design 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.930

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.590
 link under the video in the description and we are expensive 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.930
 friends now dive into the mysterious 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.940
 the world of the game minekravt and I in this video 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.100
 I will tell you how you can pass 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.530
 virtually any parkour card in 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.430
 minecraft without attaching to this special 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.950
 effort 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.489
 Yes, of course you will have to make an effort 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.250
 they will not be as great as without knowledge 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.469
 this method to tell you right a way 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.510
 does not work on all servers but on 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.620
 the server on which you play I think it 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.049
 will work and the bottom line is that by 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.320
 the end of almost all parking pk 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.909
 some kind of reward usually awaits you 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.490
 on our server 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.520
 Here I am now on it in general 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.720
 the end of such big parkour cards we 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.939
 we can get a treasure chest with diamonds 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.580
 he will then start going through here again 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.640
 one parkour card and so on in general in 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.270
 the end will be a diamond box and I 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.670
 I think not to legs can walk now 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.439
 I'll show you how to do it much 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:43.020
 simpler yes that means let us imagine 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.450
 mind Mr. 0 and try to still get through 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.299
 this parkour card 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.430
 Well, how to show you the way in general the essence 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.159
 The way is that every time 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.979
 we must prescribe a grid on each 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.530
 with every jump successful we mean 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.439
 jump 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.490
 fine grid all home installed super 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.939
 so jump further did not work yes we 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.800
 go down 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.280
 prescribe polo 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:16.740
 and trying to jump again not again 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.350
 get attempt number three dachshunds 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.210
 calmer so everything is good no matter how I 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.420
 I love this job warcraft 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.640
 and if you love him you can 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.170
 use this method and mine 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.140
 this way on different servers 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.210
 diamonds I think on your server stage 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.290
 also at the end of parkour there is some 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:39.510
 reward yes like on my server 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.400
 Here are such things here in general if you 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.670
 it will be interesting to visit 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:49.100
 our server go through the parkour maps this 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:52.890
 cool snow yes these drove such 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.750
 way to pass parkour cards today 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.620
 showed hope you liked it and 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.540

 I repeat the volcano for the third time 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.360
 but it basically does not matter in the overall okay 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.120
