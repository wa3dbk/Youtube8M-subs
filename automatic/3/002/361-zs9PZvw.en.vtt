00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.480
 Hello Today I have for you a 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.700
 a fairy tale with fairy tales especially for 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.160
 children delicious as tip times 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.200
 I'll start with that, you get the carrots 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.440
 I took a bowl full of me 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.090
 believe the 500 grams cd in the background 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.130
 and that you sign the first and 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.289
 onions and garlic cut small 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.850
 then you have to grate the carrots that 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.439
 can make it easiest her 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.029
 in the kitchen machine if you do not have one 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.859
 Of course you also like that 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.120
 Of course, it takes a while to do it by hand 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.340
 Male is longer but does not do it roughly 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.520
 fine and if the carrot salad to three 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.860
 Of course, in an emergency, you too 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.290
 yes I have this rough variant 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.700
 that's exactly what mother does 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.850
 and that worked great 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.039
 They are beautiful gardeners when cooking then 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.260
 are you heating up the pan of sounds 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:59.160
 live a bit pure and very minced meat 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.930
 already very rough and then you can 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.199
 ever strong with salt and pepper 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.199
 season and then continue planning 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.030
 the minced meat is almost through now 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.460
 then you give the onions and the 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.689
 garlic to that you see it the 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.600
 Minced meat is allowed to have a few more 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:29.840
 have pink spots before you turn onions 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.729
 and garlic and then yes 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.880
 do you still get that festive that is 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.580
 is completely through and nothing is pink anymore 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.720
 then comes the vegetable broth I have 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.240
 just a bit with it 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.259
 I always take from maggi naturpur because 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.750
 the fact neither flavor enhancers 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.670
 still has yeast extract and really very 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.890
 Of course, then come the 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.679
 fairy tale and the rice I had 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.190
 now here two bags taken so 250 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:58.039
 km dry tear i had just going on 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.929
 stay there for sure then give her there 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.970
 read this with a liter of boiling 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.159
 I have water on here now 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.959
 made serious about things and poses 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.459
 Of course you only I always do that 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.940
 a little bit longer than on the 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.440
 packaging stands 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.610
 cover it at the beginning but at the end 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.859
 I would honestly say the lid 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.420
 leave out because the liquid too 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:21.019
 you have to evaporate otherwise you have afterwards 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.519
 a lot of soup is not 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.400
 to be poured away you see now 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.140
 Here it is much earlier, before it 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.750
 I have continued to connect to the medium 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.430
 Now two tablespoons of herbs fresh 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.390
 movies still under belongs simply one more 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.310
 little bit for your taste 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.810
 that gets a bit creamy 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.500
 now instead of a cream that was also the case 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.020
 a light herb cheese 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.790
 then you can now the rest 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.410
 liquid tournament the cream cheese good 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.060
 you can have housed the metal 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.670
 in the sauce binder a bit thick 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.500
 you do not have to dump it makes you 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.230
 Just boil over and over again 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.750
 until you like the consistency in the end 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.880
 Do you still add parsley to me? 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.250
 Unfortunately, there were only frozen ones 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.870
 but it also tastes delicious 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.110
 just before you set that up 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.660
 can build a bit and not 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.459
 please cook the meters she then ran 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.560
 can you serve I wish you 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.330
 Have a good appetite and have fun 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.620
 imitate if it tries to write 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.550
 me but how you've tasted me 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.440
 would be very happy 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.440
 the next video is good
