00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:12.960
 so presentation of the doha slq wp at 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.519
 vezoult that the brand to swiss to the 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.130
 very high-end white launched at 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.109
 some 4000 euros moreover this price 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.779
 there he embarks some technologies 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.510
 interesting ones including a heat pump 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.180
 used in conjunction with the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.890
 electrical resistance to heat 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.840
 water in a more economical way 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.750
 so we will not see her because he 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.950
 should dismount the hand to see 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.520
 this famous heat pump 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.809
 opposite in passing we are just going to present 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.570
 some small functions well 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.250
 friendly which a touch screen enough 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.680
 impressive we will roll 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.199
 and to do that we'll just close the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:55.170
 door so we come to the choice of 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.719
 program temperatures for a 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.210
 program basic knife vehicle did 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.530
 not deemed necessary in fact to put 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.630
 ahead of his other programs 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.970
 we will do it for the entry a little 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.240
 little other programs that offers 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.500
 here they are the challenge colors shirt wool 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:22.259
 hand wash feathers and textile duvets 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:26.070
 waterproof either under jeans 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.520
 to the wadis clean curtain and finally the two 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.020
 black washing machine last texti manual 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.549
 black which carla really for all 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.960
 likes 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.869
 normally any piece of 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.720
 garment can be washed with our friend 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.910
 we will leave 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.130
 our section can we all be stupid a game 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.650
 Here covered me I need 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.560
 temperatures of 30 everything is there in fact 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.930
 you change various little things the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.060
 spin speed here so that's going two 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.630
 no savages at all until 1600 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.110
 rpm 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.220
 in general on the white and 1400 laps 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:03.860
 what is the degree of soiling 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.800
 so among 4 if we showed very dirty we 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.090
 continued to lay out soaking 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.710
 we can select the duration of the 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.340
 Soaking so six hours of soaking 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.600
 can really go anyway 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.250
 that is, it's not too much 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:24.490
 fear to just normal we can choose 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:26.600
 the standard rinse levels up 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.610
 pau protection that took him off a lot 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.470
 of allergens to buy a lot of 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.610
 traces of laundry in the fibers 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.080
 textiles 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.060
 necessarily it concerns a little more 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.360
 of water and it lasts a little more 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.910
 long time 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.280
 let's admit once all this is done 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.570
 there is more than waiting for the 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.000
 machine will automatically launch 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.410
 we can set favorites have chosen a 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.140
 empty location we hear this lack on 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:52.820
 has already programmed in es6 by hayden 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:56.410
 what to do the third one takes it a 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.410
 temperature of 60 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.989
 change spin in 1600 rpm 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.930
 we will say that we have mites in 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.730
 we prevails in everything alone we will 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.489
 to make super a wise the super 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.890
 cleaning we'll say we have it like 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.439
 a little bit of washing and 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.950
 that it's belin beliet including that 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:18.519
 works 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.230
 he automatically adjusts the turns to 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.250
 the small house spin that is 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.670
 that's the case and I want to be a 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:30.040
 little bit more delicate we can adjust 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:32.889
 also the straightening drummer here who 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.180
 allows to uncrease to mix everything from 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:38.530
 pass them a little faster 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.650
 and when we're done all that we 've sinned 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.169
 in favorite normally we recorded 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.480
 the changes and here we have it our 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:49.629
 program 60 ° anti-mite mixture 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.969
 delicate 800 rpm blindfold 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.909
 touch is tilting 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:56.590
 it's very nice even when it's 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:58.540
 gives a little idea of ​​the quality of the 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.819
 product 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.569
 his case detergency case opens up widely 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.229
 and on a large amplitude men on 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.109
 can put it 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:08.829
 so it took the six ovens washing 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:12.760
 the softener the laundry for the 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:15.939
 prewash liquid or powder it welcomes 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.449
 both i will introduce you the 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:22.120
 losing drum would make 14000 the 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:26.340
 perforation while the washing machines 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.340
 traditional has 4000 in general 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.560
 Zug claims that it is to do better 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.500
 penetrate the 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.419
 detergent products mixed with water in 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.960
 textile fibers to make a small 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.450
 little faster 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.270
 it also helps a lot with peeling 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:45.110
 vapor last little thing the ferry 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.210
 drain well thought out actually when we 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.950
 do not open with a little difficulty 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:59.419
 here but a container that recovers in 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:05:01.910
 do the water of the drain like that one 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:06.710
 do not put it everywhere the container is 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:09.860
 adapted and can be removed very 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:13.430
 easily poverty water finally it's 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:16.669
 what we will find the system the 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.620
 unlocking the door since there is no 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.840
 button on the body of the device 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.810
 if you need to unlock the door 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.240
 we remove this little thing we 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.180
 slide in this little bitonio here we 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.620
 hold to our criticism 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.960
 the door is open on the run and of 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.960
 kids cats or something
