I<00:00:40.770> would<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.190> point<00:00:41.460> out<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.149> think

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
I would like to point out is I think

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.229 
I would like to point out is I think
like<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.840> actually<00:00:43.020> has<00:00:43.290> done<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> fantastic<00:00:43.710> job

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
like I actually has done a fantastic job

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.180 
like I actually has done a fantastic job
with<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.300> standard<00:00:46.079> version<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.559> bagging<00:00:47.039> I

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
with the standard version of bagging I

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.869 
with the standard version of bagging I
don't<00:00:47.430> think<00:00:47.550> there's<00:00:47.700> anything

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
don't think there's anything

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.220 
don't think there's anything
particularly<00:00:48.239> wrong<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.780> set<00:00:49.020> it's

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
particularly wrong with this set it's

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.020 
particularly wrong with this set it's
just<00:00:49.379> at<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> scene<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.860> wanted<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.399> display<00:00:50.700> I

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
just at the scene I wanted to display I

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.389 
just at the scene I wanted to display I
just<00:00:51.570> couldn't<00:00:51.840> do<00:00:51.960> based<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.949> size<00:00:53.160> that

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
just couldn't do based on the size that

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.369 
just couldn't do based on the size that
Lego<00:00:53.640> head<00:00:53.879> had<00:00:54.539> produced<00:00:54.809> with<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.140> Bag<00:00:55.350> End

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
Lego head had produced with this Bag End

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.470 
Lego head had produced with this Bag End
now<00:00:56.280> as<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.520> see<00:00:56.579> there's<00:00:56.820> quite<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.300> big

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
now as you can see there's quite a big

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.450 
now as you can see there's quite a big
external<00:00:58.050> difference<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.590> these<00:00:58.739> two<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.309> it

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
external difference to these two and it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.520 
external difference to these two and it
gets<00:00:59.640> even<00:00:59.760> bigger<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> inside<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.379> Bag

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
gets even bigger on the inside of Bag

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.630 
gets even bigger on the inside of Bag
End<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:01.859> we'll<00:01:01.980> get<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.460> bit

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
End but we'll get to that in a bit

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.160 
End but we'll get to that in a bit
the<00:01:02.879> biggest<00:01:03.059> thing<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.510> wanted<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.930> represent

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the biggest thing I wanted to represent

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.530 
the biggest thing I wanted to represent
is<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.619> Bag<00:01:05.040> End<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:06.240> know<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.420> been

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
tree significantly larger than what's

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.789 
tree significantly larger than what's
included<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.390> Lego<00:01:12.540> kit<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> other

included in the Lego kit and the other
thing<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.070> Bag<00:01:14.280> End<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.939> know<00:01:15.030> it's<00:01:15.150> got<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> lot

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
thing is Bag End you know it's got a lot

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.840 
thing is Bag End you know it's got a lot
of<00:01:15.450> shrubs<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.049> growth<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.400> top<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.729> it

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
of shrubs and growth on the top of it

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.880 
of shrubs and growth on the top of it
right<00:01:18.570> around<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.020> bilwa<00:01:19.290> has<00:01:19.439> quite<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> nice

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
right around it bilwa has quite a nice

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.039 
right around it bilwa has quite a nice
garden<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:20.939> didn't<00:01:21.210> think<00:01:21.299> Lego<00:01:21.600> included

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
garden and I didn't think Lego included

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.410 
garden and I didn't think Lego included
enough<00:01:22.430> foliage<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.700> greenery<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:24.090> really

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
enough foliage and greenery to really

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.359 
enough foliage and greenery to really
represent<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.049> I've<00:01:25.770> significantly

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
represent that so I've significantly

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.270 
represent that so I've significantly
increased<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.000> amount<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:28.040> flowers<00:01:29.040> and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
increased the amount of of flowers and

you probably tell it Bag End

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.960 
you probably tell it Bag End
my<00:03:08.389> bag<00:03:08.569> and<00:03:08.720> is<00:03:08.870> significantly<00:03:09.530> larger<00:03:10.040> and

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
my bag and is significantly larger and

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.220 
my bag and is significantly larger and
the<00:03:11.060> primary<00:03:11.389> way<00:03:11.450> I<00:03:11.569> did<00:03:11.810> that<00:03:11.930> was<00:03:12.049> by

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
the primary way I did that was by

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.930 
the primary way I did that was by
extending<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.739> in<00:03:12.889> this<00:03:13.010> region<00:03:13.459> here<00:03:13.639> you<00:03:13.790> can

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
extending it in this region here you can

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.439 
extending it in this region here you can
see<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:14.329> you've<00:03:14.450> got<00:03:14.659> one<00:03:15.470> two<00:03:15.709> three<00:03:15.739> four

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:16.449 
see that you've got one two three four

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:19.750 
see that you've got one two three four
bricks<00:03:17.449> they're<00:03:17.690> wide<00:03:18.440> whereas<00:03:19.430> if<00:03:19.519> I<00:03:19.609> just

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
bricks they're wide whereas if I just

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.659 
bricks they're wide whereas if I just
bring<00:03:19.940> across<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.480> original<00:03:21.470> version<00:03:21.829> you

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
bring across the original version you

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.189 
bring across the original version you
can<00:03:22.790> see<00:03:22.940> this<00:03:23.090> one<00:03:23.329> there's<00:03:23.599> just<00:03:23.780> one<00:03:23.959> brick

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199 
can see this one there's just one brick

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.809 
can see this one there's just one brick
there<00:03:24.410> so<00:03:24.980> that's<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.280> primary<00:03:25.549> way<00:03:25.699> I

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
there so that's the primary way I

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.390 
there so that's the primary way I
extended<00:03:26.569> the<00:03:26.959> Bag<00:03:27.139> End<00:03:27.169> to<00:03:27.769> accommodate<00:03:28.220> the

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
extended the Bag End to accommodate the

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.610 
extended the Bag End to accommodate the
twelve<00:03:28.730> dwarves<00:03:29.150> on<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.329> inside<00:03:29.629> now<00:03:30.349> for<00:03:30.560> the

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
twelve dwarves on the inside now for the

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.409 
twelve dwarves on the inside now for the
main<00:03:30.739> event<00:03:30.889> itself<00:03:31.400> if<00:03:31.730> I<00:03:31.940> turn<00:03:32.150> this<00:03:32.299> around

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:32.419 
main event itself if I turn this around

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:37.569 
main event itself if I turn this around
and<00:03:32.720> we<00:03:32.840> go<00:03:32.959> inside<00:03:33.169> back<00:03:33.590> end<00:03:35.530> this<00:03:36.530> is<00:03:37.340> where

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
and we go inside back end this is where

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.280 
and we go inside back end this is where
it's<00:03:37.730> all<00:03:37.879> happening<00:03:38.030> you<00:03:38.629> can<00:03:38.780> see<00:03:38.959> it<00:03:39.139> looks

including all sorts of food some of the
primary<00:04:18.560> things<00:04:19.070> I<00:04:19.400> added<00:04:19.760> which<00:04:19.940> I<00:04:20.030> really

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
primary things I added which I really

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:20.879 
primary things I added which I really
liked

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
liked

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:25.029 
liked
are<00:04:21.889> these<00:04:22.039> turkeys<00:04:23.590> which<00:04:24.590> actually<00:04:24.889> have

are these turkeys which actually have
removable<00:04:25.490> legs<00:04:25.880> I<00:04:26.120> thought

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
removable legs I thought

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.480 
removable legs I thought
quite<00:04:27.080> classic<00:04:27.470> and<00:04:27.650> that'd<00:04:27.770> be<00:04:28.250> something

quite classic and that'd be something

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.860 
quite classic and that'd be something
you'd<00:04:28.760> probably<00:04:28.880> expect<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.390> see<00:04:29.600> in<00:04:29.780> this

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870
