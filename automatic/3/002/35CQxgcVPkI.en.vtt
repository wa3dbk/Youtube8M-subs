player and so if the object that is
colliding<00:01:08.820> with<00:01:09.450> object<00:01:10.229> player<00:01:10.439> then

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
colliding with object player then

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.820 
colliding with object player then
destroy<00:01:11.460> yourself<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.510> that's<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.650> for

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
destroy yourself and that's it for

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.380 
destroy yourself and that's it for

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
object that now for the object drug I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.410 
object that now for the object drug I
called<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.320> not<00:01:19.650> sure<00:01:19.680> why<00:01:20.420> so

called it like that not sure why so

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.880 
called it like that not sure why so
object<00:01:22.020> drag<00:01:22.560> said<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.490> sprite<00:01:24.350> sprite<00:01:25.350> drag

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
object drag said it sprite sprite drag

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.170 
object drag said it sprite sprite drag
and<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> collision<00:01:29.040> with<00:01:29.220> player<00:01:29.549> so

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and to the collision with player so

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.390 
and to the collision with player so
collision<00:01:30.930> object<00:01:31.409> player<00:01:32.600> say<00:01:34.400> destroy

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
collision object player say destroy

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.109 
collision object player say destroy
yourself<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.299> go<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.110> control<00:01:37.710> coat<00:01:38.159> now<00:01:39.090> I

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
yourself and go to control coat now I

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.440 
yourself and go to control coat now I
should<00:01:39.540> increase<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.439> font<00:01:40.740> actually<00:01:41.450> like

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
should increase the font actually like

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.719 
should increase the font actually like
this<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:44.340> if<00:01:45.890> we're<00:01:46.890> colliding<00:01:47.310> with<00:01:47.490> player

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
this so if we're colliding with player

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.760 
this so if we're colliding with player
then<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.420> object<00:01:49.079> player<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.460> also<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.329> so

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
then with object player do also this so

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.899 
then with object player do also this so
cover<00:01:52.770> up<00:01:53.399> equals<00:01:54.329> one<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.189> alarm<00:01:56.189> zero

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
cover up equals one and alarm zero

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.999 
cover up equals one and alarm zero
that's<00:01:57.119> why<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.659> made<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.079> alarm<00:01:58.469> in<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> last

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
that's why we made the alarm in the last

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.590 
that's why we made the alarm in the last
part<00:01:59.570> so<00:02:00.570> 300<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.469> 300<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.399> actually<00:02:02.909> and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
part so 300 and 300 this is actually and

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
not sure how many seconds

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.510 
not sure how many seconds
it's<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.720> lot<00:02:06.870> seconds<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:08.040> yeah<00:02:08.790> yes<00:02:09.270> for<00:02:09.660> that

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
and we're down with the object drug now

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.650 
and we're down with the object drug now
let's<00:02:16.350> make<00:02:16.530> object<00:02:17.070> control<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:18.000> create

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
let's make object control so create

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.740 
let's make object control so create
object<00:02:19.820> object<00:02:20.820> whoops

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
object object whoops

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.050 
object object whoops
object<00:02:22.320> cunt<00:02:24.350> control<00:02:25.350> did<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:26.700> does<00:02:26.880> not

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
object cunt control did this does not

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.190 
object cunt control did this does not
need<00:02:27.270> sprite<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:28.170> let's<00:02:29.130> just<00:02:29.340> do<00:02:30.110> let<00:02:31.110> me

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
need sprite and let's just do let me

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.700 
need sprite and let's just do let me
check

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
check

this will be respawn if player kills any
ghosts<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:42.960> R<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.650> stands<00:02:44.550> for<00:02:44.790> random<00:02:45.000> equals

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
ghosts so R and stands for random equals

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.710 
ghosts so R and stands for random equals
choose<00:02:46.260> one<00:02:46.650> or<00:02:47.040> two<00:02:47.510> all<00:02:48.510> right

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
choose one or two all right

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:57.400 
choose one or two all right
and<00:02:49.820> if<00:02:50.820> R<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.780> equals<00:02:52.650> 1<00:02:53.550> then<00:02:54.180> X<00:02:55.170> x<00:02:55.650> equals

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
and if R and equals 1 then X x equals

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.380 
and if R and equals 1 then X x equals
172<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.740> why<00:02:59.550> diamond<00:03:00.330> why<00:03:00.480> y<00:03:00.690> equals<00:03:02.390> 288

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
172 and why diamond why y equals 288

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.920 
172 and why diamond why y equals 288
this<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.050> spawn<00:03:04.710> position<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:06.510> let's<00:03:06.540> copy

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
this is the spawn position so let's copy

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:07.780 
this is the spawn position so let's copy
that

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
that

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.030 
that
so<00:03:08.790> if<00:03:09.030> friend<00:03:09.360> equals<00:03:09.840> 2<00:03:10.080> then<00:03:10.410> this<00:03:10.800> is<00:03:10.860> the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
so if friend equals 2 then this is the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:18.040 
so if friend equals 2 then this is the
second<00:03:11.430> spawn<00:03:11.700> position<00:03:12.300> so<00:03:12.900> 4<00:03:13.740> is<00:03:14.070> 64<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:16.970> 192

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
second spawn position so 4 is 64 and 192

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:25.460 
second spawn position so 4 is 64 and 192
and<00:03:19.940> then<00:03:20.940> instance<00:03:22.220> create<00:03:23.220> at<00:03:23.840> position<00:03:24.840> X<00:03:25.110> x

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
and then instance create at position X x

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.310 
and then instance create at position X x
and<00:03:25.709> y<00:03:25.890> y<00:03:26.130> object<00:03:26.910> enemy<00:03:27.660> which<00:03:27.959> we<00:03:28.140> did<00:03:28.290> not

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
and y y object enemy which we did not

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.320 
and y y object enemy which we did not
immediate<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.160> say<00:03:29.880> if<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.660> this<00:03:31.050> checks<00:03:31.320> if

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
immediate and say if so this checks if

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.960 
immediate and say if so this checks if
the<00:03:33.330> other<00:03:33.860> we<00:03:34.860> will<00:03:35.010> have<00:03:35.130> two<00:03:35.310> enemies<00:03:35.670> and

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
the other we will have two enemies and

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.440 
the other we will have two enemies and
if<00:03:36.120> one<00:03:36.390> is<00:03:36.600> missing<00:03:36.900> then<00:03:37.290> this<00:03:37.530> will<00:03:38.450> start

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
if one is missing then this will start

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.420 
if one is missing then this will start
the<00:03:39.570> alarm<00:03:40.200> again<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:40.830> it<00:03:40.950> was<00:03:41.130> spawned

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
the alarm again and it was spawned

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
the alarm again and it was spawned
another<00:03:41.670> one<00:03:42.120> so<00:03:42.510> if<00:03:43.820> instance<00:03:44.820> number

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
another one so if instance number

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.080 
another one so if instance number
discounts<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.560> number<00:03:46.920> of<00:03:47.040> instances<00:03:47.489> in<00:03:47.940> the

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
discounts the number of instances in the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.690 
discounts the number of instances in the
room<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:49.650> object<00:03:50.580> enemy

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.870 

equals<00:03:55.270> one<00:03:55.510> Oh<00:03:55.780> boyyyy<00:03:56.260> I<00:03:56.410> did<00:03:56.860> right<00:03:57.490> I'm<00:03:57.670> not
