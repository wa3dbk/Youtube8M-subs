00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
you're going to need a very fine detail

00:00:47.360 --> 00:01:15.480

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.610 

if<00:01:16.490> your<00:01:16.760> neon<00:01:17.060> acrylic<00:01:17.690> paints<00:01:18.080> are<00:01:18.260> too

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
if your neon acrylic paints are too

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.920 
if your neon acrylic paints are too
transparent<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.550> might<00:01:19.760> want<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.150> apply<00:01:20.780> two

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
coats just make sure that you wait in

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.470 
coats just make sure that you wait in
between<00:01:24.680> applications<00:01:24.970> for<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.150> acrylic

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
between applications for the acrylic

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.900 
between applications for the acrylic
paint<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:27.020> dry<00:01:27.260> and<00:01:28.010> you<00:01:28.130> want<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.430> make<00:01:28.610> the

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
paint to dry and you want to make the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.060 
paint to dry and you want to make the
lines<00:01:29.180> somewhat<00:01:29.930> thick<00:01:30.380> you<00:01:30.710> don't<00:01:30.860> want<00:01:30.980> to

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
lines somewhat thick you don't want to

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.820 
lines somewhat thick you don't want to
make<00:01:31.220> them<00:01:31.400> too<00:01:31.730> thin<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.330> I<00:01:33.320> will<00:01:33.560> show<00:01:33.740> you

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
make them too thin and I will show you

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:47.260 
make them too thin and I will show you
guys<00:01:33.890> why<00:01:34.370> that<00:01:34.850> is<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.330> little<00:01:36.050> bit<00:01:36.170> later<00:01:36.350> on

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.440 

so<00:01:48.110> this<00:01:48.650> is<00:01:48.860> basically<00:01:49.460> what<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:49.909> want<00:01:50.299> to

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
so this is basically what you want to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.600 
so this is basically what you want to
achieve<00:01:50.680> which<00:01:51.680> is<00:01:51.710> sort<00:01:52.040> of<00:01:52.100> like<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:52.310> rainbow

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
achieve which is sort of like a rainbow

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.410 
achieve which is sort of like a rainbow
effect<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:53.810> next<00:01:54.560> what<00:01:54.680> I'm<00:01:54.740> gonna<00:01:54.920> do<00:01:55.189> is<00:01:55.520> I'm

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
effect and next what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.260 
effect and next what I'm gonna do is I'm
going<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:56.720> use<00:01:56.840> my<00:01:56.990> very<00:01:57.259> fine<00:01:57.530> detail<00:01:57.890> brush

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
going to use my very fine detail brush

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.420 
going to use my very fine detail brush
along<00:01:59.270> with<00:01:59.509> some<00:01:59.720> black<00:01:59.960> acrylic<00:02:00.170> paint<00:02:00.530> now

what I'm gonna do is outline all of
these<00:02:03.409> little<00:02:03.860> loops<00:02:04.570> that<00:02:05.570> I<00:02:05.600> just<00:02:05.990> made<00:02:06.380> and

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
these little loops that I just made and

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.580
