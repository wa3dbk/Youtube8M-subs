00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.020 
everywhere I found my boots but here's
an<00:02:11.970> example<00:02:12.269> what<00:02:12.569> they<00:02:12.689> look<00:02:12.870> like<00:02:14.030> pretty

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
an example what they look like pretty

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.729 
an example what they look like pretty
small<00:02:15.299> their<00:02:15.480> camera<00:02:15.780> batteries<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:16.439> they're

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
small their camera batteries so they're

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.199 
small their camera batteries so they're
there<00:02:17.010> they<00:02:17.250> might<00:02:17.370> be<00:02:17.519> a<00:02:17.549> bit<00:02:17.730> hard<00:02:17.909> to<00:02:17.970> find

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
there they might be a bit hard to find

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.760 
there they might be a bit hard to find
actually<00:02:18.689> took<00:02:19.349> me<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.560> little<00:02:19.739> little<00:02:20.400> while

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
actually took me a little little while

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.680 
actually took me a little little while
but<00:02:22.770> anyways<00:02:23.130> I'm<00:02:23.580> going<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.150> put<00:02:24.390> these<00:02:24.510> in

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
but anyways I'm going to put these in

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.720 
but anyways I'm going to put these in
here<00:02:24.840> real<00:02:25.020> quick<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.530> think<00:02:26.340> they<00:02:26.459> go<00:02:26.640> like

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
here real quick I think they go like

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.680 
here real quick I think they go like
this

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
this

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.600
