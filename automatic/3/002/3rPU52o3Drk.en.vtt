allows for extra health for both the
flood<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.789> humans<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.239> takes<00:01:03.359> multiple

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
type as you can see so you you have very

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.530 
type as you can see so you you have very
limited<00:01:14.159> ammo<00:01:14.520> because<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> start<00:01:15.240> off<00:01:15.360> with

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
limited ammo because you start off with

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.600 
limited ammo because you start off with
an<00:01:15.630> assault<00:01:15.960> rifle<00:01:16.020> but<00:01:16.890> by<00:01:17.040> going<00:01:17.220> around<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
an assault rifle but by going around the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.310 
an assault rifle but by going around the
map<00:01:17.790> you'll<00:01:18.000> rapidly<00:01:18.509> begin<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.869> find<00:01:19.080> other

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
map you'll rapidly begin to find other

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
everything seemed pretty even we never

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.570 
everything seemed pretty even we never
actually<00:04:22.349> had<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.620> humans<00:04:23.039> make<00:04:23.220> it<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.490> the

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
actually had the humans make it to the

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.930 
actually had the humans make it to the

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
end I they got pretty close

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.300 
end I they got pretty close
two<00:04:26.090> occasions<00:04:26.570> I<00:04:26.690> believe<00:04:26.960> but<00:04:27.260> most<00:04:28.100> of<00:04:28.250> the

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
two occasions I believe but most of the

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.860 
two occasions I believe but most of the
time<00:04:28.490> it<00:04:28.640> ended<00:04:28.850> up<00:04:28.940> just<00:04:29.000> being<00:04:29.240> kind<00:04:29.750> of<00:04:29.780> a

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
time it ended up just being kind of a

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.560 
time it ended up just being kind of a
massacre<00:04:30.290> fest<00:04:30.560> so<00:04:30.740> as<00:04:31.400> you<00:04:31.610> saw<00:04:31.760> here<00:04:32.000> I<00:04:32.030> lost

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
massacre fest so as you saw here I lost

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.080 
massacre fest so as you saw here I lost
my<00:04:33.050> ammo<00:04:33.530> but<00:04:33.710> I<00:04:33.740> was<00:04:33.950> luckily<00:04:34.160> saved<00:04:34.640> by<00:04:34.940> my

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
my ammo but I was luckily saved by my

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.190 
my ammo but I was luckily saved by my
teammate<00:04:35.450> who<00:04:35.630> did<00:04:35.930> an<00:04:36.020> awesome

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
teammate who did an awesome

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.400 
teammate who did an awesome
assassination<00:04:37.010> on<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:37.190> flood<00:04:37.430> and<00:04:38.170> up<00:04:39.170> here

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
assassination on the flood and up here

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.110
