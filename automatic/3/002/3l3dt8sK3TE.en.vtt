friends and stuff like that so if that
is<00:01:36.390> an<00:01:36.630> option<00:01:36.750> maybe<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.200> do<00:01:37.350> want<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.590> see

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
is an option maybe you do want to see

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.530 
is an option maybe you do want to see
ranked<00:01:37.950> games<00:01:38.220> here<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.610> there<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.970> could<00:01:39.420> do

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
ranked games here and there I could do

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.870 
ranked games here and there I could do
that<00:01:40.070> but<00:01:41.070> other<00:01:41.250> than<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.549> think<00:01:41.670> like

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
that but other than that I think like

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.280 
that but other than that I think like
pack<00:01:42.119> openings<00:01:42.540> looking<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:42.899> Barry<00:01:43.079> and

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
pack openings looking for Barry and

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.740 
pack openings looking for Barry and
Jerry<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.740> could<00:01:44.159> do<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.280> consistently<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.210> I

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
Jerry I could do that consistently and I

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.999 
Jerry I could do that consistently and I
could<00:01:45.869> do<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.049> pack<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.380> play<00:01:46.439> consistently

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
could do this pack and play consistently

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.050 
could do this pack and play consistently
so<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.189> think<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.520> what<00:01:47.790> i'll<00:01:47.880> be<00:01:47.909> doing

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
so I think this is what i'll be doing

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.289 
so I think this is what i'll be doing
for<00:01:48.990> now<00:01:49.259> until<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.560> remainder<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.090> madden<00:01:51.090> 25

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
for now until the remainder of madden 25

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.969 
for now until the remainder of madden 25
which<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:52.079> have<00:01:52.170> about<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.350> month<00:01:52.590> we<00:01:52.860> have

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
which is we have about a month we have

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.639 
which is we have about a month we have
almost<00:01:53.479> exactly<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.570> month<00:01:54.810> until<00:01:55.140> madden<00:01:55.500> 15

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
almost exactly a month until madden 15

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.920 
almost exactly a month until madden 15
comes<00:01:56.100> out<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.490> i'm<00:01:57.090> really<00:01:57.299> looking<00:01:57.509> forward

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
ideas and stuff are very very fruitful i

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.870 
ideas and stuff are very very fruitful i

I<00:02:47.170> think<00:02:47.470> I'm<00:02:47.710> just<00:02:47.830> going<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:47.980> go<00:02:48.070> ahead<00:02:48.160> and

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
I think I'm just going to go ahead and

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.770 
I think I'm just going to go ahead and
use<00:02:48.490> whatever<00:02:48.700> playbook<00:02:49.150> I<00:02:49.270> want<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.510> use<00:02:49.600> in

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
use whatever playbook I want to use in

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.840 
use whatever playbook I want to use in
jerseys<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.320> stadium<00:02:51.250> which<00:02:51.460> whatever<00:02:51.760> is

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
jerseys and stadium which whatever is

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.440 
jerseys and stadium which whatever is
visually<00:02:52.270> appealing<00:02:52.540> for<00:02:52.960> videos<00:02:53.350> uh<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:55.360> as

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
visually appealing for videos uh so as

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.640 
visually appealing for videos uh so as
you<00:02:55.570> can<00:02:55.660> see<00:02:55.840> our<00:02:55.960> first<00:02:56.110> quarterback<00:02:56.530> I

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
you can see our first quarterback I

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.990 
you can see our first quarterback I
think<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.040> was<00:02:57.130> our<00:02:57.160> first<00:02:57.370> quarterback<00:02:57.640> Eli

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.930 
think that was our first quarterback Eli

coverage<00:03:18.190> I<00:03:18.400> know<00:03:18.550> most<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:19.120> my<00:03:19.209> players<00:03:19.450> in<00:03:19.810> my

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
coverage I know most of my players in my

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.440 
coverage I know most of my players in my
previous<00:03:20.530> packing<00:03:20.950> play<00:03:21.190> we're<00:03:21.790> very<00:03:21.820> slow<00:03:22.420> i

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
previous packing play we're very slow i

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.330 
previous packing play we're very slow i
think<00:03:22.750> i<00:03:22.810> had<00:03:23.020> um<00:03:24.540> Morris<00:03:25.540> Claiborne<00:03:25.720> and<00:03:26.440> I

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
think i had um Morris Claiborne and I

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.830 
think i had um Morris Claiborne and I
had<00:03:27.489> Tommy<00:03:27.730> Campbell<00:03:28.030> which<00:03:28.300> was<00:03:28.480> decently

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
had Tommy Campbell which was decently

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.900 
had Tommy Campbell which was decently
fast<00:03:29.020> 93<00:03:29.620> speed<00:03:29.860> but<00:03:30.070> his<00:03:30.220> man<00:03:30.459> coverage<00:03:30.820> is

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
fast 93 speed but his man coverage is

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.560 
fast 93 speed but his man coverage is
like<00:03:31.060> 60<00:03:31.800> then<00:03:32.800> I<00:03:32.830> had<00:03:33.010> like<00:03:33.270> rodney<00:03:34.270> mcleod

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
like 60 then I had like rodney mcleod

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.840 
like 60 then I had like rodney mcleod
bronze<00:03:35.140> guard<00:03:35.470> with<00:03:35.650> like<00:03:35.680> 80<00:03:35.980> to<00:03:36.220> speed<00:03:36.580> and

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
bronze guard with like 80 to speed and

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.580 
bronze guard with like 80 to speed and
safety<00:03:37.060> so<00:03:37.390> it<00:03:37.570> was<00:03:37.660> just<00:03:37.690> kind<00:03:37.840> of<00:03:38.200> hard<00:03:38.350> if<00:03:38.530> I

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
safety so it was just kind of hard if I

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.350 
safety so it was just kind of hard if I
got<00:03:38.770> you<00:03:39.400> know<00:03:39.489> thrown<00:03:39.730> on<00:03:39.850> deep<00:03:40.030> I<00:03:40.150> was<00:03:40.270> gonna

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
fumbling way too much so I definitely

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.160 
fumbling way too much so I definitely
have<00:03:52.090> get<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.300> better<00:03:52.420> running<00:03:52.630> back<00:03:52.840> as<00:03:52.989> well

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599 
I'm trying to say is by if I win by one

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:24.480 
I'm trying to say is by if I win by one
score<00:06:22.870> open<00:06:23.110> up<00:06:23.199> one<00:06:23.440> two<00:06:23.800> scores<00:06:24.099> are<00:06:24.250> open<00:06:24.400> up

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
score open up one two scores are open up

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.420 
score open up one two scores are open up
to<00:06:24.669> three<00:06:25.000> scores<00:06:25.240> open<00:06:25.479> up<00:06:25.860> 344<00:06:26.860> you<00:06:27.039> know<00:06:27.160> 55

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
to three scores open up 344 you know 55

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.730 
to three scores open up 344 you know 55
just<00:06:28.120> stuff<00:06:28.389> like<00:06:28.449> that<00:06:28.539> I<00:06:28.930> think<00:06:29.380> that's<00:06:29.560> how

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
just stuff like that I think that's how

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.710 
just stuff like that I think that's how
I<00:06:29.770> should<00:06:29.919> do<00:06:30.130> it<00:06:30.280> to<00:06:30.520> ensure<00:06:31.000> that<00:06:31.210> I<00:06:31.330> get<00:06:31.389> some

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
I should do it to ensure that I get some

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.960 
I should do it to ensure that I get some
better<00:06:31.840> players<00:06:32.199> with<00:06:33.039> each<00:06:33.280> victory<00:06:33.669> that<00:06:33.940> I

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
better players with each victory that I

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.719 
better players with each victory that I
get<00:06:34.270> and<00:06:35.169> then<00:06:35.530> you<00:06:35.919> know<00:06:36.039> move<00:06:36.219> on<00:06:36.310> from<00:06:36.490> there

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:36.729 
get and then you know move on from there

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.310 
get and then you know move on from there
so<00:06:37.180> I<00:06:37.210> think<00:06:37.330> that<00:06:37.599> was<00:06:37.719> the<00:06:37.750> pack<00:06:37.960> opening

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
so I think that was the pack opening

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.930 
so I think that was the pack opening
right<00:06:38.409> here<00:06:38.469> in<00:06:38.680> my<00:06:38.800> next<00:06:39.070> video<00:06:39.370> will<00:06:39.580> be<00:06:39.700> the
