00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:14.919
 we sing the DVD 2011 a little bit different than last year 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.929
 But her latest biotechnology news magazine de 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.089
 with the following topics 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.009
 we offer Smith the picture sequences of neurodegenerative diseases 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.439
 the chemical industry is going for biotechnology 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.970
 Bruns Interview Food manufacturers do not do enough research 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.970
 be set up as his one 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.770
 About 700,000 people are currently affected in Germany alone 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.500
 At the molecular level for the disease that more and more nerve cells in the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.080
 Brain die 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.900
 It took medication to slow down this process but not start it 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.500
 Scientists from Bonn now want a very special therapeutic approach 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.550
 develop 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.160
 Mice Binder Dr 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.410
 for Sybille Kraus is the current everyday life 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.440
 Thanks to the small rodents, the researchers at the German center for 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.750
 neurodegenerative diseases 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.230
 a possible therapy for Alzheimer's on the track 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.600
 the Bonn want to use the drug metformin but so far only 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.100
 Diabetes patient is prescribed 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.100
 It has been known for some time that there is a connection between 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.450
 Alzheimer's and diabetes patients who have diabetes have an elevated rate 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.460
 Risk of Alzheimer's disease 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.350
 and miss a drug that is used in diabetes 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.290
 and therefore at the thought leap from having given them to Alzheimer's 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.490
 Using Metformin to believe the researchers would get a particular enzyme 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.430
 called the p2 off 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.420
 this in turn acts on a special protein is the so-called top rotate 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.749
 Deaf routine 

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:02.459
 For alzheimer's patients it is a reason for this in the brain in large numbers 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:04.140
 Nerve cells die off 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.930
 in that case the proteins are greatly changed 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.050
 These changes are to learn at the Parkhotel in Antwerp and one 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.050
 New start has missed that are so far from an almost over 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.650
 and that's 7 PP 2 items per team the procedure 2a that can almost ride since then 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.239
 on 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.119
 first off of the 15 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:27.909
 the researchers already know the diabetes remedy metformin works on even 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:28.860
 this enzyme 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.699
 it would be considered as well as in Alzheimer's 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:35.009
 So far, it has only been unclear how the drug will look exactly 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:36.410
 to find out 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.410
 were treated with metformin after the cells of mice 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.689
 we actually thought that Metformin indirectly got on the dance there 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.559
 but surprisingly show that it has a direct effect on the 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:47.819
 Has enzyme activity 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.309
 With this result in hand, the researchers now want a brand new one 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:54.599
 Develop a treatment approach for Alzheimer's 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.939
 only then it is that is a drug that has been on for a long time 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.019
 the market of diabetes patients on the weekend will disappear 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.329
 and the hope is that if the protest can show that metformin 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.999
 It can also act against Alzheimer's that step then on from the drug 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:11.029
 to prescribe as weapons are no longer so far 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:14.859
 Nevertheless, it will take a few more years before patients get rid of the idea of 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.029
 Bonn researchers can benefit 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:20.599
 Now, even in Alzheimer's diseased mice, the desired effect 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.879
 be detected 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.549
 This technology is changing our lives and shaping our future 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.030
 but very few people know 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.600
 the policy-based principles since the Middle Ages 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.239
 Place more 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.999
 an internet page of the clinic sets its chemistry in dialogue impressed therefore 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:40.749
 all 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:43.749
 who like to go on a time travel in the art 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.659
 Since time immemorial, bacteria or yeasts help in preserving us 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.680
 Practical procedures are still an integral part of many cultures today 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:01.249
 everyone can track on their - Fini points II is based on a timeline 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:05.999
 For example, when man has learned to make Keser or WASP 

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:07.719
 To use enzymes 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:11.639
 The survey is part of a campaign by the chemical industry and will be in favor of it 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.609
 how biotechnology will secure our standard of living in the future 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:23.080
 Ambitions in supermarket shelves are mostly free because we are used to it 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.020
 Again and again, new packaging appears 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.460
 real innovations, on the other hand, are very rare 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.129
 "Thus, the food sector gives away important potential 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:36.129
 says Hannelore Daniel from the CDU Munich 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.240
 Traders go into what problem led to a study on 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.620
 to carry out the food sector 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.009
 The food sector is facing a major challenge 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.789
 growing world population who wants to be fed at the same time though 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.840
 also for sophisticated society in addition to new products of managers 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.050
 to supply other manufacturing processes 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.380
 and at the same time the question how it set up Germany compared to his 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.379
 European or global competitors 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.050
 that was the reason for dealing with this study 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:15.189
 Now what is the result of this study, there are obvious 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:16.319
 grievances 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.710
 and the abuses in Germany are essentially due to the fact that 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.960
 the German food industry 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.580
 To see extremely small and medium-sized companies is little 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.949
 Innovation potential at 4 1 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:31.749
 and not the big challenges of the future in our view 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:34.499
 is adequately prepared 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:38.219
 What are your demands now based on the study? 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:42.550
 the demand the honor that Mercury's kidneys are decorated everything that is 

00:05:42.549 --> 00:05:46.299
 means both the industry and the Argentines and the 

00:05:46.299 --> 00:05:47.749
 appropriate driver 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:51.959
 A clearer responsibility is also being taken for this sector 

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:56.949
 To bring about future orientation and that means infrastructure form the 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:01.449
 Communication about all involved groups Industrial partners line 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:03.569
 Reinforce rounders 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:07.930
 and perhaps also in this field of research substantial new ones 

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:11.549
 Development thanks a lot to thank for their execution 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.300
 we hope that new one of us technology TV has pleased them and 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.949
 However, the Cretaceous missed he simplified a look in our video 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:27.150
 Portal ab we technology de and there are then new issues Bergrheinfeld 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.150
 Have fun browsing and see you next time
