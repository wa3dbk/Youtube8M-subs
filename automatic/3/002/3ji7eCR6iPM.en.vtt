2<00:01:55.680> 3<00:01:55.860> hours<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.549> means<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.909> added<00:01:57.060> too<00:01:57.509> much

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
2 3 hours that means you added too much

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.300 
2 3 hours that means you added too much
water<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.409> do<00:01:58.619> not<00:01:58.680> add<00:01:58.860> too<00:01:59.040> much<00:01:59.130> water

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
water so do not add too much water

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.639 
water so do not add too much water
because<00:01:59.610> when<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.390> make<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.780> batter<00:02:01.020> you

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
because when you make this batter you

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.230 
because when you make this batter you
want<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.009> batter<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.340> be<00:02:02.520> slightly<00:02:02.850> thicker

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
want the batter to be slightly thicker

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.179 
want the batter to be slightly thicker
not<00:02:03.659> like<00:02:03.899> those<00:02:04.140> are<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> little<00:02:05.009> bit

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
not like those are but a little bit

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.160 
not like those are but a little bit
coarse<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.729> thicker<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.570> know<00:02:06.689> put<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.020> in

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
coarse and thicker you know put this in

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.779 
coarse and thicker you know put this in
a<00:02:07.229> blender<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.740> make<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.129> into<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> coarse

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
a blender and make this into a coarse

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.270 
a blender and make this into a coarse
paste<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:10.289> know<00:02:10.379> look<00:02:10.530> at<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.800> how<00:02:10.979> grainy

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
paste you know look at this how grainy

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.940 
paste you know look at this how grainy
it<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:12.120> do<00:02:12.270> not<00:02:12.330> want<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.810> be<00:02:12.840> fine

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
it is you do not want it to be fine

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.250 
it is you do not want it to be fine
you<00:02:14.130> are<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.310> won't<00:02:14.610> be<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:15.000> good<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:15.780> look<00:02:16.140> at

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
you are I won't be that good so look at

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.110 
you are I won't be that good so look at
this<00:02:16.380> structure<00:02:16.819> once<00:02:17.819> again<00:02:18.090> nice<00:02:18.690> grainy

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
this structure once again nice grainy

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.449 
this structure once again nice grainy
now<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.870> know<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.080> battery<00:02:22.319> is<00:02:22.530> already<00:02:22.950> let

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
now you know the battery is already let

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.460 
now you know the battery is already let
us<00:02:23.580> go<00:02:23.730> ahead<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:23.940> learn<00:02:24.209> how<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.750> spread<00:02:25.260> this

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
us go ahead and learn how to spread this

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.740 
us go ahead and learn how to spread this
awry<00:02:25.830> our<00:02:26.310> eye<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.670> usually<00:02:27.090> slightly<00:02:27.330> thicker

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
awry our eye is usually slightly thicker

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.680 
awry our eye is usually slightly thicker
but<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.500> thing<00:02:28.709> is<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:29.550> fun<00:02:29.849> part<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.270> making

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
but the thing is the fun part is making

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.960 
but the thing is the fun part is making
holes<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.470> know<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.520> am<00:02:32.730> going<00:02:32.880> to

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
holes you know in this I am going to

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.610 
holes you know in this I am going to
make<00:02:33.150> little<00:02:33.480> holes<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.840> want<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.080> see<00:02:34.200> how

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
make little holes you want to see how

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.140 
make little holes you want to see how
many<00:02:34.800> holes<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.250> why<00:02:35.400> we<00:02:35.610> do<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:35.880> many<00:02:36.030> holes

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
many holes and why we do so many holes

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.100 
many holes and why we do so many holes
okay

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
okay

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.690 
okay
now<00:02:37.530> take<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.580> batter<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.650> just<00:02:40.650> pour<00:02:41.519> this

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
now take the batter and just pour this

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.100 
now take the batter and just pour this
batter<00:02:42.180> on<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:42.959> hot<00:02:43.530> tawa<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:45.110> usually

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
batter on the hot tawa and usually

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.110 
batter on the hot tawa and usually
traditionally<00:02:46.890> what<00:02:47.069> they<00:02:47.220> used<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.459> do<00:02:47.550> there

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
traditionally what they used to do there

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.180 
traditionally what they used to do there
is<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.300> take<00:02:48.480> some<00:02:48.690> water<00:02:48.900> wet<00:02:49.680> their<00:02:49.860> hands

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
is to take some water wet their hands

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.940 
is to take some water wet their hands
and<00:02:50.310> then<00:02:50.819> spread<00:02:51.569> this<00:02:51.780> batter<00:02:52.019> onto<00:02:52.769> the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
and then spread this batter onto the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.930 
and then spread this batter onto the
tava<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.150> then<00:02:54.750> just<00:02:55.470> spread<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.160> into<00:02:56.850> the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
tava and then just spread this into the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.090 
tava and then just spread this into the
thickness<00:02:57.299> you<00:02:57.330> want<00:02:57.540> some<00:02:58.440> people<00:02:58.709> like<00:02:58.920> it<00:02:59.069> a

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
thickness you want some people like it a

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.830 
thickness you want some people like it a
little<00:02:59.220> bit<00:02:59.400> thicker<00:02:59.640> some<00:03:00.000> people<00:03:00.299> not<00:03:00.540> so

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
little bit thicker some people not so

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.460 
little bit thicker some people not so
but<00:03:01.440> basic<00:03:02.280> thickness<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:02.910> much<00:03:03.090> now<00:03:03.569> for

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
but basic thickness is this much now for

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.100 
but basic thickness is this much now for
this<00:03:04.620> we<00:03:05.130> are<00:03:05.190> going<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.370> make<00:03:05.519> holes<00:03:06.110> usually

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
this we are going to make holes usually

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.920 
this we are going to make holes usually
they<00:03:07.470> make<00:03:07.650> either<00:03:08.160> one<00:03:08.370> hole<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:09.569> can<00:03:09.750> make

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
they make either one hole you can make

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.350 
they make either one hole you can make
one<00:03:10.230> hole<00:03:10.470> three<00:03:10.799> holes<00:03:11.040> files<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:11.850> don't<00:03:12.299> know

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
one hole three holes files I don't know

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.940 
one hole three holes files I don't know
what<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.660> this<00:03:12.780> obsession<00:03:13.019> of<00:03:13.350> making<00:03:13.769> this

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
what is this obsession of making this

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.070 
what is this obsession of making this
number<00:03:14.819> of<00:03:14.940> holes<00:03:15.150> they<00:03:15.330> never<00:03:15.510> make<00:03:15.720> two<00:03:15.930> and

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
number of holes they never make two and

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.340 
number of holes they never make two and
four<00:03:16.319> never<00:03:16.890> even<00:03:17.190> odd<00:03:17.489> numbers<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:18.140> one<00:03:19.140> hole

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
four never even odd numbers so one hole

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.009 
four never even odd numbers so one hole
is<00:03:19.500> already<00:03:19.859> ready<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:21.209> next<00:03:21.540> two<00:03:21.840> holes

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
is already ready and the next two holes

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.190 
is already ready and the next two holes
I<00:03:22.320> am<00:03:22.950> going<00:03:23.100> to<00:03:23.190> make<00:03:23.310> here<00:03:23.640> make<00:03:24.540> here<00:03:24.959> and

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
I am going to make here make here and

I am going to make here make here and
next<00:03:26.070> two<00:03:26.220> holes<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.790> will<00:03:27.510> make<00:03:27.720> here<00:03:28.079> and

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
next two holes you will make here and

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.699 
next two holes you will make here and
make<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.400> see<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.600> more<00:03:30.810> crispier<00:03:31.320> you<00:03:31.470> want

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
make you see the more crispier you want

make you see the more crispier you want
the<00:03:32.010> more<00:03:32.220> holes<00:03:32.519> you<00:03:32.730> make<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.510> way<00:03:33.720> you

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
the more holes you make that way you

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.580 
the more holes you make that way you
enjoy<00:03:34.200> your<00:03:34.650> life<00:03:34.859> even<00:03:35.250> better<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.760> now<00:03:36.590> add

enjoy your life even better and now add

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.060 
enjoy your life even better and now add
oil<00:03:38.549> under<00:03:38.940> this<00:03:39.230> because<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.440> like<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:40.890> little

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
oil under this because I like it little

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.099 
oil under this because I like it little
crispier<00:03:41.549> I<00:03:41.730> am<00:03:42.060> going<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.329> add<00:03:42.450> little<00:03:42.660> extra

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
crispier I am going to add little extra

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.190 
crispier I am going to add little extra
oil<00:03:43.340> this<00:03:44.340> should<00:03:44.549> be<00:03:44.700> good<00:03:44.910> enough<00:03:44.940> now<00:03:45.810> we

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
oil this should be good enough now we

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.930 
oil this should be good enough now we
want<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.620> batter<00:03:46.829> to<00:03:47.010> cook<00:03:47.370> because<00:03:47.579> this<00:03:47.880> is

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
want the batter to cook because this is

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.310 
want the batter to cook because this is
not<00:03:48.030> like<00:03:48.239> those<00:03:48.420> are<00:03:48.630> not<00:03:48.810> thin<00:03:49.109> batter

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
not like those are not thin batter

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.610 
not like those are not thin batter
slightly<00:03:50.190> thicker<00:03:50.489> so<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:51.299> can<00:03:51.660> put<00:03:52.109> a<00:03:52.140> lid<00:03:52.590> on

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
slightly thicker so you can put a lid on

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.670 
slightly thicker so you can put a lid on
it<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:53.329> just<00:03:54.329> a<00:03:54.540> transparent<00:03:55.140> one<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:55.530> that

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
it and just a transparent one so that

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.170 
it and just a transparent one so that
you<00:03:55.769> can<00:03:55.920> see<00:03:56.100> what<00:03:56.370> is<00:03:56.489> happening<00:03:56.850> in<00:03:57.030> there

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
you can see what is happening in there

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.300 
you can see what is happening in there
and<00:03:57.420> we<00:03:58.380> are<00:03:58.440> going<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.650> let<00:03:58.799> it<00:03:58.829> cook<00:03:59.130> on<00:03:59.250> a

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
and we are going to let it cook on a

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.150 
and we are going to let it cook on a
slow<00:03:59.609> flame<00:03:59.730> and<00:04:00.150> the<00:04:00.480> putting<00:04:01.170> this<00:04:01.500> lid<00:04:02.010> on

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
slow flame and the putting this lid on

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.800 
slow flame and the putting this lid on
top<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.430> cooking<00:04:02.970> is<00:04:03.120> also<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.450> technique

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
top and cooking is also a technique

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.319 
top and cooking is also a technique
because<00:04:04.200> you<00:04:04.950> do<00:04:05.160> not<00:04:05.220> want<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.640> moisture<00:04:05.910> to

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
because you do not want the moisture to

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.449 
because you do not want the moisture to
escape<00:04:06.450> right<00:04:06.900> away<00:04:06.959> you<00:04:07.709> want<00:04:07.980> this<00:04:08.130> ri<00:04:08.370> to

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
escape right away you want this ri to

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.370 
escape right away you want this ri to
cook<00:04:08.760> nice<00:04:08.910> at<00:04:09.359> the<00:04:09.540> same<00:04:09.810> time<00:04:10.049> you<00:04:10.200> do<00:04:10.350> not

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
cook nice at the same time you do not

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.160 
cook nice at the same time you do not
want<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.739> to<00:04:10.859> burn<00:04:11.130> very<00:04:11.519> fast<00:04:11.819> see<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.840> slow

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
want it to burn very fast see the slow

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.039 
want it to burn very fast see the slow
browning<00:04:13.650> gives<00:04:13.920> even<00:04:14.370> coloring<00:04:14.760> so<00:04:15.359> when<00:04:15.930> you

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
browning gives even coloring so when you

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.199 
browning gives even coloring so when you
put<00:04:16.350> a<00:04:16.650> lid<00:04:16.859> like<00:04:17.039> this<00:04:17.100> it<00:04:17.760> will<00:04:17.880> create<00:04:18.060> a

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
put a lid like this it will create a

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.629 
put a lid like this it will create a
kind<00:04:18.539> of<00:04:18.630> a<00:04:18.750> pressure<00:04:18.959> there<00:04:19.289> and<00:04:19.440> cook<00:04:20.070> but

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
kind of a pressure there and cook but

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.600 
kind of a pressure there and cook but
after<00:04:21.419> one<00:04:21.750> or<00:04:21.780> two<00:04:22.080> minutes<00:04:22.349> of<00:04:22.500> cooking<00:04:23.130> we

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
after one or two minutes of cooking we

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.490 
after one or two minutes of cooking we
are<00:04:23.640> going<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:23.940> remove<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.330> lid<00:04:24.539> off<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:24.900> we

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
are going to remove the lid off and we

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.580 
are going to remove the lid off and we
are<00:04:25.560> going<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.740> let<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:26.039> moisture<00:04:26.220> evaporate

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
are going to let the moisture evaporate

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.230
