00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
their feet they do not get rid of heat

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.250 
their feet they do not get rid of heat
the<00:00:54.120> same<00:00:54.329> way<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.050> really

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the same way we do so it's really

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.720 
the same way we do so it's really
important<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:55.949> might<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.250> warm<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
important it might be warm and

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.639 
important it might be warm and
uncomfortable<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.420> car<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:57.660> us<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.530> it's

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
uncomfortable in the car for us but it's

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.349 
uncomfortable in the car for us but it's
potentially<00:00:59.250> deadly<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> car<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
potentially deadly in the car for the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.270 
potentially deadly in the car for the
dog<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.379> thing<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.559> really<00:01:01.800> do<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.100> to

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280
