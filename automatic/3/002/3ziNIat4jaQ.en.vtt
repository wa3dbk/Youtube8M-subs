00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.619 
throw new servos in it and put a motor
on<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.900> it's<00:00:34.350> going<00:00:34.589> out<00:00:34.710> flying<00:00:35.629> alright

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
on it and it's going out flying alright

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.990 
on it and it's going out flying alright
we're<00:00:36.809> looking<00:00:37.110> at<00:00:37.199> the<00:00:37.320> mini<00:00:37.500> Piper<00:00:37.800> Cub<00:00:38.190> it's

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
we're looking at the mini Piper Cub it's

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.340 
we're looking at the mini Piper Cub it's
a<00:00:40.070> 25<00:00:41.150> motor<00:00:42.150> max<00:00:42.570> plane<00:00:43.019> but<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.500> got<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:44.420> 460<00:00:45.420> s

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
a 25 motor max plane but we got a 460 s

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.759 
a 25 motor max plane but we got a 460 s
ax<00:00:48.530> motor<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.030> is<00:00:51.030> huge<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.989> comparison<00:00:52.049> to

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
ax motor on it is huge in comparison to

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.609 
ax motor on it is huge in comparison to
the<00:00:52.830> plane<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.519> I<00:00:53.790> think<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:55.049> should<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.409> enough

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:55.619 
the plane so I think it should be enough

00:00:55.619 --> 00:01:00.880 
the plane so I think it should be enough
to<00:00:55.799> get<00:00:55.920> her<00:00:56.010> off<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:56.220> ground<00:00:56.610> will<00:00:57.330> soon<00:00:57.809> see
