00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.630
 hello friends welcome once more to 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.180
 full 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.100
 your preferred channel your channel of trust 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.299
 my name is cam and the sweet one of them 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:17.600
 I bring another video of my routines 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.730
 in this case behind the scenes accomplices 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.460
 as you can see here I am doing this 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.369
 exercise that I find very good this 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.009
 is behind the neck is similar to doing 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.869
 a christ but for people who 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.579
 they still have a facility to make 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.280
 cristos I recommend you a lot this 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.290
 exercise this one knows Christ but without 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.200
 But something about this exercise because I 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.150
 it seems very very good here my friend jairo 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.800
 he is also doing it he can a 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.890
 little more weight he already has a lot more 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.890
 experience 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.780
 as a whip, try to do the 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.329
 clean movement when I refer 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.640
 clean i mean slow 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.710
 they can lower the bar faster but 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.960
 upload it they have to do it much more 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.050
 slow 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.020
 I'm from the rowing service and I like it 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.180
 do it with the strings I think it's 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.170
 very good exercise you have to try 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:16.850
 always keep the straight high 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.460
 many people carry the ropes up to a 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.170
 little below the ceiling I treat it from 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.890
 bring almost stuck to the legs 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.540
 from his bottle that was very good 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.540
 there friend is a variation 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.440
 I like this machine more because without 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.780
 However the same movement can do 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.010
 any two will work for you 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.200
 muscle 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.200
 I'm going to see if that is what I recommend 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.840
 as always I have always told you 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.840
 of doing the fourth muscular exercise in 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.840
 the small muscle 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.030
 and standard eight to two repetitions 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.429
 this exercise even because it seemed like 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.789
 first but he tried to do it 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:09.060
 in front of the head he took it to the 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:11.509
 breast good secret of the chest or a 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.509
 shortly before 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.170
 yes I also made three rounds today all 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.170
 those repetitions 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.080
 the following exercise is a bit 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.130
 difficult to take the position in which 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.069
 you have to iron your knees a little 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.260
 keep your back straight catch the bar 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.850
 a little closed good to put it more 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
 open 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.209
 once sleep in the east position 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.120
 exercise will realize that it is very 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.670
 good for the back, always this 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.770
 try to do it with little weight here 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:54.400
 we chose 32 kilos 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.400
 that would be little more than 66 books 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.890
 here my friend did this exercise is not 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.450
 the same but he likes to do this as 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.450
 can see have the cables crossed 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.330
 also use that since it's a 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.220
 exercise to do the movement well 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.220
 not to do multiple 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.990
 and with this exercise that I do 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:24.090
 back 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:26.580
 and we take the action of shredding 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.959
 for trichet as I told three 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:33.390
 exercises more since always in the 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.940
 week we work roof and in fact 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.680
 did not use and on the day that 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.750
 endorse work also tells you then 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.040
 I think the muscle is enough 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.040
 he has to rest always 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.610
 remember in that always keep the 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.500
 Straight back 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.500
 that will make them work more sad 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:07.750
 in this next exercise 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:10.650
 it's like some parallels with help is very 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.069
 good to super sad but normally 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:18.419
 those to work or to heat 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.419
 and after water this 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.840
 very good exercise I put them quite 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.160
 that's why I'm here working 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.330
 hard 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.330
 I also 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.500
 as always keep your back straight 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.500
 let the thigh work better 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:45.829
 the best advice I can give you is 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:47.619
 and the gymnastics traction a week do 

00:04:45.829 --> 00:04:53.490
 the routines that I am teaching you 

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:55.889
 read the gym maximum 22 hours 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.169
 and let rest to improve the muscle 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.180
 grows when you are resting not when 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.690
 you're in the gym when you're on 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.729
 ignacio longÃ¡s is to destroy the tissues 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.949
 so that when you feed and rest 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.270
 the muscle tissues regenerate and 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:12.910
 become more serious 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.410
 that's why the muscle thanks so 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:20.610
 that my recommendation is rest 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.610
 I do not recommend that 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:26.300
 and good with this culminates the routine of the 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.449
 Sep 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.009
 I hope you liked it please
