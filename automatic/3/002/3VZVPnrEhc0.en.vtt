the card that makes noble knights as an
art<00:00:33.890> type<00:00:34.130> or<00:00:34.430> I<00:00:34.760> mean<00:00:34.970> if<00:00:35.240> Merlin<00:00:35.630> fails

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
art type or I mean if Merlin fails

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.110 
art type or I mean if Merlin fails
they're<00:00:36.140> basically<00:00:36.470> just<00:00:36.560> going<00:00:37.040> to<00:00:37.250> plummet

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
and to their best and never speak of

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.340 
and to their best and never speak of
them<00:00:40.040> again<00:00:40.130> and<00:00:40.640> I<00:00:41.390> mean<00:00:41.570> I<00:00:41.600> looked<00:00:41.870> at<00:00:41.990> merlin

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
them again and I mean I looked at merlin

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.350 
them again and I mean I looked at merlin
I'm<00:00:42.500> like<00:00:42.710> I<00:00:42.860> was<00:00:43.220> pleasantly<00:00:43.730> surprised<00:00:44.150> I

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
I'm like I was pleasantly surprised I

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.330 
I'm like I was pleasantly surprised I
was<00:00:44.510> really<00:00:44.810> hoping<00:00:45.020> that<00:00:45.710> this<00:00:45.890> would<00:00:46.010> be<00:00:46.070> one

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
was really hoping that this would be one

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.800 
was really hoping that this would be one
of<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:46.490> cards<00:00:46.880> that<00:00:46.940> was<00:00:47.329> kind<00:00:47.600> of<00:00:47.630> like<00:00:47.750> a

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
of the cards that was kind of like a

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.290 
of the cards that was kind of like a
catalyst<00:00:48.380> for<00:00:48.440> them<00:00:48.680> to<00:00:48.920> kind<00:00:49.490> of<00:00:49.640> rise<00:00:49.820> up<00:00:50.120> in

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
catalyst for them to kind of rise up in

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.300 
catalyst for them to kind of rise up in
a<00:00:50.420> competitive<00:00:50.750> game<00:00:51.110> and<00:00:51.470> I<00:00:51.590> think<00:00:51.980> it<00:00:52.130> has

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
a competitive game and I think it has

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.490 
a competitive game and I think it has
the<00:00:52.340> potential<00:00:52.790> so<00:00:53.120> anyways<00:00:53.420> Merlin<00:00:54.290> is<00:00:54.440> a

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
the potential so anyways Merlin is a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.550 
the potential so anyways Merlin is a
dark<00:00:54.980> spell<00:00:55.400> caster<00:00:55.880> level<00:00:56.060> 3<00:00:56.450> 1400<00:00:57.260> attack

dark spell caster level 3 1400 attack
500<00:00:58.250> defense<00:00:58.340> the<00:00:58.730> stats<00:00:58.970> are<00:00:59.239> actually

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
500 defense the stats are actually

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.840 
500 defense the stats are actually
pretty<00:01:00.380> respectable<00:01:00.920> for<00:01:01.220> level<00:01:01.460> 3<00:01:01.640> the

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
pretty respectable for level 3 the

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.140 
pretty respectable for level 3 the
effect<00:01:02.780> says<00:01:03.020> you<00:01:03.260> can<00:01:03.440> only<00:01:03.649> use<00:01:03.890> each<00:01:04.430> effect

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150

thing I thought about when i read Merlin

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.280 
thing I thought about when i read Merlin
was<00:01:37.760> bullshit<00:01:38.510> it<00:01:38.630> looks<00:01:38.810> like<00:01:38.990> no<00:01:39.140> one

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
was bullshit it looks like no one

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:40.600 
was bullshit it looks like no one
night's<00:01:39.440> got<00:01:39.619> themselves<00:01:39.799> alone<00:01:40.340> for<00:01:40.549> our

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
night's got themselves alone for our

night's got themselves alone for our
blossom<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.210> obviously<00:01:41.780> that's<00:01:41.960> because<00:01:42.290> the

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
blossom and obviously that's because the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.530 
blossom and obviously that's because the
effect<00:01:42.740> is<00:01:42.890> very<00:01:43.070> similar<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:43.640> I<00:01:44.060> think<00:01:44.390> that

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
effect is very similar and I think that

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.330 
effect is very similar and I think that
this<00:01:44.689> that<00:01:45.020> that's<00:01:45.229> what<00:01:45.470> this<00:01:45.590> card<00:01:45.890> is<00:01:46.040> going

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
this that that's what this card is going

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.160 
this that that's what this card is going
to<00:01:46.490> boil<00:01:46.700> down<00:01:46.970> to<00:01:47.210> being<00:01:47.510> I<00:01:47.750> think<00:01:47.780> it's<00:01:47.990> going

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
to boil down to being I think it's going

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.050 
to boil down to being I think it's going
to<00:01:48.229> be<00:01:48.290> just<00:01:48.409> an<00:01:48.799> overnight<00:01:49.250> version<00:01:49.670> of<00:01:49.880> loan

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
to be just an overnight version of loan

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.670 
to be just an overnight version of loan
fire<00:01:50.299> even<00:01:50.570> though<00:01:50.780> it's<00:01:50.960> not<00:01:51.140> no<00:01:51.439> one<00:01:51.590> at

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
fire even though it's not no one at

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.520 
fire even though it's not no one at
itself<00:01:52.040> i<00:01:52.280> think<00:01:52.939> that<00:01:53.000> koo<00:01:53.240> na<00:01:53.450> me<00:01:53.510> put<00:01:54.200> a<00:01:54.229> cap

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
itself i think that koo na me put a cap

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.289 
itself i think that koo na me put a cap
on<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:55.070> effects<00:01:55.460> being<00:01:55.790> once<00:01:56.090> per<00:01:56.270> turn

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
on the effects being once per turn

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.510 
on the effects being once per turn
because<00:01:56.900> they<00:01:57.409> looked<00:01:57.680> at<00:01:57.830> lone<00:01:58.009> fire<00:01:58.280> they

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
because they looked at lone fire they

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.280 
because they looked at lone fire they
say<00:01:58.729> ok<00:01:59.090> we<00:01:59.270> don't<00:01:59.299> want<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.689> causing<00:01:59.930> any

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
say ok we don't want you causing any

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.410 
say ok we don't want you causing any
shenanigans<00:02:00.409> like<00:02:00.920> that<00:02:01.040> card<00:02:01.460> especially

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
shenanigans like that card especially

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.060 
shenanigans like that card especially
when<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:02.630> think<00:02:02.840> about<00:02:02.930> a<00:02:03.080> loan<00:02:03.320> fire<00:02:03.650> plus

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
when you think about a loan fire plus

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.679 
when you think about a loan fire plus
sole<00:02:04.310> charge<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.909> all<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.180> crazy<00:02:05.450> nonsense

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
sole charge and all the crazy nonsense

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.780 
sole charge and all the crazy nonsense
that<00:02:06.110> happens<00:02:06.500> i<00:02:06.680> understand<00:02:07.159> that<00:02:07.280> you

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
that happens i understand that you

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.669 
that happens i understand that you
couldn't<00:02:08.209> activate<00:02:08.599> merlin<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:09.229> then<00:02:09.439> so

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
couldn't activate merlin and then so

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:10.840 
couldn't activate merlin and then so
charge<00:02:10.009> it<00:02:10.159> back<00:02:10.189> because<00:02:10.489> of

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
charge it back because of

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.130 
charge it back because of
in<00:02:11.030> here<00:02:11.270> in<00:02:11.360> effect<00:02:11.660> but<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:11.930> could

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
in here in effect but you could

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.020 
in here in effect but you could
hypothetically<00:02:12.440> normal<00:02:13.280> summon<00:02:13.550> two<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.850> them

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
hypothetically normal summon two of them

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.850 
hypothetically normal summon two of them
in<00:02:14.210> one<00:02:14.270> turn<00:02:14.990> I<00:02:15.020> just<00:02:15.440> think<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:15.680> they

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
in one turn I just think that they

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.730 
in one turn I just think that they
didn't<00:02:16.100> want<00:02:16.250> any<00:02:16.400> part<00:02:16.460> of<00:02:16.820> any<00:02:17.240> type<00:02:17.570> of

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
didn't want any part of any type of

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.320 
didn't want any part of any type of
possible<00:02:18.740> like<00:02:18.950> Merlin<00:02:19.550> abuse<00:02:19.940> or<00:02:20.090> anything

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
possible like Merlin abuse or anything

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.420 
possible like Merlin abuse or anything
like<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.540> but<00:02:21.200> more<00:02:21.440> importantly<00:02:21.920> when<00:02:22.400> I

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
like that but more importantly when I

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.250 
like that but more importantly when I
look<00:02:22.640> at<00:02:22.790> Merlin<00:02:23.240> I<00:02:23.360> think<00:02:23.630> this<00:02:23.780> is<00:02:23.840> a<00:02:24.020> card

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
look at Merlin I think this is a card

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.380 
look at Merlin I think this is a card
with<00:02:24.410> multiple<00:02:24.950> effects<00:02:25.280> but<00:02:25.880> all<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.150> them

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
with multiple effects but all of them

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.000 
with multiple effects but all of them
are<00:02:26.450> actually<00:02:26.870> good<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.230> relevant<00:02:27.620> obviously

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
are actually good and relevant obviously

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.890 
are actually good and relevant obviously
the<00:02:28.160> lone<00:02:28.340> fire<00:02:28.550> effect<00:02:28.880> is<00:02:29.090> probably<00:02:29.720> the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
the lone fire effect is probably the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.570 
the lone fire effect is probably the
most<00:02:29.930> that's<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.800> most<00:02:31.010> common<00:02:31.100> effect

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
most that's the most common effect

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.160 
most that's the most common effect
you're<00:02:31.670> going<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.850> be<00:02:31.910> using<00:02:32.000> it's<00:02:32.330> great<00:02:32.690> get

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
you're going to be using it's great get

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.960 
you're going to be using it's great get
any<00:02:33.350> noble<00:02:33.680> knight<00:02:33.800> monster<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.310> want<00:02:34.550> you

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
any noble knight monster you want you

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.430 
any noble knight monster you want you
can<00:02:35.120> stow<00:02:35.300> special<00:02:35.720> summon<00:02:35.960> as<00:02:36.080> much<00:02:36.230> as<00:02:36.350> you

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
can stow special summon as much as you

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.690 
can stow special summon as much as you
want<00:02:36.620> just<00:02:36.710> have<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.070> make<00:02:37.190> sure<00:02:37.250> that<00:02:37.580> their

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
want just have to make sure that their

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.760 
want just have to make sure that their
noble<00:02:38.000> knights<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:39.020> ability<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.650> get

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
noble knights and the ability to get

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.070 
noble knights and the ability to get
boars<00:02:40.190> turn<00:02:40.700> one<00:02:41.000> on<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.360> field<00:02:41.570> is<00:02:41.840> going<00:02:41.990> to

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
boars turn one on the field is going to

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.870 
boars turn one on the field is going to
be<00:02:42.200> like<00:02:42.350> way<00:02:42.560> more<00:02:42.590> consistent<00:02:43.460> in<00:02:43.550> this<00:02:43.700> Dec

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
be like way more consistent in this Dec

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.000 
be like way more consistent in this Dec
especially<00:02:44.330> with<00:02:44.480> three<00:02:44.720> rota<00:02:44.930> like<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.800> think

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
especially with three rota like I think

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.160 
especially with three rota like I think
boards<00:02:46.460> just<00:02:46.580> he's<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.330> fucking<00:02:47.720> dude<00:02:47.960> that

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
boards just he's that fucking dude that

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.260 
boards just he's that fucking dude that
you<00:02:48.320> always<00:02:48.710> kind<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:49.070> like<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.250> Yamato<00:02:49.640> of

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
you always kind of like the Yamato of

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.610 
you always kind of like the Yamato of
noble<00:02:50.660> knights<00:02:50.810> just<00:02:50.990> because<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.350> summoned

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
noble knights just because you summoned

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.710 
noble knights just because you summoned

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
protection no warrants cards kind of

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.530 
protection no warrants cards kind of
rolling<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:58.490> then<00:02:59.030> you've<00:02:59.210> got<00:02:59.420> the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
rolling and then you've got the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.300 
rolling and then you've got the
graveyard<00:03:00.020> effects<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.590> these<00:03:00.710> let<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.130> know

graveyard effects and these let you know

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.010 
graveyard effects and these let you know
either<00:03:01.340> synchro<00:03:02.030> or<00:03:02.330> exceed<00:03:02.660> during<00:03:02.930> your

either synchro or exceed during your
opponent's<00:03:03.230> turn<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:04.090> think<00:03:05.090> that<00:03:05.210> this<00:03:05.330> is

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
opponent's turn I think that this is

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.210 
opponent's turn I think that this is
mainly<00:03:05.720> going<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:05.990> be<00:03:06.110> used<00:03:06.350> to<00:03:06.890> dodge

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
mainly going to be used to dodge

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.820 
mainly going to be used to dodge
targeting<00:03:08.120> cards<00:03:08.540> I<00:03:08.690> mean<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:09.140> actually<00:03:09.560> think

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
targeting cards I mean I actually think

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.770 
targeting cards I mean I actually think
that<00:03:10.010> there<00:03:10.130> is<00:03:10.370> some<00:03:10.790> value<00:03:11.000> in<00:03:11.210> this<00:03:11.420> effect

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
that there is some value in this effect

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.910 
that there is some value in this effect
like<00:03:11.870> there<00:03:11.990> was<00:03:12.080> I<00:03:12.140> say<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.320> lot<00:03:12.500> about<00:03:12.560> you

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
like there was I say a lot about you

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.830 
like there was I say a lot about you
because<00:03:13.190> when<00:03:13.700> you<00:03:13.820> look<00:03:13.970> at<00:03:14.180> cards<00:03:14.630> like

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
because when you look at cards like

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.810 
because when you look at cards like
Phoenix<00:03:15.320> from<00:03:15.380> wind<00:03:15.650> blast<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:16.160> karma<00:03:16.580> cuts

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
Phoenix from wind blast and karma cuts

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.300 
Phoenix from wind blast and karma cuts
Clamato<00:03:17.330> dragon<00:03:18.080> a<00:03:18.290> whole<00:03:18.770> bunch<00:03:19.010> of<00:03:19.100> cards

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
Clamato dragon a whole bunch of cards

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.770 
Clamato dragon a whole bunch of cards
out<00:03:19.490> there<00:03:19.550> that<00:03:19.850> are<00:03:19.880> commonly<00:03:20.300> played<00:03:20.570> that

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
out there that are commonly played that

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.660 
out there that are commonly played that
target<00:03:21.140> your<00:03:21.320> monsters<00:03:21.770> this<00:03:22.310> gives<00:03:22.550> you<00:03:22.640> a

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
target your monsters this gives you a

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.000 
target your monsters this gives you a
really<00:03:23.090> easy<00:03:23.420> answer<00:03:23.990> to<00:03:24.110> all<00:03:24.260> of<00:03:24.470> those<00:03:24.530> cards

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
really easy answer to all of those cards

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.650 
really easy answer to all of those cards
and<00:03:25.160> I<00:03:25.490> mean<00:03:25.640> two<00:03:25.880> of<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.090> most<00:03:26.210> common

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
and I mean two of the most common

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.720 
and I mean two of the most common
matchup<00:03:27.020> shadows<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:27.800> burning<00:03:28.130> abyss<00:03:28.220> you're

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
matchup shadows and burning abyss you're

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.760 
matchup shadows and burning abyss you're
consistently<00:03:29.300> keeping<00:03:29.720> two<00:03:29.930> monsters<00:03:30.470> on

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
consistently keeping two monsters on

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.620 
consistently keeping two monsters on
board<00:03:31.130> against<00:03:31.520> shadows<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.180> burning<00:03:32.450> abyss

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
board against shadows and burning abyss

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.570 
board against shadows and burning abyss
I<00:03:32.810> think<00:03:33.110> that<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.290> effect<00:03:33.860> is<00:03:34.010> going<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.460> be

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
I think that that effect is going to be

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.280 
I think that that effect is going to be
relevant<00:03:34.760> at<00:03:35.210> least<00:03:35.420> once<00:03:35.690> per<00:03:35.810> game<00:03:36.110> they're

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
relevant at least once per game they're

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.450 
relevant at least once per game they're
going<00:03:36.440> to<00:03:36.500> try<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:36.770> do<00:03:36.890> something<00:03:37.070> to<00:03:37.340> your

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
going to try and do something to your

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.730 
going to try and do something to your
monsters<00:03:37.670> at<00:03:38.150> some<00:03:38.780> point<00:03:39.020> or<00:03:39.260> maybe<00:03:39.530> your

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
monsters at some point or maybe your

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.170 
monsters at some point or maybe your
opponent<00:03:40.100> has<00:03:40.130> like<00:03:40.310> a<00:03:40.340> window<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:40.940> need<00:03:41.090> to

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
opponent has like a window you need to

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.120 
opponent has like a window you need to
special<00:03:41.480> summon<00:03:41.570> during<00:03:42.080> their<00:03:42.320> turn<00:03:42.620> so

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
special summon during their turn so

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.590 
special summon during their turn so
during<00:03:43.370> your<00:03:43.550> end<00:03:43.730> phase<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.180> exceed<00:03:44.480> or

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
during your end phase you exceed or

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.760 
during your end phase you exceed or
something<00:03:44.870> like<00:03:44.990> that<00:03:45.050> i<00:03:45.230> mean<00:03:45.350> i<00:03:45.500> don't<00:03:45.710> know

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
something like that i mean i don't know

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.040 
something like that i mean i don't know
i<00:03:45.830> look<00:03:45.980> at<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.660> during<00:03:47.660> your<00:03:47.780> opponent's

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
i look at the the during your opponent's

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.780 
i look at the the during your opponent's
turns<00:03:48.590> effect<00:03:49.070> and<00:03:49.250> i<00:03:49.280> think<00:03:49.490> that<00:03:49.610> those<00:03:49.760> are

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
turns effect and i think that those are

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.160 
turns effect and i think that those are
just<00:03:50.000> really<00:03:50.270> good<00:03:50.300> plus<00:03:50.600> it's<00:03:50.810> just<00:03:51.020> it

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
just really good plus it's just it

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.050 
just really good plus it's just it
vanishes<00:03:51.620> from<00:03:51.950> the<00:03:52.370> graveyard<00:03:52.580> so<00:03:52.940> you're

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
vanishes from the graveyard so you're

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.790 
vanishes from the graveyard so you're
not<00:03:53.180> really<00:03:53.480> using<00:03:53.600> any<00:03:54.140> resource<00:03:54.620> to

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
not really using any resource to

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.830 
not really using any resource to
activate<00:03:55.190> this<00:03:55.280> effect<00:03:55.460> now<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.240> fact<00:03:56.720> that

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
activate this effect now the fact that

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.780 
activate this effect now the fact that
Merlin<00:03:57.350> is<00:03:57.560> dark<00:03:57.950> is<00:03:58.160> something<00:03:58.550> that<00:03:58.640> a<00:03:58.700> lot

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
Merlin is dark is something that a lot

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.400 
Merlin is dark is something that a lot
of<00:03:58.970> people<00:03:59.180> are<00:03:59.390> probably<00:03:59.780> going<00:03:59.990> to<00:04:00.080> overlook

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
of people are probably going to overlook

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.860 
of people are probably going to overlook
but<00:04:00.620> not<00:04:00.800> me<00:04:01.010> because<00:04:01.220> now<00:04:02.000> it's<00:04:02.270> like<00:04:02.450> okay

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
but not me because now it's like okay

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.780 
but not me because now it's like okay
BLS<00:04:03.440> seems<00:04:03.680> like<00:04:03.800> it<00:04:03.920> could<00:04:04.010> be<00:04:04.070> really<00:04:04.460> really

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
BLS seems like it could be really really

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.520 
BLS seems like it could be really really

darks that didn't really conflict with

three<00:04:23.750> copies<00:04:23.960> of<00:04:24.170> Merlin<00:04:24.860> so<00:04:25.160> I<00:04:25.430> mean<00:04:25.610> now<00:04:25.970> the

three copies of Merlin so I mean now the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.450 
three copies of Merlin so I mean now the
chaos<00:04:26.750> engine<00:04:27.050> is<00:04:27.410> kind<00:04:27.710> of<00:04:27.830> there<00:04:28.040> for<00:04:28.400> the

chaos engine is kind of there for the

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.690 
chaos engine is kind of there for the
taking<00:04:28.910> I<00:04:29.180> think<00:04:29.780> that<00:04:30.010> tsunami<00:04:31.010> obviously

taking I think that tsunami obviously
wasn't<00:04:31.910> fucking<00:04:32.330> around<00:04:32.420> i<00:04:32.810> mean<00:04:32.930> we've<00:04:33.080> got

road ahead to merlin is amazing i mean
it<00:04:36.200> definitely<00:04:36.320> looks<00:04:36.890> like<00:04:36.920> a<00:04:37.010> staple<00:04:37.520> for

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
it definitely looks like a staple for

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.430 
it definitely looks like a staple for
any<00:04:37.760> overnight<00:04:38.330> builds<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:38.870> then<00:04:39.290> you're

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
any overnight builds and then you're

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.320 
any overnight builds and then you're
getting<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:39.800> bug<00:04:40.010> incarnation<00:04:40.970> you<00:04:41.210> know

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
you get the right setup usually with

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.740 
you get the right setup usually with
borz<00:04:51.800> just<00:04:52.310> getting<00:04:52.610> all<00:04:52.790> the<00:04:52.820> noble<00:04:53.330> arms
