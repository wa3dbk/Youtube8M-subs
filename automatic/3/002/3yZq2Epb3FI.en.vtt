hi this is Alex from PHP academy' back

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.269 
hi this is Alex from PHP academy' back
with<00:00:03.300> another<00:00:03.510> tutorial<00:00:03.750> for<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.650> new<00:00:04.799> Boston

with another tutorial for the new Boston
now<00:00:06.000> in<00:00:06.240> this<00:00:06.359> video<00:00:06.509> tutorial<00:00:06.810> we're<00:00:07.410> going

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
now in this video tutorial we're going

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.879 
now in this video tutorial we're going
to<00:00:07.560> be<00:00:07.649> looking<00:00:07.950> at<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.610> function<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:09.269> PHP<00:00:09.889> STR

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
to be looking at the function in PHP STR

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.390 
to be looking at the function in PHP STR
pause<00:00:11.250> now<00:00:12.179> SCR<00:00:12.840> pause<00:00:13.170> stands<00:00:13.740> for<00:00:14.009> string

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
pause now SCR pause stands for string

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.820 
pause now SCR pause stands for string
positions<00:00:15.179> we've<00:00:15.450> got<00:00:15.599> string<00:00:16.020> here<00:00:16.350> position

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
positions we've got string here position

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.859 
positions we've got string here position
and<00:00:17.640> what<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:17.850> function<00:00:18.060> does<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.660> takes

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
and what this function does is it takes

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.040 
and what this function does is it takes
three<00:00:19.710> arguments<00:00:20.070> two<00:00:20.670> are<00:00:20.850> required<00:00:21.300> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
three arguments two are required the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.810 
three arguments two are required the
first<00:00:22.320> argument<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.039> string<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.609> we

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
first argument is the string that we

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.570 
first argument is the string that we
want<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.240> search<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.560> second<00:00:26.010> argument<00:00:26.189> is

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
want to search in the second argument is

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.720 
want to search in the second argument is
the<00:00:27.269> keyword<00:00:28.109> or<00:00:28.560> character<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.250> we<00:00:29.369> want<00:00:29.580> to

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the keyword or character that we want to

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.639 
the keyword or character that we want to
find<00:00:30.060> within<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.689> string<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:33.570> last<00:00:33.809> and

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
find within the string and the last and

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.389 
find within the string and the last and
not<00:00:35.520> an<00:00:35.760> optional<00:00:36.690> offset<00:00:37.200> optional<00:00:37.950> argument

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
not an optional offset optional argument

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.180 
not an optional offset optional argument
is<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> offset<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.899> offset<00:00:40.320> offset<00:00:40.500> is

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
is the offset and the offset offset is

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
is the offset and the offset offset is
where<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.700> start<00:00:42.379> from<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.770> from<00:00:44.520> within<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
where to start from the from within the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.240 
where to start from the from within the
string<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.570> you're<00:00:45.690> searching<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.530> by

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
string that you're searching so by

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.400 
string that you're searching so by
default<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.670> will<00:00:47.730> be<00:00:47.940> 0<00:00:48.239> because<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:49.260> know

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
default this will be 0 because we know

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.779 
default this will be 0 because we know
that<00:00:49.440> arrays<00:00:49.920> or<00:00:51.590> positions<00:00:52.590> start<00:00:52.980> at<00:00:53.190> 0<00:00:53.520> and

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
that arrays or positions start at 0 and

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.750 
that arrays or positions start at 0 and
then<00:00:54.210> increment<00:00:54.510> from<00:00:54.809> there<00:00:55.250> so<00:00:56.250> let's<00:00:56.579> say

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
then increment from there so let's say

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.060 
then increment from there so let's say
we<00:00:56.910> have<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.449> string<00:00:58.140> here<00:00:58.469> now<00:00:58.800> I'm<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:58.980> to

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
we have a string here now I'm going to

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.590 
we have a string here now I'm going to
include<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.520> couple<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.879> keywords<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
include a couple of keywords in the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.270 
include a couple of keywords in the
string<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.020> we<00:01:01.079> might<00:01:01.320> want<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.620> search<00:01:01.949> for

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
string that we might want to search for

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.640 
string that we might want to search for
so<00:01:02.850> for<00:01:03.000> example<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:04.290> could<00:01:04.350> be<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.189> a

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
so for example it could be this is a

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.810 
so for example it could be this is a
string<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.970> an<00:01:09.500> example<00:01:10.580> now<00:01:11.580> I've

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
string and it is an example now I've

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.270 
string and it is an example now I've
included<00:01:12.240> two<00:01:12.750> specific<00:01:13.470> keywords<00:01:13.979> I've

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
included two specific keywords I've

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.080 
included two specific keywords I've
included<00:01:14.610> upwards<00:01:15.420> rather<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.159> is

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
included upwards rather is here and is

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.929 
included upwards rather is here and is
here<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.140> eventually<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.220> tutorial

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
here so eventually in this tutorial

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.249 
here so eventually in this tutorial
we're<00:01:21.150> going<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.299> come<00:01:21.479> up<00:01:21.600> with<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.810> way<00:01:21.990> where

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
we're going to come up with a way where

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.800 
we're going to come up with a way where
we<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.500> loop<00:01:22.740> through<00:01:22.850> each<00:01:23.850> character<00:01:24.630> of

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
we can loop through each character of

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.780 
we can loop through each character of
here<00:01:25.140> as<00:01:25.350> an<00:01:25.560> offset<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:27.320> we<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.470> search<00:01:28.790> we

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
here as an offset and we can search we

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.670 
here as an offset and we can search we
can<00:01:29.820> search<00:01:30.210> through<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.689> string<00:01:31.020> for<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
can search through this string for the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.260 
can search through this string for the
position<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.220> each<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.700> each<00:01:32.960> word<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:35.729> let's

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
position of each of each word so let's

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.569 
position of each of each word so let's
go<00:01:36.420> ahead<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.960> we'll<00:01:37.439> test<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.070> function

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
go ahead and we'll test this function

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.149 
go ahead and we'll test this function
first<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.090> all<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.509> see<00:01:39.689> if<00:01:39.750> we're<00:01:40.159> achieving

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
first of all to see if we're achieving

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.100 
first of all to see if we're achieving
the<00:01:41.250> results<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:41.939> want<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.509> then<00:01:42.990> I'm

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
the results that we want and then I'm

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.289 
the results that we want and then I'm
going<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.259> talk<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.560> little<00:01:43.770> bit<00:01:43.979> about<00:01:44.159> how<00:01:44.729> we

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
going to talk a little bit about how we

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.520 
going to talk a little bit about how we
can<00:01:45.540> loop<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.590> find<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.360> few<00:01:48.380> different<00:01:49.380> words

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
can loop to find a few different words

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.230 
can loop to find a few different words
inside<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.369> you'll<00:01:50.610> actually<00:01:50.729> notice<00:01:51.000> that

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
inside so you'll actually notice that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.139 
inside so you'll actually notice that
we've<00:01:51.360> got<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.689> here<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.430> within<00:01:53.820> this

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
we've got is here so it is within this

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.289 
we've got is here so it is within this
we've<00:01:54.810> got<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.140> here<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.799> we've<00:01:56.430> also<00:01:56.640> got<00:01:57.030> is

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
we've got is here and we've also got is

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.289 
we've got is here and we've also got is
here<00:01:57.979> so<00:01:58.979> we've<00:01:59.070> got<00:01:59.219> 3<00:01:59.490> instances<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
here so we've got 3 instances of the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.999 
here so we've got 3 instances of the
word<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.259> I'm<00:02:01.350> just<00:02:01.380> going<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.680> put<00:02:01.890> that

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
word is so I'm just going to put that

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.340 
word is so I'm just going to put that
into<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.250> variable<00:02:02.850> called<00:02:03.119> find<00:02:03.540> up<00:02:03.840> here<00:02:04.170> for

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
into a variable called find up here for

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.380 
into a variable called find up here for
now<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:05.009> we<00:02:05.100> can<00:02:05.250> use<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.460> later<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:06.030> and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
now so we can use that later on and

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.600 
now so we can use that later on and
we're<00:02:07.259> also<00:02:07.409> going<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.740> need<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.039> length<00:02:08.280> of

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
we're also going to need the length of

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.420 
we're also going to need the length of
find<00:02:09.509> but<00:02:09.780> I'll<00:02:09.869> tell<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.229> why<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.709> bit<00:02:11.190> later

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
find but I'll tell you why a bit later

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.280 
find but I'll tell you why a bit later
so

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
so

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.920 
so
need<00:02:12.469> to<00:02:12.560> say<00:02:12.680> find<00:02:13.069> length<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.870> is

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
need to say find length and that is

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.720 
need to say find length and that is
equal<00:02:15.379> to<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.709> string<00:02:16.099> length<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:16.609> we're

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
equal to the string length so we're

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.240 
equal to the string length so we're
bringing<00:02:16.879> in<00:02:17.060> a<00:02:17.180> string<00:02:17.689> or<00:02:17.989> STR<00:02:18.620> Len<00:02:18.950> function

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
bringing in a string or STR Len function

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.289 
bringing in a string or STR Len function
of<00:02:19.640> find<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:21.400> let's<00:02:22.400> test<00:02:22.760> this<00:02:22.939> string

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
of find so let's test this string

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.569 
of find so let's test this string
position<00:02:23.810> function<00:02:24.079> so<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.069> first<00:02:25.310> argument

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
position function so the first argument

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.490 
position function so the first argument
we<00:02:25.939> need<00:02:26.090> is<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.390> string<00:02:26.719> itself<00:02:27.049> which<00:02:27.349> is

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
we need is the string itself which is

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.160 
we need is the string itself which is
this<00:02:27.680> value<00:02:27.920> here<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:29.180> second<00:02:29.689> we<00:02:29.810> need<00:02:29.989> is

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
this value here the second we need is

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.530 
this value here the second we need is
the<00:02:30.319> word<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:30.739> find<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.640> is<00:02:31.819> is<00:02:32.030> so<00:02:32.420> we

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
the word to find and that is is so we

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.179 
the word to find and that is is so we
can<00:02:32.629> just<00:02:32.780> pop<00:02:32.989> that<00:02:33.019> variable<00:02:33.620> straight<00:02:33.950> into

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
can just pop that variable straight into

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.490 
can just pop that variable straight into
there<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.970> third<00:02:35.239> is<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.510> offset<00:02:35.959> which<00:02:36.140> is<00:02:36.290> by

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
there the third is it offset which is by

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.500 
there the third is it offset which is by
default<00:02:36.950> by<00:02:37.129> zero<00:02:37.430> so<00:02:38.030> we<00:02:38.120> don't<00:02:38.269> need<00:02:38.389> to

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
default by zero so we don't need to

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.289 
default by zero so we don't need to
include<00:02:38.629> this<00:02:38.989> just<00:02:39.230> yet<00:02:39.439> so<00:02:39.819> now<00:02:40.819> what<00:02:41.030> we<00:02:41.150> can

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
include this just yet so now what we can

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.460 
include this just yet so now what we can
do<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.689> we<00:02:41.900> can<00:02:42.200> echo<00:02:42.769> out<00:02:42.799> the<00:02:43.549> value<00:02:43.579> of<00:02:44.030> this

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
do is we can echo out the value of this

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.629 
do is we can echo out the value of this
so<00:02:45.470> let's<00:02:45.739> come<00:02:45.889> into<00:02:46.010> our<00:02:46.099> browser<00:02:46.430> and

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:46.639 
so let's come into our browser and

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.550 
so let's come into our browser and
refresh<00:02:46.879> and<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.840> can<00:02:47.870> see<00:02:47.989> that<00:02:48.260> we've<00:02:48.349> been

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
refresh and you can see that we've been

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.949 
refresh and you can see that we've been
given<00:02:48.829> the<00:02:48.889> value<00:02:49.220> two<00:02:49.489> now<00:02:50.299> what's<00:02:50.510> happened

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
given the value two now what's happened

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.190 
given the value two now what's happened
-<00:02:51.260> let's<00:02:52.010> check<00:02:52.370> -<00:02:52.790> what<00:02:52.939> one<00:02:53.150> -<00:02:53.419> and<00:02:53.930> then

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
- let's check - what one - and then

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.289 
- let's check - what one - and then
that's<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.680> start<00:02:54.919> of<00:02:55.069> where<00:02:55.489> this<00:02:55.879> word<00:02:56.120> is

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
that's the start of where this word is

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.690 
that's the start of where this word is
so<00:02:56.900> that's<00:02:57.200> fair<00:02:57.439> enough<00:02:57.470> but<00:02:57.919> what<00:02:58.400> about

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
so that's fair enough but what about

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.929 
so that's fair enough but what about
this<00:02:59.120> this<00:02:59.720> is<00:02:59.780> here<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.500> this<00:03:00.829> is<00:03:00.889> here<00:03:01.310> it's

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
this this is here and this is here it's

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.729 
this this is here and this is here it's
only<00:03:02.120> going<00:03:02.269> to<00:03:02.359> return<00:03:02.689> the<00:03:02.870> first<00:03:03.109> instance

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
only going to return the first instance

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.229 
only going to return the first instance
found<00:03:04.040> after<00:03:04.549> that<00:03:04.700> it's<00:03:04.879> not<00:03:05.030> going<00:03:05.180> to

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
found after that it's not going to

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.679 
found after that it's not going to
return<00:03:05.470> every<00:03:06.470> single<00:03:06.500> position<00:03:07.370> so<00:03:08.090> we<00:03:08.329> we

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
return every single position so we we

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.009 
return every single position so we we
need<00:03:08.900> to<00:03:09.049> find<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.379> way<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.560> loop<00:03:10.750> somehow<00:03:11.750> and

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
need to find a way to loop somehow and

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.679 
need to find a way to loop somehow and
find<00:03:12.250> this<00:03:13.250> one<00:03:13.489> and<00:03:13.819> return<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.540> position

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:14.689 
find this one and return the position

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.930 
find this one and return the position
this<00:03:15.530> one<00:03:15.769> and<00:03:15.950> return<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.310> position<00:03:16.430> and

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
this one and return the position and

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.360 
this one and return the position and
this<00:03:17.659> one<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:17.930> return<00:03:18.229> the<00:03:18.319> position<00:03:18.409> so<00:03:19.220> for

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
this one and return the position so for

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.520 
this one and return the position so for
example<00:03:19.790> if<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:20.090> was<00:03:20.269> set<00:03:20.479> to<00:03:20.659> set<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.019> offset

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
example if I was set to set the offset

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.930 
example if I was set to set the offset
to<00:03:22.190> let's<00:03:22.760> say<00:03:22.909> 1<00:03:23.209> 2<00:03:23.510> 3<00:03:23.540> 4<00:03:24.290> -<00:03:24.889> 4<00:03:25.250> um<00:03:27.519> actually<00:03:28.519> no

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
to let's say 1 2 3 4 - 4 um actually no

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.899 
to let's say 1 2 3 4 - 4 um actually no
0<00:03:29.389> 1<00:03:29.629> 2<00:03:29.930> 3<00:03:30.620> yep<00:03:31.549> 3<00:03:32.139> then<00:03:33.139> you'll<00:03:33.470> find<00:03:33.859> that<00:03:34.280> will

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
0 1 2 3 yep 3 then you'll find that will

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:37.149 
0 1 2 3 yep 3 then you'll find that will
return<00:03:35.389> this<00:03:35.870> position<00:03:36.440> here<00:03:36.709> which<00:03:36.859> I<00:03:36.979> think

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
return this position here which I think

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:39.969 
return this position here which I think
should<00:03:37.310> be<00:03:37.370> 5<00:03:37.760> so<00:03:38.569> yet<00:03:38.810> we've<00:03:38.930> returned<00:03:39.290> 5<00:03:39.590> and

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:39.979 
should be 5 so yet we've returned 5 and

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.849 
should be 5 so yet we've returned 5 and
if<00:03:40.370> we<00:03:40.519> start<00:03:40.879> the<00:03:41.090> search<00:03:41.690> site<00:03:42.169> after<00:03:42.680> this

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
if we start the search site after this

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.259 
if we start the search site after this
is<00:03:43.069> here<00:03:43.549> so<00:03:44.060> let's<00:03:44.269> say<00:03:44.419> at<00:03:44.569> 10<00:03:46.090> we<00:03:47.090> get<00:03:47.209> a

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
is here so let's say at 10 we get a

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.770 
is here so let's say at 10 we get a
value<00:03:47.479> of<00:03:47.780> 25<00:03:48.290> which<00:03:48.919> is<00:03:48.949> the<00:03:49.699> start<00:03:50.090> of<00:03:50.239> this

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
value of 25 which is the start of this

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.800 
value of 25 which is the start of this
is<00:03:51.079> here<00:03:51.940> so<00:03:52.940> you<00:03:53.000> can<00:03:53.120> see<00:03:53.239> that<00:03:53.329> we<00:03:53.449> can<00:03:53.569> use

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
is here so you can see that we can use

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.929 
is here so you can see that we can use
our<00:03:53.989> offset<00:03:54.409> to<00:03:54.620> our<00:03:54.709> advantage<00:03:55.400> in<00:03:55.609> a<00:03:55.699> loop

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:55.939 
our offset to our advantage in a loop

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:01.000 
our offset to our advantage in a loop
then<00:03:56.900> once<00:03:57.139> we<00:03:57.319> found<00:03:57.650> this<00:03:58.310> first<00:03:58.729> is<00:04:00.010> let's

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
then once we found this first is let's

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.360 
then once we found this first is let's
say<00:04:01.129> we<00:04:01.159> found<00:04:01.400> this<00:04:01.549> at<00:04:01.699> position<00:04:02.090> 2<00:04:02.389> here<00:04:03.370> so

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
say we found this at position 2 here so

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.119 
say we found this at position 2 here so
0<00:04:04.510> 1<00:04:05.510> 2<00:04:06.139> we<00:04:06.379> found<00:04:06.620> this<00:04:06.739> a<00:04:06.769> position<00:04:07.189> -<00:04:08.829> then<00:04:09.829> we

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
0 1 2 we found this a position - then we

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.619 
0 1 2 we found this a position - then we
can<00:04:10.280> say<00:04:10.489> well<00:04:10.759> now<00:04:10.909> I<00:04:10.939> want<00:04:11.209> to<00:04:11.359> start

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
can say well now I want to start

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.439 
can say well now I want to start
searching<00:04:12.199> two<00:04:12.650> characters<00:04:13.310> after<00:04:13.489> this<00:04:14.060> and

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:14.449 
searching two characters after this and

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:16.420 
searching two characters after this and
we<00:04:14.629> start<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.049> search<00:04:15.259> from<00:04:15.530> whether<00:04:15.859> my

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
we start the search from whether my

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.110 
we start the search from whether my
correct<00:04:17.329> is<00:04:17.419> at<00:04:17.539> the<00:04:17.630> moment<00:04:17.989> so<00:04:18.590> here<00:04:19.120> then

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
correct is at the moment so here then

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.899 
correct is at the moment so here then
once<00:04:20.510> we<00:04:20.659> found<00:04:20.900> our<00:04:21.109> position<00:04:21.500> here<00:04:21.950> we<00:04:22.700> say

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:22.909 
once we found our position here we say

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:24.310 
once we found our position here we say
well<00:04:23.060> I<00:04:23.120> want<00:04:23.240> to<00:04:23.389> search<00:04:23.599> two<00:04:23.870> characters

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
well I want to search two characters

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.500 
well I want to search two characters
after<00:04:24.469> this<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.159> then

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
after this and then

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.430 
after this and then
we<00:04:25.870> carry<00:04:26.350> on<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.620> list<00:04:26.800> so<00:04:27.600> we<00:04:28.600> need<00:04:28.750> to<00:04:28.900> we

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
we carry on the list so we need to we

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.930 
we carry on the list so we need to we
need<00:04:29.470> to<00:04:29.740> create<00:04:30.430> a<00:04:30.490> loop<00:04:30.790> to<00:04:31.030> do<00:04:31.180> this<00:04:31.420> and

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
need to create a loop to do this and

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.290 
need to create a loop to do this and
we've<00:04:33.940> seen<00:04:34.120> how<00:04:34.270> string<00:04:34.540> position<00:04:34.930> works

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
we've seen how string position works

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.270 
we've seen how string position works
let's<00:04:37.300> get<00:04:37.570> rid<00:04:37.780> of<00:04:37.870> that<00:04:38.020> for<00:04:38.200> now<00:04:38.350> so<00:04:38.590> what<00:04:39.190> we

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
let's get rid of that for now so what we

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.430 
let's get rid of that for now so what we
need<00:04:39.430> to<00:04:39.460> do<00:04:39.640> is<00:04:39.820> we<00:04:39.940> need<00:04:40.060> to<00:04:40.240> create<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:41.170> while

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
need to do is we need to create a while

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.680 
need to do is we need to create a while
loop<00:04:41.710> and<00:04:41.890> will<00:04:42.040> create<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.370> block<00:04:42.610> there<00:04:42.880> now

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
loop and will create the block there now

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.350 
loop and will create the block there now
the<00:04:44.020> essence<00:04:44.350> of<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.830> overall<00:04:45.490> idea<00:04:45.640> of<00:04:45.940> this

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
the essence of the overall idea of this

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.270 
the essence of the overall idea of this
is<00:04:46.600> that<00:04:46.810> we're<00:04:46.930> going<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:47.140> we're<00:04:48.070> going<00:04:48.220> to

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
is that we're going to we're going to

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.990 
is that we're going to we're going to
search<00:04:49.230> while<00:04:50.230> we're<00:04:50.620> continually<00:04:51.310> finding

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
search while we're continually finding

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.590 
search while we're continually finding
this<00:04:52.480> string<00:04:53.160> so<00:04:54.160> as<00:04:54.580> long<00:04:55.060> as<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.300> string<00:04:55.570> is

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
this string so as long as the string is

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.360 
this string so as long as the string is
found<00:04:55.960> we're<00:04:56.170> going<00:04:56.290> to<00:04:56.380> carry<00:04:56.620> on<00:04:56.770> searching

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
found we're going to carry on searching

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.220 
found we're going to carry on searching
and<00:04:57.610> when<00:04:57.910> it's<00:04:58.030> not<00:04:58.180> found<00:04:58.510> we<00:04:58.750> can<00:04:58.870> break<00:04:59.080> the

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
and when it's not found we can break the

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.530 
and when it's not found we can break the
loop<00:04:59.410> this<00:04:59.650> is<00:04:59.830> why<00:05:00.010> how<00:05:00.730> our<00:05:00.880> while<00:05:01.150> loop<00:05:01.390> is

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
loop this is why how our while loop is

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.920 
loop this is why how our while loop is
now<00:05:01.690> coming<00:05:02.050> into<00:05:02.170> use<00:05:02.440> so<00:05:03.480> inside<00:05:04.480> while<00:05:04.720> I'm

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
now coming into use so inside while I'm

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.300 
now coming into use so inside while I'm
going<00:05:05.050> to<00:05:05.110> create<00:05:05.320> a<00:05:05.380> new<00:05:05.590> variable<00:05:05.830> and

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
going to create a new variable and

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.750 
going to create a new variable and
that's<00:05:06.730> going<00:05:06.880> to<00:05:06.940> be<00:05:07.060> called<00:05:07.740> string

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
that's going to be called string

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.580 
that's going to be called string
position<00:05:09.760> and<00:05:10.480> this<00:05:10.630> is<00:05:10.840> going<00:05:11.050> to<00:05:11.140> be<00:05:11.230> equal

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
position and this is going to be equal

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.330 
position and this is going to be equal
to<00:05:11.620> so<00:05:11.980> remember<00:05:12.340> we<00:05:12.460> can<00:05:12.640> assign<00:05:13.120> variables

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
to so remember we can assign variables

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.100 
to so remember we can assign variables
values<00:05:15.340> inside<00:05:15.910> of<00:05:16.120> our<00:05:16.210> while<00:05:16.450> loop<00:05:16.690> so<00:05:16.720> we're

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
values inside of our while loop so we're

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.800 
values inside of our while loop so we're
constantly<00:05:18.090> reassigning<00:05:19.090> this<00:05:19.450> string

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
constantly reassigning this string

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.020 
constantly reassigning this string
position<00:05:20.230> value<00:05:20.590> that's<00:05:21.220> going<00:05:21.400> to<00:05:21.520> be<00:05:21.640> equal

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
position value that's going to be equal

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.850 
position value that's going to be equal
to<00:05:22.060> string<00:05:22.510> pause<00:05:22.810> now<00:05:23.410> we're<00:05:23.500> going<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.650> set

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
to string pause now we're going to set

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.350 
to string pause now we're going to set
it<00:05:23.890> up<00:05:24.070> exactly<00:05:24.280> the<00:05:24.610> same<00:05:24.700> as<00:05:24.970> before

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
it up exactly the same as before

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.210 
it up exactly the same as before
so<00:05:25.810> our<00:05:25.900> first<00:05:26.230> is<00:05:26.500> the<00:05:26.680> string<00:05:27.010> the<00:05:27.160> string

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
so our first is the string the string

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.700 
so our first is the string the string
we're<00:05:27.550> searching<00:05:28.000> and<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.690> second<00:05:29.200> is<00:05:29.350> the

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
we're searching and the second is the

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.070 
we're searching and the second is the
word<00:05:29.890> to<00:05:30.130> find<00:05:30.370> thirdly<00:05:31.270> I'm<00:05:31.600> going<00:05:31.780> to<00:05:31.840> create

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
word to find thirdly I'm going to create

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.570 
word to find thirdly I'm going to create
this<00:05:32.230> variable<00:05:32.830> which<00:05:32.950> I<00:05:33.070> haven't<00:05:33.370> set<00:05:33.550> a

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
this variable which I haven't set a

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.570 
this variable which I haven't set a
value<00:05:34.030> to<00:05:34.210> yet<00:05:34.420> called<00:05:34.660> offset<00:05:35.520> now<00:05:36.520> the

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
value to yet called offset now the

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.700 
value to yet called offset now the
reason<00:05:36.970> why<00:05:37.120> I'm<00:05:37.450> creating<00:05:37.960> this<00:05:38.140> is<00:05:38.380> because

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
reason why I'm creating this is because

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.190 
reason why I'm creating this is because
now<00:05:39.220> when<00:05:39.460> we<00:05:39.580> do<00:05:39.820> find<00:05:40.120> a<00:05:40.240> string<00:05:40.570> inside<00:05:40.870> here

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
now when we do find a string inside here

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.770 
now when we do find a string inside here
we<00:05:41.710> need<00:05:41.830> to<00:05:41.890> add<00:05:42.070> two<00:05:42.670> to<00:05:42.940> the<00:05:43.060> offset<00:05:43.510> because

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
we need to add two to the offset because

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.370 
we need to add two to the offset because
we<00:05:44.380> need<00:05:44.530> to<00:05:44.650> add<00:05:45.480> this<00:05:46.480> is<00:05:46.660> two<00:05:46.870> characters

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
we need to add this is two characters

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.100 
we need to add this is two characters
long<00:05:47.560> and<00:05:47.770> that's<00:05:48.400> why<00:05:48.670> I<00:05:48.700> created<00:05:49.330> this<00:05:49.600> find

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
long and that's why I created this find

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.270 
long and that's why I created this find
length<00:05:50.440> here<00:05:50.920> so<00:05:51.990> in<00:05:52.990> actual<00:05:53.290> fact<00:05:53.560> file<00:05:54.040> egg

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
length here so in actual fact file egg

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.460 
length here so in actual fact file egg
will<00:05:54.640> be<00:05:54.820> equal<00:05:55.120> to<00:05:55.150> two<00:05:55.480> so<00:05:56.050> whatever<00:05:56.320> we

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
will be equal to two so whatever we

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.620 
will be equal to two so whatever we
change<00:05:56.770> this<00:05:56.980> to<00:05:57.040> here<00:05:57.670> we're<00:05:58.240> always<00:05:58.390> going

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630
