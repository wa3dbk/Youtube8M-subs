just see it it's like a Where's Wally
minigame<00:01:33.470> seriously<00:01:34.470> unless<00:01:34.619> I'm<00:01:34.770> blind<00:01:35.189> I

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
minigame seriously unless I'm blind I

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.240 
minigame seriously unless I'm blind I
can't<00:01:36.960> see

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
can't see

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.480 
can't see
so<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.490> was<00:01:38.579> going<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.759> touch<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.030> whole<00:01:39.119> screen

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
so I was going to touch the whole screen

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.770 
so I was going to touch the whole screen
if<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.759> doubt<00:01:41.790> that's<00:01:42.180> what<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.420> do

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
if in doubt that's what you do

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.460 
if in doubt that's what you do
they<00:01:43.740> got<00:01:43.950> goes<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.119> hole<00:01:45.360> there<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.079> as

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
they got goes in that hole there and as

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.100 
they got goes in that hole there and as
you<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.649> see<00:01:46.740> I've<00:01:47.009> got<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> brilli

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
you can see I've got the brilli

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.210 
you can see I've got the brilli
so<00:01:49.110> basically<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.490> got<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.820> that

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
so basically you just got to do that

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.340 
so basically you just got to do that
in<00:01:53.220> every<00:01:53.579> level<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:54.180> keep<00:01:54.420> keep<00:01:54.899> an<00:01:55.049> ear<00:01:55.320> out

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
in every level just keep keep an ear out

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.230 
in every level just keep keep an ear out
and<00:01:56.189> make<00:01:56.399> sure<00:01:56.579> you're<00:01:56.700> listening<00:01:57.060> out<00:01:57.180> for

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
and make sure you're listening out for

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.260 
and make sure you're listening out for

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
didn't get a single one because I'd

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.749 
didn't get a single one because I'd
usually<00:02:03.719> play<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:05.040> not<00:02:05.219> pay<00:02:05.430> too<00:02:05.490> much
