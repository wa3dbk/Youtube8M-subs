00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:08.010
 squat umbrellas yes guys we have 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.139
 There is a classic video already on the channel 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.690
 squats name ale me but there i am 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.170
 told another technique now here 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.920
 a little bit more is another technique 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.300
 way well here let me take off my t-shirt 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.789
 your back position will be better seen 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:31.500
 it is here that the position of the table plays here 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:38.969
 such a key role means intel and we 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:42.000
 keep on chest is not as comfortable as in 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:47.210
 That way, but that is, look 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.420
 no matter what norms are granted something 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.239
 give 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.550
 that is, look back leaned back 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:59.789
 it's natural to save 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:03.629
 equilibrium can be seen how much can be 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.339
 most rybalin best of all three consolidated 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:12.659
 we put disks on shoulders 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:14.760
 and then inhale miss yes look 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:24.960
 elbows touched the hips near the knees visible 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:29.990
 yes here you are game you inhale exhale well you 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:34.290
 you know, there is still such a tendency 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:38.780
 here comes the young people that is 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.130
 normal guys there are 12 14 16 years old 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:47.490
 why is there an older generation 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:53.430
 This is not so guys I showed here 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.920
 how would vegetables if you have such 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.560
 the problem that is here's a man not crouch 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.190
 maybe his ankle is not showered 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.980
 strong 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.360
 that's when he starts to sink from 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:13.480
 are heels off full let's go now 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:15.760
 portray here crouches all about flexibility 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.690
 not enough opens heels off the floor 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:24.400
 apparently you are trying so hard 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.710
 squat why which is not the position 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.740
 back in the second was demet side a little 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:35.230
 does not seem so in this case you need 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:41.470
 put under my heels but me grandmother i don't 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:43.360
 just wanna run away alone 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:51.940
 long make a knife on the disc from the pants 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:53.680
 not see here the height can be seen less 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.630
 not because it will 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.550
 inefficient but it's short you're better 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.580
 that 's the length and width of your rack 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:10.020
 because here are so many Russian and 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:13.959
 such a technique is clear 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:19.470
 harder here you become tanks on 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.470
 this pump and newspapers 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.280
 back position can excuse me wide 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.530
 can on this plan work then by 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.730
 if you take another 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.840
 keep your back position 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.829
 motionless 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:42.450
 all here I am delirious of the movement that is 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:45.090
 they sent you one jar yes there you are like 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.510
 would have remembered with muscles this position 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.940
 backs and here to this here that is you have not 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.079
 there must be some such there 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:04:09.060
 here is such a clearly that you keep your back 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:04:12.569
 there is a smooth unlined secret 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:16.500
 the rest of the top and the lowest point of one 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:18.780
 souls we do not change it but this exercise 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.829
 need to be used first as add 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.829
 after squatting 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.099
 squatting patterns can be very different 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:31.830
 for example or posedsedali with strange 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:35.729
 I can now finish the muscles you drank 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:39.000
 umbrellas then guys can not a 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:41.940
 better come in a variety of racks 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.030
 for example, you have almost no pants 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:50.280
 at home only you noticed the complexes 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.620
 working on it means first approach 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.889
 there must be such a bit narrowed 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.729
 racks 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.750
 for example here are the parties you become 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:05.970
 slightly wider 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:09.090
 3 you can become even wider you try 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:13.889
 that the knees are not kept to 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:18.510
 Glinka were constantly there that is 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:20.390
 knee does not go beyond the foot on what 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.850
 less she will go taboo topics 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:26.210
 from better back and remini not very 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.790
 traumatic but it depends on the weight 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.460
 dumbbells from your muscles but with time 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:35.420
 if you have a couple of years of squatting 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.070
 knees from equally provided with sweat mother 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.250
 if you have any measures there 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:43.100
 dumbbells you lower so much dear 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.950
 points from which you can easily become 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.070
 that is, if you work here's a tank you 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.570
 sat down here 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.030
 clean and high point can without problems 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.340
 get up if you like 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.250
 go down to this point and then lower 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.680
 something begins here 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.510
 go below that point are working 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.330
 only in turin slab div which you can 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:09.110
 work technical purely then this 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:11.030
 will load your muscles 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.840
 adjust load quantity 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:17.660
 reps because much 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.750
 effective in this case do 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.240
 for example 234 extra repetitions than 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.200
 do once like that so god and 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.200
 get hurt
