00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:10.960
 ok we go with the scale of the minor 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.960
 travel 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.260
 all right 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:26.240
 let's go up each interval with a 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.240
 drops three notes 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.660
 and 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.710
 sorry 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.850
 yes 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.360
 the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.190
 now four notes is important in 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.190
 the change of 2 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.290
 i 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.670
 m 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.840
 to know we go down two ropes 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.729
 you work 3 and you raise one 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.439
 and 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.660
 with hammer 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.049
 it's the change 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.740
 i 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.350
 if advancing 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.870
 at 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.870
 let's lower two ropes 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.700
 we can lower the horizontal vertical 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.400
 to everyone on a scale of 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.709
 back 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.040
 yes also the vertical results 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.490
 you can download anywhere on the 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.490
 scale of the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.349
 all that is in the minor 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.420
 apart from reviewing horizontal vertical 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.420
 whole arm 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.290
 and the return 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:15.730
 the tremolo is important on the right 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.730
 m 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.390
 it has always alternated
