about the counter strike source or 1.6

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.080 
about the counter strike source or 1.6
was<00:02:45.440> that<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.890> can't<00:02:46.190> aim<00:02:46.490> down<00:02:46.670> sights<00:02:46.970> i

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
was that you can't aim down sights i

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.640 
was that you can't aim down sights i
just<00:02:47.270> couldn't<00:02:47.630> imagine<00:02:47.750> playing<00:02:48.260> a<00:02:48.410> game

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
just couldn't imagine playing a game

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.260 
just couldn't imagine playing a game
where<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.920> can't<00:02:49.220> aim<00:02:49.520> down<00:02:49.730> sights<00:02:50.060> with

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
where you can't aim down sights with

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.820 
where you can't aim down sights with
most<00:02:50.510> weapons<00:02:50.690> I<00:02:51.080> thought<00:02:51.440> that<00:02:51.650> would<00:02:51.800> be

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
most weapons I thought that would be

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.920 
most weapons I thought that would be
just<00:02:52.070> completely<00:02:52.400> ridiculous<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.600> just

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
just completely ridiculous I just

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.420 
just completely ridiculous I just
couldn't<00:02:54.230> imagine<00:02:54.380> playing<00:02:54.830> likes<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.250> like

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
couldn't imagine playing likes it like

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.920 
couldn't imagine playing likes it like
that<00:02:55.640> I<00:02:55.880> thought<00:02:56.330> that<00:02:56.510> would<00:02:56.630> be<00:02:56.780> just

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
that I thought that would be just

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.220 
that I thought that would be just
incredibly<00:02:57.560> unrealistic<00:02:58.130> I<00:02:58.550> just<00:02:59.300> didn't

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
incredibly unrealistic I just didn't

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.870 
incredibly unrealistic I just didn't
know<00:03:00.350> how<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.160> play<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.400> game<00:03:01.520> without

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
know how is it to play a game without

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.480 
know how is it to play a game without
aiming<00:03:02.300> down<00:03:02.570> sights<00:03:02.630> I<00:03:03.200> thought<00:03:04.130> that<00:03:04.310> would

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
aiming down sights I thought that would

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.699 
aiming down sights I thought that would
be<00:03:04.520> just<00:03:04.820> awful<00:03:05.090> but<00:03:05.630> finds<00:03:05.900> out<00:03:06.080> it<00:03:06.200> wasn't<00:03:06.410> Oh

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
be just awful but finds out it wasn't Oh

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.310 
be just awful but finds out it wasn't Oh
basically<00:03:07.580> when<00:03:08.000> there<00:03:08.209> were<00:03:08.420> video<00:03:08.959> showing

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
basically when there were video showing

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.990 
basically when there were video showing
up<00:03:09.560> with<00:03:09.739> Kelsey<00:03:10.070> a<00:03:10.220> global<00:03:10.489> offensive<00:03:10.820> beta

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.120 
up with Kelsey a global offensive beta
on<00:03:11.180> youtube<00:03:11.540> I<00:03:11.660> thought<00:03:11.900> hmm<00:03:12.320> graphics<00:03:12.980> are

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
on youtube I thought hmm graphics are

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.220 
on youtube I thought hmm graphics are
definitely<00:03:13.670> worth<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.060> nuke<00:03:14.209> our<00:03:14.360> duty<00:03:14.750> but

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
definitely worth the nuke our duty but

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.740 
definitely worth the nuke our duty but
they<00:03:15.709> aren't<00:03:15.950> as<00:03:16.160> bad<00:03:16.340> as<00:03:16.519> in<00:03:16.550> source<00:03:16.910> on<00:03:17.030> 1.6<00:03:17.450> I

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
they aren't as bad as in source on 1.6 I

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.750 
they aren't as bad as in source on 1.6 I
might<00:03:17.900> actually<00:03:18.110> try<00:03:18.380> this<00:03:18.500> game<00:03:18.739> out<00:03:18.920> but<00:03:19.730> I

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
might actually try this game out but I

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.000 
might actually try this game out but I
was<00:03:20.060> trying<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:20.780> get<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.019> access<00:03:21.350> to<00:03:21.470> beta<00:03:21.709> but

he pre-ordered the game for me and I was

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.750 
he pre-ordered the game for me and I was
like<00:04:44.139> really<00:04:44.380> happy<00:04:44.770> for<00:04:44.950> that<00:04:44.979> but<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:45.610> game

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
like really happy for that but the game

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.430 
like really happy for that but the game
actually<00:04:45.880> wasn't<00:04:46.270> that<00:04:46.419> expensive<00:04:46.690> compared

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
actually wasn't that expensive compared

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.469 
actually wasn't that expensive compared
to<00:04:47.590> call<00:04:47.830> beauty<00:04:48.190> games<00:04:48.400> it<00:04:48.610> was<00:04:48.820> really<00:04:49.240> cheap

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
to call beauty games it was really cheap

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.990 
to call beauty games it was really cheap
I<00:04:49.770> remember<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:50.889> exact<00:04:51.250> price<00:04:51.520> but<00:04:51.760> I<00:04:51.790> guess

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
I remember the exact price but I guess

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.260 
I remember the exact price but I guess
it<00:04:52.150> was<00:04:52.330> around<00:04:52.570> ten<00:04:53.200> euros<00:04:53.620> and<00:04:53.889> I<00:04:54.790> really

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
it was around ten euros and I really

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.000 
it was around ten euros and I really
thought<00:04:55.419> that<00:04:55.570> was<00:04:55.750> cheap<00:04:56.080> compared<00:04:56.470> cove<00:04:56.740> g

thought that was cheap compared cove g
d's<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:57.750> guess<00:04:58.750> it<00:04:58.870> was<00:04:59.020> cheap<00:04:59.289> i<00:04:59.500> didn't

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 
after a year of practice if you would

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.850 
after a year of practice if you would
practice<00:07:00.570> playing<00:07:00.840> call<00:07:01.080> of<00:07:01.110> duty<00:07:01.169> for<00:07:01.530> a<00:07:01.560> year

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
practice playing call of duty for a year

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.920 
practice playing call of duty for a year
almost<00:07:02.160> on<00:07:02.460> daily<00:07:02.490> basis<00:07:03.060> you<00:07:03.180> would<00:07:03.330> do<00:07:03.479> so

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
almost on daily basis you would do so

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.020 
almost on daily basis you would do so
much<00:07:04.229> better<00:07:04.410> than<00:07:04.650> that<00:07:04.710> in<00:07:05.100> my<00:07:05.490> opinion<00:07:05.700> it

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
much better than that in my opinion it

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.570 
much better than that in my opinion it
just<00:07:06.330> proves<00:07:06.690> that<00:07:06.900> cough<00:07:07.530> duty<00:07:07.830> is<00:07:07.979> so<00:07:08.310> much

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 
just proves that cough duty is so much

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.029 
just proves that cough duty is so much
easier<00:07:08.610> than<00:07:09.150> can<00:07:09.389> track<00:07:09.720> it<00:07:10.080> has<00:07:10.350> always<00:07:10.620> been

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 
easier than can track it has always been

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:14.600 
easier than can track it has always been
and<00:07:11.340> I<00:07:12.180> think<00:07:12.510> it<00:07:12.660> will<00:07:12.780> always<00:07:13.050> be<00:07:13.370> but<00:07:14.370> anyway

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
and I think it will always be but anyway

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.460 
and I think it will always be but anyway
