checking the show out because it is

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.620 
checking the show out because it is
something<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.070> can't<00:01:08.460> be<00:01:08.580> explained<00:01:09.180> well

okay<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.860> minus<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.520> reason

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
okay so this is minus that the reason

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.060 
okay so this is minus that the reason
that<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.030> not<00:01:36.119> pokemon<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.930> not<00:01:37.140> yugioh<00:01:37.619> and

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
that it's not pokemon and not yugioh and

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.800 
that it's not pokemon and not yugioh and
not<00:01:38.340> digimon<00:01:39.180> or<00:01:39.390> anything<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.689> that

really got involved in the community and
anything<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.210> that's<00:02:06.450> why<00:02:06.659> i<00:02:07.140> chose<00:02:07.649> beyblade

not because it's the best show out
all<00:02:10.090> of<00:02:10.330> them<00:02:10.479> not<00:02:10.780> because<00:02:10.990> it's<00:02:11.290> actually<00:02:11.650> a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
recently rewatched the original series

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.770 
recently rewatched the original series
and<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.480> scripting<00:02:22.840> is<00:02:22.959> just<00:02:23.170> absolutely

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
and the scripting is just absolutely

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.940 
and the scripting is just absolutely
amazingly<00:02:25.780> bad<00:02:26.050> you<00:02:26.319> don't<00:02:26.500> need<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.680> check

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
amazingly bad you don't need to check

amazingly bad you don't need to check
out<00:02:27.100> beyblade<00:02:27.430> if<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:27.610> haven't<00:02:27.880> seen<00:02:28.000> it

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
out beyblade if you haven't seen it

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.309 
out beyblade if you haven't seen it
because<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.450> probably<00:02:28.630> won't<00:02:28.900> get<00:02:29.020> much<00:02:29.200> out

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
because you probably won't get much out

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.220 
because you probably won't get much out
of<00:02:29.380> it<00:02:29.560> now<00:02:29.739> but<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:30.910> can't<00:02:31.360> explain<00:02:31.690> why<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:31.959> like

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
of it now but I can't explain why I like

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.100 
of it now but I can't explain why I like
the<00:02:32.380> show<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:32.590> maybe<00:02:33.209> maybe<00:02:34.209> in<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.510> future<00:02:34.690> I

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
the show so maybe maybe in the future I

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.870 
the show so maybe maybe in the future I
will<00:02:35.230> try<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:36.100> do<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.400> little<00:02:36.550> bit<00:02:36.730> better

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
will try to do it a little bit better

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.059

could incorporate the first series of
clannad<00:02:44.920> in<00:02:45.130> this<00:02:45.280> because<00:02:45.550> you<00:02:45.640> can't<00:02:45.850> watch

go<00:03:08.950> this<00:03:09.250> is<00:03:09.370> one<00:03:09.519> of<00:03:09.550> the<00:03:09.730> best<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.209> it<00:03:10.300> did

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
go this is one of the best and it did

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.970 
go this is one of the best and it did
sort<00:03:10.600> of<00:03:10.690> kak<00:03:10.959> itself<00:03:11.319> a<00:03:11.440> little<00:03:11.650> bit<00:03:11.800> towards

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
sort of kak itself a little bit towards

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.210 
sort of kak itself a little bit towards
the<00:03:12.310> end<00:03:12.430> but<00:03:12.989> all<00:03:13.989> in<00:03:14.290> all<00:03:14.410> it's<00:03:14.799> just<00:03:15.010> a

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
the end but all in all it's just a

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.569 
the end but all in all it's just a
really<00:03:15.640> good<00:03:16.110> adaptation<00:03:17.110> I<00:03:17.890> highly<00:03:18.430> suggest

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
really good adaptation I highly suggest

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:19.830 
really good adaptation I highly suggest
that<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:18.880> go<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.209> watch<00:03:19.360> this<00:03:19.570> if<00:03:19.750> you

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
that you go and watch this if you

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.300 
that you go and watch this if you
haven't<00:03:20.140> already<00:03:20.230> because<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.829> is<00:03:20.980> one<00:03:21.280> of

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
haven't already because it is one of

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.949 
haven't already because it is one of
those<00:03:21.519> things<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:22.000> lot<00:03:22.209> of<00:03:22.299> people<00:03:22.600> still<00:03:22.780> talk

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
still really relevant and that most

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.770 
still really relevant and that most
certainly<00:03:26.709> includes<00:03:27.100> after<00:03:27.430> story<00:03:27.780> because

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
certainly includes after story because

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.289 
certainly includes after story because
that<00:03:29.019> is<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:30.160> better<00:03:30.459> half<00:03:30.760> of<00:03:30.850> the<00:03:30.970> series

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
one of those shows that I love and I do

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.880 
one of those shows that I love and I do
not<00:03:36.730> know<00:03:36.910> why<00:03:36.940> I<00:03:37.390> honestly<00:03:37.750> can't<00:03:38.230> figure<00:03:38.680> it

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
not know why I honestly can't figure it

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.539 
not know why I honestly can't figure it
out<00:03:39.100> but<00:03:39.459> it's<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:40.680> great<00:03:41.680> even<00:03:41.980> though<00:03:42.250> it's

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
out but it's so great even though it's

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.060 
out but it's so great even though it's
not<00:03:42.609> that<00:03:43.000> good<00:03:43.359> I<00:03:43.660> think<00:03:44.320> the<00:03:44.410> most<00:03:44.530> important

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
not that good I think the most important

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.740 
not that good I think the most important
thing<00:03:45.100> with<00:03:45.519> this<00:03:45.670> show<00:03:45.940> personally<00:03:46.510> is<00:03:46.720> that

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
thing with this show personally is that

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.590 
thing with this show personally is that
when<00:03:47.410> I<00:03:47.440> watched<00:03:47.799> it<00:03:48.070> I<00:03:48.280> had<00:03:48.700> fun<00:03:49.000> watching<00:03:49.239> it

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
when I watched it I had fun watching it

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.270 
when I watched it I had fun watching it
and<00:03:49.780> it's<00:03:50.290> one<00:03:50.410> of<00:03:50.500> those<00:03:50.560> things<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:50.980> still

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
and it's one of those things that still

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.500 
and it's one of those things that still
sticks<00:03:51.459> with<00:03:51.670> me<00:03:51.820> because<00:03:52.060> it<00:03:52.150> was<00:03:52.209> really

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
sticks with me because it was really

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.680 
sticks with me because it was really
quirky<00:03:52.780> and<00:03:53.320> it<00:03:53.560> had<00:03:53.769> absolutely<00:03:54.690> amazing

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
quirky and it had absolutely amazing

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.770 
quirky and it had absolutely amazing
color<00:03:56.049> and<00:03:56.609> animation<00:03:57.609> and<00:03:57.940> character

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
color and animation and character

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.840 
color and animation and character
designs<00:03:59.140> all<00:03:59.470> of<00:03:59.739> it<00:03:59.859> was<00:04:00.070> just<00:04:00.310> really<00:04:00.579> well

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
designs all of it was just really well

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.490 
designs all of it was just really well
done<00:04:00.910> it's<00:04:01.359> just<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.660> story<00:04:01.930> Falls<00:04:02.260> a<00:04:02.380> bit

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
done it's just the story Falls a bit

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.740 
done it's just the story Falls a bit
flat<00:04:02.769> so<00:04:03.310> it<00:04:03.640> might<00:04:03.940> be<00:04:03.970> down<00:04:04.239> to<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.570> fact

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
flat so it might be down to the fact

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.630 
flat so it might be down to the fact
that<00:04:04.930> it's<00:04:05.260> got<00:04:05.530> really<00:04:06.160> good<00:04:06.250> character

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
that it's got really good character

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.009 
that it's got really good character
design<00:04:06.910> because<00:04:07.239> I<00:04:07.359> will<00:04:07.510> say<00:04:07.750> it<00:04:07.989> is

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
design because I will say it is

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.349 
design because I will say it is
absolutely<00:04:08.739> gorgeous<00:04:09.100> it<00:04:09.670> might<00:04:09.940> be<00:04:10.150> because

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
absolutely gorgeous it might be because

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.390 
absolutely gorgeous it might be because
it<00:04:10.660> includes<00:04:11.079> the<00:04:11.290> best<00:04:11.650> transformation

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
it includes the best transformation

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.580 
it includes the best transformation

sequence i have ever seen an anime born
on<00:04:14.950> it<00:04:15.220> might<00:04:15.519> be<00:04:15.670> because<00:04:15.790> I<00:04:15.940> put<00:04:16.180> it<00:04:16.299> on<00:04:16.359> in<00:04:16.510> my

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
on it might be because I put it on in my
