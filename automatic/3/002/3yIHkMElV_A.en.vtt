00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
and this one's a bit different to the

and this one's a bit different to the
normal<00:00:09.110> ones<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.230> these<00:00:10.349> in<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.650> fact<00:00:10.800> that

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
normal ones of these in the fact that

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.919 
normal ones of these in the fact that
it's<00:00:11.070> actually<00:00:11.340> got<00:00:11.429> an<00:00:11.519> extra<00:00:11.820> coach<00:00:12.030> so<00:00:12.780> it's

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
it's actually got an extra coach so it's

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.120 
it's actually got an extra coach so it's
actually<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.259> standard<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.920> 5<00:00:14.160> car<00:00:14.519> train<00:00:15.389> and

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
whereas the standard ones generally have

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.929 
whereas the standard ones generally have
one<00:00:18.539> or<00:00:18.660> two<00:00:18.840> coaches<00:00:19.350> like<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> three<00:00:20.580> or<00:00:20.730> four

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
one or two coaches like a three or four

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.929 
one or two coaches like a three or four
car<00:00:21.210> train<00:00:22.490> it's<00:00:23.490> actually<00:00:23.760> slightly

car train it's actually slightly

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.400 
car train it's actually slightly
different<00:00:24.240> standard<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.840> I've<00:00:24.930> changed

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
different standard in that I've changed

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.839 
different standard in that I've changed
the<00:00:26.990> dummy<00:00:27.990> car<00:00:28.199> for<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.529> more<00:00:28.740> recent<00:00:29.130> model

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
the dummy car for a more recent model

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.049 
the dummy car for a more recent model
not<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.210> latest<00:00:30.660> super<00:00:31.170> detail<00:00:31.500> one<00:00:32.030> but<00:00:33.030> a

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
not the latest super detail one but a

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.139 
not the latest super detail one but a
bit<00:00:33.270> nicer<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.660> general<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.230> me

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
bit nicer in general on me

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.490 
bit nicer in general on me
so<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.420> see<00:00:36.570> it's<00:00:36.690> got<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.899> sort<00:00:37.469> of

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
so it's you see it's got the sort of

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.850 
so it's you see it's got the sort of
more<00:00:37.770> modern<00:00:37.800> style<00:00:38.399> thicker<00:00:38.730> cup<00:00:39.059> or<00:00:39.270> box<00:00:39.860> and

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
more modern style thicker cup or box and

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.560 
more modern style thicker cup or box and
it's<00:00:41.010> needs<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.309> see<00:00:41.399> one<00:00:41.610> two<00:00:41.790> five<00:00:42.920> and<00:00:44.570> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
it's needs to see one two five and the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.720 
it's needs to see one two five and the
extra<00:00:45.930> coach<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> buffet<00:00:46.980> car<00:00:47.250> which<00:00:47.579> is

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
extra coach is a buffet car which is

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.229 
extra coach is a buffet car which is
ideal<00:00:48.090> because<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.989> they<00:00:49.320> look<00:00:49.469> quite<00:00:49.559> cool<00:00:49.829> I

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
ideal because and they look quite cool I

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.369 
ideal because and they look quite cool I
think<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.629> only<00:00:51.750> set<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.260> they

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
think this is the only set that they

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.510 
think this is the only set that they
came<00:00:52.800> with<00:00:53.480> so<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.629> got<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.110> chesty<00:00:55.980> power<00:00:56.219> car

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
came with so it's got a chesty power car

I'll bring up on the bit closer to the
exact<00:01:16.770> content<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:18.150> like<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.299> say<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.570> have

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
exact content and like I say I have

whatever over so it is a bit different

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.870 
whatever over so it is a bit different
but<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.650> you'll<00:01:23.250> still<00:01:23.430> see<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.759> you

model it's made in Great Britain model

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.640 
model it's made in Great Britain model
so<00:02:18.820> it's<00:02:19.450> only<00:02:19.540> got<00:02:19.750> power<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.260> one<00:02:20.410> bogey

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
so it's only got power to the one bogey

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.130 
so it's only got power to the one bogey
and<00:02:21.490> I<00:02:21.910> seen<00:02:22.150> this<00:02:22.270> one<00:02:22.330> I've<00:02:22.570> converted<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.080> it

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
and I seen this one I've converted to it

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.990 
and I seen this one I've converted to it
I<00:02:23.440> don't<00:02:23.740> know<00:02:23.800> maybe<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.130> wasn't<00:02:24.340> basic

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
I don't know maybe this wasn't basic

I don't know maybe this wasn't basic
this<00:02:25.060> one's<00:02:25.240> a<00:02:25.300> dummy<00:02:25.480> car<00:02:25.750> it's<00:02:25.900> got<00:02:25.990> no<00:02:26.170> motor

this one's a dummy car it's got no motor
in<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:26.710> one<00:02:27.300> but<00:02:28.300> I<00:02:28.420> don't<00:02:28.630> know<00:02:28.720> if<00:02:28.780> that's

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
in this one but I don't know if that's

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.450 
in this one but I don't know if that's
because<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:29.410> swapped<00:02:29.800> over<00:02:29.890> or<00:02:30.220> whatever

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:06.960 
notice really you can see the ends ones
got<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.040> number<00:03:06.310> on<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.489> end<00:03:06.610> of<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.790> other

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.500 
got the number on the end of the other
one<00:03:07.060> hasn't<00:03:07.239> and<00:03:08.110> it's<00:03:08.260> got<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.470> black<00:03:09.510> bit

yellow so little driver inside looks
quite<00:04:01.870> cool<00:04:02.049> I've<00:04:02.500> done<00:04:02.650> that<00:04:02.769> in<00:04:02.860> a<00:04:02.920> few<00:04:03.100> of<00:04:03.220> my

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
quite cool I've done that in a few of my

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.880 
quite cool I've done that in a few of my
power<00:04:04.030> cars<00:04:04.380> because<00:04:05.380> I<00:04:05.500> think<00:04:05.560> it<00:04:05.739> looks

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
power cars because I think it looks

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.590 
power cars because I think it looks
quite<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.130> bit<00:04:06.160> different<00:04:06.310> so<00:04:06.850> you<00:04:07.330> get<00:04:07.510> the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
quite a bit different so you get the

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.120 
quite a bit different so you get the
Oval<00:04:07.840> of<00:04:07.959> track<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.530> I<00:04:08.650> say<00:04:08.829> you<00:04:08.889> get<00:04:09.040> the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
Oval of track and I say you get the

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.630 
Oval of track and I say you get the
three<00:04:09.430> coaches

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
three coaches

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.700 
three coaches
so<00:04:11.270> it's<00:04:11.720> got<00:04:11.990> Oh<00:04:12.910> Jeff<00:04:13.910> Sweeney<00:04:14.120> for<00:04:15.080> two<00:04:15.290> to

three Oh standard coach he's not scaling

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.900 
three Oh standard coach he's not scaling
coach<00:04:20.420> they're<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:20.720> shorter<00:04:21.170> ones<00:04:21.760> and<00:04:22.760> then

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
coach they're the shorter ones and then

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.230 
coach they're the shorter ones and then
our<00:04:23.150> for<00:04:23.810> two<00:04:24.020> -<00:04:24.380> oh<00:04:24.640> just<00:04:25.640> another<00:04:25.820> standard

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
our for two - oh just another standard

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.420 
our for two - oh just another standard
coach<00:04:26.480> and<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:28.840> buffet<00:04:29.840> car<00:04:29.870> which<00:04:30.410> is<00:04:30.440> four

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
coach and the buffet car which is four

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.330 
coach and the buffet car which is four
oh<00:04:31.570> seven<00:04:32.570> five<00:04:32.870> four<00:04:33.110> and<00:04:33.380> this<00:04:34.040> has<00:04:34.190> got

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
oh seven five four and this has got

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.570 
oh seven five four and this has got
first-class<00:04:34.880> seating<00:04:35.210> as<00:04:35.480> well<00:04:36.460> so<00:04:37.460> I<00:04:37.490> think

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
first-class seating as well so I think

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.640 
first-class seating as well so I think
if<00:04:37.790> you<00:04:37.880> added<00:04:38.000> an<00:04:38.240> extra<00:04:38.390> first-class<00:04:39.380> coach

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
if you added an extra first-class coach

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.470 
if you added an extra first-class coach
with<00:04:39.920> it<00:04:40.070> to<00:04:40.340> full<00:04:40.520> yellow<00:04:40.700> strike<00:04:41.120> one

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
with it to full yellow strike one

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.600 
with it to full yellow strike one
then<00:04:42.170> you've<00:04:42.290> pretty<00:04:42.440> much<00:04:42.560> got<00:04:42.710> six<00:04:43.340> car

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
then you've pretty much got six car

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.010 
then you've pretty much got six car
train<00:04:43.910> so<00:04:44.270> ideal<00:04:44.900> to<00:04:45.200> go<00:04:45.650> really<00:04:45.890> I<00:04:46.570> think<00:04:47.570> was

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
train so ideal to go really I think was

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.570 
train so ideal to go really I think was
a<00:04:48.050> limited<00:04:48.440> edition<00:04:48.530> of<00:04:48.890> this<00:04:49.010> model<00:04:49.340> the

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
a limited edition of this model the

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.840 
a limited edition of this model the
first<00:04:52.810> quarter<00:04:53.810> policing<00:04:54.590> of<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.950> trains<00:04:55.640> and

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
first quarter policing of the trains and

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.150 
first quarter policing of the trains and
all<00:04:55.910> that<00:04:56.030> on<00:04:56.120> there<00:04:56.330> and<00:04:56.570> the<00:04:57.169> Box<00:04:57.350> got<00:04:57.740> the

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
all that on there and the Box got the

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.940 
all that on there and the Box got the
intercity<00:04:59.030> going<00:04:59.300> over<00:04:59.600> there<00:04:59.810> and<00:05:00.260> Bruno

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
intercity going over there and Bruno

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.030 
intercity going over there and Bruno
came<00:05:01.370> out<00:05:01.550> breach<00:05:01.760> on<00:05:01.940> the<00:05:01.970> Box<00:05:02.210> I<00:05:02.980> used<00:05:03.980> to

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
came out breach on the Box I used to

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.070 
came out breach on the Box I used to
live<00:05:04.160> quite<00:05:04.370> near<00:05:04.400> there<00:05:04.669> so<00:05:04.700> it<00:05:05.000> that's<00:05:05.600> one

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
live quite near there so it that's one

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.150 
live quite near there so it that's one
of<00:05:06.169> the<00:05:06.230> reasons<00:05:06.500> it<00:05:08.080> so<00:05:09.080> yes<00:05:09.290> pretty<00:05:10.070> good

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
of the reasons it so yes pretty good

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.980 
of the reasons it so yes pretty good

and<00:06:09.890> which<00:06:10.160> do<00:06:10.820> to<00:06:11.000> be<00:06:11.120> I<00:06:11.150> think<00:06:11.270> probably

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
and which do to be I think probably

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.340 
and which do to be I think probably
replaced<00:06:12.200> by<00:06:12.470> the<00:06:12.530> newer<00:06:13.990> they<00:06:14.990> were<00:06:15.080> trained

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350 
replaced by the newer they were trained

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.580 
replaced by the newer they were trained
basically<00:06:15.800> as<00:06:15.890> well<00:06:16.870> so<00:06:17.870> yes<00:06:18.020> a<00:06:18.229> really<00:06:18.440> nice

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
basically as well so yes a really nice

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.050 
basically as well so yes a really nice
they've<00:06:18.860> got<00:06:19.130> the<00:06:19.250> controller<00:06:19.669> and<00:06:19.789> the<00:06:19.849> track

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
they've got the controller and the track

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.900 
they've got the controller and the track
and<00:06:20.180> everything<00:06:20.450> as<00:06:20.570> well<00:06:20.750> so

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
and everything as well so
