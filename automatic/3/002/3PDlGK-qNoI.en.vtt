towards<00:02:31.290> feast<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.710> excise<00:02:32.100> I<00:02:32.430> support

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
towards feast of excise I support

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.080 
towards feast of excise I support
but<00:02:34.140> as<00:02:34.379> far<00:02:34.590> as<00:02:34.650> behind<00:02:35.220> them<00:02:35.459> rooms<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.970> that

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
but as far as behind them rooms and that

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.059 
but as far as behind them rooms and that
there's<00:02:36.239> nothing<00:02:36.660> there<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.590> mean<00:02:37.800> that's

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
there's nothing there but I mean that's

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.650 
there's nothing there but I mean that's
not<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.370> say<00:02:38.519> that<00:02:38.550> couldn't<00:02:39.060> be<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.480> never

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
not to say that couldn't be you never

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.990 
not to say that couldn't be you never
know<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.050> textures<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.739> whatever<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.250> I'm

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
know the textures and whatever that I'm

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.930 
know the textures and whatever that I'm
referral<00:02:42.599> image<00:02:42.810> textures<00:02:43.349> or<00:02:44.190> whatever<00:02:44.610> I

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
referral image textures or whatever I

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.930 
referral image textures or whatever I
don't<00:02:45.420> know<00:02:45.599> if<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.870> IRA<00:02:46.080> exactly<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.940> what

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
don't know if the IRA exactly and what

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.380 
don't know if the IRA exactly and what
you<00:02:48.060> would<00:02:48.120> call<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.690> but<00:02:49.019> I<00:02:49.230> mean<00:02:50.390> they're

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
you would call and but I mean they're

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.479 
you would call and but I mean they're
not<00:02:51.569> that<00:02:51.900> they're<00:02:52.110> not<00:02:52.230> really<00:02:52.440> visible<00:02:53.010> to

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
not that they're not really visible to

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.430 
not that they're not really visible to
us<00:02:53.640> at<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.879> moment<00:02:54.000> but<00:02:54.870> they<00:02:54.989> just<00:02:55.110> come<00:02:55.319> out

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
us at the moment but they just come out

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.559 
us at the moment but they just come out
of<00:02:55.470> nowhere<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.400> suppose<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.940> same<00:02:57.239> in<00:02:57.480> a

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
of nowhere so I suppose the same in a

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:58.940 
of nowhere so I suppose the same in a
sense<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:57.900> happen<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.379> the<00:02:58.470> rooms<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.890> I've

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
sense that happen to the rooms and I've

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.190 
sense that happen to the rooms and I've
just<00:02:58.980> disproved<00:02:59.700> by<00:02:59.940> doing<00:03:00.720> this<00:03:00.780> video<00:03:01.080> I've

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
just disproved by doing this video I've

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.869 
just disproved by doing this video I've
just<00:03:01.349> kind<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:01.769> proved<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.400> as<00:03:02.489> well<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:02.849> I

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
just kind of this proved it as well so I

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.250 
just kind of this proved it as well so I
don't<00:03:02.910> know<00:03:03.120> why<00:03:03.209> I've<00:03:03.330> just<00:03:03.510> said<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.930> fort

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
don't know why I've just said that fort

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.770 
don't know why I've just said that fort
I<00:03:04.530> mean<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.640> mean<00:03:05.819> hope<00:03:05.970> not<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.299> ridge<00:03:06.450> the

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
I mean I mean hope not the ridge the

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.410 
I mean I mean hope not the ridge the
roads<00:03:06.930> as<00:03:07.079> well<00:03:07.110> if<00:03:07.590> anyone<00:03:07.950> else<00:03:08.150> but<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:09.209> just

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
roads as well if anyone else but I just

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.670 
roads as well if anyone else but I just
don't<00:03:09.569> think<00:03:09.690> there's<00:03:09.959> anything<00:03:10.170> them<00:03:10.410> rooms

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
don't think there's anything them rooms

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.680 
don't think there's anything them rooms
because<00:03:10.860> even<00:03:11.190> if<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.400> was<00:03:11.579> that<00:03:12.569> be

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
because even if the was that be

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.660 
because even if the was that be
invisible<00:03:13.019> walls<00:03:13.470> as<00:03:13.769> a<00:03:13.799> so<00:03:14.220> say<00:03:14.400> for<00:03:14.430> example

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
invisible walls as a so say for example

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.400 
invisible walls as a so say for example
whether<00:03:15.180> would<00:03:15.510> be<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:15.690> flawed<00:03:15.959> would<00:03:16.200> be<00:03:16.319> an

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
whether would be a flawed would be an

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.309 
whether would be a flawed would be an
invisible<00:03:16.920> like<00:03:17.730> wallet<00:03:18.450> or<00:03:18.660> an<00:03:18.870> invisible

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
invisible like wallet or an invisible

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.289 
invisible like wallet or an invisible
barrier<00:03:19.349> and<00:03:20.040> then<00:03:20.370> obviously<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.849> textures

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
barrier and then obviously the textures

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.420 
barrier and then obviously the textures
would<00:03:21.480> get<00:03:21.660> added<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:21.989> it<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.440> misses<00:03:23.069> me<00:03:23.220> this

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
would get added to it and misses me this

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.130 
would get added to it and misses me this
is<00:03:23.519> quite<00:03:23.819> far<00:03:24.060> fetched<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.569> happening<00:03:24.900> but

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
is quite far fetched it happening but

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.990 
is quite far fetched it happening but
I'm<00:03:25.290> just<00:03:25.410> saying<00:03:25.650> there's<00:03:26.280> just<00:03:26.489> nothing

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
I'm just saying there's just nothing

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.030 
I'm just saying there's just nothing
there<00:03:27.030> at<00:03:27.420> all<00:03:27.540> it's<00:03:27.870> like<00:03:28.049> all<00:03:28.290> blank<00:03:28.829> you

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
there at all it's like all blank you

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.289 
there at all it's like all blank you
just<00:03:29.250> fall<00:03:29.489> through<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.849> muck<00:03:30.000> if<00:03:30.180> you're

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
just fall through the muck if you're

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.819 
just fall through the muck if you're
going<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.569> them<00:03:30.780> areas<00:03:31.170> so<00:03:31.500> i'm<00:03:32.250> not<00:03:32.519> sure<00:03:32.819> but

going to them areas so i'm not sure but

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.129 
going to them areas so i'm not sure but
am<00:03:34.829> yeah<00:03:35.340> that's<00:03:35.700> about<00:03:35.819> it<00:03:35.940> so<00:03:36.269> that's<00:03:36.569> all

the fridge like which I is anything else
we<00:03:40.769> could<00:03:40.980> sure<00:03:41.250> oh<00:03:41.519> yeah<00:03:41.850> go<00:03:42.090> into<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.420> muck

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
we could sure oh yeah go into the muck

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.449 
we could sure oh yeah go into the muck
do<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.900> know<00:03:43.019> where<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.500> Orb<00:03:43.739> is<00:03:44.040> Mitchell

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
do you know where the Orb is Mitchell

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.180 
do you know where the Orb is Mitchell
the<00:03:44.850> follow<00:03:45.120> this<00:03:45.299> rocket<00:03:45.769> yeah<00:03:46.769> follow<00:03:47.040> the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
the follow this rocket yeah follow the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.490 
the follow this rocket yeah follow the
rocker<00:03:47.400> panels<00:03:48.920> wait<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:50.069> actually<00:03:50.430> go<00:03:50.660> a<00:03:51.660> ver

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
flawed up to this car by the way it's

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.020 
flawed up to this car by the way it's
just<00:04:06.239> them<00:04:06.450> what<00:04:06.599> do<00:04:06.690> we<00:04:06.810> have<00:04:06.870> on<00:04:06.930> oh<00:04:07.340> shit<00:04:08.340> hey
