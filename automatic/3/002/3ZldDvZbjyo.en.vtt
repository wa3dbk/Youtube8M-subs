00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.740
 There are university students from Brazil. 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.270
 It is Sergio who is the channel of 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.280
 University taking it is a while back 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.469
 I did a video about 50 facts about the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.540
 college if you did not see it he would have 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.849
 to make a video with 50 facts about the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.160
 teachers do they deserve it right? 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.289
 they deserve because often we students 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.630
 we're barely talking about him cursing 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.369
 Complaining with the teacher was everything 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.470
 Just like my teacher said, it 's the same 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.119
 cholesterol having good and bad and 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.220
 if you happen to be a teacher you are 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.199
 watching this video you are a good teacher 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.610
 why the good teacher watch the videos of 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.290
 university to the cliff a fact 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.719
 interesting thing about teachers is that 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.670
 They also made mistakes and were very 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.020
 time to do exercises on the board is good 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.059
 also when correcting the tests 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.840
 it was time to not admit that too 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.489
 err 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.860
 besides being wrong, we can also say that 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.840
 many teachers confuse some 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.700
 They can say that they lie but like me. 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.530
 I find lie a very heavy word 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.449
 let's say they get confused if 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.120
 confuse when it comes to proving that 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.820
 will fall x but kym confuse about the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.590
 level of proof is easy, I guarantee 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.329
 they confuse when sending the slides or 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.140
 other content they said that 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.000
 were going to walk 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.159
 look at this chart that will fall on the test 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.080
 not in your material come in 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.939
 home is sending to the class email 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.100
 are also confused about when 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.850
 they will release the notes from the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.979
 evidences 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.470
 they always take time and talk about 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.049
 teacher is a being who does the 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.630
 things take a great example of this 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.430
 they make our diploma take longer to 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.470
 reach mourÃ£o also to end the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.509
 even though sometimes they themselves have 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.369
 arrived late to class until the end 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.350
 sometimes class takes time to start because 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.600
 although the person has three doctorates 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.549
 it takes three hours to connect the date 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.340
 show and class takes time to start because the 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.110
 teacher does not live without a slide and I think 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.390
 that this is the greatest fact of all 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.460
 teachers have difficulty and date 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.840
 show and projectors in fact in general the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.180
 teachers have problems with technology 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.189
 which does not prevent them from having 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.649
 facebook but many teachers are 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.780
 ghosts on facebook and it seems that 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.670
 stay there just watching the lives of the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.259
 students and posting other 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.750
 technology that teachers also have 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.329
 difficulty with the internal system of the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.860
 your college does not follow didactic portal 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.810
 I know what you call the most, I'm sure. 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.760
 that the supreme only has difficulty with 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.470
 that thing besides the new one takes to 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.750
 leave 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.210
 besides the wrong way I do not know why 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.030
 that it's so hard to round two and a half 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.410
 for 7 it's not because it's right there right 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.020
 other technology that teachers 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.910
 They also do not like the phone very much. 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.250
 This means with our cell phone. 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.110
 because when it touches my 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.600
 phone ringing need wait a minute meet 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.550
 because it is important to mean that 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.560
 things then we make a cell phone 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.720
 It's not important, is not it? 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.030
 it's actually most of the times it's not 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.580
 not yet another fact is that the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.709
 teachers also break the rules but 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.520
 besides breaking rules besides breaking 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.080
 promises 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.790
 another thing that teachers also 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.400
 want not only pa 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.490
 You 're professor, now you're talking to 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.870
 half the words so that the students 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.180
 I do not know what part of the 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.340
 did they learn it but there it is 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.700
 another fact as incredible as it may seem 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.590
 is not the strong point of many 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.750
 teachers the teacher talks and the people 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.920
 Do not understand the teacher, do not talk to us. 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.420
 understand but he asks if people 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.190
 understood we say yes and he 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.620
 believes the teacher also loves 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.910
 invent other methods to try 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.680
 teach the subject eg the 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.360
 teachers and pick up students set up a 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.640
 discussion wheel for students 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.470
 explain what it should be 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.630
 explaining the same way many times 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.910
 hold seminars for students to 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.890
 class that is supposed to and even when there 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.440
 something wrong it takes points 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.750
 many points teacher loves to take 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.840
 point and when that happens he always 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.580
 says the classic phrases of teachers 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.590
 any teacher speaks in my time was 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.630
 different we were not had was not 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.299
 roast did that did that 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.280
 teacher speaks looks at who study 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.739
 Proof will be easy for every teacher. 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.380
 Some day I've spoken like that without time. 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.299
 what do you do midnight cleanliness and 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.160
 speaks also rest assured of proof 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.440
 will be the same as the exercises I gave 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.049
 in the classroom and on top of all 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.890
 teacher speaks that look this is 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.019
 elementary 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.790
 This is trivial, you should have 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.950
 I learned this in the fifth grade 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.930
 old whoa where he made the fifth grade 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.030
 rock band by the phrase that teachers 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.000
 I also said that the teacher does not 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.459
 disapproves students who do not study seriously 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.140
 Old is something that seems to joke it is 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.760
 another fact about teachers 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.040
 teacher loves to count 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.170
 more than half of these jokes do not have 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.610
 grace and the other half I can not 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.070
 understand as well as I do not 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.900
 I can understand how they send mail. 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.600
 The class is running ten minutes away 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.270
 When is everyone there in college already? 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.210
 but it is a fact and we have to understand 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.460
 that the teacher also has a personal life 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.460
 has so much personal life that many times 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.800
 spend half the lesson counting on life 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.810
 them and makes a point of 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.670
 tell all his political ideology 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.350
 even if it has nothing to do with 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.810
 the class as well as the teacher as well 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.700
 speaks ill of the university within the 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.620
 university and still give moral 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.050
 the people using those phrases I 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.370
 I said up there that in his time there 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.680
 but the fact that teachers 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.870
 forget that we also have life 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.940
 social and teacher loves to end the 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.160
 our social life by marking all 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.260
 after the holiday, in addition to having 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.270
 a radar of tests to mark all the 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.940
 evidence along with the 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.890
 other teachers and that's why and why 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.500
 much more than it is a fact that the 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.180
 Teachers are beings one and is by 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.700
 that we love the teachers 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.230
 teachers we love you after 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.150
 we are clear and it is a pity that 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.580
 teachers are often not 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.410
 recognize and will have to strike and 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.780
 sometimes even there fight with the police to 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.520
 technical rights recognize the 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.600
 because the state the government says it does not 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.190
 have money 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.840
 we know that governments here is 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.160
 municipal or state has 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.350
 money the country is charging 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.870
 taxes are those who have money is because they're 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.250
 poorly managed and give teachers strength 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.960
 we are on your side 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.310
