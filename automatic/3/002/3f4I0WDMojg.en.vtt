00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:28.930

and<00:00:29.150> then<00:00:29.300> starts<00:00:29.660> to<00:00:29.750> play

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.900 

monitor<00:00:36.510> be

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.920 

d<00:00:43.030> will<00:00:44.030> power<00:00:44.300> it<00:00:44.480> up<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:47.210> watch<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.570> buttons

d will power it up and watch the buttons

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.000 
d will power it up and watch the buttons
about<00:00:48.500> 30<00:00:48.800> seconds<00:00:49.370> or<00:00:49.430> so<00:00:50.500> they'll<00:00:51.500> power<00:00:51.800> off

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
about 30 seconds or so they'll power off

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.550 
about 30 seconds or so they'll power off
and<00:00:53.000> it<00:00:53.120> doesn't<00:00:53.330> show<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.630> envision<00:00:54.260> screen

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
and it doesn't show the envision screen

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:04.490 
and it doesn't show the envision screen
like<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.920> other<00:00:55.070> monitor<00:00:55.550> did

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.649

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:19.960 

so<00:01:08.229> I'll<00:01:08.350> put<00:01:08.560> a<00:01:08.590> disc<00:01:08.920> in

it<00:01:20.510> never<00:01:20.860> goes<00:01:21.860> to<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:22.070> DVD<00:01:22.460> screen<00:01:22.940> and<00:01:23.920> then

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
it never goes to the DVD screen and then

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.920 
it never goes to the DVD screen and then
a<00:01:24.950> few<00:01:25.370> seconds<00:01:25.880> it<00:01:26.030> will<00:01:26.120> power<00:01:26.270> itself<00:01:26.720> off

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
a few seconds it will power itself off

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.290 
a few seconds it will power itself off
again<00:01:30.490> they<00:01:31.490> turn<00:01:31.730> it<00:01:31.880> back<00:01:32.030> on

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
again they turn it back on

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.600 
again they turn it back on
