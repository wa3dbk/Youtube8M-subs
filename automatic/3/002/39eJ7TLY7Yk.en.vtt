but this shape is kind of an interesting

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.539 
but this shape is kind of an interesting
shape<00:01:09.210> because<00:01:09.600> most<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:11.040> are<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.220> lot<00:01:11.430> of

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
shape because most there are a lot of

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.719 
shape because most there are a lot of
shapes<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.299> just<00:01:12.869> say<00:01:13.200> command<00:01:13.890> u

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
shapes that you can just say command u

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.630 
shapes that you can just say command u
and<00:01:15.149> ungroup<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.229> shapes<00:01:18.259> but<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:20.009> one<00:01:20.310> is

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640

also not only a grouping but it's
another<00:01:23.609> type<00:01:23.999> of<00:01:24.030> grouping<00:01:24.569> called<00:01:24.600> a

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
another type of grouping called a

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.370 
another type of grouping called a
compound<00:01:25.439> path<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.880> order<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.600> edit

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
compound path and so in order to edit

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.429 
compound path and so in order to edit
the<00:01:28.799> individual<00:01:29.549> these<00:01:30.299> individual<00:01:31.109> shapes

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
the individual these individual shapes

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.279

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
one and release the compound path in

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:46.279 
one and release the compound path in
order<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:43.709> edit<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.670> individual<00:01:45.359> shapes<00:01:45.659> so

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.670 
once and delete them just by holding my
mouse<00:02:14.520> button<00:02:14.819> down<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:15.690> want<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.590> be

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
mouse button down and you want to be

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.110 
mouse button down and you want to be
careful<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.370> don't<00:02:17.400> get<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.849> now<00:02:18.060> I

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
careful that you don't get that now I

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.170 
careful that you don't get that now I
just<00:02:18.240> move<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.500> will<00:02:19.740> obviously

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
just move that and that will obviously

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.850 
just move that and that will obviously
compromise<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.390> shape<00:02:21.570> of<00:02:21.690> my<00:02:21.810> flower<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.830> I

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
compromise the shape of my flower so I

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.979 
compromise the shape of my flower so I
can<00:02:23.100> just<00:02:23.250> go<00:02:23.400> command<00:02:23.850> Z<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.360> undo<00:02:24.390> the

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
can just go command Z to undo the

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.949 
can just go command Z to undo the
and<00:02:25.260> just<00:02:25.950> select<00:02:26.370> these<00:02:26.750> individually<00:02:27.750> and

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
and just select these individually and

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.679 
and just select these individually and
delete<00:02:28.590> them<00:02:28.829> so<00:02:29.489> I'm<00:02:29.579> just<00:02:29.760> clicking<00:02:30.030> and

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
delete them so I'm just clicking and

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.050 
delete them so I'm just clicking and
hitting<00:02:31.469> my<00:02:31.620> delete<00:02:31.950> button<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:34.530> is

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
hitting my delete button and that is

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.920 
hitting my delete button and that is
that's<00:02:36.060> right<00:02:36.510> there

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
that's right there

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.849 
that's right there
now<00:02:37.409> once<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.640> am<00:02:38.819> done<00:02:39.180> with<00:02:39.750> deleting<00:02:40.620> those

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
now once I am done with deleting those

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:44.420 
now once I am done with deleting those
Center<00:02:41.340> points<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:42.000> am<00:02:42.959> going<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.650> I'll<00:02:44.099> zoom

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
Center points I am going to I'll zoom

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.699 
Center points I am going to I'll zoom
back<00:02:44.489> out<00:02:44.819> just<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.239> little<00:02:45.510> bit<00:02:45.659> here<00:02:46.019> so<00:02:46.560> that

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
back out just a little bit here so that

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.220 
back out just a little bit here so that
we<00:02:46.829> can<00:02:47.010> get<00:02:47.159> all<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.489> it<00:02:47.549> in<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.909> the<00:02:48.629> view<00:02:49.019> at

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
we can get all of it in the the view at

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.190 
we can get all of it in the the view at
once<00:02:49.560> I'm<00:02:49.980> going<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.879> click<00:02:51.389> over<00:02:51.569> here<00:02:52.019> and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
once I'm going to click over here and

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.599 
once I'm going to click over here and
drag<00:02:52.500> around<00:02:52.799> all<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.310> these<00:02:53.909> shapes<00:02:54.389> here<00:02:55.609> so

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
drag around all of these shapes here so

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.839 
drag around all of these shapes here so
now<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.819> have<00:02:57.120> all<00:02:57.329> of<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:57.720> selected<00:02:58.349> again

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
now I have all of this selected again

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.429 
now I have all of this selected again
I'm<00:02:59.849> thinking<00:03:00.359> I<00:03:00.629> missed<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.079> bottom

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
I'm thinking I missed that bottom

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.039 
I'm thinking I missed that bottom
portion<00:03:01.859> so<00:03:02.489> just<00:03:02.819> click<00:03:03.030> around<00:03:03.209> all<00:03:03.689> of<00:03:03.720> the

portion so just click around all of the

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.009 
portion so just click around all of the
shapes<00:03:04.319> here<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:05.060> I'm<00:03:06.060> going<00:03:06.419> to<00:03:06.480> make<00:03:06.810> it

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
shapes here and I'm going to make it

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.009 
shapes here and I'm going to make it
back<00:03:07.260> into<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.739> compound<00:03:08.280> path<00:03:08.579> a<00:03:09.019> compound

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
back into a compound path a compound

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.750 
back into a compound path a compound
path<00:03:10.230> is<00:03:10.530> I<00:03:10.739> don't<00:03:10.889> know<00:03:11.189> a<00:03:11.219> whole<00:03:11.489> lot<00:03:11.549> about

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
path is I don't know a whole lot about

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.209 
path is I don't know a whole lot about
it<00:03:12.180> but<00:03:12.299> it<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.870> alters<00:03:13.409> the<00:03:13.680> way<00:03:13.829> that<00:03:14.069> it's

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:14.219 
it but it it alters the way that it's

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:15.949 
it but it it alters the way that it's
filled<00:03:14.579> if<00:03:14.909> you<00:03:15.030> were<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.269> fill<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.599> with<00:03:15.719> color

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
filled if you were to fill it with color

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.959 
filled if you were to fill it with color
so<00:03:16.650> I'm<00:03:16.799> just<00:03:17.040> gonna<00:03:17.159> select<00:03:17.430> all<00:03:17.760> those

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:17.969 
so I'm just gonna select all those

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:19.909 
so I'm just gonna select all those
shapes<00:03:18.299> again<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.900> I'm<00:03:19.349> going<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.709> right

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
shapes again and I'm going to right

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.770 
shapes again and I'm going to right
click<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.400> I'm<00:03:20.549> gonna<00:03:20.730> go<00:03:20.879> make<00:03:21.180> compound

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
click and I'm gonna go make compound

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.539 
click and I'm gonna go make compound
paths<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:23.659> then<00:03:24.659> I<00:03:24.689> can<00:03:25.230> group<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.739> as<00:03:26.010> well<00:03:26.280> or

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
paths and then I can group it as well or

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.250 
paths and then I can group it as well or
it<00:03:26.909> doesn't<00:03:27.090> actually<00:03:27.329> need<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:27.900> be<00:03:27.989> grouped

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
it doesn't actually need to be grouped

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.530 
it doesn't actually need to be grouped
once<00:03:28.530> it's<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:28.769> compound<00:03:29.220> path<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.729> did<00:03:30.299> however

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
once it's a compound path I did however

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.050 
once it's a compound path I did however
find<00:03:30.810> that<00:03:31.260> with<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:31.769> shape<00:03:32.129> the<00:03:32.579> original

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
find that with this shape the original

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.449 
find that with this shape the original
shape<00:03:33.329> if<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:33.720> just<00:03:34.139> release<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.829> compound

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
shape if I just release the compound

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.170 
shape if I just release the compound
path<00:03:35.729> it<00:03:36.269> did<00:03:36.540> not<00:03:36.720> allow<00:03:37.319> me<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:38.040> edit<00:03:38.819> the

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
path it did not allow me to edit the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.839 
path it did not allow me to edit the
center<00:03:39.599> points<00:03:40.109> by<00:03:40.530> themselves<00:03:41.069> I<00:03:41.220> also<00:03:41.430> had

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
center points by themselves I also had

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.770 
center points by themselves I also had
to<00:03:41.970> ungroup<00:03:42.359> it<00:03:42.659> so<00:03:43.409> I<00:03:43.819> have<00:03:44.819> this<00:03:45.030> flower<00:03:45.419> with

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
to ungroup it so I have this flower with

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.330 
to ungroup it so I have this flower with
the<00:03:45.810> center<00:03:46.290> points<00:03:46.590> taken<00:03:46.799> out<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.220> this

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
the center points taken out and this

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.580 
the center points taken out and this
allowed<00:03:47.699> me<00:03:47.939> to<00:03:47.970> put<00:03:48.419> pearls<00:03:48.900> right<00:03:49.169> here<00:03:49.470> in

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
allowed me to put pearls right here in

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.659 
allowed me to put pearls right here in
this<00:03:49.709> flower<00:03:50.060> if<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.689> were<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.229> go<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.560> file<00:03:53.250> and

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
this flower if I were to go to file and

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:57.050 
this flower if I were to go to file and
save<00:03:54.239> or<00:03:54.599> save<00:03:54.930> as<00:03:55.229> this<00:03:56.129> would<00:03:56.430> save<00:03:56.729> it<00:03:56.909> as

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
save or save as this would save it as

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.990 
save or save as this would save it as

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.800 
use it I can just see it in my library
rather<00:04:11.129> than<00:04:11.459> going<00:04:11.699> to<00:04:11.819> my<00:04:12.090> documents<00:04:12.750> to

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
rather than going to my documents to

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.460 
rather than going to my documents to
find<00:04:13.199> it<00:04:13.409> so<00:04:14.220> I<00:04:14.489> have<00:04:14.819> the<00:04:15.000> shape<00:04:15.229> selected<00:04:16.229> and

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
find it so I have the shape selected and

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.879 
find it so I have the shape selected and
I'm<00:04:16.590> going<00:04:16.859> to<00:04:16.919> go<00:04:17.130> file<00:04:17.459> save<00:04:18.109> to<00:04:19.109> library<00:04:19.590> and

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
I'm going to go file save to library and

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.510 
I'm going to go file save to library and
this<00:04:20.519> brings<00:04:20.820> up<00:04:21.000> this<00:04:21.560> or<00:04:22.560> this<00:04:22.800> screen<00:04:23.190> here

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
this brings up this or this screen here

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.149 
this brings up this or this screen here
and<00:04:23.729> I<00:04:24.270> can<00:04:24.479> name<00:04:24.659> it<00:04:24.720> whatever<00:04:25.050> I<00:04:25.380> want

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
and I can name it whatever I want

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:33.080 
and I can name it whatever I want
flower<00:04:26.930> center<00:04:28.639> removed<00:04:29.639> and<00:04:30.830> I<00:04:31.830> know<00:04:32.099> that

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
flower center removed and I know that

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.480 
flower center removed and I know that
the<00:04:33.810> original<00:04:34.909> artist<00:04:35.909> was<00:04:36.210> pebbles<00:04:37.279> so<00:04:38.279> I

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
the original artist was pebbles so I

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.659 
the original artist was pebbles so I
can<00:04:38.610> save<00:04:38.880> that<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:39.569> I<00:04:40.530> can<00:04:40.740> go<00:04:40.889> into<00:04:41.099> regular

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
can save that and I can go into regular

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.550 
can save that and I can go into regular
cut<00:04:41.880> I<00:04:42.030> could<00:04:42.210> put<00:04:42.360> any<00:04:42.539> keywords<00:04:43.110> in<00:04:43.319> here

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
cut I could put any keywords in here

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
cut I could put any keywords in here
that<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:43.740> want<00:04:44.720> flower<00:04:45.720> and<00:04:46.440> I<00:04:47.130> could<00:04:47.400> add

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
that I want flower and I could add

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.050 
that I want flower and I could add
another<00:04:47.610> one<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:48.180> say<00:04:48.449> spring<00:04:49.699> that<00:04:50.699> just

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
another one and say spring that just

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.089 
another one and say spring that just
makes<00:04:51.330> it<00:04:51.569> when<00:04:51.750> you're<00:04:51.960> searching<00:04:52.349> your

makes it when you're searching your

makes it when you're searching your

those when you search those things you

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.870 
those when you search those things you
could<00:04:58.169> put<00:04:58.289> a<00:04:58.349> description<00:04:58.830> here<00:04:59.190> but<00:04:59.460> anyway

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
could put a description here but anyway

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.570 
could put a description here but anyway
and<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.990> get<00:05:01.139> the<00:05:01.319> point<00:05:01.620> of<00:05:01.830> that<00:05:02.009> and<00:05:02.280> if<00:05:02.460> I

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
and you get the point of that and if I

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.749 
and you get the point of that and if I
just<00:05:02.849> hit<00:05:03.000> OK<00:05:03.919> when<00:05:04.919> I<00:05:04.949> go<00:05:05.190> back<00:05:05.370> into<00:05:05.580> my

just hit OK when I go back into my

flower<00:05:10.259> center<00:05:10.800> removed<00:05:11.130> now<00:05:11.580> you<00:05:11.639> can<00:05:11.849> see

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030

I've<00:05:12.120> done<00:05:12.300> a<00:05:12.330> couple<00:05:12.569> of<00:05:12.840> these<00:05:13.020> and<00:05:13.909> here<00:05:14.909> but

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
I've done a couple of these and here but

I've done a couple of these and here but
this<00:05:15.360> was<00:05:15.539> the<00:05:15.690> original<00:05:15.780> one<00:05:16.139> I<00:05:16.259> did<00:05:16.500> this<00:05:16.650> was

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
this was the original one I did this was

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.370 
this was the original one I did this was
the<00:05:16.860> one<00:05:17.099> I<00:05:17.130> just<00:05:17.250> did<00:05:17.580> it<00:05:18.090> will<00:05:18.240> also<00:05:18.599> so<00:05:19.199> that

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
the one I just did it will also so that

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.020 
the one I just did it will also so that
shows<00:05:19.590> up<00:05:19.770> in<00:05:19.889> my<00:05:20.069> own<00:05:20.250> design<00:05:20.639> but<00:05:20.849> it<00:05:20.940> will

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
shows up in my own design but it will

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.920 
shows up in my own design but it will
also<00:05:21.270> show<00:05:21.509> up<00:05:21.870> and<00:05:22.050> show<00:05:22.319> all<00:05:22.620> designs<00:05:23.099> and

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
also show up and show all designs and

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.950 
also show up and show all designs and
you<00:05:24.930> can<00:05:25.080> see<00:05:25.289> there<00:05:25.470> down<00:05:25.620> here<00:05:25.919> so<00:05:26.880> I<00:05:27.150> hope
