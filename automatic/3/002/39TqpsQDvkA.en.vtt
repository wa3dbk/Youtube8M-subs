here
I<00:00:16.800> want<00:00:17.800> to<00:00:17.890> already<00:00:18.279> build<00:00:18.579> this<00:00:18.759> up<00:00:18.939> a<00:00:19.060> little

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
I want to already build this up a little

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.729 
I want to already build this up a little
bit<00:00:19.390> but<00:00:19.599> I<00:00:19.630> want<00:00:19.810> to<00:00:19.869> build<00:00:20.020> up<00:00:20.200> this<00:00:20.349> site<00:00:20.590> now

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:20.739 
bit but I want to build up this site now

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:23.040 
bit but I want to build up this site now
I<00:00:20.770> think<00:00:21.040> I<00:00:21.130> did<00:00:21.310> another<00:00:21.520> video<00:00:21.810> or<00:00:22.810> it<00:00:22.899> kind

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
I think I did another video or it kind

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.859 
I think I did another video or it kind
of<00:00:23.200> showed<00:00:23.439> how<00:00:23.619> to<00:00:23.649> do<00:00:23.890> this<00:00:24.130> but<00:00:24.759> if<00:00:25.599> not

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
of showed how to do this but if not

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:37.020 
of showed how to do this but if not
here's<00:00:26.770> another<00:00:27.009> one<00:00:27.509> so<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:35.520> use<00:00:36.520> the<00:00:36.760> same

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
here's another one so I use the same

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.480 
here's another one so I use the same
thing<00:00:37.330> to<00:00:37.420> build<00:00:37.630> up<00:00:37.780> the<00:00:37.900> body<00:00:38.080> head

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.490 
thing to build up the body head

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.520 
thing to build up the body head
basically<00:00:39.490> what<00:00:39.970> you<00:00:40.120> do<00:00:40.300> you<00:00:40.960> just<00:00:40.990> tape<00:00:41.410> it

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
basically what you do you just tape it

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.950 
basically what you do you just tape it
on<00:00:41.710> there<00:00:42.010> and<00:00:42.910> when<00:00:43.030> I<00:00:43.120> start<00:00:43.390> to<00:00:43.480> play<00:00:43.630> a<00:00:43.660> bud

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
on there and when I start to play a bud

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.990 
on there and when I start to play a bud
all<00:00:44.290> day<00:00:44.440> but<00:00:44.710> really<00:00:45.070> Finley<00:00:45.520> in<00:00:45.640> here<00:00:45.880> and

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
all day but really Finley in here and

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.490 
all day but really Finley in here and
then<00:00:46.090> kind<00:00:46.450> of<00:00:46.480> go<00:00:46.630> into<00:00:46.810> the<00:00:46.960> cracks<00:00:47.230> will

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
then kind of go into the cracks will

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:57.500 
then kind of go into the cracks will
build<00:00:47.860> the<00:00:47.980> edge<00:00:48.150> so<00:00:49.150> I<00:00:49.210> have<00:00:49.360> somewhere<00:00:49.660> to<00:00:49.720> go

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.710 

and<00:00:59.250> it's<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.520> ball<00:01:00.700> spots<00:01:01.000> only<00:01:01.149> right<00:01:01.420> here

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
and it's the ball spots only right here

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:24.460 
and it's the ball spots only right here
right<00:01:04.720> there

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.260 

okay<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.530> trick<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:26.039> this<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.819> want<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.119> get

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
okay the trick on this you want to get

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.580 
okay the trick on this you want to get
it<00:01:27.390> kind<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.289> tacky<00:01:28.789> the<00:01:29.789> mud<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.179> kind<00:01:30.450> of

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
it kind of tacky the mud is kind of

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:45.020 
it kind of tacky the mud is kind of
still<00:01:31.590> soft<00:01:43.369> you<00:01:44.369> got<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.610> do<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.789> when<00:01:44.909> it's

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
still soft you got to do it when it's

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:56.510 
still soft you got to do it when it's
soft<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.569> just<00:01:46.500> take<00:01:46.709> your<00:01:55.250> there's<00:01:56.250> quite<00:01:56.489> a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
soft so just take your there's quite a

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.219 
soft so just take your there's quite a
bit<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.759> an<00:01:56.880> edge<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.209> there<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.659> that's

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
bit of an edge on there and that's

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.929 
bit of an edge on there and that's
really<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:58.979> wanted

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
really what I wanted

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.539 
really what I wanted
just<00:02:00.450> enough<00:02:00.959> to<00:02:01.170> build<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.649> up<00:02:01.799> also<00:02:02.189> have

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
just enough to build it up also have

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.249 
just enough to build it up also have
some<00:02:02.700> still<00:02:02.970> photos<00:02:03.000> it'll<00:02:03.569> put<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:03.959> here<00:02:04.140> as

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
some still photos it'll put in here as

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.620 
some still photos it'll put in here as
well<00:02:04.439> it's<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.890> little<00:02:05.069> easier<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.429> see<00:02:05.670> and

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
well it's a little easier to see and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.039 
well it's a little easier to see and
then<00:02:06.810> I'll<00:02:06.959> build<00:02:07.259> off<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.950> edge<00:02:09.049> down

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
then I'll build off of this edge down

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.129 
then I'll build off of this edge down
into<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.649> part<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.310> it's<00:02:11.549> nice<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.139> so

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:13.139 
into this part so that it's nice and so

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:15.289 
into this part so that it's nice and so
but<00:02:13.350> that's<00:02:13.440> just<00:02:13.680> I'm<00:02:13.920> building<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.459> up<00:02:14.609> it's

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
but that's just I'm building it up it's

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.150 
but that's just I'm building it up it's
a<00:02:15.420> 90<00:02:15.720> percent<00:02:15.840> that'll<00:02:16.290> be<00:02:16.410> gone<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.829> sounded

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
a 90 percent that'll be gone and sounded

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.979 
a 90 percent that'll be gone and sounded
down<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:17.639> does<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.150> give<00:02:18.299> you<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.480> nice<00:02:18.660> crisp

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
down but does it give you a nice crisp

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:45.270 
down but does it give you a nice crisp
edge

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.339 

use<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.310> straightedge<00:02:47.080> let's<00:02:48.080> see<00:02:48.200> how

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
use a straightedge let's see how

00:02:48.349 --> 00:03:19.880 
use a straightedge let's see how
straight<00:02:48.590> our<00:02:48.769> body<00:02:48.980> line<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:51.040> walking<00:02:52.040> first

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.050 

hi

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.949 

the<00:03:23.450> body<00:03:23.690> lands
