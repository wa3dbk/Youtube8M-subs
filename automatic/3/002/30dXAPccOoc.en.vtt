00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
generator we could just shoot it and

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.650

to<00:02:14.300> use<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:14.960> that<00:02:15.080> both<00:02:15.350> of<00:02:15.470> your<00:02:15.560> guns<00:02:15.830> use

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
to use and that both of your guns use

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.300 
to use and that both of your guns use
the<00:02:16.340> same<00:02:16.640> ammo<00:02:17.470> they<00:02:18.470> never<00:02:18.710> have<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.890> reload

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
the same ammo they never have to reload

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.190 
the same ammo they never have to reload
which<00:02:19.580> is<00:02:19.730> kind<00:02:19.940> of<00:02:20.000> nice<00:02:20.210> but<00:02:20.570> they<00:02:20.720> both<00:02:20.930> do

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
which is kind of nice but they both do

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.470 
which is kind of nice but they both do
use<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.590> same<00:02:21.800> ammo<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.700> just<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:23.210> eat

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
use the same ammo and you just you eat

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.650 
use the same ammo and you just you eat
through<00:02:23.810> ammo<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:24.890> quickly<00:02:25.460> that<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:26.570> are

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
through ammo so quickly that you are

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.450 
through ammo so quickly that you are
always<00:02:27.580> almost<00:02:28.580> out<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.090> ammo<00:02:29.360> in<00:02:29.570> this<00:02:29.720> game

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
always almost out of ammo in this game

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.650 
always almost out of ammo in this game
and<00:02:31.460> we're<00:02:31.640> going<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.820> thermal<00:02:32.330> detonator

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
and we're going to thermal detonator

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.690 
and we're going to thermal detonator
these<00:02:33.020> guys<00:02:33.290> I<00:02:35.200> think<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.290> killed<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.890> one<00:02:37.460> and

he<00:02:42.050> did<00:02:42.230> not<00:02:42.380> die<00:02:43.120> every<00:02:44.120> once<00:02:44.300> in<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.450> while

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
he did not die every once in a while

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.030 
he did not die every once in a while
they'll<00:02:44.750> hit<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.050> but<00:02:45.200> normally<00:02:45.740> if<00:02:45.800> you<00:02:45.860> just

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
keep moving around and random directions

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.920

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
out maybe nope it's kind of hard to do

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.350 
out maybe nope it's kind of hard to do
because<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.100> bullets<00:03:40.370> moves<00:03:40.550> so<00:03:40.730> slow<00:03:41.000> or

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
because the bullets moves so slow or

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.300 
because the bullets moves so slow or
they're<00:03:41.630> not<00:03:41.660> bullets<00:03:42.140> but<00:03:42.350> you<00:03:43.100> know<00:03:43.160> what<00:03:43.250> I

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
they're not bullets but you know what I

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.130 
they're not bullets but you know what I
mean<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:44.680> projectiles<00:03:45.680> that<00:03:45.920> kill<00:03:47.140> move

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
mean the projectiles that kill move

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.180 
mean the projectiles that kill move
slowly<00:03:49.630> yeah<00:03:50.630> I'm<00:03:51.050> almost<00:03:51.380> out<00:03:51.530> of<00:03:51.590> ammo<00:03:51.860> again

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
slowly yeah I'm almost out of ammo again

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.660 
slowly yeah I'm almost out of ammo again
just<00:03:52.750> you're<00:03:53.750> always<00:03:53.950> putting<00:03:54.950> just<00:03:55.190> so<00:03:55.489> many

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
just you're always putting just so many

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.970 
just you're always putting just so many
bullets<00:03:56.030> into<00:03:56.239> the<00:03:56.330> air<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:56.750> so<00:03:57.470> few<00:03:57.800> of<00:03:57.830> them

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
bullets into the air and so few of them

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.590 
bullets into the air and so few of them
are<00:03:58.100> hitting<00:03:58.400> because<00:03:58.489> they<00:03:58.730> move<00:03:58.970> so<00:03:59.300> slowly

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
are hitting because they move so slowly

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.620 
are hitting because they move so slowly
and<00:03:59.780> they're<00:03:59.900> so<00:04:00.110> inaccurate<00:04:01.150> okay<00:04:02.150> now<00:04:02.390> I'll

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
and they're so inaccurate okay now I'll

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.199 
and they're so inaccurate okay now I'll
go<00:04:02.750> down<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:02.989> maintenance<00:04:03.260> arrow<00:04:03.560> later<00:04:04.209> we

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
go down that maintenance arrow later we

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.050 
go down that maintenance arrow later we
are<00:04:05.330> trying<00:04:05.660> to<00:04:05.989> get<00:04:06.489> we're<00:04:07.489> trying<00:04:07.790> to<00:04:07.850> open

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
are trying to get we're trying to open

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.520 
are trying to get we're trying to open
up<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.270> other<00:04:08.420> two<00:04:08.660> areas<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.500> face

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
up the other two areas of the face

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.830 
up the other two areas of the face
they're<00:04:09.980> closed<00:04:10.340> off<00:04:10.580> right<00:04:10.850> now<00:04:11.000> i<00:04:11.030> guess<00:04:11.690> i

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
they're closed off right now i guess i

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.290 
they're closed off right now i guess i
can<00:04:11.989> show<00:04:12.170> you<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:12.350> real<00:04:12.410> quick<00:04:13.300> through

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
can show you that real quick through

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.599 
can show you that real quick through
this<00:04:14.450> window<00:04:14.660> you<00:04:14.840> should<00:04:14.989> be<00:04:15.050> able<00:04:15.110> to<00:04:15.260> see

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
this window you should be able to see

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.770 
this window you should be able to see
there's<00:04:16.609> an<00:04:16.760> area<00:04:17.000> there<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:17.270> then<00:04:17.540> there's

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
there's an area there and then there's

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.620 
there's an area there and then there's
an<00:04:17.900> area<00:04:18.230> along<00:04:19.130> that<00:04:19.400> path<00:04:19.640> there<00:04:20.000> they're

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
an area along that path there they're

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.360 
an area along that path there they're
both<00:04:20.840> blocked<00:04:21.289> off<00:04:21.530> right<00:04:21.859> now<00:04:22.039> they're<00:04:22.250> both

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
both blocked off right now they're both

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.200 
both blocked off right now they're both
locked<00:04:22.760> down

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
locked down

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.270 
locked down
we're<00:04:24.600> trying<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.169> go<00:04:25.350> open<00:04:25.680> them<00:04:25.830> up<00:04:25.919> so<00:04:26.160> that

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
we're trying to go open them up so that

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.570 
we're trying to go open them up so that
we<00:04:26.310> can<00:04:26.520> go<00:04:26.669> in<00:04:26.819> there<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.330> kill<00:04:28.259> stuff

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
we can go in there and kill stuff

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:37.150 
we can go in there and kill stuff
because<00:04:30.259> that's<00:04:31.259> what<00:04:31.800> we<00:04:31.919> do<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:35.060> where<00:04:36.060> is

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
because that's what we do and where is

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.689 
because that's what we do and where is
my<00:04:38.160> ammo<00:04:38.550> and<00:04:38.789> health<00:04:38.819> thank<00:04:39.449> you<00:04:39.630> I<00:04:40.430> need<00:04:41.430> the

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
my ammo and health thank you I need the

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.339 
my ammo and health thank you I need the
ammo<00:04:42.180> more<00:04:42.360> than<00:04:42.509> I<00:04:42.569> need<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:42.840> health<00:04:43.050> but<00:04:43.289> the

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 
ammo more than I need the health but the

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.510 
ammo more than I need the health but the
health<00:04:43.530> is<00:04:43.680> nice<00:04:43.889> too<00:04:45.710> we're<00:04:46.710> going<00:04:46.949> to<00:04:47.069> charge

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
health is nice too we're going to charge

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.120 
health is nice too we're going to charge
kill<00:04:47.970> this<00:04:48.150> guy<00:04:48.360> right<00:04:48.569> in<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.750> head<00:04:48.979> see<00:04:49.979> it's

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
kill this guy right in the head see it's

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.710 
kill this guy right in the head see it's
easy<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.460> kill<00:04:50.639> stuff<00:04:50.880> when<00:04:51.060> they<00:04:51.180> stand<00:04:51.389> still

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
easy to kill stuff when they stand still

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.110 
easy to kill stuff when they stand still
but<00:04:51.960> if<00:04:52.590> they're<00:04:52.800> moving<00:04:53.160> at<00:04:53.280> all<00:04:53.610> it's<00:04:53.910> really

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
but if they're moving at all it's really

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.610 
but if they're moving at all it's really
difficult<00:04:54.419> just<00:04:54.720> because<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:55.080> lasers<00:04:55.440> moves

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
difficult just because the lasers moves

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.770 
difficult just because the lasers moves
so<00:04:55.919> slow<00:04:56.280> which<00:04:56.520> doesn't<00:04:56.849> make<00:04:56.910> any<00:04:57.180> sense<00:04:57.599> at

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
so slow which doesn't make any sense at

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.960 
so slow which doesn't make any sense at
all<00:04:57.900> their<00:04:58.190> lasers<00:04:59.190> but<00:04:59.990> whatever<00:05:01.699> it<00:05:02.699> does

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
all their lasers but whatever it does

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.610 
all their lasers but whatever it does
make<00:05:03.180> it<00:05:03.330> kind<00:05:03.509> of<00:05:03.660> cool<00:05:03.900> that<00:05:03.930> you<00:05:04.229> can<00:05:04.349> dodge

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
make it kind of cool that you can dodge

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:12.890 
make it kind of cool that you can dodge
lasers<00:05:05.250> and<00:05:05.490> shit<00:05:06.860> no<00:05:08.180> die<00:05:11.150> there's<00:05:12.150> more<00:05:12.690> than

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
lasers and shit no die there's more than

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.350 
lasers and shit no die there's more than
that<00:05:13.080> I<00:05:13.110> know<00:05:13.349> there<00:05:13.680> is<00:05:13.710> where<00:05:14.430> are<00:05:14.580> you<00:05:17.360> what

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
I'm going to go get that extra ammo back

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.399 
I'm going to go get that extra ammo back
there<00:05:24.479> because<00:05:24.599> we're<00:05:24.810> going<00:05:24.900> to<00:05:24.960> need<00:05:25.050> that

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
there because we're going to need that

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.559 
there because we're going to need that
looks<00:05:26.310> like<00:05:26.430> I<00:05:26.520> said<00:05:26.699> you<00:05:26.789> always<00:05:27.060> run<00:05:27.360> out<00:05:27.479> of

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:27.569 
looks like I said you always run out of

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:31.339 
looks like I said you always run out of
ammo<00:05:27.840> in<00:05:27.900> this<00:05:27.990> game<00:05:28.229> ow<00:05:29.150> oh<00:05:30.150> I<00:05:30.780> did<00:05:31.080> pick<00:05:31.229> up

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
all the ammo I'll save that health in

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.600

found any way to get more than 50 health

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.020 
found any way to get more than 50 health
and<00:05:41.659> there's<00:05:42.659> the<00:05:42.870> blue<00:05:43.229> coat<00:05:43.849> we're<00:05:44.849> going<00:05:44.969> to

blight<00:05:50.849> lit<00:05:51.030> up<00:05:51.150> now<00:05:51.300> and<00:05:51.509> they're<00:05:51.630> open<00:05:51.930> and

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
blight lit up now and they're open and

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.570 
blight lit up now and they're open and
there's<00:05:52.199> a<00:05:52.259> map<00:05:52.469> of<00:05:52.620> them<00:05:52.770> we<00:05:53.219> could<00:05:53.340> hook<00:05:53.430> the

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
there's a map of them we could hook the

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.740 
there's a map of them we could hook the
camera<00:05:53.880> there<00:05:54.030> but<00:05:54.180> I<00:05:54.210> hate<00:05:54.389> looking<00:05:54.539> at

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
camera there but I hate looking at

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.420 
camera there but I hate looking at
cameras<00:05:55.110> it's<00:05:55.259> pointless<00:05:55.610> and<00:05:58.250> now<00:05:59.250> we're

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
cameras it's pointless and now we're

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.159 
cameras it's pointless and now we're
going<00:05:59.520> to<00:05:59.580> go<00:05:59.789> get<00:06:00.000> the<00:06:00.150> other<00:06:00.330> two<00:06:00.570> codes<00:06:00.930> so

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
going to go get the other two codes so

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.700 
going to go get the other two codes so
we<00:06:01.259> can<00:06:01.380> get<00:06:01.500> to<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:01.740> second<00:06:02.130> level<00:06:03.710> I've

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
we can get to the second level I've

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.070 
we can get to the second level I've
actually<00:06:05.250> memorized<00:06:06.090> all<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:06.389> codes<00:06:06.750> in<00:06:06.960> this

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
actually memorized all the codes in this

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.700 
actually memorized all the codes in this
game<00:06:07.349> it<00:06:08.000> wasn't<00:06:09.000> that<00:06:09.210> hard<00:06:09.479> I<00:06:09.780> just<00:06:09.990> play

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
game it wasn't that hard I just play

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:11.779 
game it wasn't that hard I just play
through<00:06:10.889> it<00:06:11.039> a<00:06:11.070> few<00:06:11.099> times<00:06:11.280> and<00:06:11.669> there

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:11.789 
through it a few times and there

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:14.749 
through it a few times and there
permanently<00:06:12.000> burned<00:06:12.539> into<00:06:12.840> my<00:06:12.930> memory<00:06:13.759> but

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
permanently burned into my memory but

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:16.490 
permanently burned into my memory but
we're<00:06:14.909> trying<00:06:15.150> to<00:06:15.240> enter<00:06:15.479> all<00:06:15.780> three<00:06:16.289> coats

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
we're trying to enter all three coats

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.020 
we're trying to enter all three coats
into<00:06:16.830> this<00:06:16.949> code<00:06:17.280> machine<00:06:17.490> so<00:06:17.789> you<00:06:17.849> have<00:06:17.940> the

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
into this code machine so you have the

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.149 
into this code machine so you have the
blue<00:06:18.150> code<00:06:18.389> there<00:06:18.570> which<00:06:18.719> I<00:06:18.840> have<00:06:19.110> the<00:06:19.919> green

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:20.159 
blue code there which I have the green

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:22.219 
blue code there which I have the green
code<00:06:20.430> and<00:06:20.699> the<00:06:20.820> red<00:06:21.000> coat<00:06:21.300> I<00:06:21.509> know<00:06:21.659> all<00:06:22.080> the

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
code and the red coat I know all the

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:23.570 
code and the red coat I know all the
codes<00:06:22.440> I<00:06:22.560> don't<00:06:22.710> need<00:06:22.889> to<00:06:23.039> go<00:06:23.130> get<00:06:23.250> them<00:06:23.460> but

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
codes I don't need to go get them but

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.740 
codes I don't need to go get them but
I'm<00:06:23.669> going<00:06:23.969> to<00:06:24.150> because<00:06:24.360> what<00:06:24.449> would<00:06:24.509> be<00:06:24.630> the

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
I'm going to because what would be the

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.120 
I'm going to because what would be the
fun<00:06:24.780> of<00:06:25.050> just<00:06:25.199> entering<00:06:25.560> them<00:06:25.740> in<00:06:25.830> that<00:06:26.039> would

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
fun of just entering them in that would

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.080 
fun of just entering them in that would
be<00:06:26.219> cheap<00:06:26.520> but<00:06:27.259> first<00:06:28.259> we<00:06:28.349> have<00:06:28.409> to<00:06:28.500> turn<00:06:28.680> it<00:06:28.830> on

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
be cheap but first we have to turn it on

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.209 
be cheap but first we have to turn it on
over<00:06:30.090> there<00:06:30.300> well<00:06:31.139> I<00:06:31.169> guess<00:06:31.289> we<00:06:31.440> can<00:06:31.590> get<00:06:32.070> the

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:32.219 
over there well I guess we can get the

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:33.529 
over there well I guess we can get the
codes<00:06:32.430> first<00:06:32.729> and<00:06:33.060> that's<00:06:33.210> what<00:06:33.330> I'm<00:06:33.389> going<00:06:33.479> to

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 
codes first and that's what I'm going to

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:35.600 
codes first and that's what I'm going to
do<00:06:33.630> anyway<00:06:33.979> we<00:06:34.979> have<00:06:35.070> to<00:06:35.159> turn<00:06:35.310> the<00:06:35.460> code

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
do anyway we have to turn the code

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.040 
do anyway we have to turn the code
machine<00:06:35.820> on<00:06:36.060> then<00:06:36.330> enter<00:06:36.570> the<00:06:36.690> codes<00:06:36.900> into

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
machine on then enter the codes into

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
machine on then enter the codes into
there<00:06:37.260> and<00:06:37.409> that

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
there and that

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.830 
there and that
opens<00:06:38.340> up<00:06:38.490> that<00:06:38.730> section<00:06:39.090> of<00:06:39.240> the<00:06:39.360> base<00:06:39.540> which

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
opens up that section of the base which

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.290 
opens up that section of the base which
is<00:06:39.960> the<00:06:40.110> second<00:06:40.530> level<00:06:40.910> first<00:06:41.910> we<00:06:42.000> have<00:06:42.120> to<00:06:42.150> go

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
is the second level first we have to go

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.470 
is the second level first we have to go
into<00:06:42.450> the<00:06:42.630> green<00:06:43.080> base<00:06:43.650> which<00:06:43.890> is<00:06:43.980> over<00:06:44.190> here

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.480 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.910 

first<00:06:48.480> going<00:06:48.660> to<00:06:48.690> shoot<00:06:48.930> out<00:06:49.080> that<00:06:49.260> turret<00:06:49.650> cuz

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:49.920 
first going to shoot out that turret cuz

first going to shoot out that turret cuz
it's<00:06:50.070> going<00:06:50.190> to<00:06:50.250> try<00:06:50.430> and<00:06:50.460> kill<00:06:50.820> me<00:06:51.110> then<00:06:52.110> we're
