the<00:00:54.769> reason<00:00:55.129> it's<00:00:55.489> legal<00:00:55.910> to<00:00:55.940> do<00:00:56.210> this<00:00:56.390> is

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
the reason it's legal to do this is

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.690 
the reason it's legal to do this is
because<00:00:56.840> if<00:00:57.199> you<00:00:57.380> have<00:00:57.530> small<00:00:57.950> kids<00:00:57.980> running

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
because if you have small kids running

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.060 
because if you have small kids running
around<00:00:58.790> they<00:00:59.420> can<00:00:59.690> easily<00:01:00.110> break<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.530> game<00:01:00.739> so

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
around they can easily break the game so

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.910 
around they can easily break the game so
if<00:01:01.130> you<00:01:01.219> make<00:01:01.399> a<00:01:01.430> backup<00:01:01.940> copy<00:01:02.530> then<00:01:03.530> you<00:01:03.739> won't

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
if you make a backup copy then you won't

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.460 
if you make a backup copy then you won't
have<00:01:04.520> to<00:01:04.670> go<00:01:04.820> a<00:01:04.850> store<00:01:05.270> pin<00:01:05.509> on<00:01:05.660> fifty<00:01:06.140> or<00:01:06.440> more

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.410 
protections on a game suggests through
just<00:02:46.320> doing<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.740> nibble<00:02:47.720> feature<00:02:49.730> I'll<00:02:50.730> now

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
just doing the nibble feature I'll now

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.040 
just doing the nibble feature I'll now
get<00:02:51.990> around<00:02:52.230> it<00:02:52.440> its<00:02:53.370> own<00:02:56.510> it's<00:02:57.510> not<00:02:57.660> that<00:02:57.870> they

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
get around it its own it's not that they

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.900 
get around it its own it's not that they
don't<00:02:58.500> want<00:02:58.590> copying<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.400> for<00:02:59.700> your<00:02:59.850> own

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
don't want copying it for your own

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.440 
don't want copying it for your own
personal<00:03:00.270> use

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
personal use

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.990 
personal use
it's<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.960> they<00:03:01.230> don't<00:03:01.470> want<00:03:01.770> people<00:03:02.070> making

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
it's that they don't want people making

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.320 
it's that they don't want people making
illegal<00:03:03.270> copies<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.560> game<00:03:04.910> so<00:03:05.910> that's<00:03:06.180> why

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
illegal copies of the game so that's why

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.050 
illegal copies of the game so that's why
they<00:03:06.480> make<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.750> harder<00:03:07.110> on<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:08.850> scheme

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
they make it harder on the scheme

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.280 
they make it harder on the scheme
doesn't<00:03:09.300> really<00:03:09.450> have<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:09.630> protection<00:03:10.170> that

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
doesn't really have a protection that

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.570 
doesn't really have a protection that
much<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:10.980> it's<00:03:11.430> fairly<00:03:11.700> easy<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:12.270> copy<00:03:12.510> but

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
much so it's fairly easy to copy but

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.640 
much so it's fairly easy to copy but
just<00:03:14.580> click<00:03:14.910> read<00:03:15.180> takes<00:03:15.600> like<00:03:15.810> 15<00:03:16.140> minutes

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
just click read takes like 15 minutes

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.850 
just click read takes like 15 minutes
and<00:03:16.950> makes<00:03:17.940> an<00:03:18.120> image<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.720> then<00:03:19.380> saves<00:03:19.680> it

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
and makes an image and then saves it

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.150 
and makes an image and then saves it
where<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.070> want

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.360 

if<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:26.120> do<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.480> ISO<00:03:26.900> image<00:03:27.170> you<00:03:27.620> can<00:03:27.800> use<00:03:28.070> a

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
if you do the ISO image you can use a

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.490 
if you do the ISO image you can use a
program<00:03:29.240> called<00:03:31.120> power<00:03:32.120> ISO<00:03:32.900> which<00:03:33.170> you<00:03:33.350> can

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
program called power ISO which you can

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.150 
program called power ISO which you can
also<00:03:33.710> download<00:03:34.310> or<00:03:34.880> buy<00:03:35.590> offline<00:03:38.320> this<00:03:39.320> is<00:03:39.740> one

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
also download or buy offline this is one

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.010 
also download or buy offline this is one
of<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.490> many<00:03:40.700> programs<00:03:41.150> that<00:03:41.270> will<00:03:41.480> support<00:03:41.840> I

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
of the many programs that will support I

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.960 
of the many programs that will support I
saw<00:03:42.260> images<00:03:42.770> so<00:03:42.980> you<00:03:43.040> can<00:03:43.250> burn<00:03:43.430> them<00:03:43.610> directly

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
saw images so you can burn them directly

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.920 
saw images so you can burn them directly
to<00:03:44.210> a<00:03:44.240> disc<00:03:44.450> or<00:03:46.000> if<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.180> use<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:47.510> nibble

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
to a disc or if you use the nibble

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.850 
to a disc or if you use the nibble
option<00:03:49.150> it<00:03:50.150> will<00:03:50.390> be<00:03:50.600> in<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:50.870> blind<00:03:51.860> write<00:03:53.860> image

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
option it will be in a blind write image

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.720 
option it will be in a blind write image
file<00:03:55.400> it's<00:03:55.700> called<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.240> no<00:03:57.110> program<00:03:57.730> will

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
file it's called and no program will

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.240 
file it's called and no program will
burn<00:03:59.030> that<00:03:59.720> program<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:00.470> mean<00:04:00.770> that<00:04:00.950> file

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
burn that program I mean that file

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.510 
burn that program I mean that file
except<00:04:01.940> for<00:04:02.150> blind<00:04:02.360> rate<00:04:02.570> or<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:03.920> can<00:04:04.100> use<00:04:04.310> a

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
except for blind rate or you can use a

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.690 
except for blind rate or you can use a
program<00:04:04.910> called<00:04:05.530> daemon<00:04:06.530> tools<00:04:06.860> I<00:04:07.190> believe<00:04:07.610> it

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
program called daemon tools I believe it

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.340 
program called daemon tools I believe it
is<00:04:07.820> and<00:04:08.120> you<00:04:08.810> can<00:04:08.960> mount<00:04:09.140> the<00:04:09.410> image<00:04:11.350> but

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
is and you can mount the image but

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.990 
is and you can mount the image but
that's<00:04:12.560> for<00:04:12.980> another<00:04:13.010> video<00:04:15.580> so<00:04:16.580> yeah<00:04:16.760> this<00:04:16.940> is

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
that's for another video so yeah this is

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.410 
that's for another video so yeah this is
a<00:04:17.150> great<00:04:17.480> program<00:04:17.720> very<00:04:18.500> easy<00:04:18.830> to<00:04:19.070> use<00:04:19.459> you<00:04:19.940> can

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
a great program very easy to use you can

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.750 
a great program very easy to use you can
copy<00:04:20.840> all<00:04:21.110> your<00:04:21.140> games<00:04:21.530> so<00:04:22.010> that<00:04:22.040> you<00:04:22.520> have<00:04:22.700> a

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
copy all your games so that you have a

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.820 
copy all your games so that you have a
backup<00:04:23.030> copy<00:04:23.420> of<00:04:23.750> them<00:04:23.870> and<00:04:24.170> it's<00:04:24.410> really<00:04:24.620> good

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
backup copy of them and it's really good

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.260 
backup copy of them and it's really good
oh<00:04:25.270> that's<00:04:26.270> it<00:04:26.570> and<00:04:26.750> thanks<00:04:27.080> for<00:04:27.200> watching
