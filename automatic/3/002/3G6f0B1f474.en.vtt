that out it's the more heavy duty game
play<00:03:03.540> action<00:03:03.780> when<00:03:04.049> it<00:03:04.140> just<00:03:04.410> came<00:03:04.560> out<00:03:04.709> it's

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
play action when it just came out it's

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.559 
play action when it just came out it's
actually<00:03:05.190> my<00:03:05.310> first<00:03:05.519> game<00:03:05.819> mode<00:03:06.060> or<00:03:06.239> my<00:03:06.360> first

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
actually my first game mode or my first

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.140 
actually my first game mode or my first
game<00:03:06.810> in<00:03:07.079> the<00:03:07.620> heavy<00:03:07.769> duty<00:03:08.069> game<00:03:08.250> mode<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:08.760> it's

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
game in the heavy duty game mode so it's

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.910 
game in the heavy duty game mode so it's
pretty<00:03:09.329> good<00:03:09.569> i<00:03:09.599> believe<00:03:09.930> i<00:03:10.019> drop<00:03:10.260> around<00:03:10.440> 40

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
pretty good i believe i drop around 40

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.740 
pretty good i believe i drop around 40
something<00:03:11.280> kills<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:11.730> get<00:03:11.819> like<00:03:11.940> nine<00:03:12.420> deaths

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
something kills and get like nine deaths

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.900 
something kills and get like nine deaths
or<00:03:13.019> something<00:03:13.319> but<00:03:13.500> i<00:03:13.680> believe<00:03:13.920> i<00:03:14.280> was<00:03:14.430> like<00:03:14.579> 35

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
or something but i believe i was like 35

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.490 
or something but i believe i was like 35
and<00:03:15.030> three<00:03:15.329> for<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.599> majority<00:03:16.019> of<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.290> game

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
and three for the majority of the game

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.160 
and three for the majority of the game
so<00:03:16.829> either<00:03:17.489> way<00:03:17.760> it's<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.329> good<00:03:18.480> gameplay<00:03:18.900> it's

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
so either way it's a good gameplay it's

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.259 
so either way it's a good gameplay it's
entertaining<00:03:19.620> it's<00:03:19.950> fun<00:03:20.220> even<00:03:20.639> though<00:03:20.970> heavy

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
entertaining it's fun even though heavy

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.690 
entertaining it's fun even though heavy
duty<00:03:21.690> is<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.709> know<00:03:22.829> gonna<00:03:23.040> be<00:03:23.220> something<00:03:23.549> that

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
duty is you know gonna be something that

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.309 
duty is you know gonna be something that
a<00:03:23.730> lot<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.120> noobs<00:03:24.359> really<00:03:24.840> aren't<00:03:25.200> gonna

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
a lot of the noobs really aren't gonna

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.199 
a lot of the noobs really aren't gonna
play<00:03:25.650> I<00:03:25.680> mean<00:03:26.010> it's<00:03:26.430> right<00:03:26.730> below<00:03:26.910> team

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
play I mean it's right below team

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.300 
play I mean it's right below team
deathmatch<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.109> reason<00:03:28.290> why<00:03:28.620> most<00:03:28.889> noobs

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
deathmatch and the reason why most noobs

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.949 
deathmatch and the reason why most noobs
end<00:03:29.609> up<00:03:29.819> playing<00:03:30.060> team<00:03:30.329> deathmatch<00:03:30.750> is

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
end up playing team deathmatch is

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.990 
end up playing team deathmatch is
because<00:03:31.319> first<00:03:31.590> off<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:32.250> name<00:03:32.430> makes<00:03:32.730> sense

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
because first off the name makes sense

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.280 
because first off the name makes sense
i'm<00:03:33.150> sure<00:03:33.329> a<00:03:33.359> lot<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.569> them<00:03:33.750> are<00:03:33.870> used<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.200> it

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
i'm sure a lot of them are used to it

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.780 
i'm sure a lot of them are used to it
like<00:03:34.410> when<00:03:34.560> people<00:03:34.829> first<00:03:35.010> pick<00:03:35.250> up<00:03:35.400> call<00:03:35.609> duty

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
like when people first pick up call duty

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.580 
like when people first pick up call duty
ghosts<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.299> first<00:03:36.630> game<00:03:36.840> probably<00:03:37.290> gonna

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
ghosts the first game probably gonna

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.289
