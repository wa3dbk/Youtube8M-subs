foundation I find that it looks the most

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.460 
foundation I find that it looks the most
skin<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.420> all<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.810> foundations<00:01:34.350> I've

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
skin like of all the foundations I've

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.590 
skin like of all the foundations I've
used<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.369> does<00:01:35.520> provide<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.240> medium

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
used and it does provide a medium

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.050 
used and it does provide a medium
coverage<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.049> still<00:01:37.259> looks<00:01:37.520> like<00:01:38.520> skin<00:01:38.820> that's

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
coverage it still looks like skin that's
