nexus yes at this point google has said

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.550 
nexus yes at this point google has said
that<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.730> galaxy<00:02:28.360> nexus<00:02:28.690> is<00:02:28.840> not<00:02:29.050> going<00:02:29.320> to<00:02:29.410> be

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560

kitkat<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.800> official<00:02:33.370> reasoning<00:02:33.940> is<00:02:34.210> that

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
kitkat the official reasoning is that

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.630 
kitkat the official reasoning is that
it's<00:02:34.630> outside<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:35.170> its<00:02:35.290> 18-month<00:02:35.980> window<00:02:36.400> for

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
it's outside of its 18-month window for

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.340 
it's outside of its 18-month window for
updates<00:02:37.000> so<00:02:37.270> they're<00:02:37.540> not<00:02:37.660> even<00:02:38.080> going<00:02:38.320> to

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
updates so they're not even going to

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.930 
updates so they're not even going to
consider<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:39.040> device<00:02:39.310> anymore<00:02:39.760> they're

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
consider it a device anymore they're

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.100 
consider it a device anymore they're
just<00:02:40.090> going<00:02:40.240> to<00:02:40.330> throw<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.690> off<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.930> side<00:02:41.080> of

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
just going to throw it off the side of

just going to throw it off the side of
the<00:02:41.290> road<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.740> from<00:02:41.950> reading<00:02:42.220> on<00:02:42.340> some<00:02:42.520> other

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.430 
the road and from reading on some other

think<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.800> has<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:44.980> do<00:02:45.280> with<00:02:45.580> Texas

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000
