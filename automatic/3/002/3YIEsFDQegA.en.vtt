they're like I said a lot of people in

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.219 
they're like I said a lot of people in
the<00:01:41.880> buildings<00:01:42.240> when<00:01:42.420> manastir<00:01:42.899> was<00:01:43.079> like

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the buildings when manastir was like

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.200 
the buildings when manastir was like
flying<00:01:43.530> through<00:01:43.649> him<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.159> Man<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.729> Steel<00:01:44.939> had

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
flying through him so Man of Steel had

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.810 
flying through him so Man of Steel had
severe<00:01:45.810> issues<00:01:46.020> with<00:01:46.530> their<00:01:46.799> portrayal<00:01:47.640> of

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
severe issues with their portrayal of

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.120 
severe issues with their portrayal of
Superman<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.450> what<00:01:48.540> he's<00:01:48.689> about<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.710> think

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
Superman and what he's about and I think

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.219 
Superman and what he's about and I think
so<00:01:50.579> i<00:01:50.610> think<00:01:50.759> he<00:01:51.090> was<00:01:51.210> portrayed<00:01:51.780> as<00:01:51.930> more<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.170> a

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
so i think he was portrayed as more of a

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.590 
so i think he was portrayed as more of a
child<00:01:52.470> than<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:53.460> person<00:01:54.180> who<00:01:54.270> cares<00:01:54.509> about

child than a person who cares about
humanity<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.560> has<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> certain<00:01:56.939> morals<00:01:57.420> that

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
definitely I mean it's one of those

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.110 
definitely I mean it's one of those
things<00:02:28.970> where<00:02:29.239> I<00:02:29.870> guess<00:02:30.799> if<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.489> are<00:02:31.760> Batman

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
prepared for it you know so why is

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.390 
prepared for it you know so why is
better<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.380> be<00:02:45.500> caught<00:02:45.709> with<00:02:45.950> him<00:02:46.160> than

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
without them and maybe that's why Batman

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.089 
without them and maybe that's why Batman
has<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:49.880> guns<00:02:50.090> on<00:02:50.299> his<00:02:50.510> car<00:02:50.720> uh<00:02:50.959> well<00:02:51.799> you<00:02:52.069> know

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.960 
that he has them and then doesn't have
them<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.549> it<00:03:32.000> is<00:03:32.389> kind<00:03:32.690> of<00:03:32.780> sad<00:03:33.049> that<00:03:33.290> like<00:03:33.500> I

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
them and it is kind of sad that like I

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.039 
them and it is kind of sad that like I
wish<00:03:34.970> they<00:03:35.120> wouldn't<00:03:35.329> like<00:03:35.450> if<00:03:35.599> he<00:03:35.720> did<00:03:35.900> have

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
wish they wouldn't like if he did have

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.030 
wish they wouldn't like if he did have
those<00:03:36.170> guns<00:03:36.410> it<00:03:36.590> would<00:03:36.680> have<00:03:36.769> been<00:03:36.829> a<00:03:36.920> surprise

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
those guns it would have been a surprise

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.470 
those guns it would have been a surprise
and<00:03:37.519> maybe<00:03:37.700> like<00:03:37.880> during<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.180> movie<00:03:38.450> they

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
and maybe like during the movie they

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.479 
and maybe like during the movie they
would<00:03:38.780> need<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:38.959> top<00:03:39.139> out<00:03:39.319> popped<00:03:39.889> out<00:03:40.099> instead

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
would need to top out popped out instead

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:41.710 
would need to top out popped out instead
of<00:03:40.549> just<00:03:40.730> having<00:03:40.880> them<00:03:41.090> in<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.269> picture<00:03:41.569> cuz

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
of just having them in the picture cuz

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.750 
of just having them in the picture cuz
now<00:03:41.870> but<00:03:42.590> I<00:03:42.620> think<00:03:42.709> this<00:03:43.010> is<00:03:43.160> a<00:03:43.190> talking<00:03:43.609> point

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
now but I think this is a talking point

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.339 
now but I think this is a talking point
that's<00:03:44.090> probably<00:03:44.359> why<00:03:44.510> they<00:03:44.630> did<00:03:44.810> it<00:03:44.840> so<00:03:44.959> we

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
that's probably why they did it so we

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:46.990 
that's probably why they did it so we
would<00:03:45.500> be<00:03:45.620> talking<00:03:45.950> about<00:03:46.130> yeah<00:03:46.519> but<00:03:46.849> it's

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
would be talking about yeah but it's

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.940 
would be talking about yeah but it's
just<00:03:47.180> okay<00:03:47.720> maybe<00:03:47.959> I<00:03:48.049> would<00:03:48.290> understand<00:03:48.769> if<00:03:48.829> it

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
just okay maybe I would understand if it

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.349 
just okay maybe I would understand if it
weren't<00:03:49.069> someone<00:03:49.400> else's<00:03:49.700> hands<00:03:49.910> but<00:03:50.060> Zack

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
weren't someone else's hands but Zack

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.280 
weren't someone else's hands but Zack
Snyder<00:03:50.720> has<00:03:51.079> been<00:03:52.269> he's<00:03:53.269> been<00:03:53.450> messy<00:03:53.870> with<00:03:54.139> the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
Snyder has been he's been messy with the

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.319 
Snyder has been he's been messy with the
characters<00:03:54.739> he<00:03:55.099> hasn't<00:03:55.669> always<00:03:55.790> done<00:03:56.090> things

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
characters he hasn't always done things

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.390 
characters he hasn't always done things
in<00:03:56.690> a<00:03:56.780> way<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:56.930> I<00:03:57.109> felt<00:03:57.380> was<00:03:57.530> true<00:03:57.829> though<00:03:58.340> you

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
in a way that I felt was true though you

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.309 
in a way that I felt was true though you
know<00:03:58.790> you<00:03:58.849> can<00:03:59.060> also<00:03:59.180> argue<00:03:59.419> that<00:03:59.660> comic<00:04:00.290> book

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
know you can also argue that comic book

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.020 
know you can also argue that comic book
movies<00:04:00.739> don't<00:04:00.889> have<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.250> follow<00:04:01.370> comic<00:04:01.849> books

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
movies don't have to follow comic books

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.539 
movies don't have to follow comic books
and<00:04:02.359> it<00:04:02.690> can<00:04:03.139> be<00:04:03.260> considered<00:04:03.590> a<00:04:03.739> you<00:04:03.799> but<00:04:04.340> I

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
and it can be considered a you but I

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.339 
and it can be considered a you but I
think<00:04:04.910> that's<00:04:05.389> where<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.599> lot<00:04:05.660> of<00:04:05.810> people<00:04:06.049> are

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
think that's where a lot of people are

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.280 
think that's where a lot of people are
like<00:04:06.609> dubious<00:04:07.609> about

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
like dubious about

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.259 
like dubious about
is<00:04:08.560> what<00:04:09.219> are<00:04:09.310> you<00:04:09.400> doing<00:04:09.700> with<00:04:09.819> those<00:04:09.939> X

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
is what are you doing with those X

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.119 
is what are you doing with those X
nighter<00:04:10.540> what<00:04:11.049> plans<00:04:11.319> do<00:04:11.560> you<00:04:11.590> have<00:04:11.650> for<00:04:11.829> those

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
nighter what plans do you have for those

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:13.770 
nighter what plans do you have for those
yeah<00:04:12.489> I<00:04:12.519> don't<00:04:12.760> know<00:04:12.939> if<00:04:13.030> I<00:04:13.120> trust<00:04:13.390> you<00:04:13.599> fully
