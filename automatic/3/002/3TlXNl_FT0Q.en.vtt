00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 in the tank and you see a call of duty 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.799
 Gameplay in the background of the user one 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.170
 the kripo he played quality ghost im 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.570
 Free for all modes with the AK 12 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.620
 silencer armor-piercing ammunition 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.120
 sleight of hand quickly they in 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.240
 plunderer job and his 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.070
 Specialization packages master marksman 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.439
 intensive care and dropouts on the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.640
 map of course warhawk he has in the end in 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.800
 30 0 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.840
 strike him honest i find it 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.369
 cool because I think the whole is yes 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.830
 I also had to play the ps4 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.079
 It is inscribed here for a very short time 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.610
 why did that happen with the ps4? 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.190
 Whole is yes will be in the future now 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.930
 more regularly my sent in guest 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.160
 to use gameplays again that is one 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.110
 a little bit asleep here now 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.350
 But I just say that with me 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.610
 now times commentary formats heard 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.829
 in my opinion, that's how it is 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.210
 a guest gameplay with it so if I am 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.170
 not something special for now 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.460
 the actual game was me 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.870
 I found out where I think 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.699
 I'm all clear, I have to first of 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.559
 then show my side off 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.789
 does that work so guest has gameplay 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.280
 Can you send me over my own 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.019
 channel there is one under each video 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.030
 short instructions in this commander 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.430
 kriegers channel is indeed the guide for 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.170
 him and if you give me guest gameplay 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.729
 send then send the please 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.930
 not yet 20 other people 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.880
 us quite later under circumstances 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.500
 possibly any problems with 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.750
 youtube give that the videos then 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.790
 there are two and three times and that is 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.040
 somehow not really good but one 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.939
 warranty on use of course gives 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.280
 not only when he does 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.000
 personally bock on it have something last 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.310
 week happens 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.380
 I'm sure you heard it 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.689
 first seen very late there was a free 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.579
 weekend at is the call of duty 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.320
 big i think it was the first one now 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.060
 But I'm not in this style for ghost 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.740
 certainly 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.439
 Personally, I did it the day before yesterday 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.180
 night or last night somehow so 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.320
 I have heard only very little 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.570
 people are usually written 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.399
 always been so at call of duty free 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.680
 Weekend I always have 22 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.110
 get news hey free games 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.119
 gamble blablabla and this time it was 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.729
 just as I have seen that very much 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.920
 little, that's why I have finally 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.420
 As I said, such a small one distributes it 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.430
 to make a small action out though 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.570
 that was not the only one 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.460
 down one I need a bit 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.410
 on the way had a bit to do and 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.910
 Here were some things in the 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.470
 preparation or on the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.180
 I could not do that now 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.770
 livestream do something else 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.090
 I would have liked to do it 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.520
 again been a really cool action 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.070
 but this time unfortunately not quite 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.930
 worked well what do you think of the free 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.130
 agents personally, of course I have with 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.050
 a few people and also from the clan 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.170
 or spoken to the environment and was there 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.110
 the mood so i say a lot 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.790
 very split what so call of duty 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.920
 Actually, that does not really matter now 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.800
 just because that's mostly natural 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.330
 battlefield people were there but was there 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.160
 a few call of duty followers in 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.860
 quotes with me and so me 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.300
 personally have the game already 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.100
 but also learned to appreciate 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.320
 certain modes and only under certain 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.140
 I would almost go there already 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.489
 say and how should I say so me 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.440
 personally have the most fun now 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.450
 at the match as free for all and 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.090
 Of course, conclusion is confirmed as well 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.010
 this fun mode so fun mode nothing 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.720
 that weapons game is not fun 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.070
 the fight on board in this sense so 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.209
 so things have fun so 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.610
 I really care about that is one 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.049
 thing as I call big too 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.660
 We also liked to appreciate 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.340
 what is going on for a while ? 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.140
 what you are interested in is call of duty 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.160
 greatest good and what you find bad 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.110
 because I'll do it again soon 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.510
 little commentary what I personally 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.160
 Ghosts do not look good and of course 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.540
 also what I now as positive 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.980
 aspect in recent months for me 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.720
 and then I'll take a look 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.310
 Of course you have written this 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.570
 have and yes sometimes intervenes so 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.709
 a little leaves the comments 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.269
 maybe one thing or another before 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.440
 I started that now 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.820
 in my own videos of one 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.310
 own channel too and make it 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.290
 would fit in here quite well now 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.510
 So things like the game is shit 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.130
 because that's just call of duty 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.600
 of course does not aim or 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.829
 that does not interest me that either 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.720
 maybe the opinion of someone 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.769
 who has no fun there or on 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.079
 Feeling others does not bother 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.549
 has on it and that's ok so far as you can 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.680
 have your own opinion and that too 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.380
 express how it is bock on it is only 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.030
 that does not mean a relevant argument to me 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.530
 So just to say whole call of duty 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.450
 is and that was always shit going on 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.300
 every year new parts come out that is 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.500
 now maybe marketing 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.960
 but relevant to us here now rather 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.370
 uninteresting so speak for me 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.770
 I do not think that now 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.350
 somehow great years to pay 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.630
 or somehow want to hold 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.150
 I would do so much first of all personally 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.590
 from lately not so much 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.180
 coal for the cast have played to the 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.020
 Last videos already noticed 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.420
 I was a little upset 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.460
 About this message that you have the fv 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.990
 changer was no longer allowed to use or 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.430
 that's there that supposedly there 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.970
 I am personally spellbound 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.830
 but no one who participated 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.760
 has or really banned where that was 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.830
 I wrote to a few people 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.270
 but it was mostly about others 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.460
 things and not to ghost but 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.410
 partly in mw3 mw2 that there somebody 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.300
 no idea hacked an account 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.130
 got and was warned now 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.860
 Unfortunately, blablabla does not belong here 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.300
 with pure and then you can now 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.340
 recently on the last video too 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.750
 already wants to hear exchange or 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.250
 hubert in the settings 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.870
 Graphics settings now again 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.670
 unfortunately change only to 80 but 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.960
 after all better than nothing and thus 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.790
 I can play the course again 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.070
 continue to gamble 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.750
 Honestly, if it's just standard 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.920
 fvw would have been then I would have it 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.240
 probably depend on that one 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.430
 quite normal with my foot changer 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.810
 further supplemented played times among us 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.920
 will be back soon anyway 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.050
 anytime the next part 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.330
 then there was that recently 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.400
 first dlc yes and I've watched 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.440
 how many people play cod at all 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.700
 Overall , the entrepreneur is displayed 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.560
 if you had logged in so online 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.090
 logged in like in his profile 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.680
 many people gamble and some 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.900
 You can not play game modes at all 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.370
 because there are no people there 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.440
 there are, for example, I have now 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.760
 there are no names of the game car 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.260
 then maybe three or five people 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.700
 wait for a lobby and that comes 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.180
 just not done that's right 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.800
 crap 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.480
 and quite frankly that is on the 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.190
 Consoles much better was more common 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.420
 was sold as on the pc and 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.230
 therefore I have me now first 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:55.300
 the dlc not because yes what it for 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.860
 is for me in the sense it would be cool 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.230
 been playing the new maps but 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.180
 what good is it if the pugs if the 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.420
 matches almost never come about 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.820
 or only with the same ones 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.860
 today comes about because no one is the the 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.090
 Having a new map somewhere is a pity 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.860
 I was really looking forward to it 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.100
 and would rather have brought me now 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.540
 as for example other games eg us 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.340
 again somehow raus raus 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.570
 I'll daisy myself now synonymous first 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.010
 do not pick it's an alpha it is 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.900
 but very far back is still total 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.220
 early and the game becomes active 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.740
 evolved and I personally have 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.450
 Since then , do not mind me there 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.670
 to hang purely if the game is still only 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.410
