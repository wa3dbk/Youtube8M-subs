00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
it came out straight on the first try

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.729 
it came out straight on the first try
but<00:01:00.270> I'm<00:01:00.480> just<00:01:00.660> gonna<00:01:00.809> do<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.289> second<00:01:01.710> time

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
but I'm just gonna do it a second time

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.770 
but I'm just gonna do it a second time
to<00:01:01.859> make<00:01:02.160> sure<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.430> gets<00:01:02.520> really<00:01:02.820> really<00:01:03.000> bone

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
to make sure it gets really really bone

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.030 
to make sure it gets really really bone
straight<00:01:04.229> because<00:01:04.439> that's<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> look<00:01:04.979> that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
straight because that's the look that

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:14.630 
straight because that's the look that
I'm<00:01:05.220> going<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:12.350> again<00:01:13.350> three<00:01:13.920> strokes<00:01:14.189> at<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
I'm going for again three strokes at the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.969 
I'm going for again three strokes at the
root<00:01:14.820> one<00:01:15.090> two<00:01:15.360> three<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.439> way<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.890> will

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
root one two three this way it will

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.130 
root one two three this way it will
ensure<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.549> look<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.119> really<00:01:18.150> flat<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
ensure that the look is really flat and

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.200 
ensure that the look is really flat and
then<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.710> shook<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.280> down<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:20.790> nice<00:01:21.030> and

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
then you shook it down really nice and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.140 
then you shook it down really nice and
slow<00:01:21.420> for<00:01:21.720> all<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.229> hair<00:01:22.409> strands<00:01:22.820> get<00:01:23.820> heat

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
slow for all the hair strands get heat

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.260 
slow for all the hair strands get heat
and<00:01:27.340> voila<00:01:29.230> the<00:01:30.230> hair<00:01:30.470> is<00:01:30.500> bone<00:01:31.220> straight<00:01:31.700> and

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
and voila the hair is bone straight and

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.240 
and voila the hair is bone straight and
