absolutely no voice none and I had to go
in<00:03:11.910> for<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.120> chemistry<00:03:12.420> test<00:03:12.780> with<00:03:13.050> Ryan<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.650> it

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
in for a chemistry test with Ryan and it

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.250 
in for a chemistry test with Ryan and it
was<00:03:13.920> then<00:03:14.430> what's<00:03:14.670> that<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.210> it's<00:03:15.900> like<00:03:16.110> to

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
was then what's that is it it's like to

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.080 
was then what's that is it it's like to
test<00:03:16.500> cuz<00:03:17.100> you<00:03:17.190> know<00:03:17.280> people<00:03:17.580> can<00:03:17.700> be<00:03:17.820> all

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
test cuz you know people can be all

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.910 
test cuz you know people can be all
right<00:03:18.360> on<00:03:18.630> their<00:03:18.900> own<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.320> then<00:03:19.440> you<00:03:19.650> get<00:03:19.770> them

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
right on their own and then you get them

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.680 
right on their own and then you get them
together<00:03:20.190> you've<00:03:20.520> seen<00:03:20.730> this<00:03:20.910> in<00:03:21.120> movies<00:03:21.300> and

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
together you've seen this in movies and

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.600 
together you've seen this in movies and
it<00:03:22.500> doesn't<00:03:22.950> seem<00:03:23.100> like<00:03:23.160> they're<00:03:23.460> really

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
it doesn't seem like they're really

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.240 
it doesn't seem like they're really
driving<00:03:24.120> very<00:03:24.240> well<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:25.350> they<00:03:25.500> do<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.650> test<00:03:25.980> for

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
driving very well so they do a test for

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.800 
driving very well so they do a test for
it<00:03:26.370> now<00:03:28.520> I<00:03:29.520> know<00:03:30.150> what<00:03:30.330> you're<00:03:30.480> talking<00:03:30.570> about

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
it now I know what you're talking about

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.480 
it now I know what you're talking about
a<00:03:30.900> lot<00:03:31.050> of<00:03:31.080> times<00:03:31.290> it's<00:03:31.620> just<00:03:31.800> like<00:03:31.950> oh<00:03:32.070> please

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
a lot of times it's just like oh please

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.690 
a lot of times it's just like oh please
but<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.210> other<00:03:33.480> times<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:34.500> forget<00:03:35.460> and

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
but and other times you forget and

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.370 
but and other times you forget and
because<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.270> chemistry<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:36.810> good<00:03:37.110> right

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
because the chemistry is so good right

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.260 
because the chemistry is so good right
right<00:03:37.890> so<00:03:38.160> hopefully<00:03:38.670> hopefully<00:03:38.940> the

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
right so hopefully hopefully the

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.580 
right so hopefully hopefully the
chemistry<00:03:39.660> worked<00:03:39.840> out<00:03:39.990> alright<00:03:40.260> because<00:03:40.530> how

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
chemistry worked out alright because how

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.480 
chemistry worked out alright because how
do<00:03:40.650> you<00:03:40.740> think<00:03:40.830> it's<00:03:40.980> going<00:03:41.190> here<00:03:41.400> tonight

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
do you think it's going here tonight

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:52.080 
do you think it's going here tonight

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.100 
chemistry test and I have absolutely no
voice<00:04:21.620> at<00:04:21.950> all<00:04:22.220> I<00:04:22.430> don't<00:04:23.210> really<00:04:23.450> and<00:04:23.780> I<00:04:23.870> walked

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
voice at all I don't really and I walked

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.560 
voice at all I don't really and I walked
out<00:04:24.350> thinking<00:04:25.010> that<00:04:25.280> was<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:26.000> worst<00:04:26.210> thing

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
out thinking that was the worst thing

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:33.640 
out thinking that was the worst thing
that's<00:04:26.630> ever<00:04:26.900> higher<00:04:27.710> time<00:04:27.950> I<00:04:28.190> was<00:04:28.520> very<00:04:32.650> and

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
that's ever higher time I was very and

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.260 
that's ever higher time I was very and
so<00:04:33.830> I<00:04:33.860> left<00:04:34.220> thinking<00:04:34.700> it<00:04:34.850> was<00:04:34.940> going<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.150> be

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
so I left thinking it was going to be

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.030 
so I left thinking it was going to be
terrible<00:04:35.660> but<00:04:35.810> for<00:04:36.050> some<00:04:36.230> reason<00:04:36.620> we<00:04:36.800> did<00:04:36.950> the

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
terrible but for some reason we did the

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.700 
terrible but for some reason we did the
dirty<00:04:37.250> dancing<00:04:37.640> left<00:04:37.850> in<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.240> room<00:04:38.390> and<00:04:39.020> maybe

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
dirty dancing left in the room and maybe

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.640 
dirty dancing left in the room and maybe
that<00:04:39.950> sealed<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.310> deal<00:04:40.370> I<00:04:40.640> don't<00:04:40.790> know<00:04:41.650> that's
