show you how to order or to store a

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.460 
show you how to order or to store a
specific<00:00:16.480> amount<00:00:16.750> of<00:00:17.730> Auto<00:00:18.730> crafted<00:00:19.329> parts<00:00:20.169> or

00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:23.649 
items in the or network for example I

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:27.690 
items in the or network for example I
have<00:00:24.610> only<00:00:25.000> 10<00:00:25.360> of<00:00:25.509> each<00:00:25.570> processor<00:00:26.369> but<00:00:27.369> what

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
have only 10 of each processor but what

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.999 
have only 10 of each processor but what
if<00:00:27.849> I<00:00:28.029> use<00:00:28.419> up<00:00:28.660> those<00:00:28.899> 10<00:00:29.200> for<00:00:29.470> something<00:00:29.829> and

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
if I use up those 10 for something and

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.220 
if I use up those 10 for something and
then<00:00:30.250> next<00:00:30.700> time<00:00:30.880> I'll<00:00:31.029> craft<00:00:31.360> I<00:00:31.660> have<00:00:31.869> to<00:00:32.020> wait

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
then next time I'll craft I have to wait

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.460 
then next time I'll craft I have to wait
for<00:00:32.529> 10<00:00:32.770> new<00:00:33.070> ones<00:00:33.250> or<00:00:33.610> 20<00:00:34.330> new<00:00:34.480> ones<00:00:34.690> so

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
for 10 new ones or 20 new ones so

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.450 
for 10 new ones or 20 new ones so
wouldn't<00:00:35.830> it<00:00:36.010> be<00:00:36.130> better<00:00:36.490> if<00:00:36.640> I<00:00:37.000> had<00:00:37.030> a<00:00:37.270> way<00:00:37.600> to

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
wouldn't it be better if I had a way to

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.990 
wouldn't it be better if I had a way to
always<00:00:39.460> have<00:00:39.850> 32<00:00:40.630> of<00:00:40.840> each<00:00:41.050> in<00:00:41.380> the<00:00:41.590> system<00:00:42.100> and

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
always have 32 of each in the system and

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.480 
always have 32 of each in the system and
when<00:00:43.240> I<00:00:43.270> craft<00:00:43.630> them<00:00:43.890> when<00:00:44.890> I<00:00:44.920> use<00:00:45.130> some<00:00:45.340> for

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
when I craft them when I use some for

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.050 
when I craft them when I use some for
crafting

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.060

they<00:00:46.240> will<00:00:46.480> automatically<00:00:47.610> order<00:00:48.610> new<00:00:48.790> ones

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
they will automatically order new ones

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.479 
they will automatically order new ones
no<00:00:50.590> problem<00:00:51.630> so<00:00:52.630> just<00:00:53.440> make<00:00:53.620> sure<00:00:53.650> that<00:00:54.040> you

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
no problem so just make sure that you

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.319 
no problem so just make sure that you
have<00:00:54.820> enough<00:00:55.450> material<00:00:56.020> in<00:00:56.560> the<00:00:56.829> system

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
have enough material in the system

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.560 
have enough material in the system
because<00:00:58.329> it<00:00:58.540> won't<00:00:58.750> work<00:00:59.140> advice<00:00:59.829> and<00:01:00.570> place

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
because it won't work advice and place

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.620 
because it won't work advice and place
one<00:01:02.050> interface<00:01:02.530> and<00:01:03.509> one<00:01:04.509> storage<00:01:05.409> bus<00:01:06.630> that's

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
one interface and one storage bus that's

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.750 
one interface and one storage bus that's
almost<00:01:08.110> everything<00:01:08.530> you<00:01:09.159> need<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.430> Coughlin

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
almost everything you need the Coughlin

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.200 
almost everything you need the Coughlin
card<00:01:10.000> upgrade<00:01:10.420> as<00:01:10.540> well<00:01:10.570> and<00:01:11.530> I<00:01:12.370> will<00:01:12.940> just

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
card upgrade as well and I will just

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.290 
card upgrade as well and I will just
demonstrate<00:01:13.330> what<00:01:14.290> this<00:01:14.470> means<00:01:15.060> let's<00:01:16.060> say<00:01:16.180> I

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
demonstrate what this means let's say I

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.250 
demonstrate what this means let's say I
have<00:01:17.040> place<00:01:18.040> one<00:01:18.460> logic<00:01:19.150> processor<00:01:19.690> here<00:01:19.960> in

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
have place one logic processor here in

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.870 
have place one logic processor here in
the<00:01:20.440> comfy<00:01:20.799> then<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.960> interface<00:01:22.960> will<00:01:23.350> keep

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
the comfy then the interface will keep

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.990 
the comfy then the interface will keep
one<00:01:24.880> processor<00:01:25.690> here<00:01:25.900> at<00:01:26.110> all<00:01:26.530> times<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.850> will

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
one processor here at all times it will

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.469 
one processor here at all times it will
try<00:01:28.240> to<00:01:28.270> at<00:01:28.510> least<00:01:29.159> if<00:01:30.159> I<00:01:30.460> place<00:01:30.760> a<00:01:30.790> few<00:01:31.090> more<00:01:31.330> it

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
try to at least if I place a few more it

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.320 
try to at least if I place a few more it
will<00:01:31.570> export<00:01:31.990> those<00:01:32.260> and<00:01:32.530> these<00:01:33.340> eight<00:01:33.640> over

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
will export those and these eight over

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.649 
will export those and these eight over
there<00:01:34.510> they<00:01:35.290> can<00:01:35.320> still<00:01:35.799> be<00:01:35.830> reached<00:01:36.220> from

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
there they can still be reached from

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.890 
there they can still be reached from
from<00:01:37.659> this<00:01:38.020> side<00:01:38.369> if<00:01:39.369> I<00:01:39.520> take<00:01:39.729> out<00:01:40.060> all<00:01:40.600> those

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
from this side if I take out all those

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.270 
from this side if I take out all those
10<00:01:41.320> and<00:01:42.240> walk<00:01:43.240> over<00:01:43.479> here<00:01:43.659> it<00:01:44.320> will<00:01:44.560> try<00:01:44.830> to<00:01:44.890> put

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
10 and walk over here it will try to put

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.570 
10 and walk over here it will try to put
eight<00:01:45.430> there<00:01:45.670> but<00:01:45.939> it<00:01:46.150> won't<00:01:46.630> go<00:01:46.830> if<00:01:47.830> it<00:01:48.010> pays

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
eight there but it won't go if it pays

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.359 
eight there but it won't go if it pays
10<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:49.090> will<00:01:49.240> soar<00:01:50.110> so<00:01:50.350> there<00:01:50.619> are<00:01:50.740> eight<00:01:51.010> and

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
10 it will soar so there are eight and

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.950 
10 it will soar so there are eight and
the<00:01:52.299> rest<00:01:52.570> are<00:01:52.840> in<00:01:52.900> the<00:01:53.229> system<00:01:53.760> but<00:01:54.760> we<00:01:55.750> want

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
the rest are in the system but we want

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.279 
the rest are in the system but we want
32<00:01:56.470> right

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
we can only have ten that's where you

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.770 
we can only have ten that's where you

do<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.030> same<00:02:37.180> thing<00:02:37.510> with<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:41.349> other

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
do the same thing with the other

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.890 
do the same thing with the other
processors<00:02:42.010> as<00:02:42.430> well<00:02:42.720> calculation<00:02:43.720> and

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
processors as well calculation and

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.500 
processors as well calculation and
engineering<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:45.250> as<00:02:46.030> soon<00:02:46.209> as<00:02:46.329> we're

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
engineering and as soon as we're

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.910 
engineering and as soon as we're
finished<00:02:46.540> with<00:02:47.049> this<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:48.180> will<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.989> next<00:02:50.470> job

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
finished with this I will the next job

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.850 
finished with this I will the next job
will<00:02:51.099> be<00:02:51.340> ordered<00:02:51.700> from<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.150> interface<00:02:52.860> let's

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
will be ordered from the interface let's

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.280 
will be ordered from the interface let's
have<00:02:54.099> a<00:02:54.129> look<00:02:56.760> ok<00:02:57.760> we're<00:02:58.000> closing<00:02:58.480> in<00:02:58.599> we<00:02:59.049> are

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
have a look ok we're closing in we are

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.069 
have a look ok we're closing in we are
almost<00:02:59.860> at<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.870> final<00:03:02.170> final<00:03:03.100> processor

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
almost at the the final final processor

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.710 
almost at the the final final processor
you<00:03:05.079> can<00:03:05.260> see<00:03:05.470> these<00:03:05.680> one<00:03:06.010> are<00:03:06.130> empty<00:03:06.579> and<00:03:06.790> we

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
you can see these one are empty and we

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.599 
you can see these one are empty and we
just<00:03:07.989> made<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.290> last<00:03:08.470> one<00:03:08.739> and<00:03:08.950> there<00:03:09.280> we<00:03:09.430> got

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
just made the last one and there we got

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.140 
just made the last one and there we got
the<00:03:09.790> lost<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.630> next<00:03:11.079> order<00:03:11.319> of<00:03:12.150> calculation

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
the lost the next order of calculation

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.190 
the lost the next order of calculation
processors<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:15.630> if<00:03:16.630> you<00:03:16.720> look<00:03:16.959> at<00:03:17.079> the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
processors and if you look at the

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.220 
processors and if you look at the
interface<00:03:17.560> now<00:03:18.310> we<00:03:18.370> have<00:03:18.700> 32<00:03:19.329> logic<00:03:19.810> processor

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
interface now we have 32 logic processor

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.550 
interface now we have 32 logic processor
stored<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.799> we<00:03:21.130> have<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.430> calculations<00:03:22.560> yeah

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
stored and we have the calculations yeah

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.550 
stored and we have the calculations yeah
they<00:03:23.859> are<00:03:23.920> slowly<00:03:24.310> filling<00:03:24.760> up<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.440> if<00:03:26.440> we

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
they are slowly filling up and if we

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.370 
they are slowly filling up and if we
take<00:03:26.739> a<00:03:27.010> look<00:03:27.340> in<00:03:27.639> the<00:03:28.120> crafting<00:03:28.599> terminal<00:03:29.049> we

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
take a look in the crafting terminal we

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.400 
take a look in the crafting terminal we
have<00:03:29.500> all<00:03:29.769> 32<00:03:30.180> logically<00:03:31.180> ones<00:03:31.389> here<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:31.870> the

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
have all 32 logically ones here and the

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.120 
have all 32 logically ones here and the
calculations<00:03:33.099> are<00:03:33.340> filling<00:03:34.150> up<00:03:34.500> so<00:03:35.500> that's

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
calculations are filling up so that's

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.420 
calculations are filling up so that's
how<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:36.459> do<00:03:36.639> it<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:37.090> have<00:03:38.019> always<00:03:38.680> keep<00:03:39.130> a

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
how you do it to have always keep a

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.080 
how you do it to have always keep a
specific<00:03:40.419> number<00:03:40.750> of<00:03:41.260> items<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:42.310> you<00:03:42.940> can

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
specific number of items that you can

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.020 
specific number of items that you can
alter<00:03:43.510> craft<00:03:43.810> in<00:03:44.079> your<00:03:44.230> system<00:03:44.680> if<00:03:45.639> you<00:03:45.940> have

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
alter craft in your system if you have

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.809 
alter craft in your system if you have
any<00:03:46.209> questions<00:03:46.599> about<00:03:46.690> this<00:03:47.109> setup<00:03:47.799> check<00:03:48.669> the
