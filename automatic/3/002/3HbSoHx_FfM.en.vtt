get out and that's where you need the

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.130 
get out and that's where you need the
elevator<00:01:24.430> so<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.119> elevator<00:01:25.330> can<00:01:25.690> get<00:01:25.869> you<00:01:25.960> out

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
elevator so the elevator can get you out

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.749 
elevator so the elevator can get you out

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
of the glitch and also on top of the map

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.790 
of the glitch and also on top of the map
so<00:01:28.090> when<00:01:28.539> the<00:01:28.630> elevator<00:01:28.960> is<00:01:29.050> underneath<00:01:29.530> you

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
so when the elevator is underneath you

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.950 
so when the elevator is underneath you
and<00:01:29.979> it<00:01:30.340> rises<00:01:30.580> up<00:01:30.820> it'll<00:01:31.240> push<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:31.630> through

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
and it rises up it'll push you through

and it rises up it'll push you through
the<00:01:32.110> ceiling<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:32.770> on<00:01:32.979> top<00:01:33.190> of<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.399> map<00:01:33.580> and

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
the ceiling and on top of the map and

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.340 
the ceiling and on top of the map and
then<00:01:34.090> from<00:01:34.300> there<00:01:34.509> you<00:01:34.600> can<00:01:34.630> just<00:01:34.750> go<00:01:35.020> off<00:01:35.170> and
