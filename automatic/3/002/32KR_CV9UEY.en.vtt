00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.959
 facilitated 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:14.589
 For the first time ever, the doors for robotics opened in Kulmbach 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.449
 highest level 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.650
 we fouled the competition 800 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.079
 Kelsterbach officially advertise in which one common with united forces 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.619
 and we wanted that 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.750
 So I wanted it because I've been in robotics for four five years now 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:31.470
 Kulmbach is taking, so far we are always doing a start 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.960
 Competitions Tauberbischofsheim are driven 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.580
 and Tauberbischofsheim are just three hours bus ride they drove 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.720
 always driven by 67 - now came on 10 8 and 8 00 associated with enormous costs 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.420
 and I said that would be nice if we in Kulmbach this competition 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.500
 for the very good that is me in the regional league against us on site 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.160
 This event also takes place in view of Russell's arbitration 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.300
 will continue to be maintained in the next few years 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.870
 this is very important for the school as well as for the customers 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.720
 Figurehead on the way the smoke came in total 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.540
 Ten teams took over 800 m in the city of Bayreuth Robert and 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.770
 disadvantaged 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.360
 The closer the finale is, the more guests gathered around the audience 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.450
 Playground and the participants loudly 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.860
 including, of course, the participating artists show a thick 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.730
 thing 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.500
 the two teams in the last 2 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.270
 I call Seated Newcomer teams the first time this competition 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.580
 Celebrities are also a lot of young people doing a lot of seventh years who wanted that 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.170
 First time I'm there and I think that one of the size of the competition 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.000
 Suggested are no 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.700
 continues 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.700
 1 is a query 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.410

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.100
 impressed by the services offered, also the 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.830
 Headmaster handicraft

 what I have heard what I have seen 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.030
 but is it impressive Scheffold already said what is being done you 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.239
 Working hard is how concentrated work is done 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.959
 You can see what can be achieved with such a working attitude 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.379
 and that is the Washington under easy understand and I have to say 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:23.200
 no matter what size is perhaps the is brought up to 4 me 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.619
 found the word stops 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:26.639
 dollar 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:28.809
 we should lead 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:30.969
 where we could prepare 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.969
