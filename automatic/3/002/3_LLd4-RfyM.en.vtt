00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.460
 Speak guys from the side of the force doll. 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.470
 How are you? 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.669
 the dice barely came on the scene and already won 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.860
 very prominent 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.469
 if you apply me ridiculous as 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.689
 renato and forget it watch the series and 

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:33.790
 with that the real breaker 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.739
 Thank you for arguing that I do not 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.930
 I was very excited but had so much 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.370
 but so many people recommend that I 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.320
 I thought why you want to know 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.300
 once accepted and it was better that I 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.829
 I did and especially now I did not like it 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.960
 much of the episode might be that you 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.079
 also do not like it because it has a rhythm 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.540
 very slow but serious the third before the 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.350
 thing totally changes of figure to take care of 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.840
 it was created by stan in 1964 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.060
 in the doc comic doc won his 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.649
 superhuman abilities there after 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.360
 tried to save a little guy from being 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.619
 hit by a truck full of 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.450
 toxic products 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.100
 a little of this expensive product in the eyes 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.659
 of him causing him to lose plane 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.829
 some of these products like the eyes 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.530
 of him causing him to lose his 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:19.870
 view but makes sense to overcome 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.650
 but in one direction the arena is 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.960
 red 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.120
 but the tragedy at the site was found after 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.030
 His father dies, he ends up alone. 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.250
 in this moment that the stick of trade 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.409
 victims is who has scenes and train 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.690
 he in the diplomatic messages to this is 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.210
 incredible and now does not know that you do not 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.890
 He knew about the snow reminds on what 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.290
 interprets a dobby domestic customer 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.939
 became a friend and a secretary 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.439
 I have a husband who lost his sight because of 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.240
 a degenerative disease 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.930
 the first cinematic appearance of 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.060
 demolisher was in the 1939 film the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.009
 incredible hulk trial 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.040
 Another curious fact is that the origin of 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:02.590
 turtles in plaster is a tribute 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:05.140
 time to double that created the 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.300
 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.670
 I was very much a fan of 1921, frank miller. 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.070
 then the weak the toxic waste is a 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.710
 sewer that disturbs that transformation 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.290
 genetics of the ninja turtle actually 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.020
 I even vial that hit doctor doc 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.320
 in the head and left him blind with powers 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.320
 about humans 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.150
 incredible series is directly connected 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.910
 with the last events in your stomach 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.250
 start type rower the giant between new 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.120
 york and funny that he is always in 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.110
 sea â€‹â€‹never rolling the rules 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.150
 impressive and the series will also 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.130
 they are yet to come 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.200
 Captain America made the civil war to 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.240
 the dreads several references of these 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.730
 events are well hidden from 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.920
 episodes including spain looks good 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.020
 hidden there too if you succeeded 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.459
 stone back here in the video comments like this 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.800
 I saw it there 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.600
 the first 30 and do this will be 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.620
 remembered in the next video or in a 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.769
 video special beauty cool pilots 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.510
 exciting 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.820
 there are rumors that should be 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.950
 players doing this in the series 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.630
 animal because it gives them time to 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.640
 and to develop professionals not so 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.280
 known for calmer 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.989
 after all what is two hours of film 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.970
 you have to present an entire block 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.370
 carnival characters 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.459
 the series has a dark and very serious climate 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.530
 It is well for adults even including 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.870
 scenes together are very violent and very 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.880
 Realistic, I got out of Brazil too. 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.920
 and when the murdock doctor gets hurt 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.450
 It hurts to be worth the same kind of 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.350
 spend days recovering and sometimes 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.880
 nor 50 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.980
 currently there is one thing that can 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.770
 to command this season is that the deco 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.590
 It is not so then garden fucking ninja and 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.240
 acrobat but yes but this is interesting 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.800
 in this series that they are presenting 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.290
 specials very calmly 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.860
 developing very well and was very 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.990
 cool 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.660
 then this season should the king of team 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.460
 are far from all that everything that 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.890
 the people here 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.170
 this season the devil and the king of crime 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.290
 They are far from everything that 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.720
 people wait but he is evolving 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:15.010
 it is little by little an improving suit 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.989
 and an improvement here is an annual rate where 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.290
 implanted here so they go riding 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.100
 the whole show for when he 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.950
 really and intense kassin the bug goes 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.350
 pick up issuers to find 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.420
 another detail that mano is the following 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.210
 Netflix has confirmed that another series of 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.000
 Heroes will come out there will have the cheese 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.070
 iron fist that this jonze that 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.390
 means that such series may or may not 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.670
 best which means that these 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.130
 characters can come together and give rise to 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.020
 Ministry of defenders has been 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.550
 shown exactly the Russian club will 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.100
 appear at some point in the history of the 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.200
 deco guy has cooler stuff than this 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.270
 that's why I was you and running 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.510
 in the justice season because the next 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:03.060
 going to be an animal, you just have to say it's a 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.060
 great time to live my friends 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.170
 do not let them get what you want 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.540
 found the first season that 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.320
 needing for the second and esoteric 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.450
