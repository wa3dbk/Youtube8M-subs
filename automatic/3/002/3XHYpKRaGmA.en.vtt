I just swing forward follow through use
the<00:00:42.329> same<00:00:42.510> mechanics<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.590> we<00:00:44.040> had<00:00:44.190> worked

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the same mechanics that we we had worked

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.330 
the same mechanics that we we had worked
on<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.510> previous<00:00:45.870> videos<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:47.039> let's<00:00:47.190> watch

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
on in the previous videos so let's watch

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.170 
on in the previous videos so let's watch
that<00:00:47.399> one<00:00:47.610> more<00:00:47.760> time

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
that one more time

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.180 
that one more time
starting<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.809> ready<00:00:48.989> position<00:00:49.190> pivot

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
starting in the ready position pivot

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.299 
starting in the ready position pivot
shoulder<00:00:51.030> turn<00:00:51.239> racquet<00:00:51.780> comes<00:00:51.989> back<00:00:52.260> no<00:00:52.949> loop

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
shoulder turn racquet comes back no loop

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.369 
shoulder turn racquet comes back no loop
right<00:00:53.640> now<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:54.090> coming<00:00:54.270> straight<00:00:54.360> back<00:00:54.780> and

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
right now just coming straight back and

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.650 
right now just coming straight back and
then<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.340> swing<00:00:56.640> hit<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> ball<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.420> follow

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
then I swing hit the ball and follow

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.840 
then I swing hit the ball and follow
through<00:00:57.780> now<00:00:58.230> I'm<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.309> hit<00:00:59.370> some<00:00:59.550> tennis

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
through now I'm going to hit some tennis

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.660 
through now I'm going to hit some tennis
balls<00:01:00.059> starting<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> ready<00:01:01.050> position<00:01:01.109> I

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
balls starting in the ready position I

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.609 
balls starting in the ready position I
pivot<00:01:02.670> with<00:01:02.760> my<00:01:02.879> outside<00:01:03.059> foot<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.780> turn<00:01:04.409> my

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
pivot with my outside foot I turn my

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.350 
pivot with my outside foot I turn my
shoulders<00:01:04.650> again<00:01:05.580> that's<00:01:05.760> how<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> racket

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
shoulders again that's how the racket

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.880 
shoulders again that's how the racket
starts<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.750> come<00:01:06.930> back<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.380> shoulder<00:01:07.740> turn

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
starts to come back the shoulder turn

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.280 
starts to come back the shoulder turn
brings<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> racket<00:01:08.640> back<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.090> when<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:09.990> take

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
brings the racket back and when I take

back I'm not working any loop into the
motion<00:01:14.909> yet<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.360> want<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.540> get<00:01:15.600> it

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
motion yet I just want to get it

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.109 
motion yet I just want to get it
straight<00:01:15.869> back<00:01:16.369> into<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.520> racket<00:01:17.970> back

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
straight back into the racket back

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.840 
straight back into the racket back
position<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.439> worked<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
position that we worked in in the

position that we worked in in the
previous<00:01:21.270> video<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.810> right<00:01:22.110> now<00:01:22.320> my<00:01:22.979> body

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
previous video so right now my body

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.679 
previous video so right now my body
sideways<00:01:23.850> if<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.030> freeze<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.299> my<00:01:24.509> body

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
sideways if we freeze it my body

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.780 
sideways if we freeze it my body
sideways<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.799> racket<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.250> pointed<00:01:26.640> at

the previous video and then to swing in
the<00:01:34.470> hit<00:01:34.650> my<00:01:35.009> mechanics<00:01:35.549> are<00:01:35.700> exactly<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the hit my mechanics are exactly the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.300 
the hit my mechanics are exactly the
same<00:01:36.630> we've<00:01:37.049> already<00:01:37.259> worked<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.799> them<00:01:38.070> I

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
same we've already worked on them I

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.060 
same we've already worked on them I
swing<00:01:38.970> from<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.150> shoulder<00:01:39.680> hit<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.799> tennis
