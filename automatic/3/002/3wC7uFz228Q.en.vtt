00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.639
 hello everyone is welcome on 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.840

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.250

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.140
 probably do not know since we 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.330
 are at the swamp dance center so 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.309
 in Paris today we will find a 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.290
 pretty interesting person since we 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.670

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.350

 just got out called dancers and 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.439
 who is talking about classical dance and so 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.939
 so I thought what better 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.619
 that an interview is a girl rather 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.000
 nice rather known just for 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.859
 the event is precisely who if 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.760

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.960

 so we end up with mia frye that I 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.850
 am delighted to welcome today so 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.469
 it's a pretty special video because we 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.940
 has a guest a little bit of marc so 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.649
 I think everyone knows her 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.090
 but I will still ask you to 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.040
 make a small presentation to our 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.600
 subscribers to adjust namely a little 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.750
 little what do you do since how many 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.399
 time 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.989
 and why today we are going to talk about 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.230
 dancer movie I started by dancing 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.899
 classic bomb at the age of 5 this is 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.149
 my father-in-law jean paul goude whom I 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.160
 think a lot laughed knows the key that 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.440
 saw that made him there was 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.879
 little rat when he was a kid and so 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.100
 he has me he saw that I had no doubt 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.409
 this fiber this love of wanting to dance 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.339
 and he took me to a class of 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.409
 classic and I loved 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.180
 and that's it and if we have the gift and the hic 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.360
 work it can come 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.409
 so since play I teach dance here 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.119
 in this beautiful house which is the 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.770
 dance center of the swamp I'm not 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.350
 proud as a choreographer on 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.380
 feature films known to actors and 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.380
 actresses 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.219
 we will talk about the movie dancers and so 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.719
 in this movie there is a lot of 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.409
 competitiveness but also a lot of 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.819
 fraternity 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.020
 in the dance world 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:39.670
 you felt during your 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.799
 career of competitiveness 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.689
 first of all competitiveness it is 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.819
 done with oneself even in a very 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.100
 quickly by sowing father's evening it takes 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:50.469
 already be in the felt and then 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.329
 obviously the others around you 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:54.069
 are stimulants but it does not take 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.500
 especially not compare themselves because I 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.700
 think that for one year his excellent he 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.270
 must first that it is obviously a 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:13.540
 talent a gift and then to a very big 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:15.340
 personality classical dance I think 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.549
 that is to become in a fault 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.560
 high quality dancer 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.480
 you have to go through that is to say that 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.640
 same technique but now we like it or 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.150
 we do not like it's already a 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.579
 iron discipline which allows us 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.129
 really from i think to realize 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.690
 how far can we go 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.519
 it was really a very basic 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.720
 important to start there 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.549
 like that I would be really a little 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.750
 advice to give to all that we 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.130
 look there are a lot who want 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.840
 become an ice dance teacher 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.840
 is professional it is necessary 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:04.740
 we are safe from rhinitis or dan 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:06.360
 moussa sow according to one also speaks in 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.890
 the two boys movie basically 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.540
 so that was my little question 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.130
 in the world precisely of the 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.590
 dance guys have all played a little 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.900
 little more harm we will say to integrate 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.670
 that girls or not at all and by 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.950
 report precisely as and when 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.470
 years in what in what environment and what 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.350
 are a little bit more precisely 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.600
 demonstrated that girls benefit and 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.060
 we see it very well in the film 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.170
 that when one is a boy is stupid and 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.390
 we go into classical dance 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.850
 well we do not have a lot of 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.750
 competitors we are surrounded by v / very 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.630
 pretty girl 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.170
 we are somewhere in the center of interest 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.990
 of all of course the hopes of 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.660
 teachers and everything and everything 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.160
 camif the academy in general 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.910
 obviously he is wearing you because he 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.040
 there are not many 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.010
 and suddenly I think that learning 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.640
 which is conveyed is a pro of the sage of the 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.380
 tailored 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.660
 so I think that on the contrary it gives 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.709
 a moment of pleasure and that can be 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.160
 fantastic 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.630
 they have this elegance and discretion 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.940
 it's real gentlemen louis and I 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.959
 think that on the contrary it knows some 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.959
 thing you have to have a lot of respect 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.860
 for them it is very very hard 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.860
 and anger 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.260
 kill her 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:34.560
 always 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:37.080
 our troubles we follow throughout the film 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.090
 course these three guys are very 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.370
 several who have large low 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.890
 very different physical differences where 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:48.690
 seeing them evolve growing their doubts 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.450
 their questions their evolutions 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.730
 and it's a real thriller behind 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.680
 suspects behind where we understand 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.930
 really the psychology of each of them 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.370
 it's very very well done that brings me to 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.040
 my last question is what the movie 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.270
 you liked apparently yes but the dre 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.500
 that I think in the world of 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.210
 dance it must be a little bit of a 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.770
 revolution to redo a real movie 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.120
 psychological precisely on the dance 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.770
 because it's not really a medium 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.960
 that we approach a lot I find 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.090
 and that's a pity and this movie there what 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.550
 is great is that he is very very 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.580
 positive in the sense that we really 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.770
 the impression that we are with his paintings 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.810
 his three boys 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.650
 somewhere in each of them yann share 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.540
 from us there is the joy of succeeding open 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.430
 but there is also a sudden we are not 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.960
 never safe from injury in the 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.490
 dance is a simple injury and we 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.990
 can stop and dance klaas jan 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.670
 so that's very very hard is 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.320
 interrupted let's say that is going to francs 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.940
 in classical dance we can not cheat 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.860
 there are a lot of people 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.600
 who would be in power trip 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.340
 to do their job but that's when 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.960
 even elitist enough could say it all 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.400
 so in any case thank you more 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.960
 to have been with us today 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.190
