00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.849
 This is the first video that I make new 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.990
 year so congratulations to you wholeheartedly 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.330
 with all the past holidays I wish 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:19.109
 all the best of life health 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.340
 the sun bright cheerful dancing beautifully on 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.210
 Count of course a lot of people 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.170
 today's video is about 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.390
 movement and shaking things 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.880
 that before the new year I was asked about 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.960
 tom so i recorded such videos 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.270
 dedicated grip well shaking and so I 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.469
 decided to make some of these apparently 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:50.100
 today we will deal with your knees 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.739
 the usual classical Egyptian and her 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.550
 possible variations what is possible with her 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.579
 You can do in principle what I show 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.840
 this is somehow the final version 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.170
 you can think up some of your own 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.170
 then movement 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.630
 we are creating a little bit to pass 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.950
 done 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.430
 part straighten your knees and start 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.430
 compare 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:35.960
 Today 20 grams level 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:02:03.860
 so what we did on 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.240
 come on 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.209
 you can still move 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.250
 wait point 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.209
 our colleagues Creoss will be on the fact that 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.209
 called choo choo 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:16.739
 same way we can start 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.739
 move 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.400
 of course you need to relax completely 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.400
 we breed 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.610
 with 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.630
 thus show yourself as 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.600
 using the knee ligament and hope 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.340
 that you will apply our dancing 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.150
 collecting around good 3 pulling 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.150
 next many
