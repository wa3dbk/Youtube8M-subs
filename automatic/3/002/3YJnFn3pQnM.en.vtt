00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.910
 oh how about collectors i am sebas and 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.100
 welcome to a new video of the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.930
 collector of the world how are you 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.790
 after your holidays that you have 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.590
 made me among other things break my 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.300
 camcorder that's why I'm recording this 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.250
 video with the mobile which implies a 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.140
 little bit less quality but at the moment 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.910
 those of the guarantee have not returned the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.699
 camera so this is what there is but 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.420
 I suppose this is better than not going up 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.850
 videos I suppose that among other things 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.000
 I'm a little nervous because in 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.590
 I'm going to move this room 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.300
 you have been witnessing for two 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.980
 years will not be mine anymore if you are 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.540
 attentive on my main channel sebas live 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.640
 and especially to my secondary channel 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.890
 you keep my blog channel because there 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.260
 I talk about all this new experience and 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.780
 I'm documenting it and yes but of course 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.379
 move to Madrid specifically to getafe 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.690
 it's a problem because for me 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.309
 small so the video should try to 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.440
 the books that I'm going to take to Madrid 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.870
 I saw this theme for the first time in 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.109
 a video that went up when Lorraine moved 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.490
 to London and I think it has also made 

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:10.439
 holmes 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.240
 it will also move to Madrid because 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.250
 you have to bring your books well I 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.470
 He liked and already I do not have why 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.770
 give wall explanations that start 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.520
 the games d 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.520
 the shelf 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.899
 it's worth the first book that I'm going to take 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:34.850
 to madrid is going to be this normal person of 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.649
 benito is something this book was a gift 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.929
 a gift from Alberto Villarreal 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.219
 gave enough when he came to Madrid 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.770
 because this book is not available in 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.750
 Spain and he liked it so much he left us 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.610
 record of it and still not what 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.189
 started I have not read it so if 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.929
 technical normal person must bring 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.939
 with me for the next book that 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:54.950
 I choose will be disconnection of 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.450
 wilstermann this book was also a 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.060
 gift and I've been wanting to read it from 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.189
 a long time ago because reconnection 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.989
 the second part was prize for the best 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.590
 novel belonging to the saga of the year 

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:08.479
 2013 inside the rings around so 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.030
 that if the temple considers that this is 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.739
 the one that deserves a temple I have to 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.630
 read the book like it could not be from another 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.610
 way I have to carry soul main club 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.349
 tapes grace a day because I have not 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.940
 I still do not know how the blogosphere 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.739
 he keeps saying the word not having 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.150
 read yet this book has spoken to me 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.560
 wonders of the soul 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.480
 I am an extreme fan of the theater 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.299
 Shakespearean and I'm very curious 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.010
 alva you come with me madrid and talking 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.500
 of Shakespeare theater I do not think that 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.659
 I'm also going to take the olivia book 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.400
 shakespeare of real sofia is about the 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.319
 history of olivia shakespeare the 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.970
 sister of william shakespeare who 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.640
 supposedly he would have gone to live with 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.019
 him to london at the time when I saw him 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.849
 at the presentation of the celsius festival 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.989
 I really liked the idea so Olympia 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.269
 Shakespeare also comes with me 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.519
 walking and if I'm going to give you a 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.049
 small victory Shadowhunters of 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.909
 Rental houses are also coming 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.940
 with me to mattÃ­n you have been me 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:02.030
 attacking in such a way so that it starts 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.579
 to read this saga that is already going to 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.379
 to do, because, if I do not 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.269
 I mistake you with luxury told them in your video 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.359
 that Cassandra Clare was going to go through 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.220
 madrid at the end of 2014 so well yes 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.049
 I can sign it better so this is 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.049
 a small victory for you but 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.120
 not reduce 'aces' worth it can still be 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.159
 that you do not like it yes I think the next 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.709
 book that I'm going to take is the notebook 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.860
 aroa de francesc miralles book that 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.990
 by the way I have signed why 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.610
 is of course put me for sebastiÃ¡n and 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.950
 the purest journalist of this festival 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.870
 from 62 32 thanks for your delivery in 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.530
 so many talks with love and 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.420
 admiration 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.460
 francesc miralles I still was not 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.090
 journalist of that good and I continue without 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:47.290
 be it for the moment give me time is worth 1 2 3 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.240
 4 5 6 6 I'm missing 4 is very good 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.710
 I'm going to take the secret song of 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.870
 world of jose antonio cotrina the prize 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.900
 best national independent novel of 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.000
 year 2014 that is to say it won a template 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.550
 so you have to read this book in addition 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.550
 If I do not know what martyr will kill me 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.380
 I love it for people and I do not want 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.130
 that happens after the next 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.890
 book that I have to bring is the lady and 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.170
 the soap dragon and he sent me this book 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.540
 by mail a lot of time and 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.270
 I have not yet read is shameful for 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.600
 my part and also I dedicate it to me hello or 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.980
 be because you have such a letter 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.960
 wonderful I do not know if you're watching 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.780
 but it 's because of woman has a war 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.150
 because you write also and look at all this 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.650
 I draw it all this I prefer 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.080
 show you my selectivity agents 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.030
 It's worth losing my respect not only for 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.910
 the letter that I have but because they are 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.040
 full of cartoons and symbols of the 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.590
 Deathly Hallows' and is very finite 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.290
 Well evidently the book that I have 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.780
 what to wear look at this is my yong rim area 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.320
 the book that of course I have to 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.110
 carry is loyal to be able to finish 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.610
 a blanket time with the divergent saga 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.290
 I have been told that this ending is 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.910
 terrific I have been told that this ending is 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.070
 terrible they have told me everything 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.410
 they will venture half sunny they have told me 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.460
 what happens but I have not been told that the 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.919
 character happens 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.680
 so I'm there there I want to read to 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.240
 to be able to judge cohabiting and finally the 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.220
 tenth book that I'm going to take to 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.710

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:32.270
 points that I quite liked this 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.770
 history is but I did not never read it 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.840

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.970
