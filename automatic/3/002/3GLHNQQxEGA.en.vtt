her<00:00:45.720> speed<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.290> very<00:00:46.470> good<00:00:46.830> but<00:00:47.040> now<00:00:47.190> she's

her speed is very good but now she's
setting<00:00:47.880> up<00:00:48.060> to<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> triple<00:00:48.480> lutz

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
setting up to the triple lutz

setting up to the triple lutz
combination<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.130> what<00:00:50.370> got<00:00:50.760> her<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
combination this is what got her in the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.880 
combination this is what got her in the
short<00:00:51.420> program<00:00:52.460> she's<00:00:53.460> two-footed<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.210> lots

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.200 

I<00:01:05.909> think<00:01:06.720> Judy<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.290> she's<00:01:07.560> going<00:01:07.860> to

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
I think Judy that she's going to

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.300 
I think Judy that she's going to
probably<00:01:09.210> need<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.810> clean<00:01:10.320> up<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.710> landing<00:01:11.189> of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
probably need to clean up the landing of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.359 
probably need to clean up the landing of

that triple lutz jump in order to start
really<00:01:14.690> confidently<00:01:15.690> combining<00:01:16.440> it<00:01:16.560> with

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
really confidently combining it with

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.010 
really confidently combining it with
other<00:01:16.950> jumps<00:01:17.430> for<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> short<00:01:18.509> program

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020

combination you're right Chris these
triples<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.399> in<00:01:23.610> order<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.940> put

them<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.330> combination<00:01:26.899> but<00:01:27.899> again<00:01:28.170> she's

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
them in combination but again she's

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:54.240 
them in combination but again she's
having<00:01:28.799> problems<00:01:29.310> with<00:01:29.520> these<00:01:29.640> jumps

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.980 

what<00:01:55.250> I<00:01:55.280> find<00:01:55.610> lacking<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.180> Sara<00:01:56.420> skating<00:01:56.900> at

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
what I find lacking and Sara skating at

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.280 
what I find lacking and Sara skating at
this<00:01:57.140> point<00:01:57.440> is<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:58.340> level<00:01:58.790> of<00:01:59.290> expression

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
this point is the level of expression

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.240 
this point is the level of expression
and<00:02:00.650> focus<00:02:01.100> in<00:02:01.310> between<00:02:01.850> her<00:02:02.090> jobs<00:02:03.250> she

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
and focus in between her jobs she

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.940 
and focus in between her jobs she
doesn't<00:02:04.580> seem<00:02:04.760> to<00:02:04.790> be<00:02:05.150> into<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.200> music<00:02:06.530> with

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
doesn't seem to be into the music with

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.740 
doesn't seem to be into the music with
her<00:02:07.100> face<00:02:07.370> and<00:02:07.700> her<00:02:07.760> heart<00:02:08.119> she's<00:02:08.390> doing<00:02:08.660> it

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
her face and her heart she's doing it

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.359 
her face and her heart she's doing it
with<00:02:08.869> her<00:02:08.960> body<00:02:09.170> but<00:02:09.530> I<00:02:09.590> think<00:02:09.830> that's<00:02:10.040> just

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
with her body but I think that's just

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.120 
with her body but I think that's just
time<00:02:14.110> seems<00:02:15.110> like<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.380> same<00:02:15.590> sort<00:02:15.830> of<00:02:15.890> comment

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
time seems like the same sort of comment

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.250 
time seems like the same sort of comment
we<00:02:16.400> used<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.670> make<00:02:16.790> about<00:02:16.970> what<00:02:17.360> Tara<00:02:17.690> Lipinski

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
we used to make about what Tara Lipinski

we used to make about what Tara Lipinski
that's<00:02:18.800> right<00:02:21.940> there<00:02:22.940> are<00:02:23.180> some<00:02:23.510> similarities

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
that's right there are some similarities

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.590 
that's right there are some similarities
there<00:02:24.590> Bob<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.130> Judy<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:26.030> only<00:02:26.330> difference

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
there Bob and Judy the only difference

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.120 
there Bob and Judy the only difference
is<00:02:26.960> the<00:02:27.770> competition<00:02:28.280> aspect<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:30.440> athletic

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
is the competition aspect the athletic

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.700 
is the competition aspect the athletic
aspect<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.210> and<00:02:32.450> can<00:02:32.870> she<00:02:33.110> be<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.500> kind

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
aspect of this and can she be the kind

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.350

of<00:02:33.860> fighter<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.400> competitor<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.120> tara

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
of fighter and competitor the tara

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:56.350 
of fighter and competitor the tara
lipinski<00:02:35.540> is

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.130 

I<00:02:57.460> would<00:02:58.460> definitely<00:02:58.670> give<00:02:59.150> Sarah<00:02:59.480> use<00:02:59.810> my

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
I would definitely give Sarah use my

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.930 
I would definitely give Sarah use my
vote<00:03:00.380> of<00:03:00.500> confidence<00:03:00.530> her<00:03:01.520> mother<00:03:01.820> is

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
vote of confidence her mother is

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.020 
vote of confidence her mother is
struggling<00:03:02.420> with<00:03:02.600> cancer<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.470> she<00:03:03.770> is<00:03:04.030> almost

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
struggling with cancer and she is almost

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.330 
struggling with cancer and she is almost
beating<00:03:05.450> it<00:03:05.600> and<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:05.930> think<00:03:05.990> that<00:03:06.470> Sarah<00:03:07.100> Hughes

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
beating it and I think that Sarah Hughes

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.960 
beating it and I think that Sarah Hughes
can<00:03:07.730> draw<00:03:08.000> a<00:03:08.030> deep<00:03:08.890> in<00:03:09.890> her<00:03:10.190> skating<00:03:10.550> and<00:03:10.850> make

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
can draw a deep in her skating and make

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.260 
can draw a deep in her skating and make
it<00:03:11.120> work<00:03:11.300> for<00:03:11.330> her<00:03:12.580> skiing<00:03:13.580> is<00:03:13.700> definitely<00:03:14.240> a

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
it work for her skiing is definitely a

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.340 
it work for her skiing is definitely a
family<00:03:14.720> affair<00:03:14.810> in<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.290> huge<00:03:15.470> household

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
hughes from Great Neck New York now the

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.470 
hughes from Great Neck New York now the
problem<00:04:02.890> with<00:04:03.099> the<00:04:03.280> triple<00:04:03.580> lutz<00:04:03.670> is<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:04.239> foot

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
problem with the triple lutz is the foot

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.830 
problem with the triple lutz is the foot
is<00:04:04.599> too<00:04:04.840> high<00:04:05.080> before<00:04:05.590> she<00:04:05.860> taps<00:04:06.480> thus<00:04:07.480> getting

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
is too high before she taps thus getting

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.570 
is too high before she taps thus getting
her<00:04:08.050> forward<00:04:08.650> in<00:04:08.800> creating<00:04:09.280> a<00:04:09.370> balance

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
her forward in creating a balance

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.559 
her forward in creating a balance
problem<00:04:11.069> this<00:04:12.069> is<00:04:12.310> much<00:04:12.610> better<00:04:12.849> unbalanced

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
problem this is much better unbalanced
