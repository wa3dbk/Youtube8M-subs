00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:04.129
 we are getting more and more private Xerez command center I have six here 

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:07.360
 Monitors built on all the more it ashamed me than Petit 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.429
 together 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.199
 An idea has sent our for six goals forward a special one 

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:15.120
 monitor holder so that with the monitor can mount so finely together and 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.189
 equal to two graphics cards of the type Radeon HD 58 70 Bayfield victory very important 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.939
 they each have six monitors outputs and enough power 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.730
 not full resolution of these six monitors of 5000 40 times 2100 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.720
 to drive 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.919
 I just show it a few games and applications 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.310
 the huge picture area is actually a bit too close to it 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.780
 he saw it was better to grasp the distance over the gigantic picture 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.899
 because what for 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.699
 Clock still had to be Performance Fund but because I have to 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:44.269
 dispense even though we have two graphics cards 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.690
 What stands out especially in comparison to three monitors what as well as the 

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:51.179
 is dominated that he wants sex with her arms but very much in the field of vision 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:54.609
 Driver's macaws and Elmstein are exactly where the crosshairs are 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.140
 that is not quite optimal after all, the now even the frame 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.870
 Built culture that ensures that we have geometric objects such as 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.920
 Example gyro no longer distorted represent neither 2 but OK is white 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.870
 more power than the system delivers on the heels of the resolution of the phenomenon 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.730
 Ever the resolution must be reduced 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.460
 and show that you're confused to one's culture exactly means in 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.910
 In this case, we have now never activated the raven culture Zeis the fence 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.600
 not here 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.700
 believable about the different monitors because just the picture exactly 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.560
 what will change those machines and the reigning other pixels should continue 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.240
 be alleviated 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.240
 Mischievous manner of culture too 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.330
 to a Schendel resolution Smole he set up 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.280
 the simple pa plus change 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.280
 namely the ones behind in the frame 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.540
 and now 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.750
 is the transition 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.980
 much better previous Core can light something and her but that 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.950
 in principle 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.390
 the make clear difference in the case for example the tree here that 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.969
 now wants Vettel in the frame 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.559
 whatever the downside is the whole story thinks all in 

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:08.649
 Shoot here 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.419
 is my crosshair 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.879
 completely outside 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.299
 around the point of view 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.989
 So they are not exactly where I actually what I actually 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.579
 targeted 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.179
 I still found that only four 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:27.339
 Percent and in that of my name culture once reactivated because I yes 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:29.739
 somehow then everyone wants to see 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.019
 only on the reader that can visibly lit up extremely increased 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.570
 the big disadvantage it stops 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.550
 that's down there the act 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.849
 it would be dishonest the building defects 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.049
 Nissan would call it so overall it not only had to operate 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.509
 that even with the smallest I ever played 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:52.329
 but this great figurative sensibly arranges its Emnid with their end 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.759
 Nevertheless, it is more than impressive if you look Mina me every single one 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:58.759
 Consumption too can do everything I value to him 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.059
 six monitors are not only useful in the game but also on the 

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:06.059
 windows-desktop I have started to my Bing Maps from Microsoft 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:10.329
 unlike Google, which does not modulate many in the building in 3d 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.329
 They are good here now by moving to New York 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.959
 Of course this is just bauble but he wins six feet of construction if he does 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.979
 For example, a stock market environment used in professional segments 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:25.700
 and that's for play 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.949
 I do not think so 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.680
 6 0 of the very expensive I have the problem of illegal bike Weibels 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:35.459
 and then again Palop Albert this between rehearsals and 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.679
 Ramona from always we have to lie in the community field 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:41.519
 I still need a lot of graphics power 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.689
 have become much cheaper that he is suitable for playing just three 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.290
 Monitors with a center one left and one right
