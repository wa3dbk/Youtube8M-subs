00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:08.490
 Hey, people, I'm going to the area today. 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.800
 show you a good curiosity 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.170
 legal and gta5 that can be considered a 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.420
 mystery but by the way it is 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.520
 the way the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.470
 rockstar hides things in the game all 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.600
 Do you know that gta5 is annotated from 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.400
 references to people series and 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.140
 real life things like that car 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.510
 that fell off the cliff is a reference one 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.730
 Thelma and Louise movie that I and many of 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.230
 you did not watch or that place that 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.149
 You find a suitcase with money. 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.160
 with elements very similar to the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.870
 movie where the weak do not have the time 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.280
 which I think is funnier and will have five 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.410
 people that when we think we already 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.480
 saw and know everything about the games people 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.329
 You always find something that you did not notice. 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.670
 did not pay incredible attention well knowing 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.680
 If you come to this location, 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.340
 You saints saw this strange drawing 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.010
 the wall 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.199
 have you ever stopped to think that's fi 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.610
 that this guy gave me the drawing of the zone 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.710
 west that has some more 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.629
 difficult to identify a kind of mural 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.149
 reminiscent of those of the middle ages 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.189
 sort of on top of a year carpet 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.110
 it will be a weird business drawings that 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.790
 much talk in forums on the internet and 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.920
 many people believe that it is part of the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.689
 Malt mystery of her gda forums and 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.820
 reality the gang tries to identify the 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.009
 maximum that this mural means 80 in 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.140
 box it all possible theories 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.670
 you can understand that mysterious looks 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.710
 that he hides something to be 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.210
 deciphered or something like a message 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.799
 Secret do not know but I think it's more 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.720
 simple guys this one I 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.909
 I believe you are not even 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.950
 far away they identify everything is in it has 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.530
 a very surprising things there guys 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.299
 well let's go in the center of the drawing to 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.210
 looks like a bonfire and in front a 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.430
 circle that resembles oil half arms 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.350
 sprouting from the eye in the very strange business 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.790
 a very strange thing but the most 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.979
 interesting about this design is the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.380
 message that sits on the edge of the drawing 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.280
 hard to read but has a stanza 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.530
 and people 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.070
 the message says the following as the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.760
 android kms bring someone to become and death 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.100
 on decson for wii play the game 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.110
 a free translation when the great 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.050
 referee arrive to write the points 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.620
 next to your name and brand not if you 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.140
 has won 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.240
 but as you played the obvious that much 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.580
 People thought ours has a secret phrase. 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.050
 And we have to find out what this is. 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.120
 there must be something 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.160
 It's a fact that this message is a 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.230
 relatively well known situation in the 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.230
 united states is a stanza part of a 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.050
 poem called the fire in football in a 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.330
 Portuguese means and lounge in football 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.130
 written by a guy called before legal 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.420
 said she was well known in the 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.210
 united states for writing columns 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.800
 for newspapers in the 1930s 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.180
 It's fucking time. 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.340
 most likely someone there 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.010
 rockstar is fan of this guy fact that this 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.230
 word the android store before the galley 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.390
 know this poem asked in the mouth 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.160
 That's the ex-corde man, but I 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.050
 I think it 's just part of the phrase guys 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.630
 The strange thing is that in the original situation 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.270
 addition he note not if you won the 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.360
 profile or in the game phrase they 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.520
 they took the lost which is kind of weird 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.910
 Another curious thing is that the words 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.160
 right and death that they mean to write and 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.330
 I have changed places that I 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.220
 I realized at the time that I was editing 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.030
 A video galley I researched and saw that it is 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.770
 that's right 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.600
 Do you have any tips for some 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.200
 thing she was out of is not well 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.269
 weird 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.610
 already returning to the center of the drawing 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.560
 a few thousand blinking words that 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.630
 seem random but they are not 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.820
 guys if you watch well they form 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.630
 a very difficult phrase to read that says 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.060
 next 80 auto and office boy 8 one 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.730
 tall man and garden nearby and that what 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.130
 I spent the option in a free Portuguese 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.870
 with men everything is possible but with 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.880
 women all things are impossible 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.620
 If you can not stay out of the 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.690
 kitchen looks like a rock star zoeira 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.330
 with feminism in the galley but some 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.740
 users 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.330
 were also observed that the following 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.380
 phrase is very much like a verse 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.300
 Bibliography of Matthew chapter 25 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.610
 but I really believe that, what people 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.410
 if you club and are doing that do not 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.570
 much sense now the most thing 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.000
 strange of this drawing are these two 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.220
 arms coming out of the circle in the center 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.720
 Can you see what the arms are? 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.700
 are doing I'm sure that 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.160
 many of you are not getting 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.800
 already identify that this mosaic means 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.709
 Vital mess up a lot but watch people 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.260
 watch well have fingers there arms 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.030
 guys are doing this move can 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.460
 to observe you know that this movement 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.490
 this was not a gesture of shuttlecock to the 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.710
 be very malicious puts dick ipec 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.520
 all place of the game and here it would not go either 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.960
 be different 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.210
 some people say it's a gesture 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.320
 illuminati but the illuminati gesture is medium 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.970
 different galley 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.400
 even in the United States where the game was 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.080
 created the shuttlecock symbol that's it for 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.610
 last there behind the drawing the people 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.230
 can get something that resembles a 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.760
 outside labyrinth says that this 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.620
 labyrinth is similar to the 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.360
 montijo but a vote fernando galera eu 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.790
 I think it's just a mosaic that they put 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.000
 back but if you read carefully you will see 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.760
 writing asking to start suggesting 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.290
 some kind of game 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.390
 recapitulating the game symbol 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.910
 the eye that many people say is not a 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.919
 I look at a message about cooking one 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.140
 phrase of a sports spirit fire in 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.390
 arms making a shuttlecock symbol 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.590
 which means that very strange guys 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.540
 hard to imagine 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.430
 Then you must be wondering what? 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.620
 I think it's this moral 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.090
 I really did not understand very well what 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.460
 this morality is to pass the crowd today 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.770
 well confused I believe you have a 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.790
 hidden and unrelated message 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.350
 with the mystery 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.510
 I say this because there is nothing in this 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.590
 drawing seems to be part of the mystery 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.479
 from montijo 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.240
 except for the fact that it's very strange 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.919
 mysterious think the quote the message 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.140
 what does it mean the prizes of each 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.150
 mission is how you played them like 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.130
 gold platinum trophy you win 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.510
 after making x-rays the lessons that 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.340
 the symbol of imagina 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.260
 in some reference to women perhaps 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.690
 even an enemy movie as you know 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.790
 that gta5 references are not written 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.010
 very hard to find or maybe 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.140
 even a joke with illuminati I do not know 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.630
 a hidden message is a relationship of the 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.330
 phrase around with the shuttlecock symbol 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.460
 I do not know it's very confusing but I think 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.100
 that there is something a puzzle was going to be solved 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.650
 that I really do not know what a 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.990
 Warning crowd on Saturday or 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.940
 another Saturday but most likely already 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.560
 on Saturday now I'll bring it to you 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.570
 my theory on the mystery of the hill 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.820
 in a very big video showing the real 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.160
 meaning of camp rip rip 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.990
 the ictc jump was all I believe in 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.790
 What is the script almost ready for? 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.320
 There are only a few things that need to be done. 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.600
 most likely already have on Saturday already 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.370
 beauty channel and in my theory I do not 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.260
 That 's it. 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.880
 Some things in this video galera. 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.310
 I came from the hit, I'm going to leave the link in the 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.750
 discretion for you to observe he was 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.700
 This is it people, I hope you have 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.470
 liked enjoyed the video is turned on 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.730
 angle to which the channel is inserted if 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.110
 enjoy the twenty and such an extension 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:46.850
 google chrome and that's it guys 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.850
 Success hug and see you later
