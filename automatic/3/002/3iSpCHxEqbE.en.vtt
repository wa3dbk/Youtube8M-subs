00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.590
 good damage besides that I would have 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.020
 nice to see what that gives when 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.090

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.690
 for the president in a message 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.790
 addressed to his few hundred 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.130
 thousands of fans since the mistake was 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.960
 repaired and the password change before 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.380
 that another male a pirate again the 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.750
 page 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.460
 yesterday morning so there no need to do 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.170
 something already that determines the 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.090
 passwords there it becomes any 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.400
 what good guys the time is serious 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.330
 1 2 3 4 it was way too simple 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.410
 as a password that's why we have 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.370
 chose a new password generated 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:34.640
 randomly she discover ok I 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.400
 never remember it turns figures 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.470
 maybe now we guys get the 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.470
 play security I finished hacking 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:52.730
 carlos01 say it's easy to remember 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.790
 because he thinks it's good baby foot what 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.470
 sports and we go on with the 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.640
 unusual news of the day is history 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.170
 of a young man in New Jersey 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.090
 working in a restaurant that 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.190
 prepare a policeman's sandwich until 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.510
 there is nothing wrong except that this policeman 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.430
 had arrested the young man in question 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.060
 a few weeks earlier and the latter 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.400
 for revenge decided to integrate 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.200
 surprise element in the sandwich for 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.790
 do not quote the hair present in his 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.110
 underpants 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.090
 obviously the policeman noticed 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.550
 and our young man got fifteen 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.730
 days of jail for contempt of agent in 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.080
 same time it was not super clever you 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.280

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.040

 but in the beginning it was not necessary for us 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.580
 unusual never comes alone it's the 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.319
 rule always in new-jersey as 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.880
 what they had to do the word I know 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.980
 not a man pointed a supermarket 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.569
 with a knife to start with 200 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.549
 dollars that's the part it's still going 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.950
 a few days later he comes back 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.580
 rob the same supermarket but disguised 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.290
 this time it was not a mustache 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.910
 and the seller has noticed that 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.580
 that was the same person you astonish me 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.410
 a little effort in disguise 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.209
 the guys 1 it does not hurt at least 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.209
 a wig or something like that 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:29.380
 it was you who came yesterday that the 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:30.660
 mustache bad at all I traded his 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.740
 tuna cans 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.229
 adacore not sorry I had confused 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.840
