00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
though I guess release that will try

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.280 
though I guess release that will try
this<00:02:52.350> one<00:02:52.590> more<00:02:52.620> time<00:02:53.600> before<00:02:54.600> we<00:02:54.780> go<00:02:54.930> on<00:02:55.049> to<00:02:55.260> a

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
this one more time before we go on to a

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.449 
this one more time before we go on to a
different<00:02:55.470> location
