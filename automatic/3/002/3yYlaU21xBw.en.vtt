has already been a great product and you

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.910 
has already been a great product and you
know<00:00:32.550> refreshing<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:34.380> know<00:00:34.410> making

know refreshing it and you know making
it<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> little<00:00:35.280> bit<00:00:35.460> more<00:00:35.579> new<00:00:35.760> giving<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.360> little

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
it a little bit more new giving a little

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.090 
it a little bit more new giving a little
bit<00:00:36.630> more<00:00:36.719> enhanced<00:00:37.110> design<00:00:37.410> but<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> lot<00:00:38.070> of

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
bit more enhanced design but a lot of

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.860 
bit more enhanced design but a lot of
the<00:00:38.280> great<00:00:38.550> technologies<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.750> been

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
the great technologies that have been

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.510 
the great technologies that have been
the<00:00:39.989> standard<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.710> why<00:00:40.860> reference<00:00:41.399> has<00:00:41.489> been

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
the standard and why reference has been

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.299 
the standard and why reference has been
so<00:00:41.820> successful<00:00:42.020> continue<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.170> reference<00:00:43.559> x<00:00:43.770> we

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
so successful continue on reference x we

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.190 
so successful continue on reference x we
keep<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> edge<00:00:44.730> driven<00:00:45.120> dome<00:00:45.270> tweeter<00:00:45.600> so

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.460 
infinitely start of that a number of
years<00:01:32.400> ago<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.360> now<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.900> get<00:01:34.140> great

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
years ago so you now you get great

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.350 
years ago so you now you get great
mid-range<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.340> great<00:01:35.460> bass<00:01:35.640> response<00:01:35.820> from<00:01:36.240> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
mid-range and great bass response from a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.450 
mid-range and great bass response from a
speaker<00:01:36.750> where<00:01:37.170> maybe<00:01:37.409> sometime<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.250> haven't

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
speaker where maybe sometime you haven't

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.980 
speaker where maybe sometime you haven't
added<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.939> stuff<00:01:39.150> will<00:01:39.329> subwoofer<00:01:39.810> yet

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
added in that stuff will subwoofer yet

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.319 
added in that stuff will subwoofer yet
so<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:40.650> continue<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.220> use<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.549> +1<00:01:41.790> Wulfric<00:01:42.210> oh

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
so we continue to use that +1 Wulfric oh

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.539 
so we continue to use that +1 Wulfric oh
the<00:01:43.140> other<00:01:43.259> great<00:01:43.470> thing<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.950> reference<00:01:44.369> s

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
the other great thing that reference s

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.880 
the other great thing that reference s
continues<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.270> low<00:01:45.689> impedance<00:01:46.020> speaker

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
continues is that low impedance speaker

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.319 
continues is that low impedance speaker
so<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.100> actually<00:01:47.369> are<00:01:47.729> these<00:01:47.880> are<00:01:48.000> 3<00:01:48.210> ohm

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
so we actually are these are 3 ohm

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.179 
so we actually are these are 3 ohm
speakers<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.930> year<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.829> now<00:01:49.950> they're<00:01:50.100> going
