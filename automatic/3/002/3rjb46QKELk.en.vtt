would see for now I had done all the
other<00:00:32.780> objectives<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.320> just<00:00:34.559> had<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.800> get

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
other objectives but I just had to get

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.260 
other objectives but I just had to get
the<00:00:35.100> underslung<00:00:35.340> grenade<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.000> about<00:00:36.210> a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
the underslung grenade this is about a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.180 
the underslung grenade this is about a
10<00:00:36.510> minute<00:00:36.719> clear<00:00:36.989> broken<00:00:37.350> up<00:00:37.440> into<00:00:37.590> about<00:00:37.890> I

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
10 minute clear broken up into about I

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.930 
10 minute clear broken up into about I
know<00:00:38.540> nearly<00:00:39.540> three<00:00:39.899> minutes<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.320> guess<00:00:40.350> and

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
know nearly three minutes I guess and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.340 
know nearly three minutes I guess and
the<00:00:41.940> shit<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.300> had<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.510> go<00:00:42.719> through<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.050> get<00:00:43.200> this

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
the shit I had to go through to get this

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.170 
the shit I had to go through to get this
was<00:00:43.590> unbelievable<00:00:44.370> i<00:00:44.399> thought<00:00:44.640> i'd<00:00:44.789> do<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.059> on

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
was unbelievable i thought i'd do it on

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.760 
was unbelievable i thought i'd do it on
this<00:00:45.300> map<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.170> would<00:00:46.649> have

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
this map just because it would have

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.590 
this map just because it would have
seemed<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.160> lot<00:00:47.309> simpler<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:47.850> obviously<00:00:48.329> it

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
seemed a lot simpler but obviously it

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600 
seemed a lot simpler but obviously it
didn't<00:00:48.899> seem<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.140> simple<00:00:49.649> at<00:00:49.770> all<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.460> was

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
didn't seem that simple at all it was

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.130 
didn't seem that simple at all it was
actually<00:00:50.730> rather<00:00:51.059> difficult<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:51.780> me<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.989> get

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
actually rather difficult for me to get

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200 
actually rather difficult for me to get
it<00:00:52.289> but<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.100> end<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.370> ended<00:00:53.399> up<00:00:53.730> getting<00:00:53.940> it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
it but in the end I ended up getting it

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.939 
it but in the end I ended up getting it
and<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.480> could<00:00:54.750> use<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.960> high<00:00:55.230> explosive<00:00:55.739> bolt

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
and I could use the high explosive bolt

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.889 
and I could use the high explosive bolt
now<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.550> high<00:00:56.699> explosive<00:00:57.180> bold<00:00:57.449> itself<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
now the high explosive bold itself I

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.569 
now the high explosive bold itself I
used<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.379> few<00:00:58.410> times<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.160> seems<00:00:59.399> like

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
used it a few times but it seems like

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.400 
used it a few times but it seems like
it's<00:00:59.730> got<00:00:59.850> more<00:01:00.120> drop<00:01:00.510> than<00:01:00.780> normal<00:01:01.199> bulb

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
it's got more drop than normal bulb

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.930 
it's got more drop than normal bulb
because<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.829> their<00:01:01.949> weight<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.640> end<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.850> it

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
because of their weight on the end of it

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.090 
because of their weight on the end of it
from<00:01:03.000> these<00:01:03.210> explosives<00:01:03.989> now<00:01:04.680> being<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.070> I

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
from these explosives now being that I

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.280 
from these explosives now being that I
think<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.549> may<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.760> an<00:01:06.210> actual<00:01:06.600> plastic

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
think it may be an actual plastic

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.050 
think it may be an actual plastic
explosive<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.310> end<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> bolt<00:01:08.820> itself

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
explosive on the end of the bolt itself

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.630 
explosive on the end of the bolt itself
to<00:01:10.049> our<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.680> know<00:01:10.799> sort<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.310> weigh<00:01:11.520> it

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
to our you know sort of just weigh it

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.429 
to our you know sort of just weigh it
down<00:01:11.670> well<00:01:12.240> not<00:01:12.450> weigh<00:01:12.630> down<00:01:12.659> but<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.200> give<00:01:13.320> it

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
down well not weigh down but to give it

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.710 
down well not weigh down but to give it
that<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.799> know<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.520> boom<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.390> hits<00:01:15.570> you

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
that you know that boom and it hits you

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.010 
that you know that boom and it hits you
but<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:17.220> other<00:01:17.369> way<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.420> was<00:01:18.659> actually

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
but in other way is it was actually

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.109 
but in other way is it was actually
really<00:01:19.200> good<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.890> raised<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.759> little<00:01:20.880> bit<00:01:21.090> i

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
really good I raised a little bit i

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.550 
really good I raised a little bit i
didn't<00:01:21.509> actually<00:01:21.600> record<00:01:22.049> my<00:01:22.170> voice<00:01:22.350> because

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
didn't actually record my voice because

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.859 
didn't actually record my voice because
it<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.070> put<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> man<00:01:23.520> no<00:01:24.000> point<00:01:24.330> at<00:01:24.479> all<00:01:24.600> but

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
it just put a man no point at all but
