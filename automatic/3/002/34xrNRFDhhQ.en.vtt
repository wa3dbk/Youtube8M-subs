the<00:00:29.130> Southwest<00:00:29.550> flies<00:00:29.789> their<00:00:30.000> planes<00:00:30.269> more

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
the Southwest flies their planes more

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.020 
the Southwest flies their planes more
hours<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.140> day<00:00:31.369> they<00:00:32.369> fly<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> much<00:00:32.790> shorter

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
hours in the day they fly a much shorter

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.540 
hours in the day they fly a much shorter
stage<00:00:33.390> length<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.500> they<00:00:34.649> get<00:00:34.800> six<00:00:35.190> seven

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
stage length so they get six seven

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.150 
stage length so they get six seven
flights<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.969> day<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:37.160> pressurization

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
flights a day and so that pressurization

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.330 
flights a day and so that pressurization
depressurization<00:00:38.910> landing<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.780> taking<00:00:39.989> off

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
depressurization landing and taking off

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.670 
depressurization landing and taking off
stress<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> airplane<00:00:42.020> weakens<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.500> so

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
stress on the airplane weakens it and so

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.740 
stress on the airplane weakens it and so
Boeing's<00:00:44.460> always<00:00:44.730> been<00:00:44.910> known<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.390> making<00:00:45.480> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
Boeing's always been known for making a

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.680 
Boeing's always been known for making a
lighter<00:00:45.960> airplane<00:00:46.440> with<00:00:46.710> thinner<00:00:46.950> skin<00:00:47.690> with

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
lighter airplane with thinner skin with

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.279 
lighter airplane with thinner skin with
more<00:00:49.140> fragile<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:50.309> mean<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.989> take<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
more fragile I mean that if you take the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.930 
more fragile I mean that if you take the
Aloha<00:00:52.590> Airlines<00:00:52.739> airplane<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.640> blue<00:00:53.820> at

of<00:01:07.979> their<00:01:08.250> plane<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.689> know<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:10.020> it's

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
of their plane so you know it's it's

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.330 
of their plane so you know it's it's
it's<00:01:10.979> metal<00:01:11.460> fatigue<00:01:11.580> it's<00:01:12.770> many<00:01:13.770> flights<00:01:14.100> and

it's metal fatigue it's many flights and
they<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.549> need<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.790> do<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> better<00:01:14.970> job

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090

next<00:01:40.439> startup<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.250> Brazil<00:01:41.729> could<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.030> spend<00:01:42.240> a

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
next startup in Brazil could you spend a

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.399 
next startup in Brazil could you spend a
couple<00:01:42.390> minutes<00:01:42.570> talking<00:01:42.840> about<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.170> please

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
couple minutes talking about that please

yeah<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.640> started<00:01:45.060> two<00:01:45.180> years<00:01:45.210> ago<00:01:45.860> we'll

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
yeah we started two years ago we'll

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.800 
yeah we started two years ago we'll
probably<00:01:47.040> do<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.700> billion<00:01:48.240> dollars<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.630> sales

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810
