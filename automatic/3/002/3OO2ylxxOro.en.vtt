we're<00:00:33.080> having<00:00:33.230> high<00:00:33.440> temperatures<00:00:33.949> and<00:00:34.190> in

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
we're having high temperatures and in

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.430 
we're having high temperatures and in
the<00:00:34.730> last<00:00:34.910> few<00:00:35.180> weeks<00:00:35.210> we've<00:00:36.050> seen<00:00:36.230> a<00:00:36.260> lot<00:00:36.410> of

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
the last few weeks we've seen a lot of

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.710 
the last few weeks we've seen a lot of
brown<00:00:36.710> patch<00:00:36.920> develop<00:00:37.430> in<00:00:38.059> landscapes<00:00:38.600> across

brown patch develop in landscapes across

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.530 
brown patch develop in landscapes across
Nebraska<00:00:39.500> and<00:00:39.680> the<00:00:40.519> reason<00:00:40.820> for<00:00:40.850> that<00:00:41.090> is<00:00:41.300> is

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
Nebraska and the reason for that is is

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.939 
Nebraska and the reason for that is is
because<00:00:41.690> we've<00:00:41.960> got<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:42.350> temperature<00:00:42.769> now

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
because we've got the temperature now

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.340 
because we've got the temperature now
that's<00:00:43.610> really<00:00:43.910> favorable<00:00:44.420> in<00:00:44.900> all<00:00:45.080> of<00:00:45.230> your

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
that's really favorable in all of your

that's really favorable in all of your

at night that's the worst thing you can

at night that's the worst thing you can
do<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:43.220> really<00:01:43.460> favor<00:01:43.880> a<00:01:44.180> brown<00:01:44.750> patch<00:01:45.020> you

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
do to really favor a brown patch you

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.929 
do to really favor a brown patch you
know<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.500> optimum<00:01:45.920> time<00:01:46.100> for<00:01:46.310> irrigation<00:01:46.640> is

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
know the optimum time for irrigation is

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:47.859 
know the optimum time for irrigation is
early<00:01:47.240> in<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.420> morning

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
early in the morning

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.319 
early in the morning
that<00:01:48.229> way<00:01:48.350> we<00:01:48.530> reduce<00:01:48.920> that<00:01:49.220> dead<00:01:49.640> due<00:01:49.880> period

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
that way we reduce that dead due period

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.719 
that way we reduce that dead due period
by<00:01:50.450> actually<00:01:50.900> washing<00:01:51.380> that<00:01:51.860> turf<00:01:52.130> off<00:01:52.400> and

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
by actually washing that turf off and

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.310 
by actually washing that turf off and
that<00:01:53.060> might<00:01:53.270> be<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.450> little<00:01:53.600> counterintuitive

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
that might be a little counterintuitive

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.350 
that might be a little counterintuitive
because<00:01:54.829> we<00:01:55.070> think<00:01:55.280> of<00:01:55.430> wetting<00:01:56.030> that<00:01:56.150> turf

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
because we think of wetting that turf

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.999 
because we think of wetting that turf
that<00:01:56.390> we're<00:01:56.630> keeping<00:01:56.869> it<00:01:56.900> wet<00:01:57.049> longer<00:01:57.470> but

that we're keeping it wet longer but

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.410 
that we're keeping it wet longer but
actually<00:01:58.340> studies<00:01:58.640> have<00:01:58.790> shown<00:01:59.000> that<00:01:59.240> if

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
actually studies have shown that if

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.149 
actually studies have shown that if
we'll<00:01:59.990> put<00:02:00.320> that<00:02:00.409> irrigation<00:02:00.860> on<00:02:00.979> in<00:02:01.100> the

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
we'll put that irrigation on in the

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.649 
we'll put that irrigation on in the
morning<00:02:01.490> that<00:02:01.579> will<00:02:01.670> reduce<00:02:01.820> that<00:02:02.180> layer<00:02:02.420> on

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
morning that will reduce that layer on

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.929 
morning that will reduce that layer on
the<00:02:02.780> turf<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.110> it'll<00:02:03.320> dry<00:02:03.500> quicker<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.790> other

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
the turf and it'll dry quicker the other

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.429 
the turf and it'll dry quicker the other
thing<00:02:05.180> that<00:02:05.210> really<00:02:05.479> favors<00:02:05.899> brown<00:02:06.110> patches

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
thing that really favors brown patches

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.819 
thing that really favors brown patches
high<00:02:07.130> levels<00:02:07.549> of<00:02:07.670> fertility<00:02:08.140> so<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:09.619> know<00:02:09.709> if

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:09.829 
high levels of fertility so you know if

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.140 
high levels of fertility so you know if
you're<00:02:09.950> following<00:02:10.310> recommendations<00:02:10.970> that

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
you're following recommendations that

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.460 
you're following recommendations that
Rock<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.600> others<00:02:11.780> talked<00:02:11.989> about<00:02:12.230> on<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.440> show

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470

not<00:02:13.370> fertilizing<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:14.060> turf<00:02:14.239> in<00:02:14.420> midsummer

not fertilizing that turf in midsummer

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.819 
not fertilizing that turf in midsummer
that's<00:02:14.989> going<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.230> be<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.410> best<00:02:15.590> thing

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:15.829 
that's going to be the best thing

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.800 
that's going to be the best thing
because<00:02:16.700> if<00:02:16.820> you're<00:02:17.000> in<00:02:17.060> an<00:02:17.299> excess<00:02:17.660> of

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
because if you're in an excess of

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.630 
because if you're in an excess of
nitrogen<00:02:17.989> situation<00:02:18.829> that's<00:02:19.010> also<00:02:19.430> going<00:02:19.579> to

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
nitrogen situation that's also going to

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.970 
nitrogen situation that's also going to
favor<00:02:20.180> brown<00:02:20.510> patch<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.110> again<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:21.769> is<00:02:21.950> a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
favor brown patch and again this is a

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.729 
favor brown patch and again this is a
disease<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:22.700> mostly<00:02:23.120> we'll<00:02:23.720> see<00:02:23.989> in<00:02:24.230> those

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
disease that mostly we'll see in those

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.220 
disease that mostly we'll see in those
fescue<00:02:25.280> lawns<00:02:25.879> but<00:02:26.540> we<00:02:26.660> will<00:02:26.840> occasionally

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
fescue lawns but we will occasionally

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.699 
fescue lawns but we will occasionally
see<00:02:27.349> it<00:02:27.500> in<00:02:27.620> blue<00:02:27.770> grass

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
see it in blue grass

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.000 
see it in blue grass
now<00:02:29.709> when<00:02:30.489> we're<00:02:30.670> looking<00:02:30.790> at<00:02:31.120> management<00:02:32.010> for

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
now when we're looking at management for

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.069 
now when we're looking at management for
brown<00:02:33.189> patch<00:02:33.459> we're<00:02:34.150> going<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.540> target<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:35.049> few

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
brown patch we're going to target a few

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.780 
brown patch we're going to target a few
different<00:02:35.769> things<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:36.129> know<00:02:36.189> first<00:02:36.489> of<00:02:36.700> all

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
different things you know first of all

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.699 
different things you know first of all
this<00:02:36.939> is<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.150> disease<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.379> doesn't

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
this is a disease that that doesn't

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.360 
this is a disease that that doesn't
necessarily<00:02:39.719> take<00:02:40.719> the<00:02:41.319> turf<00:02:41.560> out<00:02:41.739> totally<00:02:42.250> it

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
necessarily take the turf out totally it

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.339 
necessarily take the turf out totally it
will<00:02:42.519> thin<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.790> turf<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.329> you<00:02:43.780> can<00:02:44.019> really

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
will thin the turf and you can really

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.500 
will thin the turf and you can really
work<00:02:45.069> with<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.340> by<00:02:45.459> just<00:02:45.819> or<00:02:45.970> manage<00:02:46.209> it<00:02:46.359> by

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
work with it by just or manage it by

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.599 
work with it by just or manage it by
over<00:02:46.780> seeding<00:02:47.019> in<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.349> fall<00:02:47.590> but<00:02:48.220> if<00:02:48.430> you'd

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
over seeding in the fall but if you'd

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.369 
over seeding in the fall but if you'd
like<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.879> have<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.540> turf<00:02:49.810> looking<00:02:50.200> good

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
like to have that that turf looking good

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.750 
like to have that that turf looking good
in<00:02:50.560> green<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:50.980> not<00:02:51.040> having<00:02:51.400> these<00:02:51.489> brown

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
in green and not having these brown

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.190 
in green and not having these brown
patches<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.299> we've<00:02:52.420> talked<00:02:52.689> about<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.140> the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
patches that we've talked about and the

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.229 
patches that we've talked about and the
symptoms<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.620> we<00:02:53.739> see<00:02:54.040> then<00:02:54.819> we're<00:02:55.090> going<00:02:55.209> to

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
symptoms that we see then we're going to

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.759 
symptoms that we see then we're going to
be<00:02:55.359> looking<00:02:55.599> at<00:02:55.720> possibly<00:02:56.139> a<00:02:56.230> fungicide

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
be looking at possibly a fungicide

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.280 
be looking at possibly a fungicide
application<00:02:57.489> but<00:02:58.420> first<00:02:58.659> I<00:02:58.810> like<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:58.989> try

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
application but first I like to try

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.170 
application but first I like to try
those<00:02:59.889> more<00:03:00.159> green<00:03:00.370> approaches<00:03:00.879> and<00:03:01.060> make

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
those more green approaches and make

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.059 
those more green approaches and make
sure<00:03:01.329> we're<00:03:02.109> cutting<00:03:02.379> back<00:03:02.530> any<00:03:02.769> kind<00:03:03.040> of

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
sure we're cutting back any kind of

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.190 
sure we're cutting back any kind of
fertility<00:03:03.400> in<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.700> summer<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.569> we're

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
fertility in the summer that we're

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.470 
fertility in the summer that we're
following<00:03:05.319> good<00:03:05.680> turf<00:03:05.859> management<00:03:06.299> we're<00:03:07.299> not

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
following good turf management we're not

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.470 
following good turf management we're not
running<00:03:07.689> those<00:03:07.930> sprinklers<00:03:08.470> at<00:03:09.400> night<00:03:09.669> you

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
running those sprinklers at night you

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.020 
running those sprinklers at night you
know<00:03:10.590> watering<00:03:11.590> infrequently<00:03:12.220> as<00:03:12.430> much<00:03:12.849> as

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
know watering infrequently as much as

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.539 
know watering infrequently as much as
possible<00:03:13.290> watching<00:03:14.290> those<00:03:14.439> new<00:03:14.620> periods<00:03:15.040> and

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
possible watching those new periods and

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:16.860 
possible watching those new periods and
those<00:03:15.669> are<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.879> two<00:03:16.060> main<00:03:16.239> things<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.720> then

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
those are the two main things and then

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.539 
those are the two main things and then
if<00:03:16.989> that's<00:03:17.109> not<00:03:17.290> holding<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:17.980> disease<00:03:18.280> back

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
if that's not holding the disease back

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.629 
if that's not holding the disease back
and<00:03:19.299> we're<00:03:19.450> still<00:03:19.689> have<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.650> turf<00:03:20.919> that's<00:03:21.159> not

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
and we're still have a turf that's not

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.429 
and we're still have a turf that's not
having<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.060> good<00:03:22.209> quality<00:03:22.629> then<00:03:23.139> that's<00:03:23.290> when

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:23.439 
having a good quality then that's when

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:24.929 
having a good quality then that's when
we're<00:03:23.530> looking<00:03:23.739> at<00:03:23.829> fungicide<00:03:24.280> applications

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:24.939 
we're looking at fungicide applications

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:27.990 
we're looking at fungicide applications
and<00:03:25.150> there's<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:25.989> many<00:03:26.980> different<00:03:27.489> fungicides

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
and there's a many different fungicides

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.479 
and there's a many different fungicides
that<00:03:28.060> can<00:03:28.269> be<00:03:28.389> used<00:03:28.629> for<00:03:29.319> brown<00:03:29.709> patch<00:03:29.950> control

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
that can be used for brown patch control

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.849 
that can be used for brown patch control
those<00:03:31.150> that<00:03:31.389> contain<00:03:31.859> strobilurin

those that contain strobilurin

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.530 
those that contain strobilurin
fungicides<00:03:32.889> are<00:03:33.790> some<00:03:34.239> of<00:03:34.329> the<00:03:34.389> better

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
fungicides are some of the better

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.869 
fungicides are some of the better
products<00:03:35.049> but<00:03:35.979> there's<00:03:36.129> a<00:03:36.190> wide<00:03:36.400> range<00:03:36.430> that

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 
products but there's a wide range that
