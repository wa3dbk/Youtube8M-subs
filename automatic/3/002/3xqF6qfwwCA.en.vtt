00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.380 

so<00:02:14.010> just<00:02:14.340> make<00:02:14.490> sure<00:02:14.520> you're<00:02:14.820> looking<00:02:15.120> at<00:02:15.210> your

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
so just make sure you're looking at your

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.560 
so just make sure you're looking at your
labs<00:02:16.340> making<00:02:17.340> sure<00:02:17.460> if<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.730> have<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> high

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
labs making sure if you have a high

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.350 
labs making sure if you have a high
create<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.520> very<00:02:20.820> serious<00:02:21.150> for<00:02:21.930> your<00:02:22.260> an

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
create that is very serious for your an

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.970 
create that is very serious for your an
indication<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.660> acute<00:02:25.020> renal<00:02:25.140> failure<00:02:25.260> you

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
indication of acute renal failure you

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.220 
indication of acute renal failure you
probably<00:02:26.400> need<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.610> call<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.000> doctor<00:02:27.110> get<00:02:28.110> an

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
probably need to call the doctor get an

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.790 
probably need to call the doctor get an
order<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:29.010> start<00:02:29.700> fluids<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:31.020> start<00:02:31.320> dopamine

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
order to start fluids to start dopamine

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.430 
order to start fluids to start dopamine
to<00:02:32.670> start<00:02:32.970> getting<00:02:33.330> your<00:02:33.480> patient<00:02:33.930> prepared

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
to start getting your patient prepared

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.070 
to start getting your patient prepared
and<00:02:34.650> pushing<00:02:35.220> them<00:02:35.400> into<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:36.450> diuretic

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
and pushing them into that diuretic

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.120 
and pushing them into that diuretic
phase<00:02:37.320> okay

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
phase okay

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.500 
phase okay
so<00:02:38.850> next<00:02:39.150> let's<00:02:39.570> go<00:02:39.750> into<00:02:40.200> our<00:02:41.510> hemodialysis

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
so next let's go into our hemodialysis

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.540 
so next let's go into our hemodialysis
patients
