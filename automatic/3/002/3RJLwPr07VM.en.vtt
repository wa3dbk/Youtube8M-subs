recently changed sample rates on my
audio<00:04:05.319> interface<00:04:05.770> as<00:04:06.280> well<00:04:06.459> as<00:04:06.640> my<00:04:06.790> computer

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
audio interface as well as my computer

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.550 
audio interface as well as my computer
audio<00:04:07.750> so<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:08.530> am<00:04:09.160> recording<00:04:10.030> as<00:04:10.180> high<00:04:10.540> as<00:04:12.480> high

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
audio so I am recording as high as high

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.039 
audio so I am recording as high as high
quality<00:04:14.560> as<00:04:14.890> I<00:04:15.040> can<00:04:15.340> and<00:04:15.780> recording<00:04:16.780> it<00:04:16.930> like

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
quality as I can and recording it like

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.690 
quality as I can and recording it like
96<00:04:17.829> kilohertz<00:04:18.519> and<00:04:19.180> I<00:04:20.250> think<00:04:21.250> I'm<00:04:21.340> recording

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
96 kilohertz and I think I'm recording

96 kilohertz and I think I'm recording
24-bit<00:04:22.390> not<00:04:22.570> 32<00:04:22.930> but<00:04:23.890> 32<00:04:24.250> is<00:04:24.580> just<00:04:24.790> overkill

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
24-bit not 32 but 32 is just overkill

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.370 
24-bit not 32 but 32 is just overkill
for<00:04:25.390> a<00:04:25.419> situation<00:04:25.600> like<00:04:25.960> this<00:04:26.260> I<00:04:28.080> am<00:04:29.080> editing

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
because he's not as maneuverable as some

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.680 
because he's not as maneuverable as some
of<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.169> other<00:05:07.350> characters<00:05:08.480> that's<00:05:09.480> why

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
manoeuvrable fast acting ones and that's

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.730 
manoeuvrable fast acting ones and that's
also<00:05:19.830> a<00:05:19.950> reason<00:05:20.280> why<00:05:20.370> I<00:05:20.400> typically<00:05:20.850> play<00:05:21.210> as

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
have been getting into playing a lot as

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.440 
have been getting into playing a lot as
as<00:05:27.600> a<00:05:28.070> sniper<00:05:29.070> because<00:05:29.310> I<00:05:29.490> do<00:05:29.550> enjoy<00:05:29.760> sniping

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
as a sniper because I do enjoy sniping
