fireball is always good I mean always
like<00:01:54.380> more<00:01:54.560> useful<00:01:54.890> than<00:01:54.920> sheep's<00:01:55.220> this<00:01:55.520> is

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
like more useful than sheep's this is

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
have to placate up and UIC play doesn't

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.570 
have to placate up and UIC play doesn't
want<00:02:03.440> to<00:02:08.590> we<00:02:09.590> need<00:02:09.710> time<00:02:09.890> anyways<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.430> play

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
want to we need time anyways to play

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:21.640 
want to we need time anyways to play
these

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:34.950 

all<00:02:22.220> right<00:02:22.310> come<00:02:22.459> on<00:02:22.519> get<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.730> small<00:02:22.970> chance<00:02:23.239> yes

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.930 

as<00:02:35.530> we<00:02:35.710> don't<00:02:35.830> have<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:39.370> don't<00:02:39.520> have<00:02:39.640> block

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
as we don't have you don't have block

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.150 
as we don't have you don't have block
ons<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.420> think<00:02:40.660> we<00:02:40.750> have<00:02:40.780> two<00:02:41.050> explosive<00:02:41.980> shoot

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
ons I think we have two explosive shoot

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.900 
ons I think we have two explosive shoot
this<00:02:42.340> turn<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:44.130> then<00:02:45.130> we'll<00:02:45.280> just<00:02:45.460> giant<00:02:45.760> the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
this turn and then we'll just giant the

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.559 
this turn and then we'll just giant the
following<00:02:46.240> turn

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.479 

I<00:02:50.629> could<00:02:51.290> play<00:02:51.439> the<00:02:51.590> sheep<00:02:51.799> and<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.069> a<00:02:52.099> really

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
I could play the sheep and this a really

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:53.709 
I could play the sheep and this a really
high<00:02:52.670> chance<00:02:52.909> he<00:02:53.030> hits<00:02:53.209> it<00:02:53.329> with<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.569> knife

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:53.719 
high chance he hits it with the knife

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:55.270 
high chance he hits it with the knife
jungle<00:02:53.989> at<00:02:54.049> five<00:02:54.230> six<00:02:54.620> seven<00:02:54.799> eight<00:02:54.980> this<00:02:55.219> is

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
jungle at five six seven eight this is

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.739 
jungle at five six seven eight this is
also<00:02:55.519> pretty<00:02:55.849> high<00:02:56.030> chance<00:02:56.269> he<00:02:56.359> kills<00:02:56.569> us

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:56.749 
also pretty high chance he kills us

00:02:56.749 --> 00:03:04.440 
also pretty high chance he kills us
first<00:02:56.989> I<00:02:59.980> could<00:03:00.980> do<00:03:01.069> sheep<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.489> ping<00:03:01.700> this

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.229 

these<00:03:05.450> are<00:03:05.540> all<00:03:05.599> very<00:03:05.810> risky<00:03:06.139> Donna<00:03:06.349> think<00:03:06.920> if

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
these are all very risky Donna think if

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.819 
these are all very risky Donna think if
we<00:03:08.239> just<00:03:08.269> play<00:03:08.599> it<00:03:08.629> safe<00:03:08.870> into<00:03:09.200> Papa<00:03:09.409> run<00:03:09.620> cheap

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
we just play it safe into Papa run cheap

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:15.190 
we just play it safe into Papa run cheap
we<00:03:09.950> should<00:03:09.980> be<00:03:10.189> okay<00:03:13.810> because<00:03:14.810> they'll<00:03:15.049> only

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
we should be okay because they'll only

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.509 
we should be okay because they'll only
have<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.500> power<00:03:15.709> on<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:15.920> board<00:03:16.129> plus<00:03:16.310> whatever

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
have to power on the board plus whatever

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.030 
have to power on the board plus whatever
he<00:03:16.700> plays<00:03:16.939> so<00:03:17.239> potentially<00:03:17.829> seven<00:03:18.829> with<00:03:19.010> a

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
he plays so potentially seven with a

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.909 
he plays so potentially seven with a
doomed<00:03:19.930> guard<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:21.260> then<00:03:21.379> we<00:03:21.439> bounce<00:03:21.650> up<00:03:21.829> to

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
doomed guard and then we bounce up to
