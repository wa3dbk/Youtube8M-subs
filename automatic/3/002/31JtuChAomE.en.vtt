00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.500 
my cousin was to help me doing a gallop
and<00:03:41.980> so<00:03:42.160> it's<00:03:42.430> just<00:03:42.520> I<00:03:42.760> just<00:03:42.820> delighted<00:03:43.360> that

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
and so it's just I just delighted that

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.150 
and so it's just I just delighted that
everything<00:03:43.960> came<00:03:44.110> through<00:03:44.350> and<00:03:44.830> she<00:03:45.010> went

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
everything came through and she went

00:03:45.160 --> 00:04:03.690 
everything came through and she went
down<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.280> winning<00:03:45.580> tonight

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.700 

brilliant
