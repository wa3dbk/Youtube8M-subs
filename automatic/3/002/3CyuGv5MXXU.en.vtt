00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.760 

this<00:02:56.180> is<00:02:56.300> actually<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:56.840> weird<00:02:57.080> cuz<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.350> is<00:02:57.380> cold

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
but I think it's just because it is

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.300 
but I think it's just because it is
metal<00:02:59.180> like<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.540> don't<00:02:59.600> I<00:03:00.050> don't<00:03:01.010> think<00:03:01.220> the

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
metal like I don't I don't think the

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.040

product<00:03:01.760> is<00:03:01.880> cool<00:03:02.120> anything<00:03:02.390> because<00:03:02.780> it's<00:03:02.930> a

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
product is cool anything because it's a

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.140 
product is cool anything because it's a
metal<00:03:03.410> applicator<00:03:03.740> it's<00:03:04.460> what<00:03:04.610> makes<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:04.940> so

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
metal applicator it's what makes you so

sure if my eyes look any less puffy or

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.940 
sure if my eyes look any less puffy or
it<00:03:27.220> does<00:03:27.460> have<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:28.060> more<00:03:28.780> sheer<00:03:29.080> coverage<00:03:29.710> but

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
it does have a more sheer coverage but

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.230 
it does have a more sheer coverage but
I'm<00:03:30.070> not<00:03:30.250> really<00:03:30.400> looking<00:03:30.490> for<00:03:30.970> anything<00:03:31.120> with

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
I'm not really looking for anything with

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.820 
I'm not really looking for anything with
too<00:03:31.570> cakey<00:03:31.840> coverage<00:03:32.290> because<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.710> is

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
too cakey coverage because it is

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.640 
too cakey coverage because it is
summertime<00:03:33.310> overall<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.390> do<00:03:34.450> really<00:03:35.110> like<00:03:35.410> this

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
summertime overall I do really like this

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.620 
summertime overall I do really like this
product<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:36.310> think<00:03:36.520> it's<00:03:36.640> very<00:03:36.760> hydrating<00:03:37.390> for

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
product I think it's very hydrating for

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.950 
product I think it's very hydrating for
my<00:03:37.720> skin<00:03:37.990> I<00:03:38.170> do<00:03:38.230> think<00:03:38.740> it<00:03:39.040> covers<00:03:39.520> up<00:03:39.880> my<00:03:40.090> dark

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
my skin I do think it covers up my dark

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.780 
my skin I do think it covers up my dark
circles<00:03:41.380> although<00:03:41.650> it<00:03:41.770> is<00:03:41.890> really<00:03:42.190> sheer<00:03:42.490> but

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
circles although it is really sheer but

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.000 
circles although it is really sheer but
I<00:03:42.820> am<00:03:43.030> okay<00:03:43.420> with<00:03:43.450> that<00:03:43.720> because<00:03:44.170> it<00:03:44.320> is<00:03:44.440> the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
I am okay with that because it is the

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.650 
I am okay with that because it is the
summer<00:03:45.250> time<00:03:45.520> and<00:03:45.550> I'm<00:03:45.910> not<00:03:46.060> looking<00:03:46.240> for

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
summer time and I'm not looking for

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.660 
summer time and I'm not looking for
having<00:03:46.990> cakey<00:03:47.260> makeup<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:48.040> blends<00:03:48.370> very<00:03:48.520> well

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
having cakey makeup it blends very well

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.520 
having cakey makeup it blends very well
although<00:03:49.060> it<00:03:49.270> does<00:03:49.480> start<00:03:49.750> out<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:49.960> little<00:03:50.110> bit

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
although it does start out a little bit

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.280 
although it does start out a little bit
liquidy<00:03:51.400> but<00:03:51.640> then<00:03:51.820> after<00:03:52.240> a<00:03:52.270> while<00:03:52.570> once<00:03:53.110> it's

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
liquidy but then after a while once it's

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.410 
liquidy but then after a while once it's
on<00:03:53.470> your<00:03:53.650> skin<00:03:53.890> or<00:03:54.340> when<00:03:54.730> you<00:03:54.850> go<00:03:54.970> to<00:03:55.000> blend<00:03:55.330> it

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
on your skin or when you go to blend it

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.610 
on your skin or when you go to blend it
out<00:03:55.480> with<00:03:55.540> your<00:03:55.780> fingers<00:03:56.080> that<00:03:56.230> does<00:03:56.410> get<00:03:56.590> a

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
out with your fingers that does get a

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.290 
out with your fingers that does get a
little<00:03:56.800> bit<00:03:56.920> creamier<00:03:57.340> so<00:03:57.580> it<00:03:57.670> does<00:03:57.940> blend

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
little bit creamier so it does blend

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.930 
little bit creamier so it does blend
easier<00:03:58.900> so<00:03:59.320> far<00:03:59.560> there<00:03:59.860> has<00:03:59.980> been<00:04:00.010> no<00:04:00.190> creasing

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
easier so far there has been no creasing

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.550 
easier so far there has been no creasing
under<00:04:01.150> my<00:04:01.270> eyes<00:04:01.420> at<00:04:01.600> all<00:04:01.720> there's<00:04:02.170> one<00:04:02.230> thing<00:04:02.440> I

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
under my eyes at all there's one thing I

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.530 
under my eyes at all there's one thing I
must<00:04:02.740> say<00:04:02.920> about<00:04:02.950> this<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.520> is<00:04:03.790> very<00:04:04.060> natural

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
must say about this it is very natural

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.420 
must say about this it is very natural
looking<00:04:05.260> so<00:04:05.530> you're<00:04:05.710> not<00:04:05.860> gonna<00:04:06.130> look<00:04:06.370> like

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
looking so you're not gonna look like

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.510 
looking so you're not gonna look like
the<00:04:07.330> photoshopped<00:04:07.900> Ellen<00:04:08.290> DeGeneres<00:04:08.950> and<00:04:09.220> I

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
the photoshopped Ellen DeGeneres and I

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.890 
the photoshopped Ellen DeGeneres and I
think<00:04:09.760> I<00:04:09.850> mentioned<00:04:10.180> this<00:04:10.300> earlier<00:04:10.450> that<00:04:10.660> the

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
think I mentioned this earlier that the

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.270 
think I mentioned this earlier that the
product<00:04:11.260> does<00:04:11.410> have<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:11.650> little<00:04:11.860> bit<00:04:12.100> of<00:04:12.190> a

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
product does have a little bit of a

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.340 
product does have a little bit of a
smell<00:04:12.610> to<00:04:12.940> it<00:04:13.120> and<00:04:13.300> I<00:04:13.660> think<00:04:13.720> that's<00:04:14.080> really

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
smell to it and I think that's really

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.530 
smell to it and I think that's really
awesome<00:04:14.620> actually<00:04:15.280> because<00:04:15.580> usually<00:04:16.330> like

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
awesome actually because usually like

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.140 
awesome actually because usually like
face<00:04:16.960> products<00:04:17.650> smell<00:04:17.950> kind<00:04:18.280> of<00:04:18.430> like<00:04:18.550> paint

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
face products smell kind of like paint

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.120 
face products smell kind of like paint
