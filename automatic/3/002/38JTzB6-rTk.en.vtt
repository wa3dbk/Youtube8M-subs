00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
flowering the dough if necessary that's

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.160 
flowering the dough if necessary that's
sticking<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.790> then<00:03:11.600> just<00:03:11.810> with<00:03:11.959> a<00:03:11.989> small

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.910 
paring knife I'm going to cut a circle
in<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.130> dough

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.340 

and<00:03:24.180> at<00:03:25.180> this<00:03:25.300> point<00:03:25.600> since<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:26.020> have<00:03:26.170> your

and at this point since you have your

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.620 
and at this point since you have your
paring<00:03:26.710> knife<00:03:26.890> in<00:03:27.070> hand<00:03:27.340> you<00:03:28.030> can<00:03:28.060> go<00:03:28.330> ahead

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
paring knife in hand you can go ahead

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.650 
paring knife in hand you can go ahead
and<00:03:28.810> cut<00:03:28.990> the<00:03:29.200> air<00:03:29.350> spouts<00:03:30.300> this<00:03:31.300> will<00:03:31.510> allow

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
and cut the air spouts this will allow

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.050 
and cut the air spouts this will allow
the<00:03:31.720> steam<00:03:32.050> to<00:03:32.110> escape<00:03:32.320> from<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.010> pie<00:03:36.060> and

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
the steam to escape from the pie and

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.650 
the steam to escape from the pie and
then<00:03:37.570> we're<00:03:37.720> gonna<00:03:37.810> roll<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.910> dough<00:03:40.120> back<00:03:40.390> on

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
then we're gonna roll the dough back on

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.170 
then we're gonna roll the dough back on
to<00:03:40.960> the<00:03:41.050> rolling<00:03:41.260> pin<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:44.880> transfer<00:03:45.880> it<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.030> a

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
to the rolling pin and transfer it to a

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.420

I'm gonna press it down just slightly
into<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.400> pan<00:04:56.790> because<00:04:57.300> it's<00:04:57.480> gonna<00:04:57.600> droop

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
into the pan because it's gonna droop

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.780 
into the pan because it's gonna droop
anyway<00:04:58.500> so<00:04:58.560> we<00:04:58.830> don't<00:04:59.010> want<00:04:59.190> it<00:04:59.280> to<00:04:59.460> crack
