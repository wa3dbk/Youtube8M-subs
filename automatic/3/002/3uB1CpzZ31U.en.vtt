00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
there is there are a number of reasons

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.039 
there is there are a number of reasons
but<00:02:35.920> most<00:02:36.610> of<00:02:36.790> all<00:02:36.940> because<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.540> can<00:02:37.690> wear

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
and the pockets are not going to flare

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.610 
and the pockets are not going to flare
out<00:02:43.360> so<00:02:43.690> you're<00:02:43.810> not<00:02:43.870> gonna<00:02:44.049> get<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.409> sometimes

people call them elephant ears and

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.080 
people call them elephant ears and
you've<00:02:47.920> seen<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.280> before<00:02:48.370> when<00:02:48.670> somebody's

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.400 
you've seen it before when somebody's
wearing<00:02:49.269> a<00:02:49.420> pair<00:02:49.629> of<00:02:49.660> trousers<00:02:49.870> that's<00:02:50.319> a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
wearing a pair of trousers that's a

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.380 
wearing a pair of trousers that's a
little<00:02:50.620> bit<00:02:50.709> too<00:02:50.890> tight<00:02:51.129> and<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.819> pockets<00:02:52.269> are

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
little bit too tight and the pockets are

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.030 
little bit too tight and the pockets are
just<00:02:52.599> they're<00:02:53.140> just<00:02:53.349> pointing<00:02:53.530> out<00:02:53.769> kinda

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
just they're just pointing out kinda

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.039 
just they're just pointing out kinda
like<00:02:54.129> ears<00:02:54.430> if<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:54.730> look<00:02:54.970> at<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.180> person<00:02:55.390> from

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
like ears if you look at the person from

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.759 
like ears if you look at the person from
behind<00:02:56.379> so<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.730> J<00:02:57.970> pocket<00:02:58.530> eliminates<00:02:59.530> that

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
behind so the J pocket eliminates that

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.210 
behind so the J pocket eliminates that
in<00:02:59.950> addition<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.849> J<00:03:01.060> pocket<00:03:01.599> is<00:03:02.049> I<00:03:02.500> think<00:03:02.890> a

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
in addition the J pocket is I think a

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.190 
in addition the J pocket is I think a
bit<00:03:03.370> more<00:03:03.400> secure<00:03:04.060> so<00:03:04.269> if<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:04.660> like<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:05.019> put

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
bit more secure so if you like to put

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.650 
bit more secure so if you like to put
money<00:03:05.560> in<00:03:05.829> your<00:03:06.010> front<00:03:06.340> pockets<00:03:06.790> or<00:03:07.030> change

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
so that's another advantage now why

so that's another advantage now why
wouldn't<00:03:27.459> we<00:03:27.669> do<00:03:27.880> this<00:03:28.060> all<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.269> time<00:03:28.389> again

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959

they're<00:03:29.349> a<00:03:29.380> little<00:03:29.650> bit<00:03:30.010> they're<00:03:30.549> less<00:03:30.790> common

and they're a little bit more expensive
to<00:03:33.639> manufacture<00:03:33.910> I<00:03:34.359> think<00:03:34.660> there<00:03:34.810> were

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
to manufacture I think there were

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.589 
to manufacture I think there were
something<00:03:35.650> within<00:03:36.549> the<00:03:36.760> manufacturing

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
something within the manufacturing

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.479 
something within the manufacturing
process<00:03:38.079> literally<00:03:38.620> they<00:03:38.889> actually<00:03:39.220> had<00:03:39.370> to

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
process literally they actually had to

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.400 
process literally they actually had to
turn<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.849> machines<00:03:40.239> a<00:03:40.480> different<00:03:40.930> way<00:03:41.109> and

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
turn the machines a different way and

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.920 
turn the machines a different way and
little<00:03:42.400> things<00:03:42.609> like<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:43.030> actually<00:03:43.239> cost<00:03:43.660> a

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
little things like that actually cost a

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.270 
little things like that actually cost a
bit<00:03:44.230> of<00:03:44.319> extra<00:03:44.500> money<00:03:44.620> especially<00:03:44.889> when

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
in that direction all the way because it

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.250 
in that direction all the way because it
is<00:03:59.980> also<00:04:00.220> a<00:04:00.400> bit<00:04:00.730> more<00:04:00.970> casual<00:04:01.629> because<00:04:02.079> it's

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
is also a bit more casual because it's

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.909 
is also a bit more casual because it's
associated<00:04:02.889> with<00:04:03.299> denim<00:04:04.299> and<00:04:04.450> with<00:04:04.840> jeans<00:04:05.260> it

associated with denim and with jeans it

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.509 
associated with denim and with jeans it
is<00:04:06.370> more<00:04:06.669> casual<00:04:07.000> but<00:04:07.239> for<00:04:07.780> this<00:04:07.959> gentleman

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
is more casual but for this gentleman

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.460 
is more casual but for this gentleman
tall<00:04:09.519> skinny<00:04:10.209> it's<00:04:10.780> going<00:04:10.989> to<00:04:11.049> be<00:04:11.169> a<00:04:11.199> great

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
tall skinny it's going to be a great

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.319 
tall skinny it's going to be a great
look<00:04:11.709> in<00:04:11.949> addition<00:04:12.370> he's<00:04:12.579> not<00:04:12.819> wearing<00:04:13.120> it

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
look in addition he's not wearing it

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:15.479 
look in addition he's not wearing it
with<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.510> jacket<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:14.139> the<00:04:14.919> point<00:04:15.190> about<00:04:15.310> it

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
with a jacket and the point about it

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.580 
with a jacket and the point about it
being<00:04:15.819> casual<00:04:16.299> is<00:04:16.449> kind<00:04:16.630> of<00:04:16.720> moot<00:04:16.959> because<00:04:17.139> if

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
being casual is kind of moot because if

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.140 
being casual is kind of moot because if
you<00:04:17.889> think<00:04:18.160> about<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:18.820> only<00:04:18.970> way

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
you think about it the only way

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.460 
you think about it the only way
someone's<00:04:19.510> going<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:19.660> be<00:04:19.780> able<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:20.019> see<00:04:20.260> these

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
someone's going to be able to see these

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.490 
someone's going to be able to see these
is<00:04:20.739> if<00:04:21.280> you<00:04:21.519> are<00:04:21.669> wearing<00:04:21.969> the<00:04:22.210> trousers

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
is if you are wearing the trousers

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.469 
is if you are wearing the trousers
without<00:04:23.500> a<00:04:23.530> jacket<00:04:23.950> and<00:04:24.250> in<00:04:24.340> that<00:04:24.490> case<00:04:24.700> you're

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
without a jacket and in that case you're

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.730 
without a jacket and in that case you're
going<00:04:25.719> for<00:04:25.900> a<00:04:25.930> casual<00:04:26.289> look

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
going for a casual look

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.100 
going for a casual look
