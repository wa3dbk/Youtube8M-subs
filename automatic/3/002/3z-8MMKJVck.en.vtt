00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
game is concerned pure stealth is when

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.429 
game is concerned pure stealth is when
no<00:00:20.340> alarm<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.880> raised<00:00:21.180> as<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.990> complete<00:00:22.320> your

objectives enemies can get suspicious

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.500 
objectives enemies can get suspicious
and<00:00:25.590> perhaps<00:00:26.099> even<00:00:26.460> see<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.939> for<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> split

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
and perhaps even see you for a split

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.570 
and perhaps even see you for a split
second<00:00:27.960> but<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.470> long<00:00:28.710> as<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.039> take<00:00:29.220> care<00:00:29.460> of

second but so long as you take care of
them<00:00:29.730> immediately<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.779> still<00:00:31.080> pure

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
them immediately it is still pure

them immediately it is still pure
stealth<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.949> also<00:00:32.910> like<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.450> take<00:00:33.630> out<00:00:33.809> all

close take downs but silenced weapons
are<00:00:38.700> also<00:00:38.910> an<00:00:39.120> option<00:00:39.480> if<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.050> need<00:00:40.230> arises

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.680 

this<00:00:43.739> door<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.219> quickest<00:00:44.730> way<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.090> but<00:00:45.570> it

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
this door is the quickest way in but it

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.630 
this door is the quickest way in but it
will<00:00:45.809> raise<00:00:46.050> suspicion<00:00:46.649> soon<00:00:46.890> which<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.340> fine

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
will raise suspicion soon which is fine

00:00:47.640 --> 00:01:10.320 
will raise suspicion soon which is fine
and<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.239> will<00:00:48.390> see<00:00:48.629> why<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.500> moment

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.750 

this<00:01:10.960> guard<00:01:11.260> got<00:01:11.500> suspicious<00:01:11.830> which<00:01:12.490> moved

this guard got suspicious which moved
him<00:01:13.030> from<00:01:13.270> his<00:01:13.420> post<00:01:13.690> which<00:01:14.290> makes<00:01:14.590> it<00:01:14.800> more

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
him from his post which makes it more

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.220 
him from his post which makes it more
convenient<00:01:15.550> for<00:01:15.760> us<00:01:15.940> to<00:01:16.030> take<00:01:16.390> him<00:01:16.570> down<00:01:17.790> oh<00:01:19.230> my

chopped his legs off sorry buddy it was
not<00:01:31.780> my<00:01:31.960> intention<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.710> be<00:01:32.830> so<00:01:33.070> cruel

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.050 

time<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.140> tag<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.590> many<00:01:55.860> guards<00:01:56.280> as<00:01:56.460> possible

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
time to tag as many guards as possible

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:35.890 
time to tag as many guards as possible
via<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.780> cameras

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.839 

this<00:02:36.900> camera<00:02:37.349> seems<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.829> have<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.040> very<00:02:38.340> limited

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
this camera seems to have a very limited

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:51.490 
this camera seems to have a very limited
view<00:02:39.060> we<00:02:40.019> find<00:02:40.349> out<00:02:40.560> why<00:02:40.769> later<00:02:41.069> on

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:35.610 

looks<00:02:52.500> like<00:02:52.739> someone<00:02:53.129> noticed<00:02:53.519> me<00:02:53.730> briefly

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:49.930 

ah

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:04:45.050 

Oh

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.820 

this<00:04:46.060> is<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:46.450> first<00:04:46.660> time<00:04:46.900> I<00:04:47.050> am<00:04:47.290> playing<00:04:47.590> this

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
this is the first time I am playing this

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.950 
this is the first time I am playing this
part<00:04:48.070> so<00:04:48.610> I<00:04:48.640> have<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.180> figure<00:04:49.330> out<00:04:49.600> what<00:04:49.840> the

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
part so I have to figure out what the

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.710 
part so I have to figure out what the
guards<00:04:50.320> patrol<00:04:50.740> patterns<00:04:51.160> are<00:04:51.370> if<00:04:52.270> we<00:04:52.570> could

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
guards patrol patterns are if we could

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.020 
guards patrol patterns are if we could
manually<00:04:53.110> save<00:04:53.500> then<00:04:54.070> I<00:04:54.100> would<00:04:54.340> gladly<00:04:54.610> push

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
manually save then I would gladly push

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.540 
manually save then I would gladly push
forward<00:04:55.420> and<00:04:55.570> take<00:04:55.780> more<00:04:56.050> risks<00:04:56.440> but<00:04:57.370> we

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
forward and take more risks but we

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.490 
forward and take more risks but we
cannot<00:04:57.910> so<00:04:58.450> I<00:04:58.480> have<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:58.990> be<00:04:59.110> extra<00:04:59.470> careful

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
cannot so I have to be extra careful

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.890 
cannot so I have to be extra careful
otherwise<00:05:00.100> it<00:05:00.850> will<00:05:00.970> mean<00:05:01.210> either<00:05:01.420> taking

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
otherwise it will mean either taking

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.870 
otherwise it will mean either taking
them<00:05:02.050> on<00:05:02.260> with<00:05:02.680> all<00:05:02.920> guns<00:05:03.160> blazing<00:05:03.790> or

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
them on with all guns blazing or

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:28.600 
them on with all guns blazing or
restarting<00:05:04.840> from<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.140> last<00:05:05.350> checkpoint

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.700 

now<00:05:29.610> we<00:05:29.669> know<00:05:30.030> why<00:05:30.240> there<00:05:30.840> was<00:05:31.050> a<00:05:31.080> camera<00:05:31.530> with

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
now we know why there was a camera with

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.800 
now we know why there was a camera with
a<00:05:31.740> very<00:05:32.069> limited<00:05:32.520> view<00:05:32.729> because<00:05:33.389> it<00:05:33.509> belonged

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
a very limited view because it belonged

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:43.189 
a very limited view because it belonged
to<00:05:33.930> this<00:05:34.169> laptop<00:05:41.689> suspicious<00:05:42.689> objects

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
to this laptop suspicious objects

00:05:43.199 --> 00:06:04.610 
to this laptop suspicious objects
sighted<00:05:43.969> going<00:05:44.969> to<00:05:45.120> investigate

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:15.290 

just<00:06:05.620> one<00:06:05.830> Frakker<00:06:06.160> left

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.230 

and<00:06:16.830> now<00:06:17.830> it's<00:06:18.130> just<00:06:18.400> a<00:06:18.580> matter<00:06:18.820> of<00:06:18.910> finding

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
and now it's just a matter of finding

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.180 
and now it's just a matter of finding
the<00:06:19.540> access<00:06:19.960> point<00:06:20.230> to<00:06:20.410> start<00:06:20.680> hacking<00:06:20.920> the

power<00:06:27.400> to<00:06:27.580> the<00:06:27.730> locked<00:06:28.030> areas<00:06:28.540> in<00:06:28.780> order<00:06:29.200> to

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
power to the locked areas in order to

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.920 
power to the locked areas in order to
unlock<00:06:29.560> them<00:06:29.980> you<00:06:30.880> do<00:06:31.060> this<00:06:31.210> by<00:06:31.420> turning<00:06:31.810> these

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
unlock them you do this by turning these

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.930 
unlock them you do this by turning these
switches<00:06:32.440> around<00:06:32.740> it's<00:06:33.700> pretty

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
switches around it's pretty

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.970 
switches around it's pretty
straightforward<00:06:34.330> but<00:06:35.200> sometimes<00:06:35.680> you<00:06:35.890> will

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
straightforward but sometimes you will

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.980 
straightforward but sometimes you will
have<00:06:36.130> limited<00:06:36.520> time<00:06:36.580> so<00:06:37.300> you<00:06:37.360> might<00:06:37.630> have<00:06:37.840> to

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
have limited time so you might have to

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:53.659 
have limited time so you might have to
think<00:06:38.020> fast

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:53.669 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:56.280 

you<00:06:54.669> can<00:06:54.850> either<00:06:55.090> go<00:06:55.300> on<00:06:55.449> and<00:06:55.630> finish<00:06:55.810> the<00:06:56.080> hack

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:56.290 
you can either go on and finish the hack

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.490 
you can either go on and finish the hack
or<00:06:56.650> you<00:06:56.979> can<00:06:57.220> open<00:06:57.550> some<00:06:57.789> files<00:06:58.350> there<00:06:59.350> were

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
or you can open some files there were

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.770 
or you can open some files there were
three<00:06:59.740> such<00:07:00.009> files<00:07:00.280> in<00:07:00.550> the<00:07:00.729> server<00:07:01.000> room<00:07:01.120> but

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780 
three such files in the server room but

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:23.420 
three such files in the server room but
we<00:07:01.930> will<00:07:02.080> only<00:07:02.259> be<00:07:02.410> looking<00:07:02.560> at<00:07:03.039> the<00:07:03.160> first<00:07:03.370> one

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:23.430 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.120 

this<00:07:24.430> looks<00:07:24.729> like<00:07:24.880> bloom<00:07:25.300> surveillance<00:07:26.130> are

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.130 
this looks like bloom surveillance are

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:44.510 
this looks like bloom surveillance are
they<00:07:27.250> actually<00:07:27.669> monitoring<00:07:28.150> private<00:07:28.690> homes

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:54.500 

that's<00:07:45.520> it<00:07:45.729> we're<00:07:46.120> done

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:54.510 

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.950 

and<00:07:55.260> now<00:07:56.250> we<00:07:56.730> will<00:07:56.880> have<00:07:57.060> the<00:07:57.240> locations<00:07:57.780> of

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:57.960 
and now we will have the locations of

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.040 
and now we will have the locations of
three<00:07:58.260> ctls<00:07:59.010> towers<00:07:59.690> hacking<00:08:00.690> them<00:08:00.870> will

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.050 
three ctls towers hacking them will

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.010 
three ctls towers hacking them will
unlock<00:08:01.350> points<00:08:01.740> of<00:08:01.860> interest<00:08:02.310> on<00:08:02.520> the<00:08:02.640> map

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:03.020 
unlock points of interest on the map

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.260 
unlock points of interest on the map
anyway<00:08:04.020> that's<00:08:04.500> all<00:08:04.770> we<00:08:04.980> have<00:08:05.160> time<00:08:05.430> for<00:08:05.490> this

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:06.270 
anyway that's all we have time for this

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.100 
anyway that's all we have time for this
is<00:08:06.480> blade<00:08:06.780> and<00:08:07.020> it's<00:08:07.440> goodbye<00:08:07.680> from<00:08:08.010> me
