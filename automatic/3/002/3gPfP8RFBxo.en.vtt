strategic<00:05:13.900> planning<00:05:14.169> on<00:05:14.350> sleeping<00:05:14.650> dozen<00:05:15.190> of

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
strategic planning on sleeping dozen of

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.180 
strategic planning on sleeping dozen of
way<00:05:15.520> more<00:05:15.760> yeah<00:05:16.419> absolutely<00:05:16.930> and<00:05:17.410> it's<00:05:18.100> uh

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
way more yeah absolutely and it's uh

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.400

yeah<00:05:18.940> it's<00:05:18.970> a<00:05:19.150> different<00:05:19.450> chains<00:05:19.690> and<00:05:19.960> sniping

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
yeah it's a different chains and sniping

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.610

it's<00:05:20.680> a<00:05:20.740> whole<00:05:20.890> different<00:05:21.040> strategy<00:05:21.930> and<00:05:22.930> yeah

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
it's a whole different strategy and yeah

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.320 
it's a whole different strategy and yeah
you're<00:05:23.860> right<00:05:24.040> you<00:05:24.280> do<00:05:24.460> that<00:05:24.640> communicate<00:05:25.300> a

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
you're right you do that communicate a

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.480 
you're right you do that communicate a
lot<00:05:25.720> more<00:05:26.080> when<00:05:26.770> you're<00:05:26.890> doing<00:05:27.160> that<00:05:27.280> because

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
lot more when you're doing that because

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.100 
lot more when you're doing that because
you're<00:05:27.790> pretty<00:05:28.180> much<00:05:28.300> next<00:05:28.660> to<00:05:28.780> each<00:05:28.930> other

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
you're pretty much next to each other

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.420 
you're pretty much next to each other
you're<00:05:29.860> a<00:05:30.250> team<00:05:30.850> that's<00:05:31.150> running<00:05:31.479> around<00:05:32.430> with

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
you're a team that's running around with

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.120 
you're a team that's running around with
strategy<00:05:34.000> and<00:05:34.419> you<00:05:35.080> know<00:05:35.169> and<00:05:35.440> you<00:05:35.500> gotta<00:05:35.830> bump

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
strategy and you know and you gotta bump

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.980
