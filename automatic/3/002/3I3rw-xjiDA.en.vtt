00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
the warehouse my name is Tyson and we're

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.060 
the warehouse my name is Tyson and we're
taking<00:00:08.570> a<00:00:08.630> quick<00:00:08.750> look<00:00:08.990> here<00:00:09.020> at<00:00:09.260> the<00:00:09.559> East<00:00:09.770> and

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
taking a quick look here at the East and

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.730 
taking a quick look here at the East and
s12<00:00:10.610> ice<00:00:10.910> hockey<00:00:11.299> skate<00:00:11.570> so<00:00:12.320> this<00:00:12.440> is<00:00:12.530> gonna<00:00:12.650> be

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
s12 ice hockey skate so this is gonna be

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.379 
s12 ice hockey skate so this is gonna be
the<00:00:12.830> most<00:00:12.980> affordable<00:00:13.280> skate<00:00:13.730> with<00:00:13.940> our<00:00:14.059> coil

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
the most affordable skate with our coil

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.209 
the most affordable skate with our coil
technology<00:00:14.860> that's<00:00:15.860> going<00:00:15.980> to<00:00:16.070> be<00:00:16.129> the

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:16.219 
technology that's going to be the

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.550 
technology that's going to be the
composite<00:00:16.880> kind<00:00:17.210> of<00:00:17.300> shell<00:00:17.539> design<00:00:17.930> for<00:00:18.320> the

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
composite kind of shell design for the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.710 
composite kind of shell design for the
bulk<00:00:18.920> of<00:00:19.100> the<00:00:19.190> skate<00:00:19.460> you'll<00:00:20.300> see<00:00:20.480> that<00:00:20.539> this

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
bulk of the skate you'll see that this

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.259 
bulk of the skate you'll see that this
is<00:00:20.869> the<00:00:21.019> same<00:00:21.230> technology<00:00:21.830> used<00:00:22.099> in<00:00:22.339> the<00:00:22.490> s17

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
is the same technology used in the s17

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.540 
is the same technology used in the s17
skates<00:00:23.710> one<00:00:24.710> thing<00:00:24.919> to<00:00:25.009> keep<00:00:25.130> in<00:00:25.250> mind<00:00:25.429> about

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
skates one thing to keep in mind about

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.279 
skates one thing to keep in mind about
this<00:00:25.820> is<00:00:26.060> even<00:00:26.390> though<00:00:26.480> it<00:00:26.570> is<00:00:26.720> using<00:00:27.019> the<00:00:27.080> same

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
this is even though it is using the same

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.710 
this is even though it is using the same
design<00:00:27.499> the<00:00:28.460> shell<00:00:28.699> is<00:00:28.789> slightly<00:00:29.179> different

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
design the shell is slightly different

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.689 
design the shell is slightly different
you<00:00:30.289> can't<00:00:30.470> really<00:00:30.619> tell<00:00:30.859> from<00:00:30.890> actually

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
you can't really tell from actually

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:32.740 
you can't really tell from actually
looking<00:00:32.060> at<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.180> skate<00:00:32.390> because<00:00:32.599> it's

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
looking at the skate because it's

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.780 
looking at the skate because it's
covered<00:00:32.990> up<00:00:33.079> with<00:00:33.200> these<00:00:33.290> leather<00:00:33.560> pieces<00:00:33.890> but

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
covered up with these leather pieces but

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.160 
covered up with these leather pieces but
this<00:00:34.970> shell<00:00:35.240> is<00:00:35.270> just<00:00:35.540> gonna<00:00:35.660> be<00:00:35.780> slightly

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
this shell is just gonna be slightly

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.220 
this shell is just gonna be slightly
smaller<00:00:36.410> than<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:37.340> actual<00:00:37.820> coil<00:00:38.750> or<00:00:38.989> shell

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
smaller than the actual coil or shell

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.170 
smaller than the actual coil or shell
design<00:00:39.530> that<00:00:39.649> they're<00:00:39.800> using<00:00:40.010> on<00:00:40.219> the<00:00:40.309> s17<00:00:40.910> and

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
design that they're using on the s17 and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.639 
design that they're using on the s17 and
it's<00:00:41.600> still<00:00:41.780> going<00:00:41.930> to<00:00:41.960> offer<00:00:42.109> you<00:00:42.320> some<00:00:42.620> of

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
it's still going to offer you some of

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.340 
it's still going to offer you some of
the<00:00:42.800> same<00:00:43.010> properties<00:00:43.309> and<00:00:43.760> same<00:00:43.969> performance

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
the same properties and same performance

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.779 
the same properties and same performance
but<00:00:45.350> it<00:00:45.469> is<00:00:45.590> a<00:00:45.620> slightly<00:00:46.129> different<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:46.699> it's

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
but it is a slightly different so it's

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:48.580 
but it is a slightly different so it's
just<00:00:46.850> good<00:00:47.030> to<00:00:47.090> keep<00:00:47.210> in<00:00:47.359> mind<00:00:47.539> so<00:00:48.289> basically

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
just good to keep in mind so basically

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.770 
just good to keep in mind so basically
the<00:00:48.800> whole<00:00:48.829> concept<00:00:49.460> behind<00:00:49.489> this<00:00:49.850> is<00:00:50.030> it's<00:00:50.719> a

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
the whole concept behind this is it's a

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.810 
the whole concept behind this is it's a
composite<00:00:51.079> material<00:00:51.350> it<00:00:51.829> does<00:00:52.160> have<00:00:52.340> cutouts

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
composite material it does have cutouts

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.670 
composite material it does have cutouts
right<00:00:53.090> here<00:00:53.449> and<00:00:53.660> here<00:00:53.960> so<00:00:54.079> it's<00:00:54.530> going<00:00:54.620> to

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
right here and here so it's going to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.990 
right here and here so it's going to
allow<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:54.949> to<00:00:55.129> as<00:00:55.370> you're<00:00:55.519> skating<00:00:55.879> the

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
allow you to as you're skating the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.490 
allow you to as you're skating the
food's<00:00:56.179> gonna<00:00:56.359> flex<00:00:56.780> for<00:00:57.050> it<00:00:57.140> but<00:00:57.260> it's<00:00:57.410> going

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
food's gonna flex for it but it's going

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.259 
food's gonna flex for it but it's going
to<00:00:57.590> snap<00:00:57.800> back<00:00:58.070> into<00:00:58.100> position<00:00:58.370> give<00:00:59.149> me<00:00:59.239> a

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
to snap back into position give me a

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.479 
to snap back into position give me a
great<00:00:59.629> return<00:00:59.899> on<00:00:59.960> energy<00:01:00.289> some<00:01:01.280> great

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
great return on energy some great

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:02.560 
great return on energy some great
performance<00:01:01.850> out<00:01:01.940> of<00:01:02.000> it's<00:01:02.179> also<00:01:02.300> gonna<00:01:02.449> be<00:01:02.510> a

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
performance out of it's also gonna be a

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.210 
performance out of it's also gonna be a
lightweight<00:01:02.780> because<00:01:03.140> of<00:01:03.410> that<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:03.739> then

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
lightweight because of that and then

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.800 
lightweight because of that and then
another<00:01:04.489> benefit<00:01:04.970> that's<00:01:05.120> coming<00:01:05.420> not<00:01:05.570> as

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
another benefit that's coming not as

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.020 
another benefit that's coming not as
well<00:01:06.170> known<00:01:06.320> this<00:01:06.650> is<00:01:06.860> also<00:01:07.580> going<00:01:07.790> to<00:01:07.850> offer

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
well known this is also going to offer

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.970 
well known this is also going to offer
you<00:01:08.150> a<00:01:08.210> little<00:01:08.300> more<00:01:08.570> protection<00:01:08.990> on<00:01:09.770> your

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
you a little more protection on your

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.680 
you a little more protection on your
feet<00:01:10.220> basically<00:01:11.120> because<00:01:11.300> you<00:01:11.390> have<00:01:11.570> that

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
feet basically because you have that

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.110 
feet basically because you have that
hardshell<00:01:12.320> exterior<00:01:12.560> on<00:01:13.070> it<00:01:13.250> if<00:01:13.790> you're<00:01:13.940> to

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
hardshell exterior on it if you're to

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.120 
hardshell exterior on it if you're to
take<00:01:14.270> a<00:01:14.330> shot<00:01:14.600> on<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:14.900> outside<00:01:15.410> or<00:01:15.800> the<00:01:16.040> inside

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
take a shot on the outside or the inside

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.100 
take a shot on the outside or the inside
of<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:16.670> skate<00:01:16.910> and<00:01:17.180> it's<00:01:17.510> not<00:01:17.660> gonna<00:01:17.780> do<00:01:17.930> as

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
of the skate and it's not gonna do as

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.050 
of the skate and it's not gonna do as
much<00:01:18.440> damage<00:01:18.470> as<00:01:19.070> well<00:01:19.460> as<00:01:19.580> you<00:01:19.670> have<00:01:19.850> that

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
much damage as well as you have that

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.630 
much damage as well as you have that
composite<00:01:20.600> toe<00:01:21.110> cap<00:01:21.350> as<00:01:21.590> well<00:01:22.100> as<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.400> rubber

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
composite toe cap as well as the rubber

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.280 
composite toe cap as well as the rubber
coating<00:01:23.060> on<00:01:23.150> top<00:01:23.330> of<00:01:23.480> this<00:01:23.540> as<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:23.900> need<00:01:24.110> some

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
coating on top of this as you need some

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.170 
coating on top of this as you need some
good<00:01:24.440> durability<00:01:24.800> out<00:01:25.040> of<00:01:25.190> that<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:25.940> talking

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
good durability out of that and talking

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.790 
good durability out of that and talking
to<00:01:26.390> Easton<00:01:26.720> a<00:01:26.780> little<00:01:26.990> bit<00:01:27.080> about<00:01:27.230> their

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
to Easton a little bit about their

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.700 
to Easton a little bit about their
skates<00:01:28.100> they're<00:01:28.850> actually<00:01:29.180> saying<00:01:29.600> that<00:01:30.020> they

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
skates they're actually saying that they

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.310 
skates they're actually saying that they
haven't<00:01:30.980> really<00:01:31.490> had<00:01:31.670> any<00:01:32.060> pros<00:01:32.660> in<00:01:32.870> the<00:01:32.960> NHL

traditional<00:01:55.250> fit<00:01:55.520> also<00:01:56.420> going<00:01:56.870> in<00:01:57.020> to<00:01:57.650> take<00:01:57.800> a

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
traditional fit also going in to take a

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.620 
traditional fit also going in to take a
look<00:01:58.070> at<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.220> liner<00:01:58.460> on<00:01:58.610> this<00:01:58.820> and<00:01:59.060> they

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
look at the liner on this and they

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.150 
look at the liner on this and they
already<00:01:59.840> use<00:02:00.050> them<00:02:00.230> what<00:02:00.410> they're<00:02:00.530> calling<00:02:00.800> a

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
already use them what they're calling a

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.610 
already use them what they're calling a
bio<00:02:01.400> dry<00:02:01.730> microfiber<00:02:02.180> liner<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:03.440> it's<00:02:03.530> gonna

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
bio dry microfiber liner so it's gonna

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.900 
bio dry microfiber liner so it's gonna
have<00:02:03.710> a<00:02:03.770> nice<00:02:03.980> feel<00:02:04.250> to<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:04.490> it's<00:02:04.670> gonna<00:02:04.760> be

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
have a nice feel to it it's gonna be

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.280 
have a nice feel to it it's gonna be
pretty<00:02:05.090> thin<00:02:05.330> so<00:02:05.360> it's<00:02:05.630> going<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:05.900> add<00:02:06.110> very

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
pretty thin so it's going to add very

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.840 
pretty thin so it's going to add very
much<00:02:06.380> weight<00:02:06.710> to<00:02:06.890> it<00:02:07.040> and<00:02:07.130> then<00:02:07.550> it's<00:02:07.700> also

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
much weight to it and then it's also

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.820 
much weight to it and then it's also
going<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.179> have<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.509> dry<00:02:08.690> flow<00:02:09.110> system<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:09.739> the

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
going to have the dry flow system so the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.199 
going to have the dry flow system so the
dry<00:02:10.039> flow<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.369> going<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:10.610> allow<00:02:10.789> some<00:02:10.819> of<00:02:11.120> that

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
dry flow is going to allow some of that

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.780 
dry flow is going to allow some of that
water<00:02:11.599> to<00:02:12.200> exit<00:02:12.650> through<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:12.829> skate<00:02:13.159> as

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
water to exit through the skate as

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.490 
water to exit through the skate as
you've<00:02:13.969> seen<00:02:14.120> on<00:02:14.239> the<00:02:14.329> other<00:02:14.480> ones<00:02:14.719> it's<00:02:15.170> this

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
you've seen on the other ones it's this

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.140 
you've seen on the other ones it's this
metal<00:02:15.980> portion<00:02:16.250> right<00:02:16.519> on<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.730> bottom<00:02:17.030> of<00:02:17.060> the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
metal portion right on the bottom of the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.770 
metal portion right on the bottom of the
skate

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
skate

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.140 
skate
so<00:02:17.990> not<00:02:18.140> moisture<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.620> exit<00:02:19.010> out<00:02:19.100> you<00:02:19.819> can<00:02:19.940> see

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
so not moisture to exit out you can see

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.059 
so not moisture to exit out you can see
here<00:02:20.390> because<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.870> shell<00:02:21.080> design<00:02:21.410> it's

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
here because of the shell design it's

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.920 
here because of the shell design it's
the<00:02:22.160> same<00:02:22.459> material<00:02:22.640> on<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.300> quarter<00:02:23.569> package

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
the same material on the quarter package

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.449 
the same material on the quarter package
that's<00:02:24.140> wrapping<00:02:24.560> over<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.950> be<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.130> Alice

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
that's wrapping over to be the Alice

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.559 
that's wrapping over to be the Alice
hole<00:02:25.610> so<00:02:25.760> that's<00:02:25.880> gonna<00:02:26.000> be<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.180> composite

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
hole so that's gonna be a composite

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.000 
hole so that's gonna be a composite
material<00:02:26.840> it's<00:02:27.590> gonna<00:02:27.709> be<00:02:27.770> extremely

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
material it's gonna be extremely

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.860 
material it's gonna be extremely
responsive<00:02:28.940> it's<00:02:29.120> not<00:02:29.270> going<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.450> add<00:02:29.600> much

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
responsive it's not going to add much

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.420 
responsive it's not going to add much
weight<00:02:29.900> because<00:02:30.319> it's<00:02:30.470> that<00:02:30.620> same<00:02:30.890> material

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
weight because it's that same material

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.220 
weight because it's that same material
so<00:02:31.790> you're<00:02:31.910> not<00:02:32.000> having<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.330> layer<00:02:32.540> on<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.050> and

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
so you're not having to layer on it and

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.510 
so you're not having to layer on it and
so<00:02:33.740> it's<00:02:33.860> gonna<00:02:33.950> offer<00:02:34.100> some<00:02:34.190> great

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
so it's gonna offer some great

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.760 
so it's gonna offer some great
performance<00:02:34.970> they're<00:02:35.209> going<00:02:36.110> on<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.650> the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
performance they're going on to the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.860 
performance they're going on to the
steel<00:02:37.040> or<00:02:37.250> using<00:02:37.550> on<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:37.850> it's<00:02:38.239> a<00:02:38.360> nice<00:02:38.540> high

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
steel or using on it it's a nice high

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.780 
steel or using on it it's a nice high
grade<00:02:39.140> steel<00:02:39.530> runner<00:02:39.860> as<00:02:40.069> well<00:02:40.580> as<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:40.760> see

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
grade steel runner as well as you see

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.580 
grade steel runner as well as you see
the<00:02:41.060> cutouts<00:02:41.450> kind<00:02:41.720> of<00:02:41.810> throughout<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.319> blade

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
the cutouts kind of throughout the blade

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.290 
the cutouts kind of throughout the blade
that's<00:02:43.010> going<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.280> reduce<00:02:43.400> some<00:02:43.819> weight<00:02:44.000> of<00:02:44.180> it

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
that's going to reduce some weight of it

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.490 
that's going to reduce some weight of it
and<00:02:44.480> keeping<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.930> skate<00:02:45.110> a<00:02:45.140> little<00:02:45.410> bit

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
and keeping the skate a little bit

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.229 
and keeping the skate a little bit
lighter<00:02:45.709> give<00:02:46.459> you<00:02:46.550> a<00:02:46.640> little<00:02:46.910> bit<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.090> a

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
lighter give you a little bit of a

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.810 
lighter give you a little bit of a
quicker<00:02:47.540> stride<00:02:48.190> also<00:02:49.190> going<00:02:49.370> on<00:02:49.489> from<00:02:49.640> there

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
quicker stride also going on from there

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.000 
quicker stride also going on from there
and<00:02:49.940> finally<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:50.870> take<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.500> look<00:02:51.800> at<00:02:51.920> the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
and finally to take a look at the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.400 
and finally to take a look at the
footbed<00:02:52.780> you'll<00:02:53.780> see<00:02:53.959> on<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.140> footbed

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
footbed you'll see on the footbed

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.930 
footbed you'll see on the footbed
slightly<00:02:55.040> different<00:02:55.310> design<00:02:55.430> some<00:02:55.790> other

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
slightly different design some other

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.280 
slightly different design some other
skates<00:02:56.209> they<00:02:56.330> put<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.510> little<00:02:56.660> more<00:02:56.900> into<00:02:57.050> this

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
skates they put a little more into this

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.110 
skates they put a little more into this
and<00:02:57.530> it's<00:02:57.920> still<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.130> fairly<00:02:58.400> thin<00:02:58.760> piece<00:02:58.970> of

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
and it's still a fairly thin piece of

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.400 
and it's still a fairly thin piece of
foam<00:02:59.300> so<00:02:59.330> you're<00:02:59.600> gonna<00:02:59.720> have<00:02:59.870> good<00:02:59.959> fuel<00:03:00.230> for

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
foam so you're gonna have good fuel for

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.710 
foam so you're gonna have good fuel for
the<00:03:00.470> skate<00:03:00.709> you<00:03:01.310> do<00:03:01.519> see<00:03:01.730> those<00:03:01.880> holes<00:03:02.209> kind<00:03:02.569> of

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
the skate you do see those holes kind of

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.210 
the skate you do see those holes kind of
throughout<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.230> that's<00:03:03.650> gonna<00:03:03.800> be<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.040> dry

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
throughout it that's gonna be the dry

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.190 
throughout it that's gonna be the dry
flow<00:03:04.430> system<00:03:04.819> lining<00:03:05.120> up<00:03:05.239> moisture<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.750> exit

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
flow system lining up moisture to exit

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.990 
flow system lining up moisture to exit
but<00:03:06.830> then<00:03:06.950> as<00:03:07.069> we<00:03:07.190> go<00:03:07.340> ahead<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.640> look<00:03:07.760> at<00:03:07.910> the

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
but then as we go ahead and look at the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.670 
but then as we go ahead and look at the
other<00:03:08.120> side<00:03:08.360> you<00:03:08.780> see<00:03:09.170> they<00:03:09.380> have<00:03:09.470> some

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
other side you see they have some

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.590 
other side you see they have some
different<00:03:10.040> materials<00:03:10.100> and<00:03:10.640> here<00:03:10.970> so<00:03:11.480> that's

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
different materials and here so that's

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.820 
different materials and here so that's
going<00:03:11.690> to<00:03:11.750> give<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:11.959> a<00:03:12.019> little<00:03:12.170> more<00:03:12.350> support

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
giving that responsiveness as well as

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.620
