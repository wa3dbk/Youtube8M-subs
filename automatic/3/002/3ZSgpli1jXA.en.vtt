00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.640 
with a black liner I'm creating a line
under<00:02:41.760> my<00:02:41.910> eye<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.480> I'm<00:02:42.660> also<00:02:42.930> lining<00:02:43.530> my

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
under my eye and I'm also lining my

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.860 
under my eye and I'm also lining my
waterline<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.430> adding<00:02:45.000> some<00:02:45.300> black<00:02:45.510> in

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
waterline and adding some black in

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.620 
waterline and adding some black in
between<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.380> two<00:02:49.940> now<00:02:50.940> I'm<00:02:51.090> just<00:02:51.240> creating

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
between the two now I'm just creating

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.570 
between the two now I'm just creating
some<00:02:51.810> random<00:02:52.170> red<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.620> black<00:02:52.770> lines<00:02:53.100> down<00:02:53.460> the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
some random red and black lines down the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.020 
some random red and black lines down the
side<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.850> my<00:02:54.120> cheek<00:02:55.010> with<00:02:56.010> my<00:02:56.190> NYX<00:02:56.430> pencil<00:02:56.640> and

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
side of my cheek with my NYX pencil and

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.120 
side of my cheek with my NYX pencil and
milk<00:02:57.360> I'm<00:02:57.480> applying<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.350> my<00:02:58.380> eyelids<00:02:58.920> and

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
milk I'm applying that to my eyelids and

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.160 
milk I'm applying that to my eyelids and
then<00:02:59.370> with<00:02:59.520> the<00:02:59.610> electric-blue<00:03:00.030> I'm<00:03:00.570> creating

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
then with the electric-blue I'm creating

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.080 
then with the electric-blue I'm creating
the<00:03:01.350> middle<00:03:01.710> of<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.920> eye<00:03:01.950> again<00:03:02.340> as<00:03:02.490> well<00:03:02.760> and

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
the middle of the eye again as well and

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.120 
the middle of the eye again as well and
then<00:03:03.300> lining<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.620> part<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:05.100> really

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
then lining it this part is really

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.100 
then lining it this part is really
tricky<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:06.180> just<00:03:06.390> kind<00:03:06.660> of<00:03:06.690> have<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:06.900> be

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
tricky you just kind of have to be

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.260 
tricky you just kind of have to be
patient<00:03:07.650> because<00:03:07.790> trying<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.880> do<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.120> with

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
patient because trying to do this with

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.830 
patient because trying to do this with
one<00:03:09.480> eye<00:03:09.510> open<00:03:09.600> is<00:03:10.140> very<00:03:10.620> difficult<00:03:11.100> now<00:03:11.840> I'm

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
one eye open is very difficult now I'm

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.290 
one eye open is very difficult now I'm
creating<00:03:13.380> a<00:03:13.530> sort<00:03:13.830> of<00:03:13.950> thin<00:03:14.370> like<00:03:14.640> shape<00:03:15.030> and

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
creating a sort of thin like shape and

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.000 
creating a sort of thin like shape and
filling<00:03:15.660> that<00:03:15.690> in<00:03:15.810> with<00:03:16.020> black<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:16.650> I'm<00:03:16.830> also

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
filling that in with black and I'm also

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.990 
filling that in with black and I'm also
adding<00:03:17.310> black<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.030> purple<00:03:18.180> around<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.900> eye

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.790 

next<00:03:24.000> I'll<00:03:24.120> be<00:03:24.150> drawing<00:03:24.480> on<00:03:24.720> two<00:03:25.080> lines<00:03:25.349> in<00:03:25.709> the
