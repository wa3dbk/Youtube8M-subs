but<00:03:33.859> it's<00:03:33.980> kind<00:03:34.190> of<00:03:34.220> like<00:03:34.370> an<00:03:34.519> exclamation

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
but it's kind of like an exclamation

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.479 
but it's kind of like an exclamation
here<00:03:35.450> you<00:03:35.569> have<00:03:35.750> that<00:03:36.049> element<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.130> on<00:03:37.340> the

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
here you have that element and on the

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.580 
here you have that element and on the
back<00:03:37.700> it<00:03:37.940> has<00:03:38.180> all<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.569> info<00:03:38.959> reflective

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
back it has all the info reflective

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.349 
back it has all the info reflective
basically<00:03:40.069> everything<00:03:40.579> that<00:03:40.790> I<00:03:40.970> just<00:03:41.000> said

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
basically everything that I just said

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:42.849 
basically everything that I just said
now<00:03:41.720> let's<00:03:41.870> just<00:03:41.989> want<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:42.260> take<00:03:42.350> a<00:03:42.380> side<00:03:42.650> note

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
now let's just want to take a side note

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.670 
now let's just want to take a side note
Evie<00:03:43.639> is<00:03:43.880> in<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.209> box<00:03:44.480> for<00:03:44.780> this<00:03:44.959> to<00:03:45.560> my

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
Evie is in the box for this to my

knowledge this is just a regular Jordan
element<00:03:47.750> box<00:03:47.930> but<00:03:48.200> look<00:03:48.410> at<00:03:48.590> that<00:03:48.889> holographic

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
element box but look at that holographic

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.309 
element box but look at that holographic
it's<00:03:50.980> it's<00:03:51.980> look<00:03:52.459> at<00:03:52.549> that<00:03:52.609> it's<00:03:52.840> so<00:03:53.840> crazy

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
it's it's look at that it's so crazy

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.370 
it's it's look at that it's so crazy
that<00:03:54.859> is<00:03:55.250> crazy<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:55.970> let<00:03:56.690> me<00:03:56.780> where<00:03:56.959> we<00:03:57.260> were

Aglets<00:05:07.240> metal<00:05:07.690> dag<00:05:08.050> let's<00:05:08.320> here<00:05:08.500> you<00:05:08.710> can<00:05:08.860> see

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
Aglets metal dag let's here you can see

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.129 
Aglets metal dag let's here you can see
they're<00:05:09.610> just<00:05:09.639> plastic<00:05:10.090> but<00:05:10.510> they<00:05:10.630> are<00:05:10.780> silver

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.139 
they're just plastic but they are silver

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.629 
they're just plastic but they are silver
if<00:05:11.530> they<00:05:12.010> were<00:05:12.190> metal

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
if they were metal

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.400 
if they were metal
it<00:05:12.940> would<00:05:13.120> have<00:05:13.210> shined<00:05:13.539> a<00:05:13.690> little<00:05:14.020> bit<00:05:14.169> more

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
it would have shined a little bit more

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.690 
it would have shined a little bit more
and<00:05:14.620> it<00:05:14.740> would<00:05:14.889> have<00:05:14.979> been<00:05:15.039> a<00:05:15.190> little<00:05:15.550> bit<00:05:15.669> more

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
and it would have been a little bit more

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.390
