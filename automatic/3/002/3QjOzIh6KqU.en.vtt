sibling the the the stepbrother to the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.880 
sibling the the the stepbrother to the
7-9<00:01:03.300> 70s<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.019> got<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.199> same<00:01:04.350> set<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.589> specs

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
7-9 70s it's got the same set of specs

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.760 
7-9 70s it's got the same set of specs
as<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.430> 71<00:01:05.820> 70<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.780> it's<00:01:06.900> meant<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.170> slightly

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
as the 71 70 but it's meant to slightly

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.380 
as the 71 70 but it's meant to slightly
kind<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.070> pushed<00:01:08.310> push<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.939> boundaries<00:01:09.299> a

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
kind of pushed push the boundaries a

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.030 
kind of pushed push the boundaries a
little<00:01:09.510> bit<00:01:09.689> more<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.110> much<00:01:10.799> more

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
little bit more it's much more

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.219 
little bit more it's much more
overclockable<00:01:11.610> than<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> art<00:01:12.090> 7<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.479> 70<00:01:12.869> and

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
overclockable than the art 7 on 70 and

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.800 
overclockable than the art 7 on 70 and
also<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.890> much<00:01:14.220> much<00:01:14.490> cheaper<00:01:14.689> especially<00:01:15.689> I'm

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
also is much much cheaper especially I'm

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.590 
also is much much cheaper especially I'm
going<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.049> comparing<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.680> HS<00:01:17.430> today<00:01:17.970> to

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
going to be comparing this HS today to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.960 
going to be comparing this HS today to
the<00:01:18.720> old<00:01:18.869> sapphire<00:01:19.619> at<00:01:19.740> 7970<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.759> vapour

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the old sapphire at 7970 the vapour

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.270 
the old sapphire at 7970 the vapour
gigahertz<00:01:21.750> Edition<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.890> I'm

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
gigahertz Edition that I have and I'm

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.910 
gigahertz Edition that I have and I'm
basically<00:01:23.630> this<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:24.810> right<00:01:24.960> here<00:01:25.170> sitting<00:01:25.799> at

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
basically this one right here sitting at

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.249 
basically this one right here sitting at
idle<00:01:26.220> temperature<00:01:26.640> idols<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.180> 32<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:28.080> my

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
idle temperature idols of 32 in my

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.310 
idle temperature idols of 32 in my
system<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.860> my<00:01:29.549> scope<00:01:29.880> my<00:01:30.030> current<00:01:30.869> sapphire

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
system and my scope my current sapphire

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.630 
system and my scope my current sapphire
770<00:01:32.100> idols<00:01:32.850> 38<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.640> significantly

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
770 idols 38 so it is significantly

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.539 
770 idols 38 so it is significantly
cooler<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.990> really<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.619> wonder<00:01:38.009> why<00:01:38.520> I

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
cooler it's really just wonder why I

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.330 
cooler it's really just wonder why I
bought<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.030> sapphire<00:01:39.390> 7970<00:01:40.290> over<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> hs7

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
bought the sapphire 7970 over the hs7

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.710 
bought the sapphire 7970 over the hs7
170<00:01:41.909> when<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.150> was<00:01:42.240> back<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.570> thing

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
170 when that was back of the thing

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.389 
170 when that was back of the thing
maybe<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.470> because<00:01:43.649> it's<00:01:43.890> cheaper<00:01:44.250> and

a bit of a cheapskate

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.999 
a bit of a cheapskate
but<00:01:45.659> um<00:01:45.960> there<00:01:46.560> we<00:01:46.680> go<00:01:46.860> at<00:01:47.399> full<00:01:47.850> load<00:01:48.180> using

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
Becky what my program does is it puts it

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.270 
Becky what my program does is it puts it

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.300 
for extreme stress and pressure and
basically<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.579> goes<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.320> 64<00:02:01.320> degrees<00:02:01.710> at<00:02:01.979> full

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
from sapphire goes to 75 so that's quite

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.460 
from sapphire goes to 75 so that's quite
a<00:02:08.879> big<00:02:09.239> big<00:02:09.479> difference<00:02:09.929> there<00:02:10.110> there<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.440> a

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
a big big difference there there is a

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.170 
a big big difference there there is a
nice

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
nice

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.140

-<00:02:11.269> no<00:02:11.930> I<00:02:11.959> mean<00:02:12.260> massive<00:02:12.859> difference<00:02:13.459> it<00:02:13.909> could

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
- no I mean massive difference it could

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.589 
- no I mean massive difference it could
just<00:02:14.420> be<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:15.010> difference<00:02:16.010> like<00:02:16.790> in<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.269> brand

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
just be the difference like in the brand

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.050 
just be the difference like in the brand
the<00:02:17.780> model<00:02:18.049> being<00:02:18.260> a<00:02:18.409> Chester<00:02:19.099> Sapphire<00:02:19.549> but

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
the model being a Chester Sapphire but

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.399 
the model being a Chester Sapphire but
honestly<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.510> think<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:20.930> could<00:02:21.109> just<00:02:21.200> be<00:02:21.379> the

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
honestly I think it could just be the

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.500 
honestly I think it could just be the
whole<00:02:21.739> kind<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.069> new<00:02:22.129> r9<00:02:22.819> series<00:02:23.150> compared<00:02:23.450> to

whole kind of new r9 series compared to

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.559 
whole kind of new r9 series compared to
the<00:02:23.599> 7-9<00:02:23.989> 70s<00:02:24.500> alright<00:02:25.129> so<00:02:25.280> there<00:02:25.430> we<00:02:25.459> go<00:02:25.670> on<00:02:26.359> to

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
the 7-9 70s alright so there we go on to

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.080 
the 7-9 70s alright so there we go on to

comparing that to hif7 970 the results
are<00:02:49.849> a<00:02:49.909> little<00:02:49.939> bit<00:02:50.180> closer<00:02:50.389> together<00:02:50.629> but

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
are a little bit closer together but

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.690 
are a little bit closer together but
there's<00:02:51.530> still<00:02:51.739> a<00:02:51.769> significant<00:02:52.310> increase<00:02:52.489> for

actually<00:03:36.709> two<00:03:36.859> months<00:03:36.979> before<00:03:37.220> these<00:03:37.489> even

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:37.729 
actually two months before these even

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:39.729 
actually two months before these even
got<00:03:37.849> announced<00:03:38.090> so<00:03:38.870> I<00:03:39.229> probably<00:03:39.409> should<00:03:39.650> have

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
got announced so I probably should have

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:40.749 
got announced so I probably should have
been<00:03:39.829> a<00:03:39.859> little<00:03:40.040> bit<00:03:40.189> more<00:03:40.220> hesitant<00:03:40.669> like

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:40.759 
been a little bit more hesitant like

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:42.460 
been a little bit more hesitant like
should<00:03:41.299> have<00:03:41.389> known<00:03:41.629> there<00:03:41.959> bring<00:03:42.229> out<00:03:42.379> a<00:03:42.409> new

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
should have known there bring out a new

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.809 
should have known there bring out a new
range<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:43.099> probably<00:03:43.400> could<00:03:43.519> have<00:03:43.579> got<00:03:43.699> one<00:03:43.790> of

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
range and probably could have got one of

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.879 
range and probably could have got one of
these<00:03:43.970> for<00:03:44.150> 50<00:03:44.449> to<00:03:44.479> 50<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:44.959> 100<00:03:45.439> quid<00:03:45.650> less

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
these for 50 to 50 to 100 quid less

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.920 
these for 50 to 50 to 100 quid less
