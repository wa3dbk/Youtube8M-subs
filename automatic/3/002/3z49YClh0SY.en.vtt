 [Sana Multon's portable performance] 

00:00:34.983 --> 00:00:37.575
 How does it look? its not bad, right? 

00:00:38.617 --> 00:00:41.250
 Does it look like I am sliding my iPad or iPhone?

 [Artist - Shanna Mutton] 

00:00:45.114 --> 00:00:50.100
 So this is... It is the part I need to coordinate before I set off, to make sure my time is well mastered. 

00:00:51.378 --> 00:00:53.792
 Under the lens: Is it obvious that your finger is not your whole body? Shanna: That's right. 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.674
 This is my bag with a wig. All of them are wigs, hey, and some bags. 

00:01:06.496 --> 00:01:15.209
 Ok, wig, reading light, I think this is what I need. I have a list of details. 

00:01:18.608 --> 00:01:20.484
 I am all ready. 

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:26.756
 I didn't perform so often before I came to New York. 

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:37.684
 I didn't have a studio at the time. I was too poor when I moved here, so I decided to try to do my scene with something I could prepare with computer animation. 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.528
 That was the first time I decided to shrink the pattern to do this portable performance. 

00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:58.837
 Usually I am running around the subway, or when I am really gorgeous, I will hire a car rental service. 

00:02:00.998 --> 00:02:08.579
 All my props, you know, are taken in my hands, and then all the scenes are prepared half an hour before the show begins.

 [Tonight is the opening ceremony] 

00:02:28.722 --> 00:02:35.088
 These performances, I don't know how big the projection will be relative to my body. 

00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:40.163
 You know that if I am more creamy than the projection, then there is no way to succeed in the performance. 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.253
 The worst case is that I arrived at the venue and found that I had no way to test DVDs and projections. 

00:02:52.435 --> 00:02:56.352
 I hate the feeling that I am not completely prepared. 

00:03:05.136 --> 00:03:16.855
 You know that at the opening, everyone can only concentrate on one level of time. If anything is longer than ten minutes, it will be too long. 

00:03:17.068 --> 00:03:21.933
 Especially my exhibition, I mean, my exhibition is not about that kind of challenge. 

00:03:23.044 --> 00:03:24.733
 How does makeup look? 

00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:25.854
 Under the lens: Almost already. 

00:03:25.977 --> 00:03:28.228
 Shanna: OK [Laughter] 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:39.576
 Sometimes people don't know that I am wearing costumes. They thought that I was a... eccentric woman, hiding behind. 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:42.002
 Are you starting?

 Eileen Lely Lopez: Yes. I want to start, but I don't know if you are still outside. 

00:03:46.774 --> 00:03:48.627
 Shanna: I will go in after you.

 ♪ 

00:04:17.154 --> 00:04:24.051
 Leading the whole show is really nerve-racking, but I like it as soon as I start performing. I really enjoyed this time.

 [applause] 

00:05:00.257 --> 00:05:08.118
 Yes, the response is good, right? Yes, I am very happy. 

00:05:08.223 --> 00:05:21.978
 I know that people usually respond positively to most performances, so I don't know if I can use it to measure how successful the show is, but... 

00:05:22.081 --> 00:05:24.605
 I think, I think it is not bad. 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:30.569
 You know, this is... This is a job. 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.863
 As long as I am prepared, the results will be good.
