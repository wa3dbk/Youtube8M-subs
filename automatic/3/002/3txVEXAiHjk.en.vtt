should be fairly easy to and the shield

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.450 
should be fairly easy to and the shield
pop<00:01:20.719> out<00:01:20.840> sometimes<00:01:21.229> you<00:01:21.320> have<00:01:21.500> to<00:01:21.649> give<00:01:22.429> a

to pry from multiple places and try and
hold<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.880> open<00:02:42.000> so<00:02:42.390> that's<00:02:42.570> a<00:02:42.660> tabs<00:02:43.410> don't<00:02:43.680> lock

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
hold it open so that's a tabs don't lock

00:02:43.920 --> 00:03:05.309 
hold it open so that's a tabs don't lock
