00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.779 
years how good the defense is going to
be<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.230> obviously<00:00:58.829> being<00:00:59.129> around<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.609> more

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789

really<00:01:00.590> helped<00:01:01.590> me<00:01:01.770> with<00:01:02.129> my<00:01:02.250> decisions<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.480> i

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
really helped me with my decisions but i

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.920 
really helped me with my decisions but i
tried<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.920> look<00:01:05.129> at<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.460> at<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.390> other<00:01:06.689> schools

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
tried to look at it at the other schools

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.240 
tried to look at it at the other schools
evenly<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> beginning<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> process

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
evenly in the beginning of the process

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.090 
evenly in the beginning of the process
and<00:01:08.700> really<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:10.049> was<00:01:10.200> there<00:01:10.560> was<00:01:10.650> nothing

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
and really there was there was nothing

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.660 
and really there was there was nothing
that<00:01:12.049> compared<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.110> Nebraska<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.159> think

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
that compared to Nebraska so I think

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.580 
that compared to Nebraska so I think
that<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.299> was<00:01:15.420> really<00:01:15.630> an<00:01:15.810> easy<00:01:15.930> decision<00:01:16.200> in

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
that it was really an easy decision in

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.370 
that it was really an easy decision in
the<00:01:16.710> end<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.280> would<00:01:18.240> probably<00:01:18.360> say<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:19.020> reason

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the end I would probably say the reason

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.289 
the end I would probably say the reason
I<00:01:19.530> think<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.009> rest<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.729> tradition<00:01:21.180> behind

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
I think the rest is the tradition behind

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.929 
I think the rest is the tradition behind
the<00:01:21.540> school<00:01:22.189> expectations<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.280> high<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.729> like

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
the school expectations is high I like

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.660 
the school expectations is high I like
to<00:01:24.060> say<00:01:24.150> all<00:01:24.360> expectation<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.290> myself<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.460> pit

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
to say all expectation to myself so pit

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.910 
to say all expectation to myself so pit
