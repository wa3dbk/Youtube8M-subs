go in a circle and I'm paddle or go

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.410 
go in a circle and I'm paddle or go
pretty<00:00:37.350> straight<00:00:38.000> people<00:00:39.000> are<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.210> how<00:00:39.360> do

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
you not go in a circle like all the fins

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.850 
you not go in a circle like all the fins
are<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> bottom<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.360> board<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:43.680> just

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
are on the bottom of board and it's just

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.380 
are on the bottom of board and it's just
kind<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.190> funny<00:00:44.430> when<00:00:44.789> people<00:00:44.850> think<00:00:45.300> they're

kind of funny when people think they're
go<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> circle<00:00:47.780> one<00:00:48.780> keeping<00:00:49.379> from<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.829> is

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
go in the circle one keeping from you is

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.069 
go in the circle one keeping from you is
opening<00:00:50.430> my<00:00:50.460> eyes<00:00:50.640> when<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.180> duck<00:00:51.390> dive<00:00:51.629> like<00:00:51.899> if

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
opening my eyes when I duck dive like if

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.619 
opening my eyes when I duck dive like if
I<00:00:52.199> duck<00:00:52.469> dive<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.010> wave<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.550> sometimes<00:00:54.360> you

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
I duck dive the wave like sometimes you

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.270 
I duck dive the wave like sometimes you
can<00:00:54.840> kind<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.199> maneuver<00:00:55.680> your<00:00:55.770> way<00:00:55.890> through

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
can kind of maneuver your way through

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.970 
can kind of maneuver your way through
like<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.789> clouds<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.690> like<00:00:58.410> there's<00:00:58.770> like

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
like the clouds and like there's like

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.889 
like the clouds and like there's like
little<00:00:59.219> pockets<00:00:59.550> you<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.210> get<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.600> or

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
little pockets you can get to or

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.680 
little pockets you can get to or
sometimes<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.920> do<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.250> thing<00:01:02.489> right<00:01:02.550> stand<00:01:03.539> up

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
sometimes I do this thing right stand up

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.600 
sometimes I do this thing right stand up
on<00:01:03.870> my<00:01:03.899> board<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.559> then<00:01:04.739> like<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.250> get<00:01:05.460> my

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
on my board and then like can get my

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.300 
on my board and then like can get my
board<00:01:05.850> really<00:01:06.119> deep<00:01:06.740> deeper<00:01:07.740> than<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.100> would

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
board really deep deeper than I would

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.640 
board really deep deeper than I would
when<00:01:08.549> I'm<00:01:08.700> duck<00:01:08.970> dive<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.659> then<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.530> like

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
when I'm duck dive and then I just like

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.469 
when I'm duck dive and then I just like
jump<00:01:10.890> down<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.369> grab<00:01:11.670> my<00:01:11.790> board<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.119> kind<00:01:12.420> of

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
jump down and grab my board and kind of

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.210 
jump down and grab my board and kind of
duck<00:01:12.630> dive<00:01:12.840> or<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.770> fail

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
duck dive or I just fail

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.540 
duck dive or I just fail
I<00:01:16.280> definitely<00:01:17.330> specialize<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.630> late<00:01:18.869> drops

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
I definitely specialize in late drops

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.420 
I definitely specialize in late drops
because<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.150> for<00:01:22.050> me<00:01:22.260> paddling<00:01:22.800> into<00:01:22.980> wave<00:01:23.250> I

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
because like for me paddling into wave I

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.240 
because like for me paddling into wave I
usually<00:01:23.850> don't<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.810> take<00:01:25.050> more<00:01:25.440> than<00:01:25.710> 3

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
usually don't like to take more than 3

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.490 
usually don't like to take more than 3
to<00:01:26.430> 4<00:01:26.640> strokes<00:01:27.090> like<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.870> want<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.110> go<00:01:28.200> bump

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
to 4 strokes like I just want to go bump

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.340 
to 4 strokes like I just want to go bump
bump<00:01:28.590> bump<00:01:29.130> into<00:01:29.910> the<00:01:30.000> wave<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.870> yeah<00:01:31.320> I

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
bump bump into the wave so yeah I

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
bump bump into the wave so yeah I
definitely<00:01:31.770> take<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> lot<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.820> like<00:01:32.940> drops<00:01:33.270> and

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
definitely take a lot of like drops and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.540 
definitely take a lot of like drops and
make<00:01:35.370> a<00:01:35.400> lot<00:01:35.670> about<00:01:35.940> so<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.360> not<00:01:36.510> too<00:01:36.690> bad<00:01:37.550> and

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
make a lot about so it's not too bad and

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.490 
make a lot about so it's not too bad and
I<00:01:38.790> always<00:01:38.940> do<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.390> thing<00:01:39.630> where<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.870> like<00:01:40.050> sit

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
I always do this thing where I like sit

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.100 
I always do this thing where I like sit
or<00:01:40.860> sometimes<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:41.670> sit<00:01:42.090> back<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.570> push<00:01:42.840> my

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
or sometimes I like sit back and push my

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.080 
or sometimes I like sit back and push my
tail<00:01:43.410> into<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.980> water<00:01:44.160> and<00:01:44.370> then<00:01:44.550> like<00:01:44.700> do<00:01:44.940> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
tail into the water and then like do the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:02:02.850 
tail into the water and then like do the
little<00:01:45.300> like<00:01:45.770> like<00:01:46.770> going

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.609 

first<00:02:03.860> standing<00:02:04.310> up<00:02:04.490> hi<00:02:05.180> I<00:02:05.810> guess<00:02:06.259> just<00:02:06.500> like

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
first standing up hi I guess just like

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.320 
first standing up hi I guess just like
some<00:02:06.890> momentum<00:02:07.369> of<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.610> way<00:02:07.729> but<00:02:08.000> I<00:02:08.030> mean<00:02:08.179> like

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
some momentum of the way but I mean like

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.389 
some momentum of the way but I mean like
sometimes<00:02:08.750> slow<00:02:09.140> or<00:02:09.289> small<00:02:09.830> way<00:02:10.039> I'm<00:02:10.160> sorry

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
sometimes slow or small way I'm sorry

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.800 
sometimes slow or small way I'm sorry
like<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.670> hardest<00:02:11.000> thing<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.209> get<00:02:11.420> up<00:02:11.599> in

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
like the hardest thing to get up in

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.390 
like the hardest thing to get up in
where's<00:02:12.110> like<00:02:12.380> when<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.769> wave<00:02:12.920> has<00:02:13.160> some

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
where's like when the wave has some

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.370 
where's like when the wave has some
