00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it's not anything because it's too small

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.370 
it's not anything because it's too small
it's<00:01:39.509> hanging<00:01:39.720> out<00:01:39.930> because<00:01:40.079> that's<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
it's hanging out because that's the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.600 
it's hanging out because that's the
style<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.220> bottom<00:01:42.320> so<00:01:43.430> this<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
style of the bottom so this is the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.240 
style of the bottom so this is the
bottom<00:01:45.200> that<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.229> liked<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.920> thick

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
bottom that I liked it's a thick

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.190 
bottom that I liked it's a thick
material<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.149> going<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.420> sag<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.079> have

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
material so it's not going to sag I have

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.020 
material so it's not going to sag I have
that<00:01:49.350> problem<00:01:49.560> with<00:01:49.950> bathing<00:01:50.640> suit<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.880> feel

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
that problem with bathing suit I feel

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.670 
that problem with bathing suit I feel
like<00:01:51.119> sometimes<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.570> go<00:01:51.689> up<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.990> size<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.530> then

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
like sometimes you go up a size and then

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.410 
like sometimes you go up a size and then
they're<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:53.009> cheap<00:01:53.430> quality<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.180> they<00:01:54.299> end

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
they're just cheap quality so they end

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.530 
they're just cheap quality so they end
up<00:01:54.479> sagging<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.530> bathing<00:01:55.770> suit<00:01:55.950> was<00:01:56.390> $89<00:01:57.390> so

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
up sagging this bathing suit was $89 so

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.969 
up sagging this bathing suit was $89 so
it<00:01:57.630> definitely<00:01:57.930> was<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> little<00:01:58.320> pricey<00:01:58.619> but

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
it definitely was a little pricey but

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.490 
it definitely was a little pricey but
it's<00:01:59.340> 89<00:01:59.820> for<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.090> top<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.869> bottom<00:02:01.049> it's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
it's 89 for the top and the bottom it's

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.929 
it's 89 for the top and the bottom it's
not<00:02:01.740> like<00:02:02.009> you're<00:02:02.219> paying<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.549> dime<00:02:02.729> for<00:02:02.850> the

that situation otherwise and this does
not<00:03:05.520> adjust<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.450> clasps<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.500> that's<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:08.010> size

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
not adjust a clasps and that's the size

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.870 
not adjust a clasps and that's the size
you<00:03:08.430> get

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
you get

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.910 
you get

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
when I posted it on Instagram was they

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.320 
when I posted it on Instagram was they
said<00:03:13.739> go<00:03:13.890> up<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.190> size<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:14.640> you're<00:03:14.790> in<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:14.910> cup<00:03:15.090> so

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
said go up a size so you're in a cup so

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.390 
said go up a size so you're in a cup so
you<00:03:15.360> know<00:03:15.510> your<00:03:15.660> cups<00:03:15.900> will<00:03:16.770> fit<00:03:17.010> in<00:03:17.160> there<00:03:17.340> and

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
you know your cups will fit in there and

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.479 
you know your cups will fit in there and
then<00:03:17.730> just<00:03:17.760> get<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.360> tailored<00:03:19.100> so<00:03:20.100> you<00:03:20.190> can

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
then just get it tailored so you can

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.460 
then just get it tailored so you can
even<00:03:20.700> just<00:03:20.850> I<00:03:21.060> guess<00:03:21.270> get<00:03:21.540> these<00:03:21.690> pieces<00:03:22.020> taken

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
even just I guess get these pieces taken

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.400 
even just I guess get these pieces taken
in<00:03:22.709> a<00:03:22.770> little<00:03:23.010> bit<00:03:23.130> if<00:03:23.280> it's<00:03:23.459> too<00:03:23.940> big

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
in a little bit if it's too big

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.840 
in a little bit if it's too big
circumference<00:03:25.410> wise<00:03:25.709> like<00:03:26.130> around<00:03:26.430> here

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
circumference wise like around here

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.060 
circumference wise like around here
which<00:03:27.420> i<00:03:27.540> think<00:03:27.570> was<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.870> great<00:03:28.050> idea<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.680> didn't

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
which i think was a great idea I didn't

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.110 
which i think was a great idea I didn't
do<00:03:29.160> that<00:03:29.190> because<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.700> thought<00:03:29.850> that<00:03:29.910> the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
do that because I thought that the

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.820 
do that because I thought that the
medium<00:03:30.390> was<00:03:30.510> going<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:30.690> fit<00:03:30.900> me<00:03:31.050> perfect<00:03:31.590> but

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
medium was going to fit me perfect but

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.280 
medium was going to fit me perfect but
that<00:03:31.860> was<00:03:32.190> not<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.640> case<00:03:32.790> now<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:33.750> was<00:03:34.020> really

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
that was not the case now I was really

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.900 
that was not the case now I was really
hesitant<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.950> order<00:03:35.190> online<00:03:35.370> because<00:03:35.760> I

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
hesitant to order online because I

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.340 
hesitant to order online because I
thought<00:03:36.090> I<00:03:36.150> was<00:03:36.330> gonna<00:03:36.450> have<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.660> ship<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:37.140> all

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.050 
thought I was gonna have to ship it all
the<00:03:37.470> way<00:03:37.560> back<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.980> Hong<00:03:38.220> Kong<00:03:38.550> I<00:03:38.790> had<00:03:39.030> a

bit you can kind of pick everything up

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.659 
bit you can kind of pick everything up
so<00:04:16.320> I<00:04:16.350> just<00:04:16.680> wish<00:04:16.830> that<00:04:17.039> the<00:04:17.220> back<00:04:17.430> was<00:04:17.640> a

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
so I just wish that the back was a

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.130 
so I just wish that the back was a
little<00:04:17.850> adjustable<00:04:18.180> so<00:04:18.390> then<00:04:18.539> you<00:04:18.660> could<00:04:18.900> feel

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
little adjustable so then you could feel

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.780 
little adjustable so then you could feel
comfortable<00:04:19.169> going<00:04:19.770> up<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:20.039> size<00:04:20.220> and

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
comfortable going up a size and

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.950 
comfortable going up a size and
worrying<00:04:21.060> about<00:04:21.090> having<00:04:21.480> to<00:04:21.570> get<00:04:21.660> something

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
worrying about having to get something

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.810 
worrying about having to get something
tailored<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.620> fit<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:23.040> because<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:23.700> are

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
tailored to fit you because you are

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.400 
tailored to fit you because you are
spending<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.210> lot<00:04:24.240> for<00:04:24.510> this<00:04:24.600> bathing<00:04:24.810> suit<00:04:25.200> so

spending a lot for this bathing suit so

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.230 
spending a lot for this bathing suit so
it's<00:04:25.530> not<00:04:25.680> really<00:04:25.920> something<00:04:26.070> that<00:04:26.430> you<00:04:26.670> kind

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
it's not really something that you kind

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.640 
it's not really something that you kind
of<00:04:27.330> want<00:04:27.480> to<00:04:27.540> have<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.750> get<00:04:27.870> tailored<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.590> I

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
stressed out about the shipping process

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.920 
stressed out about the shipping process
how<00:05:29.970> much<00:05:30.120> you<00:05:30.180> had<00:05:30.270> to<00:05:30.330> pay<00:05:30.510> for<00:05:30.540> to<00:05:30.780> get

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
how much you had to pay for to get

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.180 
how much you had to pay for to get
shipped<00:05:31.200> and<00:05:31.380> that<00:05:31.470> they<00:05:31.560> don't<00:05:31.800> cover<00:05:31.980> the

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
shipped and that they don't cover the

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.640 
shipped and that they don't cover the
cost<00:05:32.400> of<00:05:32.670> the<00:05:32.790> return<00:05:33.120> fee<00:05:33.390> so<00:05:34.200> it<00:05:34.290> is<00:05:34.380> really

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
cost of the return fee so it is really

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:35.780 
cost of the return fee so it is really
frustrating<00:05:34.830> that<00:05:35.130> the<00:05:35.310> Baine<00:05:35.460> suit<00:05:35.640> doesn't

a<00:05:54.690> body<00:05:54.960> of<00:05:55.110> boobs<00:05:55.560> then<00:05:55.890> this<00:05:56.460> is<00:05:56.610> the<00:05:56.670> base<00:05:56.820> if

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
a body of boobs then this is the base if

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.340 
a body of boobs then this is the base if
you're<00:05:57.120> really<00:05:57.360> taking<00:05:57.450> a<00:05:57.660> risk<00:05:57.840> on<00:05:58.140> because

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
you're really taking a risk on because

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.920 
you're really taking a risk on because
you<00:05:58.440> don't<00:05:58.800> know<00:05:58.920> how<00:05:59.040> it's<00:05:59.220> going<00:05:59.310> to<00:05:59.400> fit<00:05:59.580> you

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
you don't know how it's going to fit you

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.000 
you don't know how it's going to fit you
like<00:06:00.930> I<00:06:01.020> said<00:06:01.170> I<00:06:01.200> like<00:06:01.440> the<00:06:01.620> way<00:06:01.710> the<00:06:01.800> large

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
like I said I like the way the large

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.700 
like I said I like the way the large
fits<00:06:02.310> me<00:06:02.550> but<00:06:03.090> for<00:06:04.020> someone<00:06:04.200> else<00:06:04.410> that<00:06:04.500> also

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
fits me but for someone else that also

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.140 
fits me but for someone else that also
thinks<00:06:05.010> they<00:06:05.070> have<00:06:05.100> a<00:06:05.250> big<00:06:05.400> butt<00:06:05.580> it<00:06:05.760> might<00:06:05.970> be

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
thinks they have a big butt it might be

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.670 
thinks they have a big butt it might be
way<00:06:06.300> too<00:06:06.360> small<00:06:06.780> and<00:06:06.900> you<00:06:06.960> might<00:06:07.230> have<00:06:07.380> needed

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
way too small and you might have needed

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.560 
way too small and you might have needed
the<00:06:07.770> extra<00:06:08.040> large<00:06:08.400> so<00:06:08.730> this<00:06:09.180> is<00:06:09.330> definitely

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
the extra large so this is definitely

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.810 
the extra large so this is definitely
taking<00:06:09.780> a<00:06:10.110> big<00:06:10.380> risk<00:06:10.410> ordering<00:06:11.190> online<00:06:11.400> with

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820

taking a big risk ordering online with
this<00:06:11.940> company<00:06:12.330> while<00:06:13.020> I<00:06:13.050> love<00:06:13.290> the<00:06:13.320> bathing

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
this company while I love the bathing

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.620 
this company while I love the bathing
suit<00:06:14.010> is<00:06:14.220> just<00:06:14.250> really<00:06:14.730> really<00:06:14.940> frustrating

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
suit is just really really frustrating

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.120 
suit is just really really frustrating
and<00:06:15.960> I<00:06:16.410> wish<00:06:17.040> they<00:06:17.250> gave<00:06:17.840> measurements<00:06:18.840> like

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
and I wish they gave measurements like

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.320 
and I wish they gave measurements like
centimeters<00:06:20.130> or<00:06:20.400> something<00:06:20.700> like<00:06:20.790> that<00:06:21.090> for

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
centimeters or something like that for

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.660 
centimeters or something like that for
the<00:06:21.420> sizes<00:06:21.930> or<00:06:22.050> inches<00:06:22.470> so<00:06:23.100> you<00:06:23.130> knew<00:06:23.400> better

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.670 
the sizes or inches so you knew better

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.580 
the sizes or inches so you knew better
what<00:06:23.850> size<00:06:24.270> you<00:06:24.510> would<00:06:24.600> be<00:06:24.810> or<00:06:25.020> the<00:06:25.200> edits<00:06:25.470> or

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
what size you would be or the edits or

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.930 
what size you would be or the edits or
the<00:06:25.650> bottoms<00:06:26.070> they<00:06:26.190> don't<00:06:26.370> even<00:06:26.460> use<00:06:26.580> inches

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
the bottoms they don't even use inches

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.910 
the bottoms they don't even use inches
and<00:06:27.270> I<00:06:27.300> really<00:06:27.540> really

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:27.920 
and I really really

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.260 
and I really really
really<00:06:28.310> wish<00:06:28.490> they<00:06:28.670> did<00:06:28.880> because<00:06:29.060> I<00:06:29.120> think

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
really wish they did because I think

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.520 
really wish they did because I think
it's<00:06:29.360> the<00:06:29.450> best<00:06:29.630> way<00:06:29.870> that<00:06:29.900> you<00:06:30.110> can<00:06:30.350> figure

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
it's the best way that you can figure

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.870 
it's the best way that you can figure
out<00:06:30.650> what<00:06:30.890> size<00:06:31.100> you<00:06:31.310> are<00:06:31.340> going<00:06:31.490> to<00:06:31.610> be<00:06:31.700> I

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
out what size you are going to be I

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.250 
out what size you are going to be I
don't<00:06:32.030> know<00:06:32.090> if<00:06:32.180> they<00:06:32.270> want<00:06:32.540> you<00:06:32.750> to<00:06:32.870> order<00:06:33.080> the

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:33.260 
don't know if they want you to order the

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:34.750 
don't know if they want you to order the
wrong<00:06:33.440> size<00:06:33.740> I<00:06:34.130> don't<00:06:34.220> know<00:06:34.550> I<00:06:34.580> don't

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
wrong size I don't know I don't

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.310 
wrong size I don't know I don't
understand<00:06:35.330> why<00:06:35.480> they<00:06:35.600> would<00:06:35.750> just<00:06:35.930> say<00:06:36.110> like

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
understand why they would just say like

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.980 
understand why they would just say like
0<00:06:37.010> 2<00:06:37.130> 4<00:06:37.550> 6<00:06:37.820> 8<00:06:38.090> or<00:06:38.150> something<00:06:38.540> like<00:06:38.600> that

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
0 2 4 6 8 or something like that

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.660 
0 2 4 6 8 or something like that
it<00:06:39.140> makes<00:06:39.470> the<00:06:39.590> most<00:06:39.770> amount<00:06:39.920> of<00:06:40.040> sense<00:06:40.250> to<00:06:40.460> do

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.670 
it makes the most amount of sense to do

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.850 
it makes the most amount of sense to do
inches<00:06:41.450> or<00:06:41.630> centimeters<00:06:41.840> because<00:06:42.410> that's

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
inches or centimeters because that's

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.400 
inches or centimeters because that's
something<00:06:43.250> everyone<00:06:43.610> can<00:06:43.970> know<00:06:44.180> of<00:06:44.450> and<00:06:44.660> with

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.410 
something everyone can know of and with

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.140 
something everyone can know of and with
women's<00:06:45.770> sizes<00:06:45.950> it's<00:06:46.340> not<00:06:46.490> universal<00:06:47.060> you

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
women's sizes it's not universal you

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.330 
women's sizes it's not universal you
could<00:06:47.270> be<00:06:47.360> a<00:06:47.390> six<00:06:48.140> in<00:06:48.290> one<00:06:48.560> store<00:06:48.860> and<00:06:48.890> then<00:06:49.190> an

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.340 
could be a six in one store and then an

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.520 
could be a six in one store and then an
8<00:06:49.520> in<00:06:49.670> another<00:06:49.970> or<00:06:50.210> two<00:06:50.510> somewhere<00:06:50.840> else<00:06:50.960> so<00:06:51.320> I

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:51.530 
8 in another or two somewhere else so I

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.410 
8 in another or two somewhere else so I
don't<00:06:52.040> think<00:06:52.220> numbered<00:06:52.580> sizes<00:06:52.970> is<00:06:53.120> the<00:06:53.240> best

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:53.420 
don't think numbered sizes is the best

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.760 
don't think numbered sizes is the best
way<00:06:53.660> to<00:06:53.690> um<00:06:54.410> kind<00:06:55.420> of<00:06:56.420> size<00:06:57.320> your<00:06:57.560> clothing

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
way to um kind of size your clothing

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.370 
way to um kind of size your clothing
like<00:06:58.070> this<00:06:58.250> you<00:06:58.460> can't<00:06:58.760> think<00:06:59.120> Oh<00:06:59.300> a<00:06:59.720> small<00:07:00.200> is

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:00.380 
like this you can't think Oh a small is

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.770 
like this you can't think Oh a small is
equal<00:07:00.650> to<00:07:00.770> a<00:07:00.800> two<00:07:01.040> like<00:07:01.340> the<00:07:02.240> two<00:07:02.480> isn't<00:07:02.630> the

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:02.780 
equal to a two like the two isn't the

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.030 
equal to a two like the two isn't the
same<00:07:02.960> everywhere<00:07:03.290> and<00:07:03.620> yes<00:07:03.740> they<00:07:03.890> have

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:04.040 
same everywhere and yes they have

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.910 
same everywhere and yes they have
European<00:07:04.640> sizes<00:07:05.270> and<00:07:05.450> US<00:07:05.690> sizes<00:07:06.110> but<00:07:06.260> here<00:07:06.800> in

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:06.920 
European sizes and US sizes but here in

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.880 
European sizes and US sizes but here in
the<00:07:07.010> US<00:07:07.340> as<00:07:07.580> two<00:07:08.030> is<00:07:08.180> not<00:07:08.330> the<00:07:08.480> same<00:07:09.260> to

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:09.890 
the US as two is not the same to

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.290 
the US as two is not the same to
everyone<00:07:10.250> else<00:07:10.430> but<00:07:10.610> everyone<00:07:10.940> knows<00:07:11.060> what<00:07:11.270> a

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:11.300 
everyone else but everyone knows what a

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.540 
everyone else but everyone knows what a
centimeter<00:07:11.750> is<00:07:11.930> or<00:07:12.140> in<00:07:12.230> inches<00:07:12.590> so<00:07:12.860> that<00:07:13.070> would

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:13.550 
centimeter is or in inches so that would

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.950 
centimeter is or in inches so that would
be<00:07:13.610> the<00:07:13.730> best<00:07:13.910> value<00:07:14.210> for<00:07:14.270> their<00:07:14.540> measurements

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 
be the best value for their measurements

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.720 
be the best value for their measurements
and<00:07:15.080> maybe<00:07:15.950> it's<00:07:16.100> something<00:07:16.220> we'll<00:07:16.460> do<00:07:16.580> in<00:07:16.670> the

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:16.730 
and maybe it's something we'll do in the

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.610 
and maybe it's something we'll do in the
future<00:07:16.940> I<00:07:17.090> don't<00:07:17.480> know<00:07:17.570> I'm<00:07:17.930> just<00:07:18.140> really
