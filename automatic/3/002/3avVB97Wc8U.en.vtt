 In the last video, how to pull the right hand of Sabi of let it go is as easy as possible 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:20.570
 I told you 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:24.080
 This time I would like to introduce the left hand that fits that right hand 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.490
 It's very simple on the left 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.710

 Please try a challenge if you like 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:43.250
 Let's check the finger number of the left hand first 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.250
 The age of the finger on the left hand looks like this 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:50.610
 123 from the thumb 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:57.490
 It is one 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:01:00.000

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.659
 Let's put one finger on the keyboard after that 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.140

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.799

 Ends with the sound of a fan 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:15.450
