00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 increases optimism in the search for 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.890
 the black boxes of the Malaysian plane 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.849
 airlines that disappeared 35 days ago 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.340
 with 239 people on board according to the first 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.500
 minister of australia tony abbott all 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.020
 indicates that the pulsations detected 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.590
 by a vessel of your country belong to the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.890
 black boxes of that ship so 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.720
 alternate 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:36.660
 with fran albert and signs of the detecten 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:39.300
 There are 300 although 17 boats and 19 aircraft 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.270
 8 countries search for the remains of the plane in the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.640
 surface of the sea in an area of ​​18 thousand 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.460
 square miles west of australia 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.860
 the prospection with robots in the bed 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.739
 marine has been reduced to a space of 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.260
 500 square miles comparing this 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.690
 search with that of air flight 447 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.090
 france whose black boxes were 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.309
 found two years after his 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.290
 disappearance the task becomes easier 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.840
 now because the bottom of the Indian Ocean 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.780
 flatter and there is less danger that the 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.420
 accidents of relief confuse the 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.490
 detection equipment but if in that 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.180
 moment the depth was three thousand 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:23.260
 nine hundred meters now the fact is 600 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.170
 meters deeper to that depth the 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.020
 weight of the water on the robots is the 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.530
 equivalent to a person carrying 50 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.049
 Jumbo planes on their shoulders 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.240
 well better that is friend of captain and 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.850
 spokesman of the association of 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.070
 professional pilots to interpret 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.540
 this latest information we are a 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.580
 little as at the beginning you do not know 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.979
 exactly what happened but well there 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.330
 new information that we can deduce from 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.070
 health or information and good night 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.890
 Felix thank you very much for the vital not the 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.149
 today yes as not here yet 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.619
 we are optimistic there is a lot of optimism 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.899
 that you can find the black boxes 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.690
 they are trying to do everything 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.970
 possible so that these boxes are the 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.070
 Battery lasts 30 days when it is certified 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.899
 this is supposed to last 30 days but 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.650
 always a little bit more and they are trying 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.300
 of 30 days last the battery lasts 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.850
 news always says the black boxes 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.410
 how many are cosep are dominant if they are 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.420
 two faces are not black they call it black 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.940
 but in reality they are orange color a 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.590
 striking color and both contain two 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.209
 types of information one is in 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.340
 the yen area and compare in that 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.980
 found under the compartment 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.870
 flight that box is called the copihue by 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.080
 that records the conversation that is in the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.730
 cabin and with the transient control what 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.079
 who bought that is correct then the 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.380
 another box is in the tail of the 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.420
 airplane 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.100
 is the box that records all of the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.980
 More than 1000 parameters with the plane 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.350
 it could even height all the data of 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.260
 navigation all record one for two 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.640
 hours the other lasts 25 hours and house today 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.100
 in more sophisticated days that last a 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.200
 little more for experts on the subject and 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.570
 there's been a lot of talk about this they say 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.280
 it was very strange that the boxes sometimes 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.880
 they had literally disappeared you think 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.220
 what happened 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.020
 look here a little bit of european to 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.250
 Malaysian government at the beginning because 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.650
 they did not want any of the 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.260
 nations cooperate in the search and 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.880
 rescue then them in interests 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.550
 personal because it is an airline of 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.900
 my rights and of the clear government that yes 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.120
 they seem to want to keep it 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.800
 among themselves they had three weeks 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.830
 I would say that they lost three weeks 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.200
 you have to learn from this role and today it came out 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.930
 a comment an article about that 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.910
 when they got tired they saw that the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.130
 search for fruitless bing and other 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.520
 Nations began to give him intelligence 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.950
 as the USA have spy satellites and 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.430
 other nations 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.950
 they entered another investigation after another 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.959
 phase and it could be deduced that the plane did 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.640
 a turn and I do not know the area where I 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.580
 they were looking was not the right area 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.860
 and finally they were able to conclude 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.230
 because of all they could get 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.269
 that the plane fell 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.970
 some one thousand five hundred thousand five hundred 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.800
 kilometers two thousand kilometers east of 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.349
 the aqualia coast is growing 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.690
 we can interpret that the government of 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.670
 malaysia knew that there was that turn and not 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.750
 it was transparent enough it was not 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.519
 gave all the information today it came out that he 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.169
 the Malaysian air force saw in 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.450
 military radar that the plane made a 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.310
 turn but they did not follow the plane 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.810
 I simply reduced that made a 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.700
 turn means that it goes back to 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.310
 airport and from there nothing was learned 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.590
 If that happens in the USA obviously 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.090
 it would have been different because when a 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.669
 plane makes a turn in a way like 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.200
 it is prey I ask for force is activated 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.669
 aerial and there's a what I call January 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.780
 intercept that the fire comes out 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.910
 intersect the plane to see what is 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.100
 happening but let's from now on 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.380
 ahead we can hope find 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.190
 in those two black boxes that are not 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.380
 figures like no 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.930
 and that we do training can be drawn to 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.450
 yesterday there was another signal but the signal 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.100
 turned out to be false and these boxes no longer 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.850
 he has almost energy left and they are trying 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.380
 to use the whole possible zonal system 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.400
 It would be good if they could try two 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.590
 more signs to make a good 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.810
 triangulation the positive thing about this is that 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.030
 the area was reduced we were talking about 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.380
 57 thousand square kilometers now 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.590
 we are talking 1,300 kilometers 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.420
 square the next phase is to stretch the 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.980
 internal group as is the vehicle 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.930
 autonomous the problem of this vehicle 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.940
 autonomous moves to three knots of 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.810
 speed for an area of 1300 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.050
 square kilometers 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.760
 then lower the vehicle and make a 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.160
 travel in the water and before lowering the 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.100
 vehicle have to be make a 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.410
 photograph of the seabed in case there is 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.630
 some kind of rock or something like that 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.390
 program the marine vehicle thing that 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.190
 do not go accidentally experience 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.680
 we have to go fast 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.510
 we will quickly know what happened 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.160
 you can find the black box 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.140
 you can locate maybe where the 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.030
 apparatus but we will know what happened good 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.530
 I'm an optimist I think if the flight 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.820
 of air france took two years in control 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.620
 it was known what happened 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.180
 this flight because at least you know 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.310
 where in what area are the boxes would be 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.200
 everything is tomorrow a blow of 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.060
 loose and I would say the area that you have to 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.040
 be versed in speed more 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.740
 or less it would take like some four to 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:10.290
 six weeks 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.290
 thank you very much the program
