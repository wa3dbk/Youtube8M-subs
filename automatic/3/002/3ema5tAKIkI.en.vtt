00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
defeat is it a fee overall I'm a little

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.069 
defeat is it a fee overall I'm a little
bit<00:05:44.069> disappointed<00:05:44.299> and<00:05:45.299> having<00:05:45.839> said<00:05:46.049> that

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:46.079 
bit disappointed and having said that

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:47.869 
bit disappointed and having said that
that's<00:05:46.349> how<00:05:46.499> we<00:05:46.559> show<00:05:46.739> a<00:05:46.769> great<00:05:47.009> character<00:05:47.429> and

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 
that's how we show a great character and

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.119 
that's how we show a great character and
particularly<00:05:48.599> memory<00:05:49.139> loss<00:05:49.289> is<00:05:49.319> everywhere

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:50.129 
particularly memory loss is everywhere

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.119 
particularly memory loss is everywhere
silly<00:05:50.459> go<00:05:50.959> having<00:05:51.959> gone<00:05:52.169> that<00:05:52.379> goal<00:05:52.589> down<00:05:52.829> you

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:53.129 
silly go having gone that goal down you

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:54.139 
silly go having gone that goal down you
could<00:05:53.279> have<00:05:53.399> turned<00:05:53.489> around<00:05:53.639> and<00:05:53.909> sneaked

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:54.149 
could have turned around and sneaked

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:55.639 
could have turned around and sneaked
this<00:05:54.299> game<00:05:54.479> probably<00:05:54.779> deserve<00:05:55.259> to<00:05:55.379> get<00:05:55.499> more

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:55.649 
this game probably deserve to get more

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:57.499 
this game probably deserve to get more
out<00:05:55.769> of<00:05:55.799> it<00:05:55.949> well<00:05:56.459> I<00:05:56.489> think<00:05:56.579> certainly<00:05:56.969> I<00:05:57.179> have

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:57.509 
out of it well I think certainly I have

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:58.879 
out of it well I think certainly I have
timing<00:05:57.929> to<00:05:58.019> be<00:05:58.049> certainly<00:05:58.439> didn't<00:05:58.619> deserve<00:05:58.860> to

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
timing to be certainly didn't deserve to

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.549 
timing to be certainly didn't deserve to
be<00:05:59.009> one<00:05:59.219> down<00:05:59.779> Tommy<00:06:00.779> Fitzgerald<00:06:00.959> had<00:06:01.319> a<00:06:01.349> great

00:06:01.549 --> 00:06:01.559 
be one down Tommy Fitzgerald had a great

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:02.629 
be one down Tommy Fitzgerald had a great
chance<00:06:01.799> and<00:06:02.039> how<00:06:02.129> many<00:06:02.249> cousins<00:06:02.459> to<00:06:02.610> the

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 
chance and how many cousins to the

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.689 
chance and how many cousins to the
crossfire<00:06:03.149> and<00:06:03.649> I<00:06:04.649> haven't<00:06:05.369> said<00:06:05.489> that<00:06:05.610> as

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 
crossfire and I haven't said that as

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.039 
crossfire and I haven't said that as
well<00:06:05.849> the<00:06:05.999> lads<00:06:06.179> come<00:06:06.389> in<00:06:06.449> and<00:06:06.569> look<00:06:06.659> down<00:06:06.839> in

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:07.049 
well the lads come in and look down in

00:06:07.049 --> 00:06:08.149 
well the lads come in and look down in
the<00:06:07.110> second<00:06:07.409> half<00:06:07.529> but<00:06:07.619> the<00:06:07.709> longer<00:06:07.949> the<00:06:08.039> game

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:08.159 
the second half but the longer the game

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.069 
the second half but the longer the game
went<00:06:08.399> on<00:06:08.579> the<00:06:09.149> more<00:06:09.299> difficult<00:06:09.539> to<00:06:09.809> became

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:10.079 
went on the more difficult to became

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:12.859 
went on the more difficult to became
because<00:06:10.349> of<00:06:10.529> the<00:06:10.589> level<00:06:10.829> of<00:06:10.889> fitness<00:06:11.869> passes

00:06:12.859 --> 00:06:12.869 
because of the level of fitness passes

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:14.209 
because of the level of fitness passes
Eamon<00:06:13.199> said<00:06:13.409> it<00:06:13.559> did<00:06:13.709> show<00:06:13.889> a<00:06:13.919> lot<00:06:14.009> of

expected for 20-25 minutes to hold an

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:26.539 
expected for 20-25 minutes to hold an
out<00:06:25.199> when<00:06:25.589> you<00:06:25.649> give<00:06:25.799> a<00:06:25.829> soft<00:06:26.069> call<00:06:26.279> like<00:06:26.399> that

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:26.549 
out when you give a soft call like that

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:30.089 
they get more Compton and they sort of

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.549 
they get more Compton and they sort of
sense<00:06:30.269> that<00:06:30.479> they<00:06:30.569> have<00:06:30.689> a<00:06:30.719> good<00:06:31.110> chance<00:06:31.169> again

00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:31.559

know with how we could have had him on
the<00:06:44.040> right<00:06:44.160> then<00:06:44.340> well<00:06:44.460> that's<00:06:44.580> how<00:06:44.699> it<00:06:44.820> goes<00:06:45.000> I

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
the right then well that's how it goes I

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.790 
the right then well that's how it goes I
mean<00:06:45.300> we<00:06:45.510> create<00:06:45.780> chances<00:06:46.080> didn't<00:06:46.470> finish<00:06:46.680> and

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
mean we create chances didn't finish and

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.159 
mean we create chances didn't finish and
they<00:06:47.160> got<00:06:47.370> one<00:06:47.490> chance<00:06:47.760> to<00:06:47.880> finish<00:06:48.060> him<00:06:48.300> that's

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:49.169 
they got one chance to finish him that's

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:50.659 
they got one chance to finish him that's
where<00:06:49.380> it<00:06:49.440> goes<00:06:49.560> must<00:06:50.280> have<00:06:50.370> got<00:06:50.460> a<00:06:50.490> bit

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669 
where it goes must have got a bit

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.100 
where it goes must have got a bit
frustrating<00:06:51.180> in<00:06:51.270> the<00:06:51.330> second<00:06:51.690> half<00:06:51.840> when<00:06:52.080> you

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
frustrating in the second half when you

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.810 
frustrating in the second half when you
knew<00:06:52.380> I<00:06:52.410> suppose<00:06:52.770> on<00:06:53.070> play<00:06:53.370> you<00:06:53.430> had<00:06:53.729> the

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:53.820 
knew I suppose on play you had the

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.890 
knew I suppose on play you had the
measure<00:06:54.030> of<00:06:54.120> them<00:06:54.330> and<00:06:54.449> just<00:06:54.510> couldn't<00:06:54.720> put

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:54.900 
measure of them and just couldn't put

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.640 
measure of them and just couldn't put
that<00:06:54.930> all<00:06:55.199> away

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 
that all away

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.950 
that all away
yeah<00:06:56.370> it<00:06:56.460> gets<00:06:56.639> it<00:06:56.850> gets<00:06:56.940> restraint<00:06:57.510> not<00:06:57.690> when

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
yeah it gets it gets restraint not when

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.629 
yeah it gets it gets restraint not when
you've<00:06:58.050> got<00:06:58.199> the<00:06:58.290> ball<00:06:58.410> and<00:06:58.650> you<00:06:58.710> know<00:06:58.740> it's

00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639
