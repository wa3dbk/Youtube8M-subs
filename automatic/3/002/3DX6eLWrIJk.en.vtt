00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.779
 there are very good and you here about 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.790
 commenting I bring a gameplay of 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.439
 carlotti advanced warfare we continue 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.930
 with the series of models and good in this 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.190
 case as I mentioned because I had several 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.170
 interesting models of rarities 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.550
 different to elite and good me well 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.840
 your comments you told me that we 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.730
 it mattered that as long as the weapon was 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.530
 good and it was interesting that he brought 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.350
 such and here you have a team duel 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.330
 playing with genuine genuine 5 head 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.130
 as you want to call her and the truth is that 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.750
 it's a submachine gun that I think of the 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.369
 best of the game I obviously go 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.340
 better the mpc goliat that brings you the other 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.929
 the last review but good 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.129
 it seems a pretty decent submachine gun the 

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.539
 truth let's talk about abyss in 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.449
 when how does this rifle and such 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:41.010
 but good to tell you that yesterday you had 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.609
 new two videos the last of the videos 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.170
 If I'm not mistaken, it was the end of 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.999
 diamond because I'm taking out besides 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.800
 diamond increases the rifles and such 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:51.479
 report of royalty because I was 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.699
 he has played one and he adds me like I have 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.019
 one more of those that I have but good little 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.460
 little by little I'm taking it out so I do not have 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.010
 to teach the vall also that you have 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.260
 many of the diamond vall I'm already 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.589
 taking out the rx I want to start the goal goal 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.409
 well, better, the air mouse 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.520
 and well, as we are with a lot of 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.409
 exams and with several works of 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.210
 university because these days maybe the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.740
 channel activity I have maintained it but 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.020
 maybe the content you have noticed us 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.420
 but I have not done it so to speak with 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.100
 the same ease with it with the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.140
 same time frame that I've had 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.549
 other days not then now that I have 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.860
 a little more free to see if I can from 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.149
 new recover because for example the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.880
 would agree would be a yes that is 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.319
 recorded and well well then so I 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.069
 I can put to record and the diamond that 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:37.560
 does not have time to record recording in 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.670
 live in 2.0 so good fit us page 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.369
 because he had several breaks in the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.479
 series and it has simply been for 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.560
 that we have a little time for 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.360
 play and to record this week 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.549
 I've practically only played to record 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.989
 the right videos to upload them the day and 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.700
 until I can not be good now that I can 

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:53.429
 play a little closer to my roll as 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.989
 much better then good that we 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.420
 we deviate let's go with the submachine 

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:59.039
 This is good because that statistics 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.599
 first of all as we are seeing already 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.489
 the right one from royalty 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:03.989
 professional as I told you I said to the 

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.979
 they were interested in weapons that did not 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:06.569
 were an elite as this is 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.770
 several professional you will have 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.140
 surely to see if in some photo 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.610
 because the digital 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.470
 and good externally touched me relatively 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.030
 recently this week while recording 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.069
 the videos of the week and all that 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.690
 I was playing this weapon and not the 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.850
 is testing and the truth that works 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.220
 pretty good eye fixes quabit that 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.110
 I leave here is almost a 5 more I think 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.670
 here they already shoot me from behind good 5 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.290
 more not because it is already cut but there was 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.520
 another uncle there a quasi in by 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.000
 teams we did not get very good the 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.170
 truth there is no night nor so and so the 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.730
 it really works pretty well 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.209
 then the submachine gun gains a point of 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.950
 damage loses one's reach and then does not 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.450
 we can put accessories and also win 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.620
 one in precision with which I think 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.390
 very good because as I said the 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.489
 statistics when evaluating 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.130
 models the important statistics are 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.500
 the damage the cadence and the precision the 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.480
 reach is not noticeable practically 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.400
 then as some distrust me 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.930
 I think come on you want that that tried 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.580
 cheat or something that I tell you that this that 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.630
 this is true and you do not want me 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.709
 good the next model that I'm going to 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.470
 bring is going to be a model of enhancement 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.300
 cadet that is going to be the one and m &amp; r that kills 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.860
 a burst because some of you believe me 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.900
 I have a yesterday called James Ring 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.090
 hat that kills a gust always 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.500
 then they will bring it and so that 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.750
 See him because you do not really love me 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.660
 that because that particular weapon the 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.030
 I will talk more always 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:26.200
 in that video but that weapon loses an eye 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:27.880
 the people who cost me the ipad have 1 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.290
 - range and 1 more damage with which 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.720
 obviously from a distance 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.190
 kill less no but no or it is not that 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.570
 scope really is not relevant to the 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.250
 time to value more if you see that the weapon 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.650
 loses reach or earns no matte 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.910
 more or less the same and then the test will 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.050
 I will bring or be stress you know that in the 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.940
 ground weapons guides do tests of 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.890
 keep them kill the weapons I'm going to 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.090
 teach that 100% weapon is killed a race 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.350
 if you see all the bullets at any 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.600
 distance for those who do not love me if 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.070
 you think he tried to cheat or something 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.510
 that you know that not that I do it 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.190
 good faith and that I do it so that 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.540
 use the weapons that are really good 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.790
 and so that you appreciate the statistics that 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.250
 they are important but good for finishing 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.620
 talk about your rifle as I tell you he goes up 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.630
 the damage with which the range increases 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.800
 partly because the minimum damage goes up like this 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.690
 that also kills away from a wand 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.550
 less the pressure also improves with what 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.940
 which with handle and silencer 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.350
 It makes me think of a very precise weapon 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.820
 could be compared more or less to the mete 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.109
 11 goal and what happens that the mind has 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.060
 more has more 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.620
 what is called more cadence and that at 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.449
 final note and well you know that this 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.590
 is a rifle has a practice 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:26.479
 special feature and is that the 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.009
 five first bullets have a year 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.449
 increased then if we are accurate and 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.560
 the first bullets take for 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.629
 we will usually kill people very 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.949
 fast and good because ultimately that 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:35.539
 increase of the year and that precision are going 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.189
 very good to your rifle and what not 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.389
 we can put peepholes at me really not 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:40.219
 I care how important I am 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.080
 personally for the possible is the 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:44.150
 silencer or the bullets of these 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.819
 comment the reach the grip on 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.949
 everything that for me is a 100% accessory 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:50.120
 that I put the rifles always on 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.099
 Unwrapped takes you very well with the 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.960
 possible the parabolic microphone all 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.279
 that lets you place it then that you do not 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.599
 I let you look at me really I do not 

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:58.759
 they import their rifle to me since it has 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:01.039
 this the typical look of the mp5 of all the 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:02.509
 round life and it's very very good is not 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.580
 very open and it's very comfortable so 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:05.960
 That really see it as an impediment 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.889
 the only impediment is that as you 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.120
 I said it takes away scope I think it was but 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.039
 is that it is not going to notice or is not noticeable 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.479
 nothing kills there is another model out there that is 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.340
 the other way around that takes away the year and adds 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.750
 reach but it kills a lot more this 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.099
 for comparing what he has done in a private 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.020
 and it kills much more even if you lose 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.969
 scope does not matter what you are going to notice 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.110
 kill because it has a lot more damage like that 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.430
 like the kids 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.600
 and I already tell you that it brings you the proofs 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.100
 for those who do not believe that many 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.450
 you say in the comments get the 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.280
 try the ims so you can see what it is 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.780
 I do not feel like kids like that 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.970
 I hope you liked this video as 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.770
 I tell you this week I will bring you the 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.150
 next model of the and m &amp; r is also 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.010
 bring the diamond endorsement I'll start with 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.590
 the series that I have pending so 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:47.440
 it will always be more you like it 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.440
 the favorite video your goodbye programs
