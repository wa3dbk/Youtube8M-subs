00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
agents for the batter then we're gonna

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.069 
agents for the batter then we're gonna
do<00:01:55.470> all<00:01:55.799> our<00:01:55.860> things<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.759> require<00:01:57.180> one

works<00:04:53.310> as<00:04:53.490> a<00:04:53.520> strainer<00:04:54.320> so<00:04:56.120> whisk<00:04:57.120> that<00:04:57.419> up<00:04:57.479> I

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
works as a strainer so whisk that up I

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.600 
works as a strainer so whisk that up I
found<00:04:58.919> that<00:04:59.220> it<00:04:59.520> was<00:04:59.550> a<00:05:00.240> little<00:05:00.810> too<00:05:01.080> thin<00:05:01.610> and

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
found that it was a little too thin and

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.550 
found that it was a little too thin and
this<00:05:03.000> happens<00:05:03.419> and<00:05:03.570> it's<00:05:03.750> easy<00:05:03.930> to<00:05:04.050> correct

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
this happens and it's easy to correct

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.740 
this happens and it's easy to correct
all<00:05:05.400> you<00:05:05.550> gotta<00:05:05.729> do<00:05:06.000> is<00:05:06.030> get<00:05:06.900> some<00:05:07.200> flour<00:05:08.000> and<00:05:09.000> a

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
all you gotta do is get some flour and a

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.080 
all you gotta do is get some flour and a
little<00:05:09.780> bit<00:05:10.110> more<00:05:10.370> and<00:05:11.370> just<00:05:11.430> play<00:05:11.880> with<00:05:12.030> that

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
little bit more and just play with that

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.439 
little bit more and just play with that
and<00:05:12.570> some<00:05:13.200> water<00:05:13.470> till<00:05:13.860> you<00:05:13.979> get<00:05:14.190> a

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
and some water till you get a

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.820 
and some water till you get a
consistency<00:05:15.449> that<00:05:16.280> well<00:05:17.280> it's<00:05:17.820> a<00:05:17.970> good<00:05:18.090> batter

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
consistency that well it's a good batter

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.510 
consistency that well it's a good batter
what<00:05:19.830> is<00:05:19.950> it<00:05:20.100> good<00:05:20.250> better<00:05:22.070> it'll<00:05:23.070> stick<00:05:23.490> to

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
what is it good better it'll stick to

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.890 
what is it good better it'll stick to
chicken<00:05:24.770> that<00:05:26.000> would<00:05:27.000> be<00:05:27.510> it

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
chicken that would be it

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.170 
chicken that would be it
maybe<00:05:28.530> not<00:05:28.770> pancake<00:05:29.220> better<00:05:29.490> a<00:05:29.789> little<00:05:29.940> bit

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
maybe not pancake better a little bit

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.070 
maybe not pancake better a little bit
thinner<00:05:30.450> but<00:05:31.460> yeah<00:05:32.660> plate<00:05:33.660> was<00:05:33.810> that<00:05:33.930> you'll

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
thinner but yeah plate was that you'll

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.800 
thinner but yeah plate was that you'll
see<00:05:34.349> I<00:05:34.560> mean<00:05:34.979> you<00:05:35.910> can<00:05:36.030> kind<00:05:36.240> of<00:05:36.270> figure<00:05:36.479> out<00:05:36.690> in

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
see I mean you can kind of figure out in

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.650 
see I mean you can kind of figure out in
this<00:05:36.900> video<00:05:37.110> but<00:05:37.440> see<00:05:37.680> when<00:05:37.889> I<00:05:37.919> have<00:05:38.160> chicken

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
this video but see when I have chicken

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.159 
this video but see when I have chicken
it<00:05:39.660> coats<00:05:40.020> it<00:05:40.910> kind<00:05:41.910> of<00:05:42.030> nicely<00:05:42.270> and<00:05:42.810> will

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
it coats it kind of nicely and will

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.310 
it coats it kind of nicely and will
still<00:05:43.500> drip<00:05:43.830> off<00:05:44.070> but<00:05:44.789> see<00:05:45.030> the<00:05:45.780> chicken<00:05:46.139> isn't

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
still drip off but see the chicken isn't

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.580 
still drip off but see the chicken isn't
completely<00:05:47.039> coated<00:05:49.190> that's<00:05:50.190> fine<00:05:51.139> so<00:05:52.139> slowly

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
completely coated that's fine so slowly

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.870 
completely coated that's fine so slowly
adding<00:05:53.220> into<00:05:53.610> the<00:05:54.240> fryer<00:05:54.630> I<00:05:55.610> swing<00:05:56.610> it<00:05:56.760> back

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
adding into the fryer I swing it back

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.029 
adding into the fryer I swing it back
and<00:05:56.940> forth<00:05:57.330> here's<00:05:58.169> a<00:05:58.229> chicken<00:05:58.440> like<00:05:58.710> saffron

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
and forth here's a chicken like saffron

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.210 
and forth here's a chicken like saffron
and<00:05:59.550> it<00:05:59.700> likes<00:05:59.910> this<00:06:00.090> thing<00:06:00.889> when<00:06:01.889> you<00:06:01.979> let<00:06:02.190> go

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
and it likes this thing when you let go

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.460 
and it likes this thing when you let go
make<00:06:02.849> sure<00:06:03.060> that<00:06:03.240> you<00:06:03.419> let<00:06:03.660> go<00:06:03.870> and<00:06:04.050> drop<00:06:04.229> it

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
make sure that you let go and drop it

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.800 
make sure that you let go and drop it
away<00:06:04.740> from<00:06:04.919> you<00:06:05.070> so<00:06:05.280> you<00:06:05.400> don't<00:06:05.520> splash<00:06:05.880> oil<00:06:06.180> at

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
away from you so you don't splash oil at

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.219 
away from you so you don't splash oil at
you<00:06:07.849> I'm<00:06:08.849> used<00:06:09.750> to

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
you I'm used to

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.250 
you I'm used to
oil<00:06:10.770> so<00:06:11.130> I<00:06:11.190> can<00:06:11.430> get<00:06:11.550> my<00:06:11.669> hands<00:06:12.030> really<00:06:12.900> close

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
oil so I can get my hands really close

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.879 
oil so I can get my hands really close
so<00:06:13.530> it<00:06:13.620> doesn't<00:06:13.919> really<00:06:14.130> burn<00:06:14.370> me<00:06:14.610> but<00:06:15.889> you're

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889 
so it doesn't really burn me but you're

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:18.710 
so it doesn't really burn me but you're
doing<00:06:17.280> this<00:06:17.460> if<00:06:17.669> you<00:06:17.789> just<00:06:17.820> dropped<00:06:18.360> it<00:06:18.570> in

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
doing this if you just dropped it in

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.890 
doing this if you just dropped it in
there<00:06:18.930> it'll<00:06:19.530> sink<00:06:20.280> to<00:06:20.460> the<00:06:20.550> bottom<00:06:20.580> and<00:06:21.030> hit

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
there it'll sink to the bottom and hit

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.510 
there it'll sink to the bottom and hit
the<00:06:22.139> bottom<00:06:22.560> of<00:06:22.880> that<00:06:24.800> right<00:06:25.800> there<00:06:26.190> and<00:06:26.430> then

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
the bottom of that right there and then

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.510 
the bottom of that right there and then
kind<00:06:28.120> of<00:06:28.210> cook<00:06:28.450> on<00:06:28.690> to<00:06:28.930> it<00:06:29.050> and<00:06:29.170> then<00:06:30.070> your

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
kind of cook on to it and then your

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.330 
kind of cook on to it and then your
chicken<00:06:30.910> stuck<00:06:31.270> to<00:06:31.570> your<00:06:31.690> basket<00:06:32.040> and<00:06:33.040> that's

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
chicken stuck to your basket and that's

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.000 
chicken stuck to your basket and that's
no<00:06:33.520> good<00:06:33.960> that's<00:06:34.960> why<00:06:35.170> you<00:06:35.230> add<00:06:35.440> it<00:06:35.620> in<00:06:35.710> slowly

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010 
no good that's why you add it in slowly

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:41.280 
no good that's why you add it in slowly
and<00:06:36.900> I<00:06:38.640> just<00:06:39.640> keep<00:06:39.790> adding<00:06:40.180> until<00:06:40.210> it's<00:06:40.630> kind

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290 
and I just keep adding until it's kind

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.870 
and I just keep adding until it's kind
of<00:06:41.440> full<00:06:42.360> and<00:06:43.360> you<00:06:43.570> look<00:06:43.960> for<00:06:44.230> color<00:06:44.470> now<00:06:45.250> I<00:06:45.580> can

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
of full and you look for color now I can

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.300 
of full and you look for color now I can
get<00:06:46.030> into<00:06:46.060> the<00:06:46.360> physics<00:06:46.900> of<00:06:47.110> this<00:06:47.260> but<00:06:48.160> when

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
get into the physics of this but when

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:54.870 
get into the physics of this but when
things<00:06:48.610> float<00:06:49.110> they're<00:06:50.110> generally<00:06:50.860> done<00:06:53.880> but

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
things float they're generally done but

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.720 
things float they're generally done but
you<00:06:55.210> always<00:06:55.750> do<00:06:56.530> a<00:06:56.560> knife<00:06:56.890> test<00:06:57.190> with<00:06:57.370> chicken

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:57.730 
you always do a knife test with chicken

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.800 
you always do a knife test with chicken
goes<00:06:58.240> look<00:06:59.190> not<00:07:00.190> quite<00:07:00.460> done<00:07:00.700> so<00:07:01.360> thrown<00:07:01.630> in

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:01.810 
goes look not quite done so thrown in

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.630 
goes look not quite done so thrown in
there<00:07:01.960> a<00:07:01.990> bit<00:07:02.140> more<00:07:02.380> handing<00:07:02.920> with<00:07:03.070> two

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:03.640 
there a bit more handing with two

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.510 
there a bit more handing with two
colorful<00:07:04.030> anyways<00:07:04.690> I<00:07:04.930> like<00:07:05.620> a<00:07:05.650> good<00:07:05.920> color

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
colorful anyways I like a good color

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.360 
colorful anyways I like a good color
so<00:07:07.560> maybe<00:07:08.560> five<00:07:09.220> to<00:07:09.700> seven<00:07:10.090> minutes<00:07:10.240> on<00:07:10.630> these

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.370 
so maybe five to seven minutes on these

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.830 
so maybe five to seven minutes on these
but<00:07:12.370> cut<00:07:12.670> it<00:07:12.700> try<00:07:13.150> out<00:07:13.330> I<00:07:14.010> got<00:07:15.010> some<00:07:15.040> ranch<00:07:15.430> in<00:07:15.670> a

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 
but cut it try out I got some ranch in a

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.470 
but cut it try out I got some ranch in a
little<00:07:16.840> ramekin<00:07:17.110> on<00:07:17.830> a<00:07:17.860> bowl<00:07:18.550> so<00:07:19.120> some<00:07:19.450> of

little ramekin on a bowl so some of

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.550 
little ramekin on a bowl so some of
these<00:07:20.010> temporary<00:07:21.010> Caen<00:07:21.610> I<00:07:21.930> know<00:07:22.930> you<00:07:22.990> Asians

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 
these temporary Caen I know you Asians

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.670 
these temporary Caen I know you Asians
are<00:07:23.680> hating<00:07:24.040> me<00:07:24.190> right<00:07:24.220> now<00:07:25.200> so<00:07:26.200> there<00:07:26.500> you
