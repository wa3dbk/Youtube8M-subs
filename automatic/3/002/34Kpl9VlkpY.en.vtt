00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.570 
think you're taking you're doing
stepping<00:02:44.800> out<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.040> box<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.400> doing

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
stepping out of the box and doing

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.130 
stepping out of the box and doing
something<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:45.940> little<00:02:45.970> bit<00:02:46.239> different<00:02:46.630> saying

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
something a little bit different saying

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.990 
something a little bit different saying
that<00:02:47.319> will<00:02:47.500> riad<00:02:47.830> Real<00:02:48.250> Madrid<00:02:48.610> be<00:02:48.760> able<00:02:48.940> to

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
that will riad Real Madrid be able to

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.150 
that will riad Real Madrid be able to
win<00:02:49.120> by<00:02:49.269> four<00:02:49.540> more<00:02:49.780> goals<00:02:50.080> that<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.709> think<00:02:51.069> the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
win by four more goals that I think the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.550 
win by four more goals that I think the

even three goals or more priced 2.25 I

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.650 
even three goals or more priced 2.25 I
really<00:03:30.819> like<00:03:30.970> those<00:03:31.180> odds

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
really like those odds

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.509 
really like those odds

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
I predicted I mean I felt I felt weird

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.729 
I predicted I mean I felt I felt weird
doing<00:03:43.359> it<00:03:43.450> I've<00:03:43.569> run<00:03:43.750> so<00:03:44.019> much<00:03:44.139> in<00:03:44.290> my<00:03:44.380> life<00:03:44.590> and

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
doing it I've run so much in my life and

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.890 
doing it I've run so much in my life and
written<00:03:44.950> so<00:03:45.069> much<00:03:45.250> but<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:45.489> predicted<00:03:46.359> a<00:03:46.450> 7<00:03:46.810> to

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
written so much but I predicted a 7 to

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.569 
written so much but I predicted a 7 to
nothing<00:03:47.049> final<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:47.889> I<00:03:48.130> thought<00:03:48.280> this<00:03:48.430> is

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
nothing final and I thought this is

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.250 
nothing final and I thought this is
insane<00:03:49.030> who<00:03:49.239> would<00:03:49.420> predict<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.810> 7<00:03:50.139> nothing

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
insane who would predict a 7 nothing

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.789 
insane who would predict a 7 nothing
final<00:03:51.180> but<00:03:52.180> just<00:03:52.930> just<00:03:53.139> thinking<00:03:53.500> about<00:03:53.590> the

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
final but just just thinking about the

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.140 
final but just just thinking about the
amount<00:03:54.040> of<00:03:54.100> time<00:03:54.310> what<00:03:54.639> would<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:54.850> have<00:03:54.940> here

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
amount of time what would you have here

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.960 
amount of time what would you have here
is<00:03:55.209> a<00:03:55.239> reality<00:03:55.569> of<00:03:55.810> Bale<00:03:56.470> and<00:03:56.769> Ronaldo<00:03:57.700> and

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
is a reality of Bale and Ronaldo and

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.420 
is a reality of Bale and Ronaldo and
Benzema<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.569> Rodriguez<00:03:59.380> and<00:03:59.590> Hernandez<00:04:00.310> and

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
Benzema and Rodriguez and Hernandez and

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.250

they're out there therefore that's why

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.899

you're<00:04:26.560> going<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:26.800> get<00:04:26.890> some<00:04:27.039> high-scoring

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:27.909 
you're going to get some high-scoring

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:29.820 
you're going to get some high-scoring
games<00:04:28.659> that's<00:04:28.960> why<00:04:29.050> you<00:04:29.259> can<00:04:29.560> lay

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
games that's why you can lay

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.140 
games that's why you can lay
three-and-a-half<00:04:30.430> of<00:04:30.550> three<00:04:30.699> all<00:04:30.819> Madrid

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
three-and-a-half of three all Madrid

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.210 
three-and-a-half of three all Madrid
that's<00:04:31.629> why<00:04:31.870> I<00:04:31.900> can<00:04:32.379> say<00:04:32.680> that<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:32.949> game<00:04:33.069> is

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
that's why I can say that the game is

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.200 
that's why I can say that the game is
going<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.400> go<00:04:33.460> over<00:04:33.759> three<00:04:33.939> and<00:04:34.060> a<00:04:34.090> half

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
going to go over three and a half

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.570 
going to go over three and a half
because<00:04:34.860> Ronaldo<00:04:35.860> could<00:04:36.039> get<00:04:36.189> three<00:04:36.370> goals

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580
