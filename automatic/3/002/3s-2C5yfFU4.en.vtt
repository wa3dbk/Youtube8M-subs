because it when I'm studying a
particular<00:02:15.000> part<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.660> logic<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.260> can<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.530> go

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
particular part of logic I can just go

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.870 
particular part of logic I can just go
to<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:16.890> section<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.340> have<00:02:17.490> like<00:02:17.640> what<00:02:17.790> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
teacher says and with the textbook says

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.410

in<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.740> same<00:02:19.890> place<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.940> legal<00:02:21.120> pad

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
in the same place this is the legal pad

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.000 
in the same place this is the legal pad
that<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.600> need<00:02:21.900> for<00:02:22.020> my<00:02:22.080> public<00:02:22.410> speaking<00:02:22.530> class

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
because whenever I print out a speech I

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.140 
because whenever I print out a speech I
cut<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.740> out<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:25.890> paste<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.580> onto<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.820> legal

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
cut it out and paste it onto the legal
