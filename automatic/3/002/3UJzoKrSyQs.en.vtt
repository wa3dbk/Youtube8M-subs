00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello today a bit 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.779
 I like to print but yes I have 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.429
 at least now my best and given 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.440
 It should be the new limited edition of 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.849
 eat the dark romance even now 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.799
 outside and I have a little something 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.440
 not too much like the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.449
 p2 because the gothic theme is honest 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.460
 said not quite so appealing but one 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.020
 a few things smell first of all 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.609
 here this eyeshadow palette with the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.000
 I also got that excited today 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.980
 is the color 01 mystery glam and there was 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.050
 there is another love palette 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.610
 with other riders order and the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.130
 thing has more appealed to me now 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.440
 because this farm is not like that yet 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.250
 so in my repertoire 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.719
 I have made-up today 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.760
 actually with all four colors namely 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.120
 once here to marry this brightest 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.500
 that is pretty good so nice glitter 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.879
 So I'm holding on that I'm real 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.379
 I am satisfied with this grayish one 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.809
 here on the entire movable lid 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.340
 advantage although that is not quite right now 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.860
 I have to comment so well 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.610
 say that is also one of the matte and 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.980
 then I have this one here 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.809
 bordeauxfarbenen again on the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.170
 entire moving lid given but with 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.030
 Concentration and concentration in the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.979
 middle and yes he is quite good again 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.630
 commenting he is also a matter so 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.490
 that is pretty nice and last but not least 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.200
 still this blue for this the eyelet fold 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.760
 that is also well commented so too 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.740
 with a glimmering share he is again 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.330
 and yes , I was fine with that too 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.390
 work so the only one is not so 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.650
 was great he is very horrible brown so 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.750
 but we have a bit of a rage here 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.189
 otherwise the palette i think in 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.659
 order for below I have again 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.490
 drive this bordeaux here on the edge 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.950
 drawn and this very bright again 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.170
 highlighter up front yes I think so 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.360
 is okay the eye make-up though it is for 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.140
 me really a bit 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.180
 getting used to is because I have this 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.950
 burgundy eyeshadow one me 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.320
 I have always shunned so far 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.420
 maybe a bit difficult with 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.439
 to combine these colors to work 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.000
 but I use that this time 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.380
 just all four in here are 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 and makes an eye make-up myself 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.530
 I think that works too 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.180
 well then there is one more 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.890
 highlighter in the ropes of such a 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.350
 I am feeling a little bit content 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.340
 So yes that's just this cream 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.960
 consistency then he has very very little 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.570
 shimmer share no glittering share 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.700
 only very very little amount of shimmer 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.530
 and makes it a bit harder 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.700
 Roche has what you have in mind here 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.709
 actually can not recognize it 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.870
 but if you wear it on then it is 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.830
 a bit rosé colors yes so me 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.140
 He does not know if he necessarily does 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.790
 it has to be kept like it is 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.500
 I have described it now and if so 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.410
 you really wanted something like that is then 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.959
 can you look at it but so now 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.569
 so super hot I find him now 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.489
 honestly not yes I think so 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.549
 interesting that he sees us that way 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.870
 but even otherwise, I know you have to 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.640
 I do not think so necessarily now 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.910
 also have lipsticks 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.989
 in this e roth color a bit 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.340
 stronger than the other 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.019
 I do not have one this time 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.730
 Lipsticks taken with me though 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.799
 Otherwise , do not pass by lipsticks 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.180
 but yes red tones are just not 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.890
 so mine and I thought at home 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.420
 I can still do a red 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.950
 I fit here today 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.769
 By the way, this is the long one 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.319
 lasting from essens number 02 all you 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.230
 need is red yes i think the others 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.579
 Fans do not like this red color now 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.739
 distinguish what is still there 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.690
 There were two lip gloss effects once 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.970
 this bright and once the dark 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.470
 So everything also keeps that is the case 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.450
 similar to that works much like 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.989
 this cream highlighter is namely 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.579
 also the theme here so rose-colored so 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.049
 one does not see in the potty now either 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.730
 so with the maybe if you completely 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.310
 look closely at him against the light 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.049
 but he thinks he is right now 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.600
 many float particles and if you do 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.060
 he gets excited then he shimmers like that 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.350
 irritating rosé maybe can 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.600
 to the below I have seen the 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.069
 now today as a top on the red 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.049
 lipstick applied 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.269
 and yes the effect is even better 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.829
 over if you have this lip gloss again 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.870
 with the handkerchief again a 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.880
 takes away a bit and then you see the 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.410
 still he so I find that the 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.329
 not so bad at all 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.010
 she would be very pretty second 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.109
 it still that slightly darker lipgloss 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.910
 Effect and I have the effect now 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.310
 So I imagined a little differently 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.650
 except that he has the lipsticks 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.690
 he makes ticking darker 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.269
 not so much now though 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.829
 a lot of silver and black glitter 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.630
 inside is find I can see him now 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.359
 not so bad on the lips maybe 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.680
 if the super does not seem like it 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.349
 rather we see that then but otherwise 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.640
 i am the effect i tend to lower 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.409
 I think I would have found better if 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.930
 the black and silver glitter 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:22.330
 particle 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.220
 then you would have been there 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.210
 maybe yes and then it would be 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.460
 maybe something for New Year's Eve 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.259
 but that's not how it is 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.120
 that's what's most important to me now 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:33.590
 This bothers lip gloss effects is the 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.440
 smell I have to say honestly so the 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.720
 is extremely sweet but in the wake is there 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.009
 something else in it was not something 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.020
 So I usually like it 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:45.169
 These smells are very nice but that is 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.250
 somehow yes that smells extreme i like 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.380
 We do not like it that much 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.930
 otherwise the effect is the bright 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.070
 interesting if you are looking for something like that 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.850
 I would not be dark now 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.370
 recommend 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.960
 yes that just has too little effect for 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.460
 I have you ever something from this 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.320
 Before I take away I had such a 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.300
 the feeling that this now 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.090
 not quite as well arrived at 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.650
 you yes, if I'm interesting now 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.690
 otherwise I link below now 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.910
 times my last video was the p2 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.660
 night to remember from which I have re 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.979
 very much taken 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.349
 they were really beautiful 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.150
 and my penultimate video that was in 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.410
 november favorites depending on topic 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.000
 you are not interested in anything else 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.680
 like to watch a video of me 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.509
 and then yes I can also open it 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.159
 follow facebook or on Instagram 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.270
 I am also quite active and then 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:27.740
 Of course I hope the video is here 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.460
 and then we'll see each other 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.460
 next time again
