2003 and at that point I was dreaming we

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.220 
2003 and at that point I was dreaming we
ever<00:00:36.739> get<00:00:36.980> it<00:00:37.160> here<00:00:37.460> and<00:00:37.610> here<00:00:38.239> we<00:00:38.360> are<00:00:38.390> in<00:00:38.510> 2013

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
ever get it here and here we are in 2013

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.820 
ever get it here and here we are in 2013
and<00:00:39.800> it's<00:00:39.920> become<00:00:40.250> a<00:00:40.280> reality

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.550 

or<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.400> first<00:00:46.750> time<00:00:47.750> that<00:00:47.990> it's<00:00:48.110> ever<00:00:48.260> been<00:00:48.440> in

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:48.560 
or the first time that it's ever been in

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.920 
or the first time that it's ever been in
the<00:00:48.650> United<00:00:49.010> States<00:00:49.310> so<00:00:50.030> it's<00:00:50.420> great<00:00:50.660> to<00:00:50.780> be<00:00:50.900> a

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
the United States so it's great to be a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.450 
the United States so it's great to be a
leader<00:00:51.200> but<00:00:51.290> you<00:00:51.470> learn<00:00:51.740> a<00:00:51.770> lot<00:00:51.980> from<00:00:52.040> others

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
leader but you learn a lot from others

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.160 
leader but you learn a lot from others
if<00:00:52.640> they've<00:00:52.790> done<00:00:52.970> it<00:00:53.090> before<00:00:53.180> you<00:00:53.570> we're

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
if they've done it before you we're

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.690 
if they've done it before you we're
excited<00:00:54.530> that<00:00:54.680> we're<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.100> first<00:00:55.280> ones<00:00:55.550> who

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
excited that we're the first ones who

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.850 
excited that we're the first ones who
have<00:00:55.820> ever<00:00:56.000> done<00:00:56.210> it<00:00:56.420> but<00:00:57.320> we've<00:00:57.440> learned<00:00:57.680> a

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
have ever done it but we've learned a

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.040 
have ever done it but we've learned a
lot<00:00:57.890> as<00:00:58.190> we've<00:00:58.400> gone<00:00:58.640> so<00:00:59.060> the<00:00:59.180> first<00:00:59.660> step<00:00:59.900> was

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
lot as we've gone so the first step was

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.049 
lot as we've gone so the first step was
just<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.890> connect<00:01:01.280> with<00:01:01.460> our<00:01:01.610> friends<00:01:01.760> at

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
just to connect with our friends at

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.180 
just to connect with our friends at
mosaic<00:01:02.480> culture<00:01:02.900> to<00:01:03.350> see<00:01:03.379> if<00:01:03.770> they<00:01:03.980> thought

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
mosaic culture to see if they thought

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.980 
mosaic culture to see if they thought
this<00:01:04.430> garden<00:01:04.850> would<00:01:05.059> be<00:01:05.120> the<00:01:05.330> right<00:01:05.449> place<00:01:05.750> to

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
this garden would be the right place to

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.960 
this garden would be the right place to
host<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:06.590> showcase<00:01:07.280> such<00:01:07.520> an<00:01:07.640> exhibition

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
host and showcase such an exhibition

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.730 
host and showcase such an exhibition
because<00:01:08.510> they<00:01:08.660> never<00:01:08.870> have<00:01:09.080> done<00:01:09.290> it<00:01:09.440> in<00:01:09.620> our

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
because they never have done it in our

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.700 
because they never have done it in our
country<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.400> we<00:01:11.210> once<00:01:11.900> we<00:01:12.050> got<00:01:12.200> together<00:01:12.350> we

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
country and we once we got together we

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.990 
country and we once we got together we
realized<00:01:12.920> it<00:01:13.280> was<00:01:13.310> a<00:01:13.400> perfect<00:01:13.820> marriage

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
realized it was a perfect marriage

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.090 
realized it was a perfect marriage
between<00:01:14.360> their<00:01:14.900> work<00:01:15.110> in<00:01:15.350> our<00:01:15.470> garden<00:01:15.890> and

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
between their work in our garden and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.280 
between their work in our garden and
then<00:01:16.640> it<00:01:16.790> was<00:01:16.910> really<00:01:17.210> about<00:01:17.450> doing<00:01:17.869> great

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
then it was really about doing great

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.380 
then it was really about doing great
design<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:18.710> making<00:01:19.400> sure<00:01:19.610> we<00:01:19.790> had<00:01:19.910> iconic

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390

the<00:01:30.640> whole<00:01:30.820> thing<00:01:31.060> has<00:01:31.210> been<00:01:31.390> designed<00:01:31.990> for

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
the whole thing has been designed for

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.950 
the whole thing has been designed for
well<00:01:32.680> over<00:01:32.710> a<00:01:32.980> year<00:01:33.070> so<00:01:33.640> first<00:01:33.910> is<00:01:34.180> what<00:01:34.840> are

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
well over a year so first is what are

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.480 
well over a year so first is what are
the<00:01:35.020> images<00:01:35.440> what<00:01:35.620> do<00:01:35.680> they<00:01:35.800> can<00:01:36.100> look<00:01:36.250> like

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
the images what do they can look like

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.890 
the images what do they can look like
and<00:01:36.700> how<00:01:36.820> will<00:01:36.970> they<00:01:37.090> integrate<00:01:37.540> into<00:01:37.570> the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
and how will they integrate into the

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.030 
and how will they integrate into the
garden<00:01:38.260> so<00:01:38.470> we<00:01:38.590> have<00:01:38.680> these<00:01:38.830> beautiful

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
garden so we have these beautiful

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.520 
garden so we have these beautiful
watercolors<00:01:40.000> of<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.810> images<00:01:41.229> that<00:01:41.260> we've

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
watercolors of the images that we've

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.560 
watercolors of the images that we've
used<00:01:41.890> and<00:01:42.310> how<00:01:42.550> they<00:01:42.729> would<00:01:42.880> integrate<00:01:43.090> into

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
used and how they would integrate into

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.270 
used and how they would integrate into
our<00:01:43.690> garden<00:01:43.900> and<00:01:44.229> then<00:01:44.710> they<00:01:44.860> have<00:01:45.010> to<00:01:45.130> build

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
the frames and then they have to plant

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.680 
the frames and then they have to plant
them<00:01:47.740> irrigate<00:01:48.340> them<00:01:48.580> let<00:01:48.970> the<00:01:49.090> plants<00:01:49.450> grow

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
and then ship them that part of the

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.090 
and then ship them that part of the
process<00:01:52.240> took<00:01:52.570> they<00:01:53.440> were<00:01:53.500> working<00:01:53.920> on<00:01:54.010> the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
process took they were working on the

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.310 
process took they were working on the
frames<00:01:54.369> last<00:01:54.700> fall<00:01:55.000> and<00:01:55.270> they<00:01:55.690> planted<00:01:56.140> them

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
frames last fall and they planted them

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.710 
frames last fall and they planted them
in<00:01:56.440> January<00:01:56.740> so<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:57.850> took<00:01:58.090> four<00:01:58.360> months<00:01:58.510> to
