00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
seismically active before so they set up

have been able to collect data to see if

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.010 
have been able to collect data to see if

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
there is a cause-and-effect relationship

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.510 
there is a cause-and-effect relationship
between<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:12.680> wells<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.160> more<00:01:13.310> recent

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.630 
between the wells and the more recent
earthquakes<00:01:14.090> this<00:01:14.590> increase<00:01:15.590> could<00:01:16.160> be<00:01:16.340> part

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
earthquakes this increase could be part

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.090 
earthquakes this increase could be part
of<00:01:16.730> that<00:01:16.790> natural<00:01:17.630> cycle<00:01:18.380> or<00:01:18.530> it's

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
of that natural cycle or it's

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.320 
of that natural cycle or it's
potentially<00:01:19.940> part<00:01:20.810> of<00:01:21.190> being<00:01:22.190> triggered<00:01:22.970> by

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
potentially part of being triggered by

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.840 
potentially part of being triggered by
the<00:01:23.360> wastewater<00:01:24.050> injection<00:01:24.700> into<00:01:25.700> those

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
the wastewater injection into those

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.260 
the wastewater injection into those
wells<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:26.510> so<00:01:27.290> we<00:01:27.740> have<00:01:28.070> initiated<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.970> study

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
wells and so we have initiated a study

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.390 
wells and so we have initiated a study
and<00:01:29.540> we<00:01:29.990> are<00:01:30.140> looking<00:01:30.470> into<00:01:30.590> it<00:01:30.890> along<00:01:31.220> with

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
and we are looking into it along with

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.880 
and we are looking into it along with
the<00:01:31.520> Arkansas<00:01:31.970> Geological<00:01:32.840> Survey<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.320> it

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
the Arkansas Geological Survey and it

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.740 
the Arkansas Geological Survey and it
turns<00:01:34.220> out<00:01:34.370> that<00:01:34.430> about<00:01:34.820> ninety<00:01:35.150> percent<00:01:35.300> of

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
turns out that about ninety percent of

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.450 
turns out that about ninety percent of
the<00:01:35.900> earthquakes<00:01:36.770> than<00:01:37.010> two-and-a-half

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
the earthquakes than two-and-a-half

the earthquakes than two-and-a-half

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
these wells began operation have been

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.500 
these wells began operation have been
within<00:01:42.230> about<00:01:42.560> 6<00:01:42.860> kilometers<00:01:43.040> of<00:01:43.640> a<00:01:44.000> well<00:01:44.270> and

within about 6 kilometers of a well and

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.220 
within about 6 kilometers of a well and
three<00:01:45.020> in<00:01:45.170> particular<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:46.330> and<00:01:47.330> their<00:01:47.960> their

three in particular and and their their
activity<00:01:48.980> started<00:01:49.400> there<00:01:49.580> after<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.180> wells

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
activity started there after the wells

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.460 
activity started there after the wells
started<00:01:50.930> pumping<00:01:51.740> or<00:01:52.190> injecting<00:01:52.750> so<00:01:53.750> this<00:01:54.260> was

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
started pumping or injecting so this was

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.910 
started pumping or injecting so this was
enough<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:55.040> allow<00:01:55.340> us<00:01:55.550> or<00:01:55.760> to<00:01:56.630> get<00:01:57.470> us<00:01:57.650> to

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
enough to allow us or to get us to

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.410 
enough to allow us or to get us to
hypothesize<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.670> there's<00:01:59.120> a<00:01:59.210> relationship

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
hypothesize that there's a relationship

hypothesize that there's a relationship
