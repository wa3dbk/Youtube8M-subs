here I'll just give you one example this
is<00:03:13.930> two<00:03:14.049> examples<00:03:14.530> actually<00:03:14.970> y<00:03:15.970> can<00:03:16.150> go<00:03:16.299> 31<00:03:16.690> to

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
is two examples actually y can go 31 to

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.650 
is two examples actually y can go 31 to
27<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.680> loses<00:03:18.130> we're<00:03:18.549> going<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.760> show<00:03:18.910> you<00:03:18.940> 31

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
to 26 in this position you would go 11

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.059 
to 26 in this position you would go 11
to<00:03:23.980> 15<00:03:24.430> break<00:03:25.120> up<00:03:25.299> his<00:03:25.419> elbow<00:03:25.859> white<00:03:26.859> would

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
to 15 break up his elbow white would

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.319 
to 15 break up his elbow white would
jump<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.400> from<00:03:27.849> little<00:03:28.060> 18<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:29.079> 2<00:03:29.940> he<00:03:30.940> gets<00:03:31.209> a

jump to from little 18 to 2 he gets a

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:38.309 
jump to from little 18 to 2 he gets a
king<00:03:33.060> now<00:03:34.060> you<00:03:34.120> would<00:03:34.450> jump<00:03:34.690> 9<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:36.459> 25<00:03:37.200> kept<00:03:38.200> you

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
king now you would jump 9 to 25 kept you

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.490 
king now you would jump 9 to 25 kept you
check<00:03:38.530> his<00:03:38.709> back<00:03:38.889> he<00:03:39.790> asked<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.150> jump<00:03:40.389> 2<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.230> 9

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
check his back he asked to jump 2 to 9

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.750 
check his back he asked to jump 2 to 9
and<00:03:42.389> you<00:03:43.389> would<00:03:43.540> jump<00:03:43.750> 5<00:03:44.049> to<00:03:44.260> 14<00:03:44.709> and<00:03:45.579> this

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
and you would jump 5 to 14 and this

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.240 
and you would jump 5 to 14 and this
check<00:03:46.090> on<00:03:46.269> 26<00:03:46.870> is<00:03:47.049> going<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.319> be<00:03:47.440> trapped<00:03:47.739> and

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
check on 26 is going to be trapped and

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.780 
check on 26 is going to be trapped and
you<00:03:48.340> get<00:03:48.519> after<00:03:48.760> you<00:03:48.970> get<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.150> king<00:03:49.419> so<00:03:50.790> that's

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
you get after you get a king so that's

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.839 
you get after you get a king so that's
how<00:03:51.970> you<00:03:52.030> would<00:03:52.299> win<00:03:53.190> if<00:03:54.190> white<00:03:54.430> cuts<00:03:54.669> the

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
how you would win if white cuts the

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.720 
how you would win if white cuts the
incorrect<00:03:55.209> move<00:03:55.450> for<00:03:55.630> 25<00:03:56.109> to<00:03:56.290> 22<00:03:59.639> so<00:04:00.639> the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
incorrect move for 25 to 22 so the

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.569 
incorrect move for 25 to 22 so the
correct<00:04:01.030> move<00:04:01.209> here<00:04:01.540> is<00:04:01.959> 31<00:04:02.530> to<00:04:02.680> 27<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:06.370> go

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
correct move here is 31 to 27 and you go

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.030 
correct move here is 31 to 27 and you go
6<00:04:06.940> to<00:04:07.150> 10

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040

white Jones 27 to 18 you jump 10 to 17
white<00:04:17.019> goes<00:04:17.290> 25<00:04:17.919> to<00:04:18.190> 21<00:04:18.549> he<00:04:18.850> squeezes<00:04:19.239> and<00:04:20.250> you

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
jumps 21 to 14 and again you squeeze

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.060 
jumps 21 to 14 and again you squeeze
again<00:04:28.990> six<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.560> ten<00:04:30.150> what<00:04:31.150> goes<00:04:31.360> to<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:32.070> tected

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
again six to ten what goes to the tected

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.700 
again six to ten what goes to the tected
he<00:04:33.130> goes<00:04:33.280> 32<00:04:33.669> 25<00:04:34.979> you<00:04:35.979> jump<00:04:36.250> 10<00:04:36.490> to<00:04:36.639> 17<00:04:37.710> and

he goes 32 25 you jump 10 to 17 and

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.840 
he goes 32 25 you jump 10 to 17 and
white<00:04:39.220> jumps<00:04:39.580> 25<00:04:40.060> wiped<00:04:40.870> squeezes<00:04:41.770> 25<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.520> 21

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
white jumps 25 wiped squeezes 25 to 21

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.090 
white jumps 25 wiped squeezes 25 to 21
now<00:04:43.750> here<00:04:43.990> in<00:04:44.080> this<00:04:44.169> position<00:04:44.410> you<00:04:44.860> make<00:04:45.070> a

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
now here in this position you make a

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.270 
now here in this position you make a
good<00:04:45.430> move<00:04:45.699> a<00:04:46.440> double<00:04:47.440> exposed<00:04:47.740> to<00:04:47.889> move<00:04:48.070> you

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
good move a double exposed to move you

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.270 
good move a double exposed to move you
go<00:04:48.430> 19<00:04:49.030> to<00:04:49.240> 23<00:04:49.539> and<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.320> reason<00:04:50.680> why<00:04:50.860> this

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
go 19 to 23 and the reason why this

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.730 
go 19 to 23 and the reason why this
white<00:04:51.639> cannot<00:04:52.000> go<00:04:52.180> 21<00:04:52.720> to<00:04:52.870> 14<00:04:53.289> because<00:04:53.590> you

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
white cannot go 21 to 14 because you

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.820 
white cannot go 21 to 14 because you
would<00:04:53.949> jump<00:04:54.190> here<00:04:54.550> and<00:04:55.169> get<00:04:56.169> an<00:04:56.289> extra<00:04:56.500> checker

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
would jump here and get an extra checker

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.670 
would jump here and get an extra checker
so<00:04:57.430> white<00:04:57.669> has<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:57.940> go<00:04:58.210> this<00:04:58.389> way<00:04:58.630> has<00:04:59.229> to<00:04:59.470> jump

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
so white has to go this way has to jump

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.300 
so white has to go this way has to jump
26<00:05:00.280> to<00:05:00.820> 19<00:05:01.270> and<00:05:01.650> then<00:05:02.650> you<00:05:02.860> would<00:05:03.010> go<00:05:03.160> 17<00:05:03.850> to<00:05:04.000> 22

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
26 to 19 and then you would go 17 to 22
