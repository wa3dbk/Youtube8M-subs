00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289 
I'd feel a little tired and that is

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.430 
I'd feel a little tired and that is
because<00:00:17.410> I<00:00:17.650> worked<00:00:17.950> out<00:00:18.130> hard<00:00:18.490> yesterday<00:00:18.820> and

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
feel tired I like to drink loads of 20

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.290 
feel tired I like to drink loads of 20
and<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.970> know<00:00:28.119> it<00:00:28.599> tastes<00:00:28.810> like<00:00:28.900> hey<00:00:29.230> and<00:00:30.300> hand

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
and I know it tastes like hey and hand

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.390 
and I know it tastes like hey and hand
down<00:00:31.570> there<00:00:31.839> actually<00:00:32.070> loads<00:00:33.070> of<00:00:33.280> other

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
down there actually loads of other

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.070 
down there actually loads of other
things<00:00:33.760> out<00:00:33.970> that<00:00:34.000> the<00:00:34.300> taste<00:00:34.540> far<00:00:34.840> better

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
things out that the taste far better

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.010 
things out that the taste far better
than<00:00:35.170> we<00:00:35.500> tea<00:00:35.770> but<00:00:36.610> I<00:00:36.820> drink<00:00:37.329> it<00:00:37.510> primarily

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
than we tea but I drink it primarily

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.730 
than we tea but I drink it primarily
because<00:00:38.560> of<00:00:38.740> its<00:00:39.040> health<00:00:39.250> benefits<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:41.440> first

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:41.740 
because of its health benefits the first

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.130 
because of its health benefits the first
thing<00:00:41.950> you<00:00:42.040> should<00:00:42.070> know<00:00:42.400> about<00:00:42.430> 20<00:00:43.120> that<00:00:43.780> it

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
thing you should know about 20 that it

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.410 
thing you should know about 20 that it
is<00:00:44.380> able<00:00:44.590> to<00:00:44.770> boost<00:00:45.220> your<00:00:45.400> metabolism<00:00:45.640> and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
is able to boost your metabolism and

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.650 
is able to boost your metabolism and
that<00:00:46.660> way<00:00:46.900> you<00:00:46.960> can<00:00:47.290> burn<00:00:47.500> more<00:00:47.710> calories<00:00:47.950> and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
that way you can burn more calories and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.300 
that way you can burn more calories and
certainly<00:00:49.660> when<00:00:50.440> I<00:00:50.500> drink<00:00:50.800> coffee<00:00:51.070> for

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.310 
certainly when I drink coffee for

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.160 
certainly when I drink coffee for
instance<00:00:51.850> I<00:00:52.000> get<00:00:52.150> an<00:00:52.240> instant<00:00:52.540> rush<00:00:52.780> but<00:00:53.080> it

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
instance I get an instant rush but it

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.590 
instance I get an instant rush but it
only<00:00:53.320> lives<00:00:53.620> like<00:00:53.770> two<00:00:54.220> hours<00:00:54.610> but<00:00:55.450> its

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
only lives like two hours but its

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.350 
only lives like two hours but its
opposite<00:00:56.110> with<00:00:56.380> green<00:00:56.800> tea<00:00:57.100> if<00:00:57.550> I<00:00:57.820> drink<00:00:58.060> green

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
opposite with green tea if I drink green

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.540 
opposite with green tea if I drink green
tea<00:00:58.390> I<00:00:58.660> feel<00:00:59.050> energetic<00:00:59.470> for<00:00:59.860> at<00:00:59.950> least<00:01:00.160> four

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
tea I feel energetic for at least four

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.450 
tea I feel energetic for at least four
hours<00:01:00.580> and<00:01:01.470> that<00:01:02.470> is<00:01:02.590> because<00:01:02.740> green<00:01:03.310> tea

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
hours and that is because green tea

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.300 
hours and that is because green tea
contains<00:01:04.000> molecules<00:01:04.299> called<00:01:05.310> polyphenols

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
contains molecules called polyphenols

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.450 
contains molecules called polyphenols
which<00:01:06.610> are<00:01:07.570> able<00:01:08.140> to<00:01:08.380> prevent<00:01:08.830> your<00:01:09.070> body<00:01:09.100> from

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
which are able to prevent your body from

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.940 
which are able to prevent your body from
absorbing<00:01:10.290> all<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.380> caffeine<00:01:12.370> and<00:01:12.640> once<00:01:13.950> it

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
absorbing all the caffeine and once it

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.520 
absorbing all the caffeine and once it
also<00:01:15.250> contains<00:01:15.670> still<00:01:16.090> room<00:01:16.360> in<00:01:16.510> which<00:01:17.290> is<00:01:17.500> a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
also contains still room in which is a

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.490 
also contains still room in which is a
molecule<00:01:18.420> similar<00:01:19.420> and<00:01:19.690> its<00:01:19.840> effect<00:01:20.230> to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
molecule similar and its effect to

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.450 
molecule similar and its effect to
caffeine<00:01:20.920> but<00:01:21.520> it<00:01:21.670> lasts<00:01:21.910> longer<00:01:23.460> something

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
caffeine but it lasts longer something

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.300 
caffeine but it lasts longer something
about<00:01:24.580> when<00:01:24.909> T<00:01:25.150> is<00:01:25.180> that<00:01:25.840> reaches<00:01:26.830> actually

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
about when T is that reaches actually

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.700 
about when T is that reaches actually
able<00:01:27.550> to<00:01:27.760> stimulate<00:01:28.390> alpha<00:01:29.230> waves<00:01:29.440> in<00:01:29.680> your

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
able to stimulate alpha waves in your

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.660 
able to stimulate alpha waves in your
brain<00:01:30.100> if<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:31.630> take<00:01:32.620> Buddhist<00:01:33.040> minds<00:01:33.460> for

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
brain if you take Buddhist minds for

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.760 
brain if you take Buddhist minds for
instance<00:01:34.000> when<00:01:34.300> they<00:01:34.480> sit<00:01:34.750> down<00:01:34.780> to<00:01:35.020> meditate

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
instance when they sit down to meditate

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.100 
instance when they sit down to meditate
for<00:01:35.800> a<00:01:36.070> couple<00:01:36.430> of<00:01:36.460> hours<00:01:36.640> they<00:01:37.510> get<00:01:37.720> alpha

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
for a couple of hours they get alpha

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.310 
for a couple of hours they get alpha
waves<00:01:38.290> in<00:01:38.500> their<00:01:38.710> brains<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.930> it's<00:01:41.110> always

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
waves in their brains so it's always

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.250 
waves in their brains so it's always
great<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:42.159> to<00:01:42.760> keep<00:01:42.970> you<00:01:43.360> know<00:01:43.390> Mimi

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
great and to keep you know Mimi

great and to keep you know Mimi
concentrated<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:45.250> focused<00:01:46.680> another<00:01:47.680> major

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
concentrated and focused another major

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.730 
concentrated and focused another major
thing<00:01:48.340> about<00:01:48.610> three<00:01:48.970> tiers<00:01:49.300> that<00:01:49.740> scientists

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
thing about three tiers that scientists

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.670 
thing about three tiers that scientists
improve<00:01:51.520> that<00:01:52.060> we<00:01:52.390> t<00:01:52.659> is<00:01:52.720> able<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.290> prevent

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
improve that we t is able to prevent

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.399 
improve that we t is able to prevent
cancer<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:54.520> that<00:01:55.390> is<00:01:55.540> because<00:01:55.659> green<00:01:56.200> tea

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
cancer and that is because green tea

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.420 
cancer and that is because green tea
contains<00:01:56.950> a<00:01:57.070> molecule<00:01:57.400> called<00:01:58.320> egcg<00:01:59.320> that<00:02:00.310> is

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
contains a molecule called egcg that is

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.210 
contains a molecule called egcg that is
able<00:02:00.610> to<00:02:00.880> fight<00:02:01.120> cancer<00:02:01.420> cells<00:02:01.870> so<00:02:02.799> as<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.100> can

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
able to fight cancer cells so as you can

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.640 
able to fight cancer cells so as you can
see<00:02:03.490> there<00:02:04.090> are<00:02:04.180> lots<00:02:04.420> of<00:02:04.570> reasons<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:05.229> drink

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
see there are lots of reasons to drink

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.699 
see there are lots of reasons to drink
green<00:02:05.950> tea<00:02:05.979> and<00:02:06.490> you<00:02:06.729> know<00:02:06.880> taste-wise<00:02:07.470> if<00:02:08.470> you

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
green tea and you know taste-wise if you

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.009 
green tea and you know taste-wise if you
add<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:08.860> little<00:02:09.099> agave<00:02:09.429> syrup<00:02:09.789> you<00:02:10.360> know<00:02:10.479> maybe

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
add a little agave syrup you know maybe

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.030 
add a little agave syrup you know maybe
some<00:02:11.470> fresh

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
some fresh

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.339 
some fresh
and<00:02:12.610> squeeze<00:02:12.909> of<00:02:13.030> languages<00:02:13.510> it's<00:02:13.750> actually

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
and squeeze of languages it's actually

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.360 
and squeeze of languages it's actually
very<00:02:14.760> delicious<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:16.590> even<00:02:17.590> like<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.859> blend<00:02:18.099> some
