00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:13.079
 my policy has only one objective 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.960
 create well-paid jobs so you and your family can live better 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:20.769
 and for that I'm going to be four things 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:26.109
 I'm going to reduce taxes for those who work to produce jobs and 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.079
 I will simplify your payment 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.439
 second 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.020
 I go atance to enter totally 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.830
 the taxes we pay 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.860
 third I will invest your money better 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.740
 and fourth I will guarantee economic stability to take care of your heritage 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.760
 so first 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.830
 I'm going to lower the income tax rate 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.570
 because the Mexicans that produce because it invests in that they work that generate 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.330
 Other jobs must not pay more taxes than those paid in other 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.120
 parts of the world that will allow us to have more investment and more employment than 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.120
 It's what I'm looking for 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.450
 and stop because it will be easier than ever 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.040
 make a statement you can do it simply and without help 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.880
 second I will handle in a glass box the money of the people 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.909
 here there will not be any hidden trusts or mysterious boxes you're going to 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:17.560
 to know 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.290
 where are you going to spend them how you spend up to the last penny that 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.570
 they suffer all 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.980
 third I will invest better what we have 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.820
 for investing money what really made me really 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.970
 you need 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.990
 I'm going to invest in schools 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.479
 and in quality universities for your children I will invest in health 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.390
 not only to continue with the popular insurance if I go for health insurance 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.080
 for all because my goal is that no Mexican this without doctors and 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.869
 medicines and without treatment 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.389
 and I'm going to start with all the children that are born when I'm president of the 

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:50.560
 republic 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.200
 fourth I will also use the money precisely in the communities 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.150
 indigenous people that the roads that are needed in drinking water 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.940
 oliver has money in the security that we need to return randomly the 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.330
 streets with tranquility 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.060
 and fourth when I said I'm going to adapt ancÃ­zar economic stability for 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.749
 what 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:11.799
 to take care of your heritage 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.430
 I will launch economic stability to clamor won interest rates 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.349
 and you can buy a house 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.929
 so you can renovate your kitchen so you can lose to put kiruna auto 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:25.969
 I'm going to lower interest rates so there's more investment in Mexico and 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.359
 there is more employment in synthesis my fiscal policy will be 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:34.219
 lower taxes for those who produce so that there is more investment more 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:35.889
 employment and so that we can live better
