recently leathered I guess you can see

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.110 
recently leathered I guess you can see
the<00:00:09.719> main<00:00:09.900> difference<00:00:09.929> from<00:00:10.559> here<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.370> the

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
the main difference from here is the

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.740 
the main difference from here is the
side<00:00:12.300> plates<00:00:13.460> this<00:00:14.460> customer<00:00:14.969> had<00:00:15.150> me<00:00:15.389> order

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
side plates this customer had me order

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.920 
side plates this customer had me order
the<00:00:15.870> rocks<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.379> plates<00:00:16.710> again<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.750> really<00:00:18.750> like

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
the rocks and plates again I really like

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.640 
the rocks and plates again I really like
them<00:00:19.199> they<00:00:19.920> have<00:00:20.100> like<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:21.140> good<00:00:22.140> bit<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.350> depth

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
them they have like a good bit of depth

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.099 
them they have like a good bit of depth
to<00:00:22.980> them<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:26.300> think<00:00:27.300> good<00:00:27.539> as<00:00:27.660> well<00:00:27.900> with

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
to them and I think good as well with

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:36.229 
to them and I think good as well with
the<00:00:28.580> belt<00:00:29.630> like<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.810> black<00:00:34.309> also<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.730> can<00:00:35.940> see

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
the belt like the black also you can see

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.430 
the belt like the black also you can see
that<00:00:37.309> champion<00:00:38.309> won<00:00:38.850> top<00:00:39.180> belt<00:00:39.480> has<00:00:40.170> been

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
that champion won top belt has been

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.459 
that champion won top belt has been
painted<00:00:40.739> black<00:00:40.829> behind<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:42.480> words<00:00:42.719> whereas

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
painted black behind the words whereas

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.700 
painted black behind the words whereas
on<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.950> bottom<00:00:44.280> one<00:00:44.430> its<00:00:44.640> ring<00:00:44.850> accurate<00:00:45.300> and

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
on the bottom one its ring accurate and

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.889 
on the bottom one its ring accurate and
it's<00:00:46.710> not<00:00:46.860> painted<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.789> guess<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.719> just

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
it's not painted so I guess is just

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.189 
it's not painted so I guess is just
preference<00:00:49.170> but<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.629> really<00:00:51.629> like<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.840> with<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
preference but I really like it with the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.010 
preference but I really like it with the
champion<00:00:52.620> painting<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.039> mean<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.670> I

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
champion painting I mean I think it I

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.479 
champion painting I mean I think it I
think<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.260> make<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.559> makes<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.100> stand<00:00:56.280> out

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
think it make it makes it stand out

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.330 
think it make it makes it stand out
especially<00:00:56.879> if<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.300> had<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:58.620> rocks<00:00:58.890> please

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
especially if it had the rocks please

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.189 
especially if it had the rocks please
I<00:00:59.760> think<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.660> would<00:01:00.750> go<00:01:00.870> well<00:01:01.050> together

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
I think that that would go well together

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.100 
I think that that would go well together
but<00:01:01.910> does<00:01:02.910> not<00:01:03.030> how<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.329> used<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.719> ring<00:01:03.930> I

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
but does not how it's used in the ring I

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.070 
but does not how it's used in the ring I
know<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> lot<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.559> people<00:01:05.360> what<00:01:06.360> their<00:01:06.540> belts<00:01:06.840> is

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
know a lot of people what their belts is

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.560 
know a lot of people what their belts is
ring<00:01:07.560> accurate<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.070> possible<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:11.570> texturing

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
ring accurate as possible so texturing

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.850 
ring accurate as possible so texturing
behind<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.049> double<00:01:13.320> use<00:01:13.939> same<00:01:14.939> as<00:01:15.270> always<00:01:15.860> as

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
behind the double use same as always as

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:29.750 
behind the double use same as always as
well<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.280> in-between<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.970> W

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.010 

now<00:01:30.330> I<00:01:30.390> did<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> little<00:01:30.990> border<00:01:32.420> around<00:01:33.420> here

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
now I did the little border around here

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.040 
now I did the little border around here
slightly<00:01:34.920> differently<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.550> time<00:01:36.050> the

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
slightly differently this time the

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.240 
slightly differently this time the
customer<00:01:37.230> requested<00:01:37.980> that<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.860> borders

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
customer requested that the borders

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.890 
customer requested that the borders
follow<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:44.340> letter<00:01:44.550> cut<00:01:44.910> so<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.510> can<00:01:45.660> see

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
follow the letter cut so you can see

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.080 
follow the letter cut so you can see
here<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.500> go<00:01:46.650> all<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.400> way<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.910> very<00:01:48.090> edge

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
here to go all the way to the very edge

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.840 
here to go all the way to the very edge
there<00:01:51.090> as<00:01:51.300> well

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
there as well

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.270 
there as well
whereas<00:01:53.850> what<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.630> usually<00:01:54.930> do<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.710> more<00:01:56.100> like

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
whereas what I usually do is more like

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.570 
whereas what I usually do is more like
this<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.090> just<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:58.710> street<00:01:59.240> square

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
this and it's just the street square

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.340 
this and it's just the street square
this<00:02:02.580> saves<00:02:02.910> you<00:02:03.060> with<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.630> know<00:02:03.660> that<00:02:03.990> empty

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
this saves you with you know that empty

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.490 
this saves you with you know that empty
space<00:02:04.620> as<00:02:05.130> well<00:02:05.280> as<00:02:05.400> hot<00:02:06.090> but<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.020> think<00:02:07.410> it

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
space as well as hot but I think it

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.440 
space as well as hot but I think it
looks<00:02:07.680> cleaner<00:02:08.040> this<00:02:08.310> way<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:11.580> other<00:02:11.820> way<00:02:12.120> is

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
looks cleaner this way the other way is

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.590 
looks cleaner this way the other way is
the<00:02:12.690> accurate<00:02:13.170> way<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.320> do<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.830> which<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.220> why

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
the accurate way to do it which is why

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.450 
the accurate way to do it which is why
if<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:15.660> wanted<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.200> done<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.680> way<00:02:18.200> but<00:02:19.460> as

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
if you wanted it done that way but as

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.980 
if you wanted it done that way but as
you<00:02:20.670> can<00:02:20.790> see<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.150> corners<00:02:21.540> don't<00:02:21.750> really

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
you can see the corners don't really

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.740 
you can see the corners don't really
match<00:02:22.170> up<00:02:22.670> so<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.730> looks<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.120> little<00:02:24.240> bit<00:02:24.450> sloppy

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
match up so it looks a little bit sloppy

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.300 
match up so it looks a little bit sloppy
but<00:02:26.180> again<00:02:27.180> that's<00:02:27.510> just<00:02:27.870> perfect<00:02:28.310> and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
but again that's just perfect and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.710 
but again that's just perfect and
whatever<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.990> would<00:02:31.140> rather<00:02:32.270> they<00:02:33.270> both<00:02:33.450> have

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
whatever you would rather they both have

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.480 
whatever you would rather they both have
their<00:02:35.930> perks<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:37.440> guess<00:02:38.750> mmm<00:02:40.100> I'll<00:02:41.100> set<00:02:41.370> the

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
their perks I guess mmm I'll set the

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.310 
their perks I guess mmm I'll set the
snack<00:02:41.700> box<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.330> big<00:02:42.540> leg<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.900> slightly

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
snack box on this big leg is slightly

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.340 
snack box on this big leg is slightly
different<00:02:43.709> it's<00:02:44.130> like<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:45.540> one<00:02:45.720> Reggie<00:02:46.140> Park

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
different it's like the one Reggie Park

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.300 
different it's like the one Reggie Park
did<00:02:46.560> on<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.070> his<00:02:47.459> real<00:02:47.670> leather<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:49.190> don't<00:02:50.190> know

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
did on you his real leather I don't know

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.949 
did on you his real leather I don't know
if<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.550> can<00:02:50.700> see<00:02:51.180> but<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:52.380> tool<00:02:53.570> actually<00:02:54.570> has

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
if you can see but the tool actually has

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.280 
if you can see but the tool actually has
like<00:02:55.140> little<00:02:55.440> vertical<00:02:55.770> lines<00:02:56.100> in<00:02:56.489> it<00:02:57.290> and

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
like little vertical lines in it and

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.910 
like little vertical lines in it and
it's<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.770> slightly<00:02:59.220> smaller<00:02:59.550> tool<00:02:59.970> then<00:03:00.920> what's

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
it's a slightly smaller tool then what's

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:14.770 
it's a slightly smaller tool then what's
normally<00:03:02.700> huge<00:03:03.860> if<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:04.980> can<00:03:05.220> see

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.430 

there<00:03:15.470> we<00:03:15.560> go

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.280 

you<00:03:19.250> can<00:03:19.400> sit<00:03:19.670> in<00:03:19.730> there<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:20.870> was<00:03:21.020> just<00:03:21.230> a

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
you can sit in there that was just a

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.690 
you can sit in there that was just a
little<00:03:21.470> bit<00:03:21.560> bigger<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:23.660> also<00:03:24.340> this<00:03:25.340> cut

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
little bit bigger and also this cut

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.410 
little bit bigger and also this cut
right<00:03:26.030> here<00:03:27.760> this<00:03:28.760> is<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.090> cut<00:03:29.240> that<00:03:29.360> I

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
right here this is the cut that I

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.820 
right here this is the cut that I
normally<00:03:29.930> make<00:03:30.110> it's<00:03:30.710> more<00:03:30.980> like<00:03:31.130> a<00:03:31.250> see<00:03:32.830> where

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
normally make it's more like a see where

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.460 
normally make it's more like a see where
as<00:03:33.920> you<00:03:34.040> can<00:03:34.070> see<00:03:34.340> on<00:03:34.460> this<00:03:34.730> cut<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:35.390> did<00:03:36.320> the

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
as you can see on this cut I did the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.990 
as you can see on this cut I did the
curve<00:03:36.680> slightly<00:03:37.160> tighter<00:03:38.260> so<00:03:39.260> it's<00:03:39.410> not<00:03:39.560> so

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
curve slightly tighter so it's not so

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.180 
curve slightly tighter so it's not so
round<00:03:45.070> finger<00:03:47.260> I'll<00:03:48.260> shine<00:03:48.500> it<00:03:48.680> up<00:03:48.800> before<00:03:49.160> I

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
round finger I'll shine it up before I

00:03:49.190 --> 00:04:02.730 
round finger I'll shine it up before I
send<00:03:49.460> it<00:03:49.580> out<00:03:49.700> I<00:03:49.760> promise

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.180 

that<00:04:03.370> about<00:04:03.580> wraps<00:04:04.000> it<00:04:04.240> up<00:04:04.390> for<00:04:05.190> the

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
that about wraps it up for the

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.680 
that about wraps it up for the
differences<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:10.830> can<00:04:11.830> see<00:04:12.280> over<00:04:12.520> here

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
differences you can see over here

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.560 
differences you can see over here
borders<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.840> same<00:04:14.080> way<00:04:15.060> it<00:04:16.060> looks<00:04:16.330> nice

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
borders the same way it looks nice

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.770 
borders the same way it looks nice
because<00:04:16.780> it<00:04:17.050> follows<00:04:17.980> the<00:04:18.010> leather<00:04:18.850> but<00:04:19.180> see

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
because it follows the leather but see

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.540 
because it follows the leather but see
like<00:04:19.959> up<00:04:20.110> here<00:04:20.410> you<00:04:20.680> can't<00:04:20.890> really<00:04:21.010> make<00:04:21.340> this

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:21.550 
like up here you can't really make this

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.940 
like up here you can't really make this
to<00:04:21.760> meet<00:04:22.330> so<00:04:22.780> you<00:04:22.990> just<00:04:23.140> kind<00:04:23.410> of<00:04:23.440> have<00:04:23.560> to<00:04:23.590> fit

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
to meet so you just kind of have to fit

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:57.400 
to meet so you just kind of have to fit
with<00:04:24.070> what<00:04:24.220> you<00:04:24.340> got

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.200
