months<00:00:35.370> old<00:00:35.579> because<00:00:35.940> they<00:00:36.540> have<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> tendency

months old because they have a tendency
to<00:00:37.860> its<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.460> at<00:00:38.610> first<00:00:38.910> when<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.180> heard<00:00:39.420> that

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
to its I at first when I heard that

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.150 
to its I at first when I heard that
finnish<00:00:39.899> spitz<00:00:40.079> had<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.530> be<00:00:40.649> tied<00:00:40.800> up<00:00:40.860> no

finnish spitz had to be tied up no
matter<00:00:41.340> what<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.850> thought<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.629> was<00:00:42.690> because<00:00:42.870> if

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
matter what I thought it was because if

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260 
matter what I thought it was because if
you<00:00:43.649> let<00:00:43.800> them<00:00:43.980> loose<00:00:44.190> then<00:00:44.579> they<00:00:44.730> just<00:00:45.000> bolt

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
you let them loose then they just bolt

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.420 
you let them loose then they just bolt
and<00:00:45.480> run<00:00:45.600> away<00:00:45.690> it's<00:00:46.530> not<00:00:46.739> really<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.250> case

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
and run away it's not really the case

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.279 
and run away it's not really the case
it's<00:00:47.760> not<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:47.940> much<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.450> they<00:00:48.570> bolt<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.110> run

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
it's not so much that they bolt and run

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.430 
it's not so much that they bolt and run
away<00:00:49.559> it's<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.610> they<00:00:50.910> don't<00:00:51.329> come<00:00:52.140> when<00:00:52.320> you

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
away it's that they don't come when you

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.389 
away it's that they don't come when you
call<00:00:52.800> them<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.160> much<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.670> they<00:00:54.120> meander<00:00:54.809> and

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
call them as much and they meander and

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.610 
call them as much and they meander and
the<00:00:56.399> road<00:00:56.670> doesn't<00:00:57.149> seem<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.750> stop<00:00:57.989> them<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
the road doesn't seem to stop them the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.110 
the road doesn't seem to stop them the
woods<00:00:58.859> don't<00:00:59.039> seem<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.399> stop<00:00:59.609> them<00:00:59.850> so

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
woods don't seem to stop them so

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.529 
woods don't seem to stop them so
wherever<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.410> don't<00:01:01.770> want<00:01:01.980> them<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.309> go

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
wherever you don't want them to go

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.450 
wherever you don't want them to go
they're<00:01:03.539> still<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.960> go<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.739> they're

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
they're still going to go so they're

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.770 
they're still going to go so they're
right<00:01:05.700> when<00:01:05.850> they<00:01:06.000> say<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.479> should<00:01:06.659> be

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
right when they say that it should be

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.510 
right when they say that it should be
either<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.140> really<00:01:07.560> large<00:01:07.799> yard<00:01:08.130> where<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.369> can

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
either a really large yard where you can

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.719 
either a really large yard where you can
let<00:01:08.700> them<00:01:08.850> meander<00:01:09.270> or<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:10.470> fenced-in<00:01:11.130> area<00:01:11.310> or

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
let them meander or a fenced-in area or

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.140 
let them meander or a fenced-in area or
as<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.540> do<00:01:12.600> quite<00:01:13.049> often<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.560> them<00:01:13.970> tied<00:01:14.970> up

for her the willpower the not running
straight<00:04:04.570> out<00:04:04.810> into<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.350> woods<00:04:05.440> never<00:04:05.769> coming

back and the issue with children that

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.130 
back and the issue with children that
seemed<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:09.940> have<00:04:10.090> come<00:04:10.209> up<00:04:10.390> more<00:04:10.600> often<00:04:10.959> than<00:04:11.110> I

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
seemed to have come up more often than I

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.289 
seemed to have come up more often than I
would<00:04:11.230> like<00:04:11.530> it<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:11.709> which<00:04:12.549> is<00:04:12.579> still<00:04:13.030> actually

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
would like it to which is still actually

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.840 
would like it to which is still actually
a<00:04:13.630> mild<00:04:14.200> issue<00:04:14.500> with<00:04:14.860> her<00:04:15.010> she's<00:04:15.250> growing<00:04:15.670> out

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
a mild issue with her she's growing out

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.050 
a mild issue with her she's growing out
of<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.359> as<00:04:17.140> she's<00:04:18.100> being<00:04:18.400> taught<00:04:18.700> not<00:04:19.000> to

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
of it and as she's being taught not to

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.210 
of it and as she's being taught not to
do<00:04:19.419> that<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:19.870> as<00:04:20.109> the<00:04:20.350> children<00:04:20.560> become<00:04:21.190> more

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
do that and as the children become more

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.700 
do that and as the children become more
dominant<00:04:21.910> with<00:04:22.090> her<00:04:22.270> she<00:04:22.960> has<00:04:23.110> decided<00:04:23.500> that

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
dominant with her she has decided that

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.760 
dominant with her she has decided that
she<00:04:24.039> is<00:04:24.190> under<00:04:24.550> them<00:04:24.700> and<00:04:24.940> it<00:04:25.900> is<00:04:26.080> a

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
she is under them and it is a

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.400 
she is under them and it is a
has<00:04:27.460> finally<00:04:27.699> taken<00:04:27.940> her<00:04:28.240> place<00:04:28.509> I<00:04:28.780> guess<00:04:29.289> you

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
has finally taken her place I guess you

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.710 
has finally taken her place I guess you
could<00:04:29.560> say<00:04:29.740> so<00:04:30.060> it's<00:04:31.060> taken<00:04:31.389> a<00:04:31.449> little<00:04:31.569> while

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
could say so it's taken a little while

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.260 
could say so it's taken a little while
and<00:04:32.199> a<00:04:32.349> little<00:04:32.590> bit<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:32.800> work<00:04:32.979> but<00:04:33.280> we're<00:04:34.120> gonna

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
and a little bit of work but we're gonna

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.760 
and a little bit of work but we're gonna
we're<00:04:34.750> kind<00:04:34.960> of<00:04:35.050> getting<00:04:35.289> that<00:04:35.379> out<00:04:35.560> of<00:04:35.590> her

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
we're kind of getting that out of her

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.960 
we're kind of getting that out of her
but<00:04:35.979> that's<00:04:36.099> definitely<00:04:36.310> something<00:04:36.789> to

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
but that's definitely something to

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.189 
but that's definitely something to
consider<00:04:37.180> if<00:04:37.629> you're<00:04:37.750> thinking<00:04:38.080> about

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199
