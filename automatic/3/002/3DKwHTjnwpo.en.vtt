00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.109
 some small changes in my channel 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.330
 youtube and more more details I'm going to talk 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.980
 later on about this but one of 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.260
 they for example have put me lights 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.560
 look 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.619
 lights to see the image well but 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.150
 not all of this will help us to give 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.850
 best tips for you and for you 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.590
 especially do everything becomes clearer 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.600
 that you can implement in your business 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.970
 coffee or as a barista or even as 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.220
 coffee lover at home and today I'm going to 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.070
 talk about a council that has given a few 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.280
 my friends and they were freaking out over the 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.800
 coffee theme filter this coffee maker 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.989
 filter is called v60 in other videos already 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.790
 I will go more in details but the trick 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.250
 What I want to give you is when the fact is 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.960
 good coffee all this you already know 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.290
 how to prepare it but when done the 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.110
 coffee we put the coffee and here we have the 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.330
 water just heated then this water 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.120
 is almost boiling and now what I'm going to 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.100
 to do is divide a little bit my lame coffee 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.019
 a spoon or anything you can 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.170
 use to remove and what we're going to 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:10.250
 to do is to place the Laborism of coffee and 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.500
 As soon as possible I will remove with this 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.110
 spoon because I do this because of this 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.240
 safer way than everything 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.939
 exactly all the coffee 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.060
 is in contact with the water and you get a 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.280
 much better coffee alone with this trick and 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.290
 you will be able to get better coffees for your 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.840

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.560
