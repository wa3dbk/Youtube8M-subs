I'll show you how to do a hood fold
well<00:00:44.219> that's<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> thing<00:00:44.640> there's<00:00:44.820> all

well that's the thing there's all
different<00:00:44.969> types<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.690> folds<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.710> get

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
different types of folds and if you get

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.459 
different types of folds and if you get
into<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> art<00:00:47.610> you'll<00:00:48.420> learn<00:00:48.690> how<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.289> it

do them so so I got some nice Japanese
paper<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.430> think<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.670> bought<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.120> Japan<00:00:57.449> and

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
paper I think I bought this in Japan and

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.750 
paper I think I bought this in Japan and
it's<00:00:58.350> one<00:00:58.500> sided<00:00:58.770> although<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.280> pattern<00:00:59.609> kind

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
it's one sided although the pattern kind

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.580 
it's one sided although the pattern kind
of<00:00:59.940> shows<00:01:00.120> through<00:01:00.449> but<00:01:01.079> if<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.260> want<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> do

inches<00:01:06.540> whatever<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.920> smaller<00:01:08.220> actually<00:01:08.700> it

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
inches whatever the smaller actually it

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.240 
inches whatever the smaller actually it
is<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.360> better<00:01:09.510> they<00:01:09.689> look<00:01:09.960> but<00:01:10.740> um<00:01:10.950> I

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
is the better they look but um I

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.250 
is the better they look but um I
recommend<00:01:12.090> if<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.299> have<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.479> two-sided<00:01:12.930> paper

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
recommend if you have a two-sided paper

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.550 
recommend if you have a two-sided paper
start<00:01:14.189> with<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.520> pattern<00:01:15.030> side<00:01:15.270> up<00:01:15.540> okay<00:01:16.500> so

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
start with the pattern side up okay so

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.200 
start with the pattern side up okay so
this<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.950> what<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.130> do<00:01:17.250> fold<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.180> half

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
this is what we do fold this in half

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.630 
this is what we do fold this in half
like<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:21.470> you're<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.500> making<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.100> crease<00:01:23.369> as

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
like this you're just making a crease as

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.420 
like this you're just making a crease as
all<00:01:23.759> you're<00:01:23.909> doing

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.480 

then<00:01:29.430> I'm<00:01:29.550> hold<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.970> now<00:01:30.980> bring<00:01:31.980> both<00:01:32.190> sides

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
then I'm hold it now bring both sides

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.940 
then I'm hold it now bring both sides
into<00:01:32.910> that<00:01:33.060> center<00:01:33.330> line<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:33.690> this<00:01:33.890> kind<00:01:34.890> of

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
into that center line like this kind of

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.020 
into that center line like this kind of
every<00:01:35.130> similar<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.550> what<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.730> do<00:01:35.850> if<00:01:35.940> you're

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
every similar to what you do if you're

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.230 
every similar to what you do if you're
making<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.330> paper<00:01:36.510> airplane<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:39.030> broke

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
making a paper airplane so that we broke

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.730 
making a paper airplane so that we broke
both<00:01:39.420> sides<00:01:39.660> and<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.870> try<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.050> get<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.380> line<00:01:40.560> to

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
both sides and I try to get that line to

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.340 
both sides and I try to get that line to
match<00:01:40.890> as<00:01:41.130> best<00:01:41.340> as<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.550> can<00:01:45.140> flip<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.290> thing

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
match as best as you can flip this thing

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.030 
match as best as you can flip this thing
over<00:01:49.160> right<00:01:50.160> you<00:01:51.090> turn<00:01:51.330> it<00:01:51.450> like<00:01:51.480> this<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.890> this

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
over right you turn it like this so this

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.850 
over right you turn it like this so this
point<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.430> facing<00:01:53.790> off<00:01:53.940> to<00:01:54.090> your<00:01:54.180> left<00:01:56.300> now

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
point is facing off to your left now

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.280 
point is facing off to your left now
this<00:01:58.860> take<00:01:59.190> this<00:01:59.370> corner<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.050> match<00:02:01.050> it<00:02:01.260> to

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
this take this corner and match it to

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.719 
this take this corner and match it to
this<00:02:01.530> corner<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:01.979> I'll<00:02:02.130> sort<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.400> just<00:02:02.610> like

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
this corner and I'll sort it just like

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.830 
this corner and I'll sort it just like
this<00:02:02.910> on<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.570> straight<00:02:03.900> line<00:02:04.430> take<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.840> bring

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
this on a straight line take this bring

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.870 
this on a straight line take this bring
it<00:02:06.960> over<00:02:07.140> here

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
it over here

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.850 
it over here
just<00:02:08.880> like<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.570> these<00:02:09.720> corners<00:02:10.229> meet<00:02:10.470> and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
just like that so these corners meet and

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.600 
just like that so these corners meet and
this<00:02:11.130> is<00:02:11.280> nice<00:02:11.490> and<00:02:11.700> vertical<00:02:14.209> very<00:02:15.209> nice<00:02:16.610> now

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
this is nice and vertical very nice now

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.010 
this is nice and vertical very nice now
we<00:02:17.730> had<00:02:17.880> already<00:02:18.000> done<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.330> fold<00:02:18.660> we<00:02:18.840> have<00:02:18.990> a

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
we had already done a fold we have a

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.020 
we had already done a fold we have a
fold<00:02:19.380> along<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:19.920> line<00:02:19.980> here<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.790> we<00:02:20.880> had

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
fold along this line here that we had

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.720 
fold along this line here that we had
previously<00:02:21.240> done<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.800> now<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.040> can<00:02:23.280> take<00:02:23.490> this

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
previously done so now you can take this

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.160 
previously done so now you can take this
whole<00:02:24.000> thing<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.300> fold<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.690> right<00:02:24.810> over<00:02:25.050> like

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
whole thing and fold it right over like

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.510 
whole thing and fold it right over like
that<00:02:26.600> there<00:02:27.600> we<00:02:27.660> go<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.530> take<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.310> fold

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
that there we go so take that and fold

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.020 
that there we go so take that and fold
it<00:02:29.730> right<00:02:29.880> over

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.730 

now<00:02:34.540> here's<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.780> little<00:02:35.020> bit<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.230> tricky<00:02:35.500> fold

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
now here's a little bit of a tricky fold

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.550 
now here's a little bit of a tricky fold
this<00:02:36.340> isn't<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.990> hood<00:02:37.990> fold<00:02:38.260> that<00:02:38.410> I<00:02:38.440> was

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
this isn't the hood fold that I was

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.690 
this isn't the hood fold that I was
telling<00:02:38.680> about<00:02:38.860> but<00:02:39.130> this<00:02:39.250> one<00:02:39.400> is<00:02:39.490> a<00:02:39.520> little

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
telling about but this one is a little

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.010 
telling about but this one is a little
different<00:02:40.060> this<00:02:40.120> one<00:02:40.300> is<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.450> little<00:02:40.630> tricky

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
different this one is a little tricky

very<00:03:24.640> good

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
very good

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.680 
very good
not<00:03:27.380> what<00:03:27.530> we<00:03:27.650> did<00:03:28.220> this<00:03:28.370> is<00:03:28.640> this<00:03:28.850> swans<00:03:29.270> neck

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
not what we did this is this swans neck

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.720 
not what we did this is this swans neck
it's<00:03:30.020> too<00:03:30.230> big<00:03:30.440> so<00:03:30.680> we're<00:03:30.830> gonna<00:03:30.920> reduce<00:03:31.520> the

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
it's too big so we're gonna reduce the

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.750 
it's too big so we're gonna reduce the
size<00:03:31.940> of<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.210> swans<00:03:32.510> net<00:03:33.220> so<00:03:34.220> bring<00:03:34.520> these

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
size of that swans net so bring these

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.500 
size of that swans net so bring these
both<00:03:35.000> these<00:03:35.180> edges<00:03:35.570> into<00:03:35.870> your<00:03:36.020> center<00:03:36.260> line

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
both these edges into your center line

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.080 
both these edges into your center line
fold<00:03:38.510> that<00:03:38.720> up<00:03:38.840> like<00:03:39.020> that<00:03:39.760> try<00:03:40.760> to<00:03:40.790> keep<00:03:40.970> your

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
fold that up like that try to keep your

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.520 
fold that up like that try to keep your
point<00:03:41.360> and<00:03:41.630> your<00:03:41.780> lines<00:03:41.990> as<00:03:42.200> straight<00:03:42.410> as

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
point and your lines as straight as

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.010 
point and your lines as straight as
possible<00:03:43.030> it<00:03:44.030> will<00:03:44.180> look<00:03:44.360> much<00:03:44.510> better<00:03:44.750> the

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
possible it will look much better the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.400 
possible it will look much better the
more<00:03:45.490> precise<00:03:46.490> you<00:03:46.730> are<00:03:46.760> with<00:03:47.150> your<00:03:47.240> folds<00:03:47.900> the

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
more precise you are with your folds the

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.060 
more precise you are with your folds the
better<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.770> final<00:03:49.100> project<00:03:49.310> looks<00:03:50.830> your<00:03:51.830> mind

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
better the final project looks your mind

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.650 
better the final project looks your mind
is<00:03:52.220> starting<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.670> get<00:03:52.790> just<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.120> little<00:03:53.150> bit<00:03:53.570> of

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
is starting to get just a little bit of

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.520 
is starting to get just a little bit of
where<00:03:53.870> on<00:03:54.140> the<00:03:54.260> tip<00:03:54.500> there<00:03:54.800> that's<00:03:55.760> okay<00:03:56.530> so

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
where on the tip there that's okay so

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.960

actual hood fold is

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.670 
actual hood fold is
yeah<00:04:35.180> actually<00:04:35.390> breaking<00:04:35.960> this<00:04:36.080> open<00:04:36.500> like

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
yeah actually breaking this open like

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.440 
yeah actually breaking this open like
this<00:04:36.890> and<00:04:37.750> getting<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:38.930> direction<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.590> change

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
this and getting the direction to change

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.200 
this and getting the direction to change
chip<00:04:41.650> seems<00:04:42.650> almost<00:04:42.800> like<00:04:43.010> a<00:04:43.070> swivel<00:04:43.430> it

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
chip seems almost like a swivel it

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.150 
chip seems almost like a swivel it
swivel<00:04:44.240> now<00:04:45.169> that's<00:04:45.350> kind<00:04:45.530> of<00:04:45.590> tricky<00:04:45.740> to<00:04:45.979> do

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
swivel now that's kind of tricky to do

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.700 
swivel now that's kind of tricky to do
if<00:04:46.370> you've<00:04:46.490> never<00:04:46.640> done<00:04:46.850> origami<00:04:47.300> before<00:04:47.750> so

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
if you've never done origami before so

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.020 
if you've never done origami before so
what<00:04:48.919> you<00:04:49.040> can<00:04:49.250> do<00:04:49.550> is<00:04:51.010> do<00:04:52.010> a<00:04:52.040> pre<00:04:52.340> polls<00:04:52.669> on

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
what you can do is do a pre polls on

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.530 
what you can do is do a pre polls on
your<00:04:53.270> Swan<00:04:54.050> like<00:04:54.890> this<00:04:55.130> just<00:04:55.790> grab<00:04:56.030> this<00:04:56.300> and

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
your Swan like this just grab this and

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.950 
your Swan like this just grab this and
think<00:04:57.140> of<00:04:57.260> a<00:04:57.410> vertical<00:04:57.710> line<00:04:58.010> right<00:04:58.370> here<00:04:58.610> and

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
think of a vertical line right here and

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.940 
think of a vertical line right here and
fold<00:04:59.960> it<00:05:00.850> so<00:05:01.850> you<00:05:01.970> just<00:05:02.150> grab<00:05:02.300> it<00:05:02.419> and<00:05:02.770> fold<00:05:03.770> it

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
fold it so you just grab it and fold it

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.940 
fold it so you just grab it and fold it
so<00:05:04.130> this<00:05:04.310> line<00:05:04.520> is<00:05:04.550> vertical<00:05:05.180> and<00:05:05.740> then<00:05:06.740> do<00:05:06.890> it

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
so this line is vertical and then do it

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.380 
so this line is vertical and then do it
the<00:05:07.040> other<00:05:07.160> direction<00:05:07.310> to<00:05:07.729> just<00:05:07.970> to<00:05:08.060> make<00:05:08.210> your

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
the other direction to just to make your

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.760 
the other direction to just to make your
fold<00:05:08.660> well<00:05:09.140> tuck<00:05:09.890> it<00:05:10.010> underneath<00:05:10.250> and<00:05:11.770> crease

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
fold well tuck it underneath and crease

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.899 
fold well tuck it underneath and crease
it

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909 
it

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.689 
it
so<00:05:15.449> now<00:05:15.569> this<00:05:15.719> is<00:05:15.779> straight<00:05:16.639> straighten<00:05:17.639> your

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
so now this is straight straighten your

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.369 
so now this is straight straighten your
back<00:05:17.849> out<00:05:18.059> now<00:05:18.629> you<00:05:18.689> have<00:05:18.869> a<00:05:18.929> nice<00:05:19.080> crease

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:19.379 
back out now you have a nice crease

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:20.719 
back out now you have a nice crease
there<00:05:19.589> that<00:05:19.770> you<00:05:19.860> can<00:05:19.949> do<00:05:20.069> you<00:05:20.189> hood<00:05:20.309> fold<00:05:20.550> on

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
there that you can do you hood fold on

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.139 
there that you can do you hood fold on
so<00:05:21.599> open<00:05:22.409> it<00:05:22.499> up<00:05:22.619> get<00:05:23.490> your<00:05:23.580> finger<00:05:23.849> in<00:05:23.999> there

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:24.149 
so open it up get your finger in there

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:31.129 
so open it up get your finger in there
and<00:05:24.439> then<00:05:25.439> pop<00:05:26.279> it<00:05:26.459> through<00:05:28.789> like<00:05:29.789> this<00:05:30.139> there

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
and then pop it through like this there

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:31.669 
and then pop it through like this there
we<00:05:31.259> go

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:31.679 
we go

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:34.579 
we go
popped<00:05:32.309> over<00:05:32.990> I'm<00:05:33.990> just<00:05:34.050> starting<00:05:34.439> to<00:05:34.469> get

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:34.589 
popped over I'm just starting to get

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:38.869 
popped over I'm just starting to get
used<00:05:34.889> worn<00:05:35.669> a<00:05:35.999> little<00:05:36.149> worn<00:05:36.449> here<00:05:37.520> right<00:05:38.520> along

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:38.879 
used worn a little worn here right along

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:42.139 
used worn a little worn here right along
that<00:05:39.029> crease<00:05:39.360> there<00:05:39.629> we<00:05:39.839> go<00:05:40.909> so<00:05:41.909> that<00:05:42.029> it

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:42.149 
that crease there we go so that it

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:44.059 
that crease there we go so that it
popped<00:05:42.389> right<00:05:42.509> over<00:05:42.929> and<00:05:43.649> then<00:05:43.800> is<00:05:43.889> your<00:05:43.979> hood

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:44.069 
popped right over and then is your hood

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:46.549 
popped right over and then is your hood
fold<00:05:44.339> so<00:05:45.330> that's<00:05:45.599> a<00:05:45.659> little<00:05:45.809> tricky<00:05:46.199> but<00:05:46.379> work

00:05:46.549 --> 00:05:46.559 
fold so that's a little tricky but work

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:48.919 
fold so that's a little tricky but work
on<00:05:46.740> it<00:05:46.919> it's<00:05:47.039> really<00:05:47.369> worth<00:05:47.550> it<00:05:47.759> because<00:05:48.389> a<00:05:48.539> lot

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:48.929 
on it it's really worth it because a lot

00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:51.529 
on it it's really worth it because a lot
of<00:05:48.959> our<00:05:49.169> egami<00:05:49.469> uses<00:05:49.889> that<00:05:49.979> well<00:05:50.300> it's<00:05:51.300> a<00:05:51.419> very

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
of our egami uses that well it's a very

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.669 
of our egami uses that well it's a very
standard<00:05:52.349> fold<00:05:54.019> so<00:05:55.019> now<00:05:55.139> I<00:05:55.169> spawned<00:05:55.529> it's

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:55.679 
standard fold so now I spawned it's

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:58.329 
standard fold so now I spawned it's
almost<00:05:55.860> done<00:05:56.099> so<00:05:56.279> you<00:05:56.339> do<00:05:56.519> one<00:05:56.729> more<00:05:56.909> hood<00:05:57.149> fold

00:05:58.329 --> 00:05:58.339 
almost done so you do one more hood fold

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:04.279 
almost done so you do one more hood fold
by<00:05:59.339> the<00:05:59.399> head<00:06:02.389> we've<00:06:03.389> got<00:06:03.569> the<00:06:03.659> neck<00:06:03.869> now<00:06:04.080> we<00:06:04.139> do

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
by the head we've got the neck now we do

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.129 
by the head we've got the neck now we do
the<00:06:04.379> head<00:06:04.580> let's<00:06:05.580> open<00:06:05.789> it<00:06:06.029> up<00:06:06.119> and<00:06:07.610> you<00:06:08.610> pop<00:06:08.909> it

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:24.400 
the head let's open it up and you pop it
there<00:06:10.139> we<00:06:10.289> go

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.410 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.260 

now<00:06:24.980> you<00:06:25.040> can<00:06:25.250> billow<00:06:25.430> out<00:06:25.610> the<00:06:25.820> Rings<00:06:26.030> a

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
now you can billow out the Rings a

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:33.010 
now you can billow out the Rings a
little<00:06:26.810> bit<00:06:27.370> billow<00:06:28.370> these<00:06:28.610> out<00:06:31.840> and<00:06:32.840> you're

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
little bit billow these out and you're
