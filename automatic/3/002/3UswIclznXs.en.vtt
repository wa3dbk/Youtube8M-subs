 not in vain they were property of housing 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:16.869
 According to a study carried out by archaeologists working in a jungle 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.300
 African tropical 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.300
 macri against my belief that the chimpanzees of west africa 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.609
 when using stone tools to crack nuts from before arrival 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:26.970
 of agriculture 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.939
 thousands of years ago 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.280
 the scientists found hammers and stone tumbes dating back to 4 thousand 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.590
 300 years in excavations carried out in three different places in the park 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:40.350
 National Cannon on Ivory Coast 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.260
 the tools to crush food or open need are too large 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.260
 so that many humans use with ease 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.430
 has been found in them recent movie of varieties of nuts 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.430
 that constitute the staple food of those Indians 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.610
 the region where these instruments were discovered was not practically 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.880
 inhabited by man in those prehistoric times 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.920
 but it is believed that he could be a common ancestor while he lived the use of these 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.010
 tools the same human chimpanzees studied 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.410
 htc 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.270
 it had already been observed for the first time in the 19th century that chimpanzees 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.399
 they used stone tools 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.119
 as we see them in the picture in gestation in the thays park 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.650
 thanks to this new archaeological discovery the use of tools by 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.270
 part of chimpanzees has been delivered thousands of years back in time 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.130
 the authors argue the use of this type of tools could have been 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.820
 originated 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.390
 with our common ancestor 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.570
 instead of having emerged independently of the hominids 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.860
 and the chimpanzees 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.200
 four birds of imitation of humans 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.200
 for its part 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.509
 this work confirms chimpanzees and human ancestors 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.050
 shared over thousands of years several cultural attributes that 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.509
 was once believed to be ex 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:05.850
 musicians of humanity 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.139
 including the transport of raw materials 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.159
 the selection 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.500
 and curing the raw wounds for a specific type of work 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.690
 and for a political use the usual reuse of places where 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.000
 garbage and debris accumulates and the use of locally available resources 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:22.229
 in the pacers 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:25.510
 the behavior of breaking molds is transmitted socially 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.010
 the new discoveries presented show this behavior has been 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.919
 transmitted over many generations 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.459
 chimpanzee prehistory has its very deep roots
