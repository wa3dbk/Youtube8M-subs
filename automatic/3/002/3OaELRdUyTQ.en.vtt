00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
the design of the phone may look

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.610 
the design of the phone may look
familiar<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.719> uses<00:00:13.049> essentially<00:00:13.500> the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
familiar to you it uses essentially the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.810 
familiar to you it uses essentially the
same<00:00:13.830> body<00:00:14.400> shape<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.710> components<00:00:16.710> as<00:00:16.859> the

same body shape and components as the
previous<00:00:18.630> iPhone<00:00:19.170> 4s<00:00:19.670> but<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.390> build<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.840> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
previous iPhone 4s but the build of the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.290 
previous iPhone 4s but the build of the
phone<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.320> completely<00:00:22.710> new<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.310> fact<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.789> spoke

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
phone is completely new in fact I spoke

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.779 
phone is completely new in fact I spoke
to<00:00:24.449> Phil<00:00:24.630> Schiller<00:00:24.840> at<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.830> launch<00:00:26.340> event<00:00:26.550> for

to Phil Schiller at the launch event for

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.730 
to Phil Schiller at the launch event for
the<00:00:26.939> phone<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.390> he<00:00:27.539> told<00:00:27.750> me<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:27.960> while<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
the phone and he told me that while the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.919 
the phone and he told me that while the
design<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.189> an<00:00:29.279> iteration<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.570> previous

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
design is an iteration of the previous

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.600 
design is an iteration of the previous
version<00:00:31.289> it's<00:00:31.500> kind<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.949> built<00:00:32.340> from<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
version it's kind of built from the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.270 
version it's kind of built from the
ground<00:00:32.880> up<00:00:33.090> with<00:00:33.329> new<00:00:34.020> processes<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.980> new

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
ground up with new processes and new

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.720 
ground up with new processes and new
materials<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.559> you<00:00:37.559> know<00:00:37.680> new<00:00:37.829> funky<00:00:38.250> style

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
materials and you know new funky style

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.000 
materials and you know new funky style
and<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.840> phone<00:00:39.989> does<00:00:40.260> look<00:00:40.530> different<00:00:40.739> when

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
and the phone does look different when

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.650 
and the phone does look different when
you<00:00:41.100> get<00:00:41.219> up<00:00:41.340> close<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.610> personal<00:00:42.360> with<00:00:42.450> it

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
you get up close and personal with it

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.020 
you get up close and personal with it
it's<00:00:43.290> got<00:00:43.440> these<00:00:43.559> edges<00:00:44.460> these<00:00:44.579> mirrored

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
it's got these edges these mirrored

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.580 
it's got these edges these mirrored
edges<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.480> are<00:00:45.539> really<00:00:45.809> beautiful<00:00:46.170> looking

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
edges that are really beautiful looking

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.190 
edges that are really beautiful looking
it's<00:00:47.550> thinner<00:00:47.940> it's<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.719> little<00:00:48.899> bit<00:00:49.020> taller

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
it's thinner it's a little bit taller

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.799 
it's thinner it's a little bit taller
because<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:49.770> got<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> bigger<00:00:50.129> screen<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.809> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
because it's got a bigger screen and and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.569 
because it's got a bigger screen and and
it<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.050> using<00:00:52.379> some<00:00:52.559> new<00:00:52.680> materials<00:00:53.250> there's

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
it is using some new materials there's

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.170 
it is using some new materials there's
glass<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.149> but<00:00:54.390> you've<00:00:54.510> also<00:00:54.660> got<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.260> new

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
glass on it but you've also got this new

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.430 
glass on it but you've also got this new
aluminum<00:00:57.180> back<00:00:57.390> which<00:00:57.750> feels<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.140> lot<00:00:58.260> better

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
aluminum back which feels a lot better

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.069 
aluminum back which feels a lot better
in<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.219> hand<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.449> presumably<00:01:00.780> is

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
in the hand and that presumably is

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.479 
in the hand and that presumably is
harder<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.530> break<00:01:01.770> than<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:02.070> piece<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.370> glass

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
harder to break than a piece of glass

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.850 
harder to break than a piece of glass
the<00:01:03.120> phone<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.480> also<00:01:03.809> lighter<00:01:04.320> than<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the phone is also lighter than the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.260 
the phone is also lighter than the
previous<00:01:04.890> version<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.729> actually<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> lot

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
previous version it's actually a lot

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.149 
previous version it's actually a lot
lighter<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:07.140> first<00:01:07.320> time<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.530> picked<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.860> up<00:01:07.950> I

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
lighter the first time I picked it up I

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.469 
lighter the first time I picked it up I
almost<00:01:08.490> dropped<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.060> because<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.360> was

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
almost dropped it because I was

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.050 
almost dropped it because I was
expecting<00:01:10.020> more<00:01:10.200> heft<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:11.010> feels<00:01:11.580> smaller

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
expecting more heft it feels smaller

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.179 
expecting more heft it feels smaller
it's<00:01:12.570> thinner<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.530> overall<00:01:13.890> feels

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
it's thinner but it overall feels

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.380 
it's thinner but it overall feels
smaller<00:01:14.490> even<00:01:14.729> though<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.119> little<00:01:15.240> bit

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
smaller even though it's a little bit

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.690 
smaller even though it's a little bit
taller<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.320> width<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.710> exactly<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.280> same<00:01:17.520> as

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
taller the width is exactly the same as

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.200 
taller the width is exactly the same as
the<00:01:17.850> iPhone<00:01:17.880> 4s<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.750> iPhone<00:01:19.140> 4<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:20.210> typing

the iPhone 4s and the iPhone 4 so typing
on<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.570> won't<00:01:21.720> seem<00:01:22.020> weird<00:01:22.590> or<00:01:22.799> awkward<00:01:22.830> for

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
on it won't seem weird or awkward for

Apple<00:01:24.720> has<00:01:24.840> moved<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> location<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.799> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
Apple has moved the location of the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.530 
Apple has moved the location of the
headphone<00:01:26.189> jack<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> bottom<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
headphone jack to the bottom of the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.990 
headphone jack to the bottom of the
phone<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.650> sits<00:01:28.829> next<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.820> new

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
phone and it sits next to the new

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.640 
phone and it sits next to the new
lightning<00:01:30.299> dock<00:01:30.659> connector<00:01:31.110> which<00:01:31.320> replaces

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
lightning dock connector which replaces

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.950 
lightning dock connector which replaces
the<00:01:31.950> 30-pin<00:01:32.369> port<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.210> was<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.509> every

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
the 30-pin port that was on every

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.230 
the 30-pin port that was on every
previous<00:01:34.320> version<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> iPhone<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:36.060> main

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
previous version of the iPhone the main

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.179 
previous version of the iPhone the main
reason<00:01:36.509> for<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.710> takes<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:38.040> less

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
reason for this is that it takes up less

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.280 
reason for this is that it takes up less
space<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.850> much<00:01:39.060> much<00:01:39.270> smaller<00:01:39.479> jack<00:01:40.049> in

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
space it's a much much smaller jack in

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.810 
space it's a much much smaller jack in
fact<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.680> about<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.100> size<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.490> micro<00:01:41.790> USB
