00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
reason to not have this on it just gives

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.830 
reason to not have this on it just gives
you<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.550> lot<00:01:49.820> more<00:01:49.850> options<00:01:50.030> when<00:01:50.540> making<00:01:50.720> your

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
you a lot more options when making your

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.310
