 already carla veloso companies during the strike 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.960
 that my project is the virtual environment 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:16.090
 the site we perceive within the classroom that these students they have an access 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.869
 very large and technology 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.359
 your computer 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.009
 and a reality that we had here did not know how to do research in 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.759
 internet first brazilian site 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:26.739
 copied 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.319
 they talked about how millions 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:34.329
 This partnership of the virtual environment with the science department of the 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.410
 computing 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.080
 where they created a very bad environment and I went and inserting the contents of 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.010
 geography 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.040
 is a tool with miami where students make think 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.380
 both of the post on your lap 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.920
 is a continuation of the aln we hoped was a minor 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.590
 for him 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.620
 your first 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.440
 you need to make trusted sites available to three students who can use 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.550
 second stage you make a selection of the best texts and then make the 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.840
 posting within the environment and there are 16 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.520
 can be searching forums 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.070
 days and times of the slots and it really becomes a chat more 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.090
 about campus 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.390
 many students worked at home I answered the exercises and then 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.840
 people comment on what has been worked on 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.610
 in the virtual environment the healthy brand or it is stop 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.980
 This Saturday's Brasilia 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.040
 the new tool 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.040
 then we work for example conflicts end 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.630
 it does not look like years 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.650
 within the same theme 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.050
 the thing that sometimes in the classroom we would be limited 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.050
 to what the book would give us 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.300
 They are handsome boys. 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.039
 let the coalition come here 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.620
 of a student has access to what is placed by wef 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.760
 then a network of knowing 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.920
 this to them was an achievement they saw that they were contaminated 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:18.200
 has become civilian and federal said about the bangu the second house to klm in the 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:22.119
 lot will have an old graphic news day they saw it inside the computer 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:24.009
 there are other tools 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.759
 Who can think of them the party knows 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:29.569
 formerly the value that refers to the escape play 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.670
 in a post and chat in that time the genoa had paper much later because of 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.479
 lack of oxygenation the contracontrast contrast they will learn 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:41.209
 how to search 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.790
 let's see if a news item that is swept is correct 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.059
 they will learn how to use it in beijing 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:50.629
 and they can do quality jobs today
