00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.529
 people i am bottle comes to mine 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.779
 money vossloh jumping kassel guide zur 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.160
 saber-rattling books all important ones 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.740
 As always you will find information in 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.139
 the video description same rassler 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.240
 Buch is located in the northeast of the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.000
 map gander rand fields that's it 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.039
 area directly above LÃ¶wenstein goes here 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.769
 at my position the next point away 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:27.599
 For example, here is the cornucopia 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.189
 fields you just follow the cliff up 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.750
 here at my position here you have to 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.730
 swim through the water and could 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.440
 here at this position again 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.890
 solid land from where we start 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.010
 become 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.899
 to prepare for this jumping 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.570
 I really only recommend kassel enough 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.030
 offensive power or a second player 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.629
 if you are not too high 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.940
 You can have that jumping kassel relatively 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.649
 strong or relatively heavy there are the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.350
 opponents here are really strong and it 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.969
 many opponents are on the way and it has to be 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.329
 even be fought for this jumping 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.520
 Kassel therefore I recommend him several 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.090
 players at least two probably even with 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.439
 Level 80 will be here a few times 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.659
 I'm just now on 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.790
 refrain from showing you the fights 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.010
 just so that the video is shorter but 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.189
 I will always show you where fought 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.500
 Must be like this from here if you come back 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.159
 has solid ground under the feet it goes 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.860
 we go along the only possible way 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.180
 veteran wolves are already waiting here 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.700
 But you can easily contact them 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.390
 walk by and then it goes in here 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.070
 A secret cave with scales against the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.170
 but you have to fight but not me 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.600
 recommend is actually against 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.610
 to fight for that will be during 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.869
 you run that many right here 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.890
 then you in the same water 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.200
 will pursue 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.670
 Here you have to go into the water 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.380
 These minds over here in any case 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.110
 with enough of these heads 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.360
 because if that shouts you 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.700
 what you've just seen meets 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.140
 then it does a great deal of harm 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.540
 Here it goes up here is even 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.009
 also a veteran in the scala here 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.969
 you have to go with alternate spaces again 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.840
 turn it over 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.050
 that does not happen to you 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.390
 and then quickly up here and then 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.640
 you in the next area and then you go 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.200
 in principle, already going on with fighting 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.810
 here come directly several ghosts 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.519
 you defeat, you have the four 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.360
 Opponents who came here can defeat it 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.250
 go on 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.110
 they are relatively strong and they come 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.170
 also all four as soon as you are one of them 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.280
 attacks so beware and in the next 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.780
 we must now here this 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.519
 light torches 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.930
 they must all four at the same time 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.319
 burn the general time again 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.790
 so that a veteran opponent bond and the 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.470
 then we have to kill it so we can continue 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.150
 can 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.890
 I recommend everyone else here first 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.360
 kill spirits to make it easier 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.680
 they really do that to us 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.510
 live hard i will go for this now 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.680
 recommend it anyway 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.569
 I do it work 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.720
 The first thing you do is go over here 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.670
 to get ignited on this platform here 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.549
 the first torch is burning here now 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.500
 luckily in my case but it 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.660
 continues 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.310
 quickly past these opponents and 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:09.180
 then around here outside 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.290
 possible without falling heal 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.500
 maybe I should go in between 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.610
 also here on this wooden stake 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.950
 and up 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.560
 that's how we can go over here 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.830
 to the next platform to 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.150
 this torch so this torch will be on 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.560
 when it is time to go 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.569
 should the torch burn i have the 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.080
 wrong button pressed, of course, too 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.420
 always good 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.310
 and continue to make the next torch on 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.260
 and now only one is missing 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.489
 I hope the lower torch is 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.630
 now run in the time not return 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.970
 next one is still on 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.560
 and now quickly here to this question 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.330
 and apply them 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.920
 now the enemy types come here first 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.690
 set there spurs new degree 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.000
 Ghosts have to visit the world 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.380
 so the first guests are gone 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.530
 to defeat the veteran 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.989
 So on and against the veteran 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.959
 fight 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:01.709
 so the veteran defeated is likely to be the same 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:04.319
 so far we would have to be yes 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.530
 we see we notice an earthquake 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.900
 that means under water 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.200
 opened a way so we jump 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.820
 clean and now here is one here 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.079
 small cave before this was gone 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.880
 we could not stay there for a long time 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.269
 have here on underwater is here now 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.800
 also a hai who could follow you 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.300
 which should be a bit careful 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.729
 but you can also just before the 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.330
 swimming away follows this easily 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:33.720
 the only possible way around here 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.740
 again on the other side of the 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.780
 to come to water 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.820
 Briefly orient where we go 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.440
 wait again scale on you 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.620
 you can but as always actually 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.910
 just over and then it works now 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.470
 up here now here comes times but the 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.410
 last difficulties 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.390
 falling stone blocks it 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.920
 to avoid it is always 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.720
 pretty easy 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.970
 if you are a lonely circle 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.360
 just do an evasive role 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.460
 so you can dodge the rockfall 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.510
 and then it's just up here then 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.950
 we already have as good as 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.780
 managed the hardest thing behind us 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:11.370
 and then we find here next to a few 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:14.010
 ncc a pcs a moi lining sack the 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.750
 is not important here either 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.430
 really he can from emergencies but left 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.370
 us that make a lot easier here 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.290
 with the two us can eat some of it 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.980
 and a speedboat like that 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.270
 to make this claim here 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.940
 Then important here are about all these 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.190
 swamp as soon as we go to this box 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.080
 im the moors are attacking us 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.310
 usually all are around this box 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.480
 I do not know why the Vaud 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.950
 everyone is here but usually 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.230
 stand around this box 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.080
 Now here we take this bag and 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:46.050
 with arms change with change 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.330
 skills so the skill nonsense with the 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.980
 So the button under escape with 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.200
 Acting ecoflex we can take the bag 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.360
 then drop the moas automatically 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.830
 go to this bag and then have 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.510
 we have enough time to go here and 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.010
 this box would open otherwise us 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.169
 the moore that was also a veteran 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.760
 in fact, we attack immediately 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.570
 have to oppose a whole hordes mode here 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.310
 fight 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.410
 so we lured them away and 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.210
 you will get to go to the crate 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.280
 which is also the decision that we 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.660
 saber rattles have done book and 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.979
 I can dust off our reward 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.210
 have me with these words and we 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:17.210
 see us again the days ciao people
