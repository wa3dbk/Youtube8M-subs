00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 two whole next video here on the 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.629
 channel to the next episode of fifa 15 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.670
 team of the season prediction of 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.500
 Barclays premier li years are there with 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.969
 the second episode means we are 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.559
 in midfield and I have to 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.780
 honestly say that it may be that 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.740
 very difficult projects you are because of it 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.390
 There are so many good ones 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.529
 Midfielder in the Barclays 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.020
 Premier League There are many players 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.820
 you could say that his striker but 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.080
 more about that at first, but if so 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.420
 The love falls thumbs thumb up 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.769
 but a great support 1500 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.650
 likes are getting really horny one 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.210
 great support on your part for 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.100
 me that the only feedback really 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.899
 could create over 1500 then create 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.309
 Show me that I'm off that's all 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.840
 wonderful, of course, write yours 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.379
 opinion in the comments to the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.090
 gamblers 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.680
 who believes you can swim off season 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.879
 Come in who is your opinion 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.680
 wrong of my political and who 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.149
 he should write for everyone 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.710
 In case this is the exchange the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.129
 can have hinterland and I think 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.550
 times well that would be a good 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.110
 Exchange of opinion because you can 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.370
 be different opinion and straight in 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.239
 the premier league it is very difficult 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.260
 because a lot of good central 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.949
 midfielder or left 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.449
 midfielder rights 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.460
 midfielder is like me already 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.930
 mentioned captives with the central 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.510
 midfield and that with the defensive 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.580
 Variation as defensive not really 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.869
 defensive but come because three 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.240
 midfielders and indeed are there 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.030
 be bright the maria and santi cazorla 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.560
 these are my two risk variants 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.450
 yes there are a lot of players who 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.040
 there could be no worry on the bank 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.210
 even sitting still we'll get 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.130
 of course, even the lowest 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.900
 rating of the three casola with one 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.520
 very strong season is extremely important 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.689
 for hare if not even the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.460
 most important player last play 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.420
 that's why I could count myself 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.310
 Also imagine that the team muster 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.659
 but I would think it is not so 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.150
 really he z 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.040
 and thus my 90s rating a2 in form 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.960
 so far and he looks right 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.040
 strong set i did think i could 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.170
 choose him 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.090
 but there are other candidates di maria 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.500
 on the other side is my opinion 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.850
 After not being so strong the season 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.649
 but the statistic reads anyway 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.390
 relatively good and he has a team on the 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.979
 hunters are in degree of deformation in the beginning of the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.720
 year he is a bit too we 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.369
 the risk variant because a team on the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.380
 here at united manchester united 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.820
 is high and I also current 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.490
 possibly no other variant 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.700
 united and that's why he is 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.460
 in my opinion one 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.830
 Candidate who is not so popular 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.019
 but use it unpopular but it 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.959
 would be typical because it is one 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.040
 moneymaker 93 rating and accordingly 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.870
 That would not be so unlikely 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.700
 though maybe not quite true 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.750
 like other players I will give 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.660
 short list if I do not now 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.340
 But I was happy to do so 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.450
 is it I have omitted 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.910
 philippe coutinho 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.290
 yes that is not in it has only four gates 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.310
 four templates was when he was enormous 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.390
 important for the game 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.890
 you have to be a bit on the 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.940
 statistic eighth jordan henderson have 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.709
 I also left out 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.360
 that could be because he is mine 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.010
 opinion after possibly in the team of the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.900
 season mouse consistent enters data 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.220
 april does not get in shape that could 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.480
 For him a little bit the gate too 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.190
 to be this world 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.290
 I have an ecstatic Christian 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.730
 I'm not the same with him 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.579
 sure if that's the goal 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.810
 the performance of the first one is enough for 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.549
 I am a team of the season 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.900
 not so sure but could also 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.489
 be that he comes in for the maria 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.230
 or santi cazorla i have as well 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.120
 yannick blaser left the outside 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.040
 I also read in the relatively often 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.690
 projects have looked at the sun but 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.489
 the man has not played so blatantly yet 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.889
 as a team would have to be from these rows 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.359
 I have it outside to the new factory 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:13.269
 Who is left with me in the mouse 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.829
 consistent it is relatively difficult 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.000
 decisions as already said though 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.230
 that's the way the players are now 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.579
 We do not have spontaneous times 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.480
 have possibly omitted the pure 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.609
 could come 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.750
 It is very difficult as I said 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.190
 I decided to go here now but 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.720
 write me purely on it your opinion 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.370
 should any other I would have 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.690
 or you are the one here 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.150
 same opinion get now first 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.440
 to the wing players and there it is 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.900
 I have a hard time now 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.310
 decided once for david silva yet 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.230
 on the other side waterwalking side 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.870
 same on the same page for eden 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.519
 Both are very very strong david 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.380
 possibly the best players are white 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.000
 the seasonally at least apart from 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.920
 agüero now times the most constant in the 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.630
 Mittelfeld always there for a goal 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.150
 good and what as a midfielder 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.980
 still with many templates and it is that 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.170
 sorry has left most of the time 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.639
 that's why we played him midfield 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.410
 probably if then as a link 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.269
 midfielder will get cities 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.019
 currently second or third I am 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.000
 not sure 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.430
 definitely not at the top 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.989
 I'm never really 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.280
 sure if any team on this 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.169
 but it could be good though 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.420
 because he is as important as the game of 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:14.400
 city ​​he made five submissions eleven 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.810
 Gates 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.579
 that could be enough for midfielders 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.440
 is at least three masters more 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.759
 and two more gates than 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.590
 for example, a christian eriksen and 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.850
 just because he plays at city so 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.770
 that could be high up 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.880
 His hair is on the other side 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.949
 exactly the same 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.810
 he too may be okay now 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.460
 actually as risky because he has he 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.039
 not in shape but its values 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.590
 he's simply bombastic he's twelve 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.479
 gates templates 31 plays he stands with 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.800
 chelsea at the very top of the table 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.690
 the first place and the perfect one 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.190
 rightly he is doing in every one 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.919
 he plays something almost in every game 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.930
 in vienna scorerpunkt and therefore it is 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.669
 relatively hard to kick it out 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.260
 and I think that 's on the 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.210
 left side is almost there already set 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.650
 still as david c the thing is me 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.000
 was happy as a central offensive 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.960
 but you want options 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.130
 probably will not happen 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.479
 and that's why we come to the 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.560
 both replacement players so the two 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.610
 Of course, see cards from tinkering 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.440
 you can keep 94 93 37 90 98 fit 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.639
 that would be super horny cool when he is in shape 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.930
 started at which would the values still 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.030
 pushes a bit but also so 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.380
 really strong and as I said 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.660
 we come to the replacement players too 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.639
 the substitutes are relatively difficult 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.620
 or one not so the other more 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.419
 I do not know where actually knows 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.160
 I can do this but that their pc software is 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.680
 but that the state has the higher rating 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.949
 first we come to nemanja matic and 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.389
 alexis sanchez nemanja matic with best 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:32.220
 Sixth of the league I almost want 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.960
 say the best sixth touré leaves 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.940
 Slowly a bit after he gets older 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.900
 even if he is not up to date in his class 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.880
 is still a wonderful player 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.900
 bombastic player has during the 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.460
 africa-cups of course a bit 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.229
 was exposed because not available 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.729
 for human is that you have anyway 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.930
 in my eight goals made which yes 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:48.449
 not quite as strong as last season 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.669
 only one template is available for him 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.229
 and I could imagine that there 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.430
 a man marketing yes over what 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.409
 That is because the boy is defensive 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.940
 just an absolute grenade at 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.740
 Chelsea then come up with a completely different routine 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.479
 purely the play much better if matip 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.740
 doing is and then playing is saved 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.820
 the whole a bit disordered the 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.800
 have good central midfielder 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.300
 serve but can not replace 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.590
 as good as in my opinion after one 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.000
 the undervalued and best player 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.680
 not just the premier league 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.900
 but on the world and centrally one 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.729
 absolute weapon because he is huge 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.400
 The winner of the battles can still 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.870
 better play no machines that 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.639
 gate to the gate of the year of fifa 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.900
 counted has once wii channel in 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:23.099
 at that time still he has only two 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.300
 templates and a gate made this 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:26.039
 season but still he is mine 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.510
 opinion, relatively likely in the 

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:28.520
 team of the seas possibly with 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.470
 sometimes 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:35.040
 manufacturer sure who of the two is 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:36.720
 You also have to get both or something like that 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.820
 I hope that a topic has this value 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.410
 simply mega mega city ​​map very much 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.720
 would look very very cool and one 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.130
 or other side hare are always 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.480
 Fourth at the end of the summer see if they 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.340
 that's exactly how they will be 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.770
 many injured gave or meanwhile 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.210
 no hurt i think it was anymore 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.430
 critical at the beginning of the season 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.470
 By now they are relatively high up 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.480
 I do not have to go there just after grad 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.580
 Definitely where you stand in any case 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.950
 as sanchez 14 goals and eight submissions 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.300
 that is very impressive 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.920
 former left winger the third 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.180
 in this topic it was just times were 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.590
 yes, I do not know why and how the 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.420
 left wing player goes but played 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.550
 mostly left therefore also left side 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.290
 hunt lawn is second now 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.390
 city ​​through the defeat against united 

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.370
 even slipped on rank four 

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.350
 yes I can well imagine that one 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:22.500
 Zimmerchen comes in as I said you 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:24.660
 probably the best variant of the trade yet 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.400
 times more likely and the card people 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:29.720
 rather how much do you ask for that? 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:33.870
 would be abnormal 390 shooting 390 tempo 95 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.190
 86 yes yes that would be just us 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.330
 will see what happens write yours 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.410
 Opinion in the comments write me 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.790
 what a player in your opinion 

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.840
 missing or necessarily pure 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.650
 I would definitely have to 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.940
 interest 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.200
 and see you next time 

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.460
 episode again then it goes to the 

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.430
 strikers I'm still beautiful 

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.560
 day until next time were nevertheless times 

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.090
 around here 

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.310
 people people until next time 

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:55.490
 skin clean the thumbs up and 

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.490
 watch
