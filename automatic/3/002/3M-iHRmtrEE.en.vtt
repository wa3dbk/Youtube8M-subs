software<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.379> think<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.989> think

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
software so I think it's the I think

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.420 
software so I think it's the I think
it's<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> combination<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.890> sieve<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.070> OBS

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
it's the combination of a sieve and OBS

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.069 
it's the combination of a sieve and OBS
as<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:50.969> see<00:00:51.149> right<00:00:51.360> now<00:00:51.539> which<00:00:51.719> makes<00:00:51.960> it

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
as you can see right now which makes it

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.810 
as you can see right now which makes it
so<00:00:52.289> laggy<00:00:53.750> has<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.930> already<00:00:55.199> crashed<00:00:55.620> nope<00:00:56.579> not

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
so laggy has it already crashed nope not

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.000 
so laggy has it already crashed nope not
