on chia seeds and so I started

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.910 
on chia seeds and so I started

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
researching and how healthy they are and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.310 
researching and how healthy they are and
then<00:00:25.280> I<00:00:25.670> decided<00:00:26.480> well<00:00:26.690> I'm<00:00:26.840> gonna<00:00:26.960> go<00:00:27.140> online

and order some and then today I went to
Whole<00:00:29.780> Foods<00:00:29.810> and<00:00:30.590> thought<00:00:31.460> oh<00:00:31.730> this<00:00:32.449> is<00:00:32.509> about

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
Whole Foods and thought oh this is about

Whole Foods and thought oh this is about
a<00:00:34.360> pound<00:00:35.360> and<00:00:36.200> a<00:00:36.320> third<00:00:36.710> actually<00:00:37.520> of<00:00:37.820> chia

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
a pound and a third actually of chia

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.770 
a pound and a third actually of chia
seeds<00:00:38.690> these<00:00:39.110> are<00:00:39.260> organic<00:00:39.680> and<00:00:40.480> it<00:00:41.480> seemed

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
seeds these are organic and it seemed

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.300 
seeds these are organic and it seemed
like<00:00:41.810> most<00:00:42.410> of<00:00:42.680> them<00:00:42.829> are<00:00:43.690> they're<00:00:44.690> non-gmo

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 
like most of them are they're non-gmo

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.220 
like most of them are they're non-gmo
they're<00:00:46.310> all<00:00:46.989> good

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
they're all good

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.690 
they're all good
the<00:00:48.860> health<00:00:49.340> benefits<00:00:49.940> are<00:00:50.210> beyond<00:00:51.079> belief<00:00:52.010> I

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
the health benefits are beyond belief I

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.530 
the health benefits are beyond belief I
can't<00:00:53.630> even<00:00:53.780> it's<00:00:54.739> awesome<00:00:55.370> they<00:00:55.940> have<00:00:56.180> four

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
can't even it's awesome they have four

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.680 
can't even it's awesome they have four
times<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:57.140> calcium<00:00:57.410> they<00:00:58.070> have<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:59.030> omega-3s

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
times the calcium they have the omega-3s

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.690 
times the calcium they have the omega-3s
we<00:00:59.899> need<00:01:00.079> for<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.380> head<00:01:00.590> for<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:01.370> healthy

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
we need for the head for the healthy

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.459 
we need for the head for the healthy
heart<00:01:02.350> it's<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.590> most<00:01:04.239> naturally<00:01:05.469> derived

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:06.469 
heart it's the most naturally derived

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:10.029 
heart it's the most naturally derived
from<00:01:06.920> plants<00:01:07.600> it's<00:01:08.600> got<00:01:08.780> more<00:01:08.959> than<00:01:09.139> salmon<00:01:09.469> so

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
from plants it's got more than salmon so

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:14.620 
from plants it's got more than salmon so
I<00:01:10.880> know<00:01:11.359> we<00:01:12.139> have<00:01:12.289> a<00:01:12.319> hard<00:01:12.530> time<00:01:12.740> eating<00:01:13.630> fish

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
I know we have a hard time eating fish

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.230 
I know we have a hard time eating fish
once<00:01:15.619> or<00:01:15.770> twice<00:01:15.979> a<00:01:16.039> week<00:01:16.280> because<00:01:16.939> of<00:01:17.119> the

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
once or twice a week because of the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.639 
once or twice a week because of the
expense<00:01:17.719> and<00:01:17.899> it's<00:01:18.079> hard<00:01:18.289> to<00:01:18.409> find

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
expense and it's hard to find

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.219 
expense and it's hard to find
wild-caught<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:20.119> we're<00:01:20.270> not<00:01:20.420> on<00:01:20.600> a<00:01:20.630> you<00:01:21.139> know

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
wild-caught and we're not on a you know

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
we're not in a coastal city or so it's

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.379 
we're not in a coastal city or so it's
kind<00:01:24.499> of<00:01:24.560> tough<00:01:24.740> sometimes<00:01:25.009> but<00:01:25.459> that<00:01:26.149> being

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:26.389 
kind of tough sometimes but that being

said I'm going to show you what happens

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.260 
said I'm going to show you what happens
when<00:01:28.880> you<00:01:30.340> when<00:01:31.340> there<00:01:31.490> are<00:01:31.549> tons<00:01:31.849> of<00:01:32.090> fiber

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
when you when there are tons of fiber

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.089 
when you when there are tons of fiber
it's<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.779> health<00:01:36.020> benefits<00:01:36.560> it<00:01:36.740> will<00:01:36.889> lower

00:01:37.089 --> 00:01:37.099 
it's the health benefits it will lower

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:41.739 
it's the health benefits it will lower
your<00:01:39.189> risk<00:01:40.189> of<00:01:40.429> heart<00:01:40.639> attack<00:01:40.969> because<00:01:41.450> of<00:01:41.479> the

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
your risk of heart attack because of the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:48.459 
your risk of heart attack because of the
omega-3<00:01:42.469> and<00:01:43.569> also<00:01:44.799> your<00:01:45.849> blood<00:01:46.849> pressure<00:01:47.469> so

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
omega-3 and also your blood pressure so

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.620 
omega-3 and also your blood pressure so
if<00:01:48.679> your<00:01:48.829> hype<00:01:49.099> if<00:01:49.520> you've<00:01:49.700> got<00:01:49.849> hypertension

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
if your hype if you've got hypertension

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.679 
if your hype if you've got hypertension
or<00:01:51.079> something<00:01:51.529> like<00:01:51.649> that<00:01:52.179> it<00:01:53.179> helps<00:01:53.509> lower

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
or something like that it helps lower

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.449 
or something like that it helps lower
that<00:01:53.959> in<00:01:54.200> fact<00:01:54.409> if<00:01:54.560> you're<00:01:54.740> prone<00:01:55.039> to<00:01:55.279> low

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
that in fact if you're prone to low

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:56.830 
that in fact if you're prone to low
blood<00:01:55.729> pressure<00:01:56.029> you<00:01:56.240> would<00:01:56.329> want<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:56.719> be

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
blood pressure you would want to be

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.349 
blood pressure you would want to be
careful<00:01:57.609> the<00:01:58.609> other<00:01:58.729> thing<00:01:58.969> you<00:01:59.060> want<00:01:59.149> to<00:01:59.270> be

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
careful the other thing you want to be

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:01.629 
careful the other thing you want to be
careful<00:01:59.630> of<00:01:59.929> is<00:02:00.200> if<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:00.499> eat<00:02:00.709> these<00:02:00.919> I<00:02:01.310> mean

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:01.639 
careful of is if you eat these I mean

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:03.969 
careful of is if you eat these I mean
they<00:02:01.759> they<00:02:02.179> have<00:02:02.389> me<00:02:02.869> they<00:02:03.349> remind<00:02:03.709> me<00:02:03.799> of<00:02:03.859> a

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
they they have me they remind me of a

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.260 
they they have me they remind me of a
poppy<00:02:04.219> seed<00:02:04.369> but<00:02:04.700> they<00:02:04.759> don't<00:02:04.939> have<00:02:05.060> any

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
poppy seed but they don't have any

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.779 
poppy seed but they don't have any
flavor<00:02:05.919> so<00:02:06.919> if<00:02:07.549> you<00:02:07.939> eat<00:02:08.209> them<00:02:08.420> dry<00:02:08.750> they<00:02:09.789> are

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
flavor so if you eat them dry they are

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.640 
flavor so if you eat them dry they are
hydrophilic<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:11.900> they're<00:02:12.050> gonna<00:02:12.170> attract

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
hydrophilic so they're gonna attract

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.830 
hydrophilic so they're gonna attract
water<00:02:13.040> which<00:02:13.940> would<00:02:14.150> mean<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:14.780> could

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
water which would mean that you could

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.720 
water which would mean that you could
dehydrate

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
dehydrate

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.180 
dehydrate
you<00:02:16.000> don't<00:02:16.150> want<00:02:16.269> to<00:02:16.360> do<00:02:16.480> that<00:02:16.599> it<00:02:17.409> also<00:02:17.590> slows

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
you don't want to do that it also slows

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.130 
you don't want to do that it also slows
down<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.970> digestion<00:02:20.010> which<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:22.330> slower

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
down the digestion which a slower
