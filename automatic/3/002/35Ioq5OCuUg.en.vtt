for<00:05:10.800> a<00:05:11.039> while<00:05:11.250> and<00:05:11.490> then<00:05:11.909> it<00:05:12.030> hit<00:05:12.120> me<00:05:12.150> the

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
for a while and then it hit me the

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.689 
for a while and then it hit me the
solution<00:05:13.470> was<00:05:13.650> a<00:05:13.680> collapsible<00:05:14.159> bar<00:05:14.490> Mack

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 
solution was a collapsible bar Mack
