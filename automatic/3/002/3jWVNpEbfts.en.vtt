that have no clear answer yet

that have no clear answer yet
this<00:00:23.160> differs<00:00:23.609> from<00:00:23.640> theories<00:00:24.210> because

this differs from theories because

at this point
sardonyx<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.770> be<00:00:52.860> almost<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.160> anything<00:00:53.520> let's

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
sardonyx can be almost to anything let's

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.830 
sardonyx can be almost to anything let's
go<00:00:54.719> over<00:00:54.960> all<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.230> possibilities<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.840> start

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
go over all the possibilities to start

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.200 
go over all the possibilities to start
off<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.530> gym<00:00:58.739> sardonyx<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.550> most<00:00:59.789> commonly

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
off the gym sardonyx is most commonly

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.110 
off the gym sardonyx is most commonly
orange<00:01:00.629> with<00:01:00.750> white<00:01:00.780> bands<00:01:01.760> jasper<00:01:02.760> happens

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
orange with white bands jasper happens

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.119 
orange with white bands jasper happens
to<00:01:03.239> be<00:01:03.329> orange<00:01:03.719> which<00:01:04.080> leads<00:01:04.350> many<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.680> believe

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
to be orange which leads many to believe

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.460 
to be orange which leads many to believe
that<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.460> new<00:01:05.670> gym<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> fusion<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.900> jasper

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
that this new gym is a fusion of jasper

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.460 
that this new gym is a fusion of jasper
and<00:01:07.590> another<00:01:07.860> gym<00:01:08.570> many<00:01:09.570> speculate<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.320> to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
and another gym many speculate this to

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.320 
and another gym many speculate this to
be<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> fusion<00:01:11.010> with<00:01:11.040> peridot<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.150> reality

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
be a fusion with peridot but in reality

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.740 
be a fusion with peridot but in reality
this<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.110> unlikely<00:01:13.470> as<00:01:14.090> malachite<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.270> fusion

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
this is unlikely as malachite a fusion

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.350 
this is unlikely as malachite a fusion
of<00:01:15.869> Jasper<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.500> lapis<00:01:16.860> lazuli<00:01:17.090> seems<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.270> be

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
of Jasper and lapis lazuli seems to be

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.510 
of Jasper and lapis lazuli seems to be
losing<00:01:18.570> herself<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.409> she<00:01:19.950> might<00:01:20.159> become<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
losing herself and she might become a

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.640 
losing herself and she might become a
permanent<00:01:20.820> fusion

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
permanent fusion

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.830 
permanent fusion
however<00:01:22.650> peridot<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.729> sardonyx<00:01:24.299> are<00:01:24.509> both

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
however peridot and sardonyx are both

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.649 
however peridot and sardonyx are both
all<00:01:25.110> dispersed<00:01:25.560> zones<00:01:25.880> which<00:01:26.880> does<00:01:27.210> give<00:01:27.450> them

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
all dispersed zones which does give them

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.460 
all dispersed zones which does give them
a<00:01:27.810> slight<00:01:28.170> relation<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.890> one<00:01:29.040> another<00:01:30.470> another

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
a slight relation to one another another

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.260 
a slight relation to one another another
thing<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.770> sardonyx<00:01:32.430> could<00:01:32.610> be<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.180> a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
thing that sardonyx could be is a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.600 
thing that sardonyx could be is a
combination<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.229> pearl<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.890> garnet<00:01:35.280> which

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
combination of pearl and garnet which

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.760 
combination of pearl and garnet which
has<00:01:35.790> been<00:01:35.970> long-awaited<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:37.229> finally<00:01:37.619> see

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
has been long-awaited to finally see

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.350 
has been long-awaited to finally see
these<00:01:37.950> two<00:01:38.159> fuse<00:01:38.460> would<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.790> pretty<00:01:39.090> cool

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
these two fuse would be pretty cool

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.010 
these two fuse would be pretty cool
although<00:01:40.229> from<00:01:40.439> appearances<00:01:40.890> alone<00:01:42.020> sardonyx

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
although from appearances alone sardonyx

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.840 
although from appearances alone sardonyx
may<00:01:43.320> not<00:01:43.590> be<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.009> best<00:01:44.340> fit<00:01:44.820> for<00:01:45.180> these<00:01:45.299> two

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
may not be the best fit for these two

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.819 
may not be the best fit for these two
perhaps<00:01:47.850> sardonyx<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> forced<00:01:48.930> fusion<00:01:49.439> or

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
perhaps sardonyx is a forced fusion or

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.880 
perhaps sardonyx is a forced fusion or
clusters<00:01:50.430> created<00:01:51.000> by<00:01:51.090> peridot<00:01:51.590> this<00:01:52.590> seems

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
clusters created by peridot this seems

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.160 
clusters created by peridot this seems
like<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.130> huge<00:01:53.490> possibility<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:54.810> know<00:01:54.960> that

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
like a huge possibility as we know that

like a huge possibility as we know that
peridot<00:01:55.590> has<00:01:55.740> gotten<00:01:56.040> some<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.430> gem

carved<00:02:26.150> into<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.600> temple<00:02:26.930> but<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:27.980> would<00:02:28.070> be

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
carved into the temple but it would be

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.520 
carved into the temple but it would be
surprising<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:29.000> see<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:29.390> incredible<00:02:30.080> gem<00:02:30.290> so

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
surprising to see that incredible gem so

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.900 
surprising to see that incredible gem so
early<00:02:30.890> in<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.040> series<00:02:31.430> if<00:02:32.000> we<00:02:32.210> see<00:02:32.360> it<00:02:32.480> at<00:02:32.600> all

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
early in the series if we see it at all

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.730 
early in the series if we see it at all
there<00:02:34.910> was<00:02:35.000> also<00:02:35.270> that<00:02:35.420> Jim<00:02:35.810> seaman<00:02:36.260> sworn<00:02:36.620> to

there was also that Jim seaman sworn to
the<00:02:36.860> sword<00:02:37.100> a<00:02:37.220> few<00:02:37.400> times<00:02:37.610> which<00:02:38.300> looks<00:02:38.570> like

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
the sword a few times which looks like

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.230 
the sword a few times which looks like
Jasper<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.770> man<00:02:39.950> fact<00:02:40.310> be<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.580> different<00:02:41.060> Jim

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.260 
Jasper the man fact be a different Jim
that<00:02:41.450> will<00:02:41.570> be<00:02:41.660> significant<00:02:42.260> in<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.560> future

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
that will be significant in the future

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.080 
that will be significant in the future
this<00:02:44.270> one<00:02:44.540> does<00:02:44.780> not<00:02:44.930> seem<00:02:45.290> very<00:02:45.530> likely<00:02:46.090> but

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
this one does not seem very likely but

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.230 
this one does not seem very likely but
we<00:02:47.330> can't<00:02:47.570> count<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.990> out<00:02:48.080> just<00:02:48.380> yet

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
we can't count it out just yet

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.800 
we can't count it out just yet
and<00:02:50.950> finally<00:02:51.950> sardonyx<00:02:52.850> could<00:02:53.060> be<00:02:53.210> a<00:02:53.240> new<00:02:53.480> Jim

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
and finally sardonyx could be a new Jim

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.440 
and finally sardonyx could be a new Jim
this<00:02:54.470> is<00:02:54.620> entirely<00:02:55.070> possible<00:02:55.460> although<00:02:56.240> many

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
this is entirely possible although many

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.300 
this is entirely possible although many
people<00:02:56.900> would<00:02:56.990> prefer<00:02:57.110> if<00:02:57.530> sardonyx<00:02:58.100> was<00:02:58.280> a
