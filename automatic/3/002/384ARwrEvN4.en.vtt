00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.759
 the marine wave is scarce in the company of 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.010
 habitat and welcome to teach you how 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.380
 go the advances in the thriller ship 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.530
 It's good, thank you very much, especially 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.850
 first of all to all comments 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.860
 super nice that we have arrived is worth 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.210
 that's why this video is more than anything 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.980
 because the truth that I had not thought 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.529
 show you a video as soon as not, but 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.210
 well let's go, let's go and what 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.520
 showing 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.290
 you asked me I saw that such a good 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.850
 You can see how it's going 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.469
 little by little because cosmos has the 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.379
 problems with the pc and well then I'm 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.030
 throwing doing it alone so far 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.790
 that I'm putting block block and block 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.129
 It's driving me crazy because all this 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.379
 part is huge and filling it will cost 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.940
 quite work especially I'm 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.610
 focusing on finishing what is the 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.089
 External structure is worth and what comes 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.680
 being the biggest because it interests 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.149
 have it clear enough to see how 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.149
 we are doing the internal approach 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:10.119
 of future galleries and others and others 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.500
 things that we will add as you see 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.410
 good 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.730
 I'm more or less what I'm having 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.100
 because perhaps removing some ornament 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.140
 that I can think of is going to stay like this here 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.430
 I'm going to show you an area that taught us 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.200
 the route to reach it does not 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.110
 because we do not want it to be known we want 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.070
 maybe play a little with that kind of 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.800
 little things here would go a kitchen and more 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.450
 forward a gallery that good and 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.910
 We'll see to see where he can take us and 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.460
 this would be the room where I'm sure that 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.880
 the servers of the series so to what 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.740
 better hope you remember was the first 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.350
 room in which he signed in his amio but 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.030
 they entered the mansion when they entered 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.530
 with the doctor they came to a good room 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.110
 It would be that you have seen there 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.729
 back here would start galleries that 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.340
 I 'm already inventing a bit because 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.190
 good good in the series do not stop 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.050
 run many times and gallery gallery and 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.820
 we must make it somewhere 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.470
 from here is a bathroom 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.659
 who does not look at all like the truth 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.380
 to the bathroom where they shower me because 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:14.080
 with so much steam and so much history 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.730
 I appreciated very little or nothing as I was 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.560
 structured the bathroom 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.590
 here the bathroom you remember in the one that enters 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.540
 an invisible man good man that 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.480
 thing with a head that was that of 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.040
 tiger, well, there you have it, this is 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.730
 my particular version of what could 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.730
 have been that bathroom 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.510
 and from here we will go on to show you another 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.410
 of the rooms in the house that we have 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.600
 transformed into a library because 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.350
 this is still the mansion of a 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.380
 doctor or from a bit thrown away that 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.600
 open vain but 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.720
 who will have the right to study because if 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.580
 He is a doctor and do those things are this 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.980
 that way with the zombies then in water 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.590
 If you have to keep your books as 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.260
 we put a library in the library 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.150
 of access through here through this corridor to 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.460
 a main room that is the one 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.780
 Now let's get not what this is that 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.900
 you see around here this is an office 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:16.489
 little girl that we have put 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:19.490
 to the doctor and around here the fireplace 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:23.570
 central one walks 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:26.120
 to rest and have dreams with 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.920
 zombies and like any good room 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.740
 principal that prides itself well also 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.840
 has a bathroom of its own that does not exist that 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.590
 we are seeing now 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.989
 with a bathtub overlooking 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.129
 to the rest of the boat and a shower that 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.519
 works 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.370
 It's worth it, well, this is what 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.580
 we have 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.670
 in the room that we're not going to 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.170
 charge a lot more because there is not no me 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.690
 they like the spaces excessively 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.950
 charged and now I'm going to show you a 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.549
 little thing that I think has not been 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:04.239
 appreciated in the rest of the videos and it's 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:07.030
 the amplitude of the internal cavity 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.349
 of the mast is worth this we are going to have 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.530
 that fill clear is not going to stay 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:14.620
 well because this is a soda it's worth and I do not 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.160
 like to leave things like that, but 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.989
 As you can see, it is very broad and I trust 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.660
 in which my imagination does not fail me to the 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.900
 time to fill it and this is what 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.080
 we have until now done the 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:33.030
 thriller I hope you like it and 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.030
 until the next video guys
