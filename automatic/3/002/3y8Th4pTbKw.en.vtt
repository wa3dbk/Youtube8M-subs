00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
actually kind of sunk in

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.870 
actually kind of sunk in
I<00:02:53.690> really<00:02:54.690> believe<00:02:55.050> in<00:02:55.550> showing<00:02:56.550> up<00:02:56.700> for

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
I really believe in showing up for

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.420 
I really believe in showing up for
yourself<00:02:57.270> and<00:02:57.450> carving<00:02:57.900> out<00:02:58.050> time<00:02:58.290> for<00:02:59.250> your

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
yourself and carving out time for your

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.940 
yourself and carving out time for your
fitness<00:02:59.790> routine<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.450> not<00:03:01.170> letting<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:01.770> be

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
fitness routine and not letting that be

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.260 
fitness routine and not letting that be
the<00:03:02.070> first<00:03:02.250> thing<00:03:02.430> on<00:03:02.610> your<00:03:02.790> schedule<00:03:03.030> that

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
the first thing on your schedule that

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.450 
the first thing on your schedule that
you<00:03:03.570> wipeout<00:03:04.020> because<00:03:04.710> if<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:04.980> don't<00:03:05.160> show<00:03:05.430> up

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
you wipeout because if you don't show up

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.520 
you wipeout because if you don't show up
for<00:03:05.820> yourself<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:06.540> don't<00:03:06.810> take<00:03:07.200> care<00:03:07.260> of

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
for yourself and you don't take care of

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.300 
for yourself and you don't take care of
yourself<00:03:07.740> then<00:03:08.580> it's<00:03:09.360> really<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:10.250> sounds<00:03:11.250> a

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
yourself then it's really it sounds a

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.070 
yourself then it's really it sounds a
little<00:03:11.520> cliche<00:03:11.970> but<00:03:12.030> if<00:03:12.270> you<00:03:12.390> don't<00:03:12.600> take<00:03:12.840> care

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
little cliche but if you don't take care

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.720 
little cliche but if you don't take care
of<00:03:13.110> yourself<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.530> can't<00:03:14.040> take<00:03:14.310> care<00:03:14.460> of<00:03:14.580> other

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
of yourself you can't take care of other

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.790 
of yourself you can't take care of other
people<00:03:15.120> properly<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.780> when<00:03:16.500> you're<00:03:16.650> not

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
people properly and when you're not

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.350

connecting to your health a lot builds
up<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:22.080> last<00:03:22.320> tip<00:03:22.740> is<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.220> would<00:03:23.400> be<00:03:23.520> very

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
up the last tip is that I would be very

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.510 
up the last tip is that I would be very
careful<00:03:24.120> about<00:03:24.870> reading<00:03:25.860> or<00:03:26.370> getting

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
careful about reading or getting

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.910 
careful about reading or getting
information<00:03:27.390> about<00:03:27.810> if<00:03:27.990> you<00:03:28.140> do<00:03:28.320> an<00:03:28.440> exercise

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
information about if you do an exercise

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.320 
information about if you do an exercise
for<00:03:29.160> this<00:03:29.310> amount<00:03:29.550> of<00:03:29.700> time<00:03:29.760> you're<00:03:30.270> gonna

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
for this amount of time you're gonna

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.390 
for this amount of time you're gonna
burn<00:03:30.630> this<00:03:30.960> amount<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.410> calories<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.040> then

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
burn this amount of calories and then

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.760 
burn this amount of calories and then
eating<00:03:32.820> against<00:03:33.240> that<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.960> truth<00:03:34.230> is<00:03:34.500> is<00:03:34.740> that

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
eating against that the truth is is that

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.160 
eating against that the truth is is that
we<00:03:34.980> all<00:03:35.190> burn<00:03:35.520> calories<00:03:35.760> differently<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:36.870> we

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
we all burn calories differently so we

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.140 
we all burn calories differently so we
could<00:03:37.830> all<00:03:37.950> be<00:03:38.190> doing<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.520> same<00:03:38.730> movements

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
could all be doing the same movements

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.610 
could all be doing the same movements
for<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.330> same<00:03:39.540> amount<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.810> time<00:03:40.020> and<00:03:40.260> the

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
for the same amount of time and the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.220 
for the same amount of time and the
amount<00:03:40.860> of<00:03:40.980> calories<00:03:41.360> spent<00:03:42.360> for<00:03:42.660> each<00:03:42.750> person

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
amount of calories spent for each person

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.590 
amount of calories spent for each person
will<00:03:43.350> be<00:03:43.470> drastically<00:03:44.160> different<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.850> proper

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
will be drastically different the proper

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.340 
will be drastically different the proper
approach<00:03:46.020> is<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:47.360> get<00:03:48.360> good<00:03:48.690> at<00:03:48.810> something

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
approach is to get good at something

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.790 
approach is to get good at something
let<00:03:49.950> your<00:03:50.190> endurance<00:03:50.850> build<00:03:51.270> let<00:03:52.020> the<00:03:52.200> time<00:03:52.500> of
