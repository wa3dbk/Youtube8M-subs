figures okay sculpting is good uh not
really<00:00:33.539> too<00:00:34.539> keen<00:00:34.780> on<00:00:34.839> the<00:00:35.170> paint<00:00:35.469> job

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:35.769

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
actually especially around the head but

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.669 
actually especially around the head but
overall<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.859> figure<00:00:48.159> is<00:00:48.309> nice<00:00:48.579> um<00:00:49.679> again

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:50.679 
overall the figure is nice um again

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.309 
overall the figure is nice um again
these<00:00:51.129> were<00:00:51.190> initially<00:00:51.820> produced<00:00:52.329> by<00:00:52.659> DC

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:53.319 
these were initially produced by DC

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.799 
these were initially produced by DC
direct<00:00:53.679> and<00:00:53.909> most<00:00:54.909> likely<00:00:55.030> these<00:00:55.480> were

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
direct and most likely these were

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.619 
direct and most likely these were
produced<00:00:56.499> by<00:00:56.679> DC<00:00:56.980> direct<00:00:57.370> sculpted<00:00:58.359> by<00:00:58.449> them

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
produced by DC direct sculpted by them

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.250 
produced by DC direct sculpted by them
and<00:00:58.870> all<00:00:59.019> that<00:00:59.199> but<00:00:59.940> since<00:01:00.940> they<00:01:01.809> didn't<00:01:02.050> meet

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
and all that but since they didn't meet

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.990 
and all that but since they didn't meet
their<00:01:04.740> their<00:01:05.740> deadline<00:01:06.160> of<00:01:06.520> when<00:01:06.550> these

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
their their deadline of when these

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.930 
their their deadline of when these
things<00:01:07.060> are<00:01:07.570> supposed<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:08.170> come<00:01:08.380> out<00:01:08.410> I

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
things are supposed to come out I

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.580 
things are supposed to come out I
believe<00:01:12.150> another<00:01:13.150> company<00:01:13.660> took<00:01:13.840> over<00:01:14.170> which

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
believe another company took over which

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.870 
believe another company took over which
is<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.800> big<00:01:15.370> fish<00:01:15.730> toys<00:01:16.210> so<00:01:19.770> that's<00:01:20.770> why<00:01:20.950> the

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
is a big fish toys so that's why the

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.260 
is a big fish toys so that's why the
sculpt<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:22.570> articulation<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:24.610> what<00:01:25.000> you

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
sculpt and articulation it's what you

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.880 
sculpt and articulation it's what you
would<00:01:25.870> expect<00:01:26.260> from<00:01:27.030> DC<00:01:28.030> Direct<00:01:28.360> because<00:01:28.890> they

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
would expect from DC Direct because they

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.240 
would expect from DC Direct because they
are<00:01:30.070> pretty<00:01:30.970> limited<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:32.860> far<00:01:33.130> as

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
are pretty limited as far as

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.750 
are pretty limited as far as
articulation<00:01:33.910> but<00:01:34.560> sculpting<00:01:35.560> it<00:01:35.710> is<00:01:35.860> really

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
articulation but sculpting it is really

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.200 
articulation but sculpting it is really
good<00:01:36.970> but<00:01:37.360> paint<00:01:37.990> job<00:01:38.230> it's<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:40.000> but

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
good but paint job it's and it's but

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.160 
good but paint job it's and it's but
it's<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:44.680> bit<00:01:44.950> bland<00:01:45.670> I<00:01:45.910> guess<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.780> paint<00:01:46.990> job

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
it's a bit bland I guess the paint job

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.540 
it's a bit bland I guess the paint job
wise<00:01:48.660> overall<00:01:49.660> the<00:01:49.780> vicar's<00:01:50.110> get<00:01:50.380> as<00:01:51.100> far<00:01:51.340> as

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
wise overall the vicar's get as far as

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.970 
wise overall the vicar's get as far as
this<00:01:51.810> articulation<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:53.200> head<00:01:53.560> is<00:01:53.710> on<00:01:53.860> a<00:01:53.890> ball

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
this articulation a head is on a ball

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.770 
this articulation a head is on a ball
joint<00:01:54.160> but<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:55.090> is<00:01:55.240> very<00:01:56.700> limited<00:01:57.780> so

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
joint but it is very limited so

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.940 
joint but it is very limited so
basically<00:01:59.230> you<00:01:59.350> can<00:01:59.500> only<00:01:59.650> do<00:01:59.890> swivel

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
basically you can only do swivel

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.590 
basically you can only do swivel
movement<00:02:02.950> for<00:02:03.430> his<00:02:03.550> head<00:02:03.760> and<00:02:04.030> then<00:02:04.300> the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
movement for his head and then the

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.870 
movement for his head and then the
shoulders<00:02:05.080> of<00:02:05.230> ball<00:02:05.440> hinge<00:02:05.710> and<00:02:06.520> then<00:02:06.730> the

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
shoulders of ball hinge and then the

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.130 
shoulders of ball hinge and then the
bicep<00:02:07.420> there's<00:02:07.870> a<00:02:07.960> swivel<00:02:08.879> hinge<00:02:09.879> elbows<00:02:10.390> in

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
bicep there's a swivel hinge elbows in

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.950 
bicep there's a swivel hinge elbows in
the<00:02:11.200> swivel<00:02:11.829> wrist

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
the swivel wrist

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.490 
the swivel wrist
and<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.950> waste<00:02:14.520> there<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> swivel<00:02:16.260> joint

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
and the waste there is a swivel joint

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.750 
and the waste there is a swivel joint
and<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.970> hips<00:02:18.210> are<00:02:18.480> swivel<00:02:20.570> knees<00:02:21.570> are<00:02:21.870> hinge

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
and the hips are swivel knees are hinge

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:31.070 
and the hips are swivel knees are hinge
