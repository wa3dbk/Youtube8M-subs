00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.080
 hi friends today we are going to talk to you about 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.380
 6 feeding systems 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.710
 uninterrupted on another previous occasion 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.690
 we already explained to you why 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.330
 they served and more or less how they worked 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.400
 today what we are going to see is one of them 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.970
 inside we're going to take it apart and we're going 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.840
 to proceed to change the batteries this 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.039
 operation can not be done or is not 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.710
 recommendable to do it in any type 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.300
 of low-end trials the truth is that 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.300
 It's not worth it because the cost of 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.860
 batteries and the time that we are going to lose 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.559
 with respect to what can be a sai 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.059
 new of similar characteristics make 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.160
 that this operation is not worth it 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.649
 however, you think a little more 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.020
 powerful when the battery runs out 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.969
 because all the batteries run out like 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.829
 those of our mobile phones or 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.840
 any other type of battery arrives a 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.470
 moment that with the use they arrive at 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.480
 exhaust and are not able to recharge 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.300
 then when the batteries are depleted 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.390
 what we can do to take advantage of 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.190
 rest of the device is to put some 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.510
 new batteries and with that we will have 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.700
 between 12 and 15 months more life for the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.770
 device below I'm going to leave you 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.890
 with our colleague and will 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.180
 proceed to dismantle the site and 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.180
 replace the batteries 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.800
 of the power that allows us is 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.230
 necessary good before anything else you have to 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.970
 keep in mind that to open a site 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.310
 we have to have certain knowledge 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.070
 previous because we have 220 inside 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.260
 volts is not like a pc that like many 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.900
 let's find 12 volts and well no 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.300
 it can be something too serious for 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.860
 we work in a sai if we take 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.110
 where we should not we can take a 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.530
 considerable and very dangerous discharge 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.330
 OK 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.190
 this site is a bit bigger 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.590
 of the masters in the standards return 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.030
 amps mounted in addition to some keys 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.119
 special to open a few screws 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.850
 but we need a set of thor keys 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.230
 to be able to open it 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.240
 well here you can clearly see the difference 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.850
 of the parts that make up in saint la 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.190
 circuit board the transformer and 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.220
 the batteries in this case what said this 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.930
 two batteries are mounted if it were more 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.460
 tiny one of 600 multi amps that 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.590
 would be the standard for any pc that 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.520
 we can have at home the normal thing is that 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.770
 take a good voucher then what is said 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.900
 if we want to venture to change the 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.690
 battery, we locate them, we take them out 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.220
 of course I repeat again to influence 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.600
 what the income from this operation 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.580
 we have to have a minimum 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.040
 knowledge is minimal enough 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.310
 knowledge so that there is no problem 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.800
 OK 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.530
 here we see that the two batteries are in 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.420
 series 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.940
 well we take out the batteries and we look 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.099
 to the characteristics then these in 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.580
 concrete are 12 volts per 7 with 2 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.130
 amps 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.750
 it's worth an important thing that we 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.430
 condition the characteristics and that 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.990
 say has that the size is not going to be 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.290
 that later we do not focus on our 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.290
 acts 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.140
 and then place them then if we look 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.769
 just as we have taken them out 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.849
 we have to be a positive pole to a 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.890
 of the batteries 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.080
 the other negative to the other battery and a 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.959
 bridge between the two to place them in 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.849
 would be and as has been commented before by 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.670
 true in this case then we bought 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.300
 these batteries and it would be just for 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.310
 replace one for another 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.830
 and I keep stressing that if you are not very 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.580
 sure of this operation because the ideal 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.580
 is that you do not do it 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.230
 I have seen that the operation is 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.840
 relatively simple but once again 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.690
 we are going to influence the danger that can 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.150
 involve manipulating a 6 inside if not 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:57.800
 we know exactly what it is that 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.750
 we are doing in fact is the fact 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.490
 that in order to open it you have to 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.670
 use a key of this this 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.230
 mayabe torch style that has a tip 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.190
 completely different from what I can 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.410
 be any our bander or key 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:16.370
 usual and usual virtual house is 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:19.090
 thought so that I can not do this 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.410
 opening and unscrewing operation 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.090
 anyone at any time but 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.090
 only those people who 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.950
 really intend to do it and 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.260
 have acquired and birds of this style 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.510
 otherwise, what you have said 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.790
 which is relatively simple but so 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.640
 as on other occasions we encourage you to 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.190
 that you do what we do 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.080
 this time we have simply 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.750
 taught this so you know him but 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.080
 in no case we encourage you to what 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.539
 you do it alone 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.569
 as in all the rest of the occasions 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:56.129
 we await your comments and we have 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:59.599
 open all our channels of 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.599
 communication thank you very much
