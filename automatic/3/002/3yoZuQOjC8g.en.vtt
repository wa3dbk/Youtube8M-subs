00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Concretely, once again, they are very much now 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.540
 very optimistic that we are the third 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:12.679
 rate why we are direct 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.599
 cassens in scotland from one 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:18.380
 local law firm of 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.359
 renowned representatives for the second 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.029
 The rangers already come in contact 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.740

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.480
 important personalities of glasgow 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.399
 Rangers and that's why I'm right 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.520
 optimistic that with the largest part 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.230
 the open sum will get it 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.020

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.760
 answer where is the money out there 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.190
 Michael almond asked this question 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.510
 transfers revenue europe league it 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.700
 always haunts so around 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.140
 where did the millions come from ? 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.680
 Perhaps you can also here times 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.020
 so be more concrete half first 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.309
 already stated but repeat that 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:05.670
 like to go back to the beginning 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.200
 everyone does it every budget 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.320
 not ensured full funding 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.909
 have and that we each additional 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.799
 income in the largest dimension of 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.310
 two to three million and need around 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.659
 what to balance 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.570
 the high conversion amounts and affects 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.530
 I'm actually the one for that 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.240
 Thank you very much for your cooperation 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.530
 actually accomplish 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.600
 so if in the media if 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.310
 one looks at the last few years 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.320
 sum, I believe already about 17 million 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.720
 always true in the media around 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.530
 that's just part of it, of course 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.299
 these amounts also in the club treasury 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.090
 flow and not because of that 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.890
 someone diverts something but because 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.259
 We have contractual obligations 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.360
 this is often true for a player 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.729
 contract extended if he guarantees 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.970
 that he's worth in case 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.190
 the transfers is involved 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.440
 this often applies to clubs of those 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.710
 you have a player purchased cheap 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.450
 but he continues to be committed 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.270
 then I'm involved in this 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.250
 transfer then release to commissions 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.410
 player agent so I notice 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.390
 can always be from those in the newspapers 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.000
 17 million are around again 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.150
 the club from 8 million net 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.640
 Remained in five years 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.410
 and that is part of this extra 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.330
 income we need to deal with 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.450
 balanced account to balance 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.450
 can
