00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.540 

I<00:01:58.020> kind<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.590> team<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.860> find<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.250> I'm<00:01:59.370> truly

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
I kind of team to find it I'm truly

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:15.390 
I kind of team to find it I'm truly
yeah

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.850 

so<00:02:16.400> I'll<00:02:16.610> just<00:02:16.760> quickly<00:02:16.910> sure<00:02:17.300> this<00:02:17.860> can't

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
so I'll just quickly sure this can't

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.440 
so I'll just quickly sure this can't
swim<00:02:19.069> under<00:02:19.310> water<00:02:19.340> without<00:02:19.760> drowning<00:02:19.819> I

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
swim under water without drowning I

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.180 
swim under water without drowning I
think<00:02:20.720> this<00:02:20.810> will<00:02:20.930> be<00:02:21.019> useful<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.860> don't<00:02:22.040> have
