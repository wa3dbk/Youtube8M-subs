00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
okay so a used PVC pipe for a buffer

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.200 
okay so a used PVC pipe for a buffer
vessel<00:01:16.179> to<00:01:16.750> put<00:01:16.960> in<00:01:17.079> the<00:01:17.200> waste<00:01:17.380> oil<00:01:17.619> and<00:01:18.520> I'm

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
vessel to put in the waste oil and I'm

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.190 
vessel to put in the waste oil and I'm
ingesting<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:20.020> oil<00:01:20.259> flow<00:01:20.700> with<00:01:21.700> an<00:01:22.060> old<00:01:22.420> gas

valve<00:01:23.950> from<00:01:24.460> an<00:01:24.610> old<00:01:24.759> gas<00:01:25.030> bottle<00:01:25.509> I<00:01:25.689> use<00:01:26.020> gas

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:26.319 
valve from an old gas bottle I use gas

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.230 
valve from an old gas bottle I use gas
bottles<00:01:26.770> all<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:26.979> time<00:01:27.189> so<00:01:27.459> why<00:01:27.640> not<00:01:27.789> use<00:01:28.030> that

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
bottles all the time so why not use that

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:35.580 
bottles all the time so why not use that
one<00:01:29.640> copper<00:01:30.640> line<00:01:32.130> into<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:35.020> rocket<00:01:35.350> stove

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
one copper line into the rocket stove

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.319 
one copper line into the rocket stove
heater<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.729> let's<00:01:39.939> see<00:01:40.119> that<00:01:40.149> again<00:01:42.209> so<00:01:43.209> you

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
heater and let's see that again so you

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:44.940 
heater and let's see that again so you
can<00:01:43.509> burn<00:01:43.689> a<00:01:43.720> really<00:01:44.319> long<00:01:44.500> time<00:01:44.770> without

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
can burn a really long time without

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.770 
can burn a really long time without
adjusting<00:01:45.880> anything<00:01:46.420> on<00:01:47.229> waste<00:01:47.709> oil<00:01:48.750> with<00:01:49.750> a

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
adjusting anything on waste oil with a

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.279 
adjusting anything on waste oil with a
drip<00:01:50.110> feeder<00:01:50.380> like<00:01:51.009> this<00:01:51.810> very<00:01:52.810> controlled

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
drip feeder like this very controlled

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.800 
drip feeder like this very controlled
