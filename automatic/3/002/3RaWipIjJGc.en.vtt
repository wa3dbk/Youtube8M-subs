00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.019
 dinner dark this service appeared in 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.179
 one of the metropolitan cafes a year ago 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.650
 this exotic dish is still only 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.080
 included in our diet 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.359
 because like any little exotic 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.029
 scares at first may not like it but 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.180
 the one who tried out is unlikely to forget and 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.670
 will definitely try to repeat it wildly 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.489
 a big surprise when you do not have to, and 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.350
 then they are a dark room so they 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.690
 do not understand what is happening 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.410
 here and then very pleased that 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.950
 got 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.739
 the dinner menu of the dark is also full of mysteries in 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.730
 there are no names of dishes or their ingredients 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.070
 so you have to choose a lot 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:54.090
 we offer it either a meat menu 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:58.020
 and is called red or fish blue 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.840
 either from the chef then the white bird 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.730
 it's yellow and the menu from the chef that is here 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.220
 nothing to say after here here we are 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.970
 call it a surprise act will calculate 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.850
 usually 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.640
 from the boss to take it because then 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.010
 In general, in full intrigue, they do not know what 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.020
 Well will not eat in the dark 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.610
 get a huge batch of bright 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.100
 impressions need a good 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.200
 enlighten dough learn remember 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.659
 the main thing is to follow the rules of conduct in 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.369
 dinner time at the entrance to 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.250
 the restaurant will take you mobile 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.890
 phones watches and other light sources 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.930
 after diving into the darkness will meet you 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.600
 waiter armed with a night gear 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.939
 visions that will follow your 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.159
 security during the meal because 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.619
 darkness you lose the sense of time and 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.060
 spaces and the person becomes extremely 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.860
 awkward spy cam 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.530
 naturally this happens because 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.390
 then all the same darkness and almost some 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.789
 movement in the side can still 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.039
 spread really break here but 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.229
 it happens extremely rarely and here 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.689
 waiter served pieces to me size 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.149
 the plates seem incredibly large and the food 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.920
 which to me is unusual in form and 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.050
 mysterious in content 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.179
 By the way, you probably have to eat 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.459
 hands only so you can appreciate 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.800
 the size of what you are going to eat and 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.400
 put an aromatic piece in your mouth with 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.040
 first try here so much experience 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.370
 that is, I feel that you take because 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.040
 what 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.190
 fork knife but no longer that experience that is 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.350
 felt the need to look not felt yet 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.630
 you bring the card is already empty plug 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.010
 may be 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.709
 sense of smell and taste buds 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.200
 darkness intensified several times and 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.599
 thanks to this taste familiar products 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.459
 revealed in a new way so ordinary 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.330
 potatoes may well seem 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.830
 unprecedented exotic sometimes even confused 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.870
 white with red wine 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.630
 Well, that is not often confused 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.269
 if not liquor tussocky people 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.670
 again may confuse let me 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.530
 cloudy orange apple orange 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.390
 that is, completely different still 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.390
 here is no visual 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.989
 analyzer and accordingly somehow else 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.269
 brugge 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.120
 after dinner which usually consists of 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.890
 main course and dessert appetizers 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.290
 gently brought to light 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.389
 By the way, not the interior of the hall is not a waiter 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.299
 who served you never see 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:21.609
 but find out what was on your plate 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.500
 show photos of your menu and detail 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.450
 tell about each ingredient 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.209
 so what about the quality of the products can not 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.310
 to worry and with pleasure 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.739
 digest everything that happened to you in 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.170
 the darkness is all there to touch 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.290
 there is something soft something warm something 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.330
 cold and sometimes even to taste 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.490
 there is well 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.710
 it's impossible to understand what it is you eat sometimes 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.140
 on the contrary, it is so interesting very tasty 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.390
 really tasty unexpected some taste 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.700
 and dinner darkness is not a pleasure 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.040
 cheap by the way its cost depends on 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.170
 number of people in the hall for a large 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.790
 companies such a dinner would be cheaper 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.740
 than just for two 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:04.830
 but the discovery that you are for sure 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.830
 do in the dark too cost dear
