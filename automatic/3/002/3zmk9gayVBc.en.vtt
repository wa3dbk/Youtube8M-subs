 your other devices in your home for 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:05.180
 carry out the order for example 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:08.180
 could you tell the ex to put 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.410
 any song and alexa immediately 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.420
 put the Ã¡lex song to add to the 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.170
 list of your market that you carry in your 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.920
 Milk table and alexa adds the 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.640
 milk to the market list or ask him 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.400
 the components of a cooking recipe 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.450
 Alex takes many eggs this recipe 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.600
 it tells you 3 eggs also works like 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.000
 speaker as an audio device with 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.930
 at the bottom it has a 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.979
 powerful speaker that echoes in the 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.710
 where he is willing and 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.259
 they say it has an optimal sound 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.810
 excellent the truth we have not tried it 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.910
 is for sale in amazon for those who 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.210
 they have an estimated 100 dollars for 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.310
 that we're 199 and basically it's a 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.250
 device the closest thing to that of stars 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.590
 star trek when the order was given 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.789
 protagonist to the computer and the 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.390
 computer did what he ordered 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.960
 same 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.790
 it's the same story the same concept 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.960
 then friends, I leave you some photos of 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.580
 what more or less would be the 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.050
 amazon eco in innovation because 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.150
 really the technology was also taken 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.150
