00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.580
 good I'm warcraft stimulus for 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.030
 explain how to get a helmet for 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.680
 transfigure are all of tier 2 - 1 that 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.780
 is from tier 1 to explain what they are 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.789
 each one of these helmets is that 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.590
 are obtained through an emission so 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.360
 they get yes or yes sure not 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.940
 we depend on the probability of killing 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.460
 one bots and the other good thing they have is 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.680
 that are not class for example are 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.869
 the cases of tier 2 destroyed and of 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.640
 rogues like the two are leather I with 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.199
 the druid can I catch the one who has 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.449
 aspect of tier 2 of rogues and 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:36.670
 transfigure - in the noise so could 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.620
 getting a helmet is not from me or 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.690
 transfigured to the cases that 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.760
 they get doing this mission I leave them 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.350
 all in the description in link to 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.570
 that you see it before putting them to do 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.070
 nothing so that if you like it or not and 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.590
 all ways in case you know them I'm going 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.160
 to say what is this fabric the helmet 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:57.370
 of tier 2 of leather wizard the helmets of 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.829
 druida tier 2 and rogue mesh is 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.550
 in shaman's tier 2 helmets and 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.829
 hunter and plate is the helmet of the 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.600
 tier 1 of warrior now but as I have 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:08.650
 said before as it does not require class just 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.260
 type of armor 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.720
 after figuring the warrior in both a 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.760
 paladin like in a horse the death 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.830
 as number what we want the missions 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.290
 are equal for horde and alliance only 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.990
 renames and the starting point 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.670
 remember before you start activating the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.410
 can see the missions of the low level in 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.540
 the minimap magnifying glass of the horde I'm going to 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.460
 explain who epc gives all three 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.470
 first missions and then I'll continue what 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.570
 I will explain everything with the alliance of all 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.950
 the missions are the same the only thing that 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.200
 change is that the first two change 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.030
 of place for order of alliance the site 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.690
 where they are caught for the horde starts to 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.450
 all all the chains in the is in 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.250
 I started being the chief apothecary 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.200
 hildegart in the shadow village moon in 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.600
 the same valley of moon shadow that is 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.820
 right there and start with the mission one of 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.680
 ghosts and for the alliance begins 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.390
 also in the moon shadow valley but 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.390
 the base of the alliance that is the bastion 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.670
 hammer is wild and starts with this 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.020
 I started that he's just the vigilante though 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.970
 goes around inside a bastion 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.160
 it is not in a fixed point like the other and 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.160
 will begin with the mission a ghost 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.110
 the base of the alliance is at this point 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.540
 and both to address and to alliance 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.879
 the first mission asks us to collect 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.590
 15 always burning ashes that are 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.450
 these little smoking craters that 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.400
 I'm picking up and now when we have 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.290
 all the ashes we will return to in 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.450
 I started that he gave us the mission and they will give us 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.069
 a new mission in which we will have to 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.349
 put on some glasses that have given us 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.150
 to do the mission that with them 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.040
 we will see some ghosts we have to 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.510
 kill twelve of them the ghosts 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.580
 are in our same base do not we 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.140
 we move or where they give us the mission and 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.510
 once the ghosts are killed we return 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.099
 to deliver the mission and they will give us the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.319
 first mission that is the same for order 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.049
 as for alliance called theron 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.819
 bloody tradition and legend undo us 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.799
 jce of the glasses because you are going to use it 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.349
 leave here to do all the 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.849
 good mission be four missions 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.709
 there is not much left either and as I said 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.940
 before here and for from here 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.010
 now and alliance is all the same 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.220
 exactly the same does not change neither place nor 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.950
 nothing to the mission of theron is delivered 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.450
 in the spirit of shadow central moon 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.250
 which is at the bottom to 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.830
 the right of shadow moon and this we 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.750
 will give three missions at a time each one of us 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.400
 will ask us to get an object for 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.620
 get this object we will have to 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.300
 put on the glasses that they had given us 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.550
 in the previous mission the layer was 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.670
 get killing ghosts on the outskirts 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.110
 of the dark temple with luck the best 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.660
 have to kill one that you have to kill 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.550
 10 but like all the missions it nails 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.110
 that is the weapon we will get it by killing 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.270
 riders who are going around 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.940
 the valley of moon shadow but always by 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.800
 the central way that if you look 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.840
 it's a ring and the armor the 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.760
 we will get killing a ghost dragon 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.350
 that flies very high on the reef of 'la 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.570
 abyssal that is under him all the right 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.520
 we will have to go look for it flying when 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.830
 we 'll see them we'll follow them and when 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.720
 put about some high mountain we 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.430
 we will put on the mountain ourselves and the 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.380
 we will attack to kill him once we have 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.870
 the three objects we will return to the spirit 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.370
 and will give us the last mission already in this 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.220
 mission we will have to kill an elite 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.330
 but being transformed and with other 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.250
 skills 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.920
 very easy to use the keko this 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.870
 we select the enemy we will get to 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.370
 melee and we will use once the 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.350
 ability of 1 to stay giving 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.940
 auto attacks and the rest of the 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.500
 skills we will use them whenever 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.410
 are available is already 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.610
 once dead we will be sent to the first pc 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.890
 with which we started 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.110
 at the beginning the truth its basis and the 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.270
 alliance yours and we can choose the 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.070
 helmet that we like most, remember the 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.780
 time to choose the helmet that you can only 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.850
 transfigure your same type of 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.890
 armor you use and return them to put 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.720
 your helmet that you will wear the glasses and 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:46.970
 I do not expect any helmet to like the 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.970
 video serve you and tomorrow more until tomorrow
