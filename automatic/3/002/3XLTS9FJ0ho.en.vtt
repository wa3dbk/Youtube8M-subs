00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
go a week without exercising if I met

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.800 
go a week without exercising if I met
somebody<00:02:34.010> who<00:02:34.280> is<00:02:34.700> who<00:02:35.120> told<00:02:35.390> me<00:02:35.510> that<00:02:35.689> they'd

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
somebody who is who told me that they'd

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.420 
somebody who is who told me that they'd
been<00:02:36.019> battling<00:02:36.469> with<00:02:36.620> weight<00:02:36.829> all<00:02:36.859> their<00:02:37.219> life

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
been battling with weight all their life

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.640 
been battling with weight all their life
or<00:02:37.459> for<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.849> long<00:02:38.000> period<00:02:38.269> of<00:02:38.510> time<00:02:38.569> I<00:02:39.140> would

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
or for a long period of time I would

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.470 
or for a long period of time I would
certainly<00:02:39.920> tell<00:02:40.189> them<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.609> it's<00:02:40.760> not

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
certainly tell them that it's not

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.330 
certainly tell them that it's not
actually<00:02:42.049> a<00:02:42.079> battle<00:02:42.560> if<00:02:42.769> you're<00:02:43.189> actually

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
actually a battle if you're actually

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.250 
actually a battle if you're actually
going<00:02:43.579> to<00:02:43.670> truly<00:02:44.060> lose<00:02:44.269> that<00:02:44.510> weight<00:02:44.719> forever

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
going to truly lose that weight forever

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.619 
going to truly lose that weight forever
then<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.400> becomes<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.030> easy<00:02:47.239> when<00:02:47.510> you

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
then it becomes so easy when you

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.960 
then it becomes so easy when you
identify<00:02:47.780> whatever<00:02:48.590> your<00:02:48.950> issue<00:02:49.280> or<00:02:49.579> issues

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
identify whatever your issue or issues

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.089 
identify whatever your issue or issues
are<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.269> created<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:50.870> weight<00:02:51.049> gain<00:02:51.799> in<00:02:52.069> the

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
are that created that weight gain in the

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.729 
are that created that weight gain in the
first<00:02:52.400> place<00:02:52.609> that<00:02:53.109> once<00:02:54.109> you<00:02:54.230> identify<00:02:54.349> that

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
first place that once you identify that

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.550 
first place that once you identify that
it's<00:02:55.159> just<00:02:55.459> so<00:02:56.120> easier<00:02:56.689> and<00:02:57.049> it's<00:02:57.349> such<00:02:57.530> a

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
it's just so easier and it's such a

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.069 
it's just so easier and it's such a
graceful<00:02:57.889> flow<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:58.849> it<00:02:59.000> will<00:02:59.150> just<00:02:59.389> happen<00:02:59.629> I

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
graceful flow and it will just happen I

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.740 
graceful flow and it will just happen I
don't<00:03:00.230> believe<00:03:01.099> now<00:03:01.939> that<00:03:01.969> anything<00:03:02.629> else

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
don't believe now that anything else

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.929 
don't believe now that anything else
works<00:03:03.170> there<00:03:03.620> aren't<00:03:04.010> any<00:03:04.129> other<00:03:04.340> methods<00:03:04.790> of

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
works there aren't any other methods of

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.729 
works there aren't any other methods of
calorie<00:03:05.299> counting<00:03:05.870> watching<00:03:06.409> food

calorie counting watching food

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.369 
calorie counting watching food
exercising<00:03:07.639> madly<00:03:08.269> it<00:03:08.480> simply<00:03:08.989> will<00:03:09.139> not<00:03:09.200> work

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
exercising madly it simply will not work

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.199 
exercising madly it simply will not work
long-term<00:03:10.269> you've<00:03:11.269> got<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:12.970> get<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.120> that

you down through that journey to

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.879 
you down through that journey to
identify<00:03:22.370> what<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.150> issues<00:03:23.510> are<00:03:23.689> and<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.709> work

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
identify what the issues are and to work

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:26.920 
identify what the issues are and to work
through<00:03:25.220> them<00:03:25.430> not<00:03:25.909> only<00:03:26.120> have<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:26.510> lost<00:03:26.540> the

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
through them not only have I lost the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.750 
through them not only have I lost the
weight<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:27.409> all<00:03:27.799> the<00:03:27.889> benefits<00:03:28.310> that<00:03:28.459> just

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
weight and all the benefits that just

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.000 
weight and all the benefits that just
come<00:03:28.939> with<00:03:29.090> that<00:03:29.269> anyway<00:03:29.720> but<00:03:30.650> how<00:03:30.829> it's

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
come with that anyway but how it's

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.009 
come with that anyway but how it's
changed<00:03:31.400> my<00:03:31.519> life<00:03:31.549> in<00:03:32.359> other<00:03:32.510> ways<00:03:32.689> that<00:03:32.989> I

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
changed my life in other ways that I

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.680 
changed my life in other ways that I
couldn't<00:03:33.650> even<00:03:33.980> have<00:03:34.189> ever<00:03:34.430> hoped<00:03:34.760> would

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
couldn't even have ever hoped would

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.599 
couldn't even have ever hoped would
happen<00:03:35.900> in<00:03:36.379> terms<00:03:36.919> of<00:03:37.040> especially<00:03:37.459> what's

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
happen in terms of especially what's

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.159 
happen in terms of especially what's
happened<00:03:37.940> to<00:03:38.060> me<00:03:38.180> in<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.419> last<00:03:38.449> six<00:03:38.959> months

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169 
happened to me in the last six months

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.170 
happened to me in the last six months
which<00:03:39.620> has<00:03:39.799> just<00:03:39.829> been<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:40.639> absolutely

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
which has just been so absolutely

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.839 
which has just been so absolutely
glorious<00:03:41.479> and<00:03:42.049> I<00:03:42.560> think<00:03:43.040> can<00:03:43.250> only<00:03:43.400> get<00:03:43.669> so

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
glorious and I think can only get so

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.000 
glorious and I think can only get so
much<00:03:44.000> better<00:03:44.359> again<00:03:45.199> then<00:03:45.409> probably<00:03:45.650> I<00:03:45.709> can

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
much better again then probably I can

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.920 
much better again then probably I can
even<00:03:46.129> imagine<00:03:46.400> at<00:03:46.669> this<00:03:46.699> point<00:03:47.150> when<00:03:47.900> i

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
even imagine at this point when i

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.330 
even imagine at this point when i
