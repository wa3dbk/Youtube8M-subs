00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.770
 in one of the latest issues with an example 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.440
 models and errors and 500 we convincingly 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.250
 proved that with a touch screen and 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.450
 mobile phone is not just a tribute to fashion 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.170
 go for similar controls 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.470
 its capabilities must be said 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.960
 opportunity modern 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.280
 There were quite a few devices for 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.110
 of this review we take two phones 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.420
 the same manufacturer Tajiks foreign cars and 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.720
 Tajiks and Asv 660 let's start in order 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.460
 drawn fully matched 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.300
 my wish cameraphone 8 more 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.780
 megapixel matrix in a mobile phone 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.469
 you will rarely see it often 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.890
 suggest that renoir in many 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.789
 sense will be much more convenient 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.030
 most household cameras and not only 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.510
 from size for example the device has a manual 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.069
 which focus is adjustable 

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:49.460
 literally one touch times and everything 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.739
 no complicated settings then photo 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.409
 can be processed into a slim editor 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.489
 images sure without touch screen 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.979
 this whole undertaking would hardly have had any 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.309
 the meaning of the buttons is even so simple 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:01.940
 the operation would be done and 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.220
 almost impossible and this is 2 7 4 kia 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.190
 from 660 unlike many others 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.020
 similar devices switch between 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.119
 Khimki on it can be literally pressing 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.469
 one key however in order to 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.180
 take a call with either of the two numbers 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.350
 switch don't have to go to 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.180
 Generally serious phone and serious 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.439
 people m already in an elegant concise 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.299
 the owner of this device 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.750
 will certainly appreciate the convenient interface 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.009
 embedded postal browser did not die 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.409
 phonebook here's the last one especially 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.049
 actually there are two sim cards it is almost 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.219
 probably double the number and 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.030
 personal data in which is short-lived and 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.890
 lost now users 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.590
 armed with a touchscreen it became 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.630
 much easier to navigate 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.770
 quite possibly already very soon males 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.350
 on the screen will be the same 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.649
 mobile phone standards like 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.350
 never became the peak of alcohol this company 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.439
 already as people are already offered 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.590
 bring on completely different devices 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.499
 equipped with a center of our displays
