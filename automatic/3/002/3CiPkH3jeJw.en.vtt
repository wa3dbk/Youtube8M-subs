00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
lot it's actually a lamination in the

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.740 
lot it's actually a lamination in the
center<00:01:39.250> of<00:01:39.310> two<00:01:39.490> pieces<00:01:39.820> of<00:01:39.850> plate<00:01:40.090> glass<00:01:40.120> okay

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
just breaks on the outside and it stops

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.440 
just breaks on the outside and it stops
