00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.049
 good two attached to a good new video 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.700
 announced the new model of 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:08.320
 a terabyte of play are four but 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.450
 well this is not everything more basically it 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.310
 have announced two models the first 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.410
 as I say it will have a terabyte as it already 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.810
 had already leaked at least almost 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.849
 a month or so we all think that it 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.070
 will see in the in the e3 but in the end not 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.670
 it was like that and well basically it will have a 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.720
 terabyte of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.520
 of capacity will come here in Spain or 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.460
 Europe on July 15 but in Spain 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.950
 also on July 15 and there is still no 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.360
 there are no prices that I have seen and others 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.129
 rumored that could cost about 449 euros 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.949
 or something like that been reading for 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.680
 some pages and others and good 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.970
 basically because then that will have a 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.340
 terabyte and little else 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.050
 then apart from that another one 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.330
 interesting good another one also very 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.059
 interesting apart from this one that is very 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:01.110
 recommended a terabyte is very like 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.210
 so I say important in a console 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.379
 this generation basically because it 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.820
 filled with all the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.340
 facilities that you have to get 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.210
 each installation is already at least 30 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.060
 gigas and so on and it 's ridiculous with 500 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.560
 gigabytes then hold it also 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.210
 has announced another another version the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.610
 standard version that I do not know when it 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.090
 will begin to market and regulate and 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.640
 usually but good the standard 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.780
 Well that will be 500 gigs but 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.680
 basically 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.080
 good we will have an 8% lower consumption and 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.150
 the console will be slightly lighter 10% 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.400
 lighter 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.050
 how to say it have improved the 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.120
 components have updated the 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.730
 components and as I say the consumption is 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.530
 minor and in the lightest consoles 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.690
 also he filtered that does already 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.750
 also a month with which can be 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.150
 no surprise 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.880
 in all this but good as I say then 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.600
 have finally announced it so good 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.520
 does not include anything else is simply that 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.130
 but good enough interesting for 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.490
 now it is lighter and with less 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.110
 Consumption and others is only in Japan 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.050
 here they will arrive I do not know when it will come we are going 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.660
 to see when they start to put it also 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.720
 between sales and all this so 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.050
 nothing guys like I say, that's a 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.730
 little bit more to see yes 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.040
 to see if they are doing bad things 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.240
 interesting and the guys we see each other in 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.240
 the next video until next time
