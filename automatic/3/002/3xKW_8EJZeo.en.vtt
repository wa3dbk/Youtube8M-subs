00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
it that was really weird of her don't

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.740 
it that was really weird of her don't
you<00:00:45.420> think

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
you think

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.170 
you think
and<00:00:45.930> she<00:00:46.320> made<00:00:46.500> her<00:00:46.649> neck<00:00:46.860> cake<00:00:49.760> but<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.879> taste

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
and she made her neck cake but I taste

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.680 
and she made her neck cake but I taste
it

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
it

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.090 
it
whoa<00:00:53.930> okay<00:00:55.010> jalisa<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.280> definitely<00:00:57.149> not<00:00:57.300> black

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
whoa okay jalisa is definitely not black

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.049 
whoa okay jalisa is definitely not black
so<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.129> would<00:00:59.520> say<00:00:59.910> probably<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.059> she's

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
so I would say probably this and she's

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.330 
so I would say probably this and she's
kind<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.449> tiny<00:01:03.780> person<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:05.840> know<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.080> song

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
kind of a tiny person so I know the song

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.000 
kind of a tiny person so I know the song
so<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.670> think<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.119> more<00:01:09.270> tiny<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:10.049> are<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
so I think the more tiny you are the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.830 
so I think the more tiny you are the
less<00:01:11.369> hair<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:13.070> we<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.220> use<00:01:14.430> this

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
less hair you have so we can use this

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.020 
less hair you have so we can use this
looks<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:16.049> Stella's<00:01:16.640> literally<00:01:17.640> not<00:01:17.820> very

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
looks like Stella's literally not very

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.240 
looks like Stella's literally not very
much<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.590> meant<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.979> be<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.340> guess

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
much but it's meant to be I guess

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.050 
much but it's meant to be I guess
and<00:01:22.340> she<00:01:22.820> like<00:01:23.000> she's<00:01:23.690> she's<00:01:24.650> not<00:01:25.010> very<00:01:25.790> in<00:01:25.970> a

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
and she like she's she's not very in a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.600 
and she like she's she's not very in a
good<00:01:26.270> mood<00:01:26.540> all<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:26.840> time<00:01:27.230> so<00:01:27.590> I'd<00:01:28.130> say<00:01:28.580> just

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
good mood all the time so I'd say just

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.130 
good mood all the time so I'd say just
that<00:01:29.210> so<00:01:29.630> if<00:01:29.870> it<00:01:30.170> really<00:01:30.440> can<00:01:30.710> describe<00:01:31.250> her

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
then she hates purple or pink so I'm

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.530 
then she hates purple or pink so I'm
saying<00:01:39.950> something<00:01:40.610> without<00:01:40.790> purple<00:01:41.420> or<00:01:41.510> pink

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
saying something without purple or pink

one well it's sort of high heels and she

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.030 
one well it's sort of high heels and she
can<00:02:34.450> have<00:02:34.690> this<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:37.080> he<00:02:38.080> doesn't<00:02:38.260> like<00:02:38.500> gloves

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040
