machines I have actually three of them

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.139 
machines I have actually three of them
and<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:41.309> one<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.000> test<00:00:42.839> pasta<00:00:43.500> machine<00:00:43.859> and

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
because it has the teflon rollers is the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.540 
because it has the teflon rollers is the
nonstick<00:00:48.839> rollers<00:00:49.530> right<00:00:49.949> through<00:00:50.309> here<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
nonstick rollers right through here and

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.739 
nonstick rollers right through here and
they're<00:00:53.550> hard<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.969> find

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:54.749 
they're hard to find

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:57.889

and<00:00:54.929> I<00:00:55.679> don't<00:00:55.739> know<00:00:56.010> if<00:00:56.159> AAMCO<00:00:56.699> still<00:00:57.329> has<00:00:57.570> them

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
and I don't know if AAMCO still has them

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.290 
and I don't know if AAMCO still has them
so<00:00:58.230> my<00:00:58.440> pasta<00:00:58.890> machine<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.730> my<00:01:00.059> good

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.510 
dig them out and you're careful because
if<00:02:41.490> you<00:02:41.550> scratch<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.950> part<00:02:43.950> here<00:02:44.280> your

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
if you scratch this part here your

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.850 
if you scratch this part here your
roller<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:45.810> might<00:02:46.050> as<00:02:46.170> well<00:02:46.260> just<00:02:46.470> go<00:02:46.650> out<00:02:46.830> and

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
roller you might as well just go out and

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.220 
roller you might as well just go out and
buy<00:02:47.370> because<00:02:47.730> particles<00:02:48.720> are<00:02:48.840> going<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.140> get

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
buy because particles are going to get

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.810 
buy because particles are going to get
in<00:02:49.350> there<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.800> your<00:02:49.920> pieces<00:02:50.130> are<00:02:50.430> not<00:02:50.610> going
