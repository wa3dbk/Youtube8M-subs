simple will be in terms of people

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.440 
simple will be in terms of people
putting<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.920> postcode<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:27.270> we'll

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
putting in a postcode and then we'll

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.960 
putting in a postcode and then we'll
pick<00:01:27.600> up<00:01:27.720> those<00:01:27.930> radio<00:01:28.829> stations<00:01:29.340> whose

pick up those radio stations whose

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.050 
pick up those radio stations whose
service<00:01:30.450> areas<00:01:30.869> sits<00:01:31.520> you<00:01:32.520> know<00:01:32.610> over<00:01:32.939> that

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
service areas sits you know over that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.050 
service areas sits you know over that
postcode<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.110> that's<00:01:34.290> how<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.470> would<00:01:34.680> work

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
postcode so that's how that would work

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.080 
postcode so that's how that would work
and<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.750> see<00:01:37.200> any<00:01:37.400> potential<00:01:38.400> conflicts<00:01:39.000> or

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
and you see any potential conflicts or

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.179 
and you see any potential conflicts or
difficulties<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.930> fat<00:01:40.140> man<00:01:40.290> BBC<00:01:40.860> will<00:01:41.070> be

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
difficulties of the fat man BBC will be

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.280 
difficulties of the fat man BBC will be
sitting<00:01:41.369> on<00:01:41.640> side<00:01:41.880> commercial<00:01:42.450> stations<00:01:42.899> no<00:01:43.259> I

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
sitting on side commercial stations no I

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.380 
sitting on side commercial stations no I
think<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.950> look<00:01:44.100> at<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> live<00:01:44.850> listening

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
think if you look at a live listening

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.060 
think if you look at a live listening
online<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:45.990> fairly<00:01:46.229> small<00:01:46.530> at<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.740> moment

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
online it's fairly small at the moment

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.100 
online it's fairly small at the moment
so<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.850> idea<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.890> UK<00:01:49.890> radio<00:01:50.329> has<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.659> bigger

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
so the idea that UK radio has a bigger

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.590 
so the idea that UK radio has a bigger
scale<00:01:52.470> proposition<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.759> world<00:01:53.939> online<00:01:54.210> I

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
scale proposition in the world online I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.660 
scale proposition in the world online I
think<00:01:54.780> everyone<00:01:55.110> will<00:01:55.200> benefit<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.710> mean<00:01:55.860> from

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
think everyone will benefit I mean from

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.160 
think everyone will benefit I mean from
a<00:01:56.790> BBC<00:01:57.060> point<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.420> view<00:01:57.509> are<00:01:57.570> only<00:01:57.719> about<00:01:57.869> two
