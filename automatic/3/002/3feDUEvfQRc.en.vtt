here it contains the media inside the

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:18.429 
here it contains the media inside the
filter<00:01:17.149> so<00:01:17.450> it<00:01:17.509> doesn't<00:01:17.750> go<00:01:17.840> floating<00:01:18.170> right

now<00:01:28.579> we're<00:01:28.850> going<00:01:28.939> to<00:01:29.000> take<00:01:29.270> dirty<00:01:29.570> pond<00:01:29.840> water

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
now we're going to take dirty pond water

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.109 
now we're going to take dirty pond water
we're<00:01:30.770> going<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:30.979> send<00:01:31.250> it<00:01:31.369> into<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:31.789> unit

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
we're going to send it into the unit

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.260 
we're going to send it into the unit
we're<00:01:32.630> going<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:32.840> inject<00:01:33.140> air<00:01:33.409> into<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:33.890> unit

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
we're going to inject air into the unit

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.730 
we're going to inject air into the unit
when<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.359> air<00:01:35.509> goes<00:01:35.749> in<00:01:35.960> there<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.439> floating

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
when the air goes in there the floating

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.739 
when the air goes in there the floating
media<00:01:37.130> comes<00:01:37.399> to<00:01:37.579> life<00:01:37.789> and<00:01:38.090> it<00:01:38.390> starts<00:01:38.630> to

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:38.749 
media comes to life and it starts to

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:41.469 
media comes to life and it starts to

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
tumble from top to bottom there's

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.639 
tumble from top to bottom there's
billions<00:01:41.869> of<00:01:42.170> beneficial<00:01:42.619> bacteria

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
billions of beneficial bacteria

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:46.999 
honey combs and as they're tumbling they

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:48.669 
honey combs and as they're tumbling they
have<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:47.240> opportunity<00:01:47.899> to<00:01:48.020> touch<00:01:48.200> that<00:01:48.439> water

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
have the opportunity to touch that water

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.950 
have the opportunity to touch that water
multiple<00:01:49.369> times<00:01:49.640> before<00:01:49.880> it<00:01:50.210> goes<00:01:50.329> back<00:01:50.600> into

so<00:01:52.130> that's<00:01:52.310> why<00:01:52.429> it's<00:01:52.579> so<00:01:52.700> efficient<00:01:53.090> at

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
so that's why it's so efficient at

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.789 
so that's why it's so efficient at

are produced by the fish waste now let

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.440 
are produced by the fish waste now let
