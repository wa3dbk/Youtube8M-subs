00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.560
 already owed him six tags and 6 sec 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.270
 instagram clones and valves for 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.500
 windows phone released well before 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.110
 official versions of these applications 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.540
 sharing photos and videos and 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.969
 well our french rudy developer 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.620
 wind just reoffend with 6 tablecloth 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.050
 it finally allows to use snapshot 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.280
 also on windows phone so for 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.050
 memory is to chat is an application 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.730
 sharing photos and videos 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.170
 ephemeral who once they've been 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.300
 seen by their recipients are 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.829
 automatically destroyed and a 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.230
 very popular application currently 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.359
 since it is not less than 350 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.739
 millions of synapses that are exchanged 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.570
 every day in the world 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.369
 so vocally besides that facebook has 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.560
 proposed to buy it back for 3 billion 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.119
 dollars and google for 4 that's 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.409
 for the little story then with six 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.790
 sna so you find all the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.229
 snapshot functions since it's a 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.710
 true copy paste application 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.390
 original 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.250
 so you can not only send 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.080
 ephemeral photos and videos at all 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.790

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.590
 on my story of recently added options 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.840

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.259
 visible contents for a duration of 24 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.210
 hours 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.909

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.799
 in passing thanks to dio xf who told me 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.970
 reported its release on twitter and for the 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.590
 download without further delay 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.900
 can scan the qr code that appears 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.430
 right now on the screen since we 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.540
 are we talking about photos I do not 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.040

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.540
 week the new hot social network 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.430

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.360
 selfs is the rooms that son you the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.100
 probably know it's these 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.970
 self-portraits of more or less good taste 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.399
 it must be said 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.200
 taken at arm's length with a smartphone 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.549
 a real phenomenon currently is good 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.560
 with sophie you will be able to 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.540
 have fun sharing yours with your 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.610
 friends not just those registered on 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.869
 shot of me since all your shots 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.420
 will be visible from a simple 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.380
 browser window at shot 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.120
 first slash your username 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.620
 for the rest use of things except 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.730
 looted can not be more classic 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.380
 besides the fact that you can take 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.820
 your stool currencies via the app 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.560
 to immediately put them online 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.390
 and add a comment you can 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.460
 also follow other users who 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.800
 they themselves can follow you and even 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.810
 exchange private messages with them to 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.060
 know finally overheating me you can 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.010
 to cross justin bieber the truth that comes 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.900
 to invest $ 1.1 billion in 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.340
 this new social network thing except 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.500
 mickey is a free application but 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.390
 available only on iphone for the 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.250
 pity this was a name that we 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.510
 was waiting for the game clown if ninja they 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.580
 were presented at the launch of 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.260
 the iphone 5 so it was necessary to wait 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.110
 5 is the fifth to see it 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.400
 finally appear on the app store but 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.990
 force is to note that it was worth 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.520
 still the shot because even if ninja 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.650
 is part of these games to taste of 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.180
 come back and never end 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.430
 in you take control of a 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.900
 very awkward ninja that you go 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.850
 have to train to make him a 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.900
 true warrior 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.970
 for that you have at your disposal 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.280
 different interactive objects trampoline 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.810
 basketball basketball hitting bag 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.160
 among others that allow him to 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.300
 gain experience and also 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.810
 money to buy new ones 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.360
 amenities 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.500
 the game includes 99 level that you 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.540
 will probably take a long time to 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.890
 complete because you will be forced to do 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.720
 breaks regularly each object 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.920
 having been used once 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.180
 then unavailable for a few 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.790
 dozens of minutes 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.290
 but so that you do not drop 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.790
 as if ninja will send you an alert 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.290
 on your smartphone as soon as it is ready 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.610
 to resume his workouts and then 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.110
 throughout the game you will discover 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.700
 new places meet new ones 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.709
 characters and unlock new ones 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.910
 objects so that we do not get tired 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.790
 really not this graphics game 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.500
 extremely neat finally to not 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.060
 spoil our pleasure that even if ninja 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.350
 is free but as I told you 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.270
 unfortunately only available 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.860
 on iphone you can go see it 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.480
 since today in theaters 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.740
 obscure this a future box record 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.480
 office in any case in the united states 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.850
 I obviously want to talk about 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.220
 second part of a guys games hunger 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.400
 games the embrace where we find 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.900
 Jennifer Lawrence 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.340
 the role of katniss everdeen who will 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.530
 having to take part in a game again 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.909
 futuristic reality TV or to win 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.560
 you have to ziggle in real life every 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.030
 other participants and such 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.229
 blockbuster would not really be a 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.459
 blockbuster if he did not go out with 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.019
 all its range of derivative products 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.220
 which here in this case a game for 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.810
 iphone and android 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.220
 so if you already know the young 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.449
 pale man rhÃ´ne where you have to run to 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.039
 infinity on platforms by tempting 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.080
 to escape from the hunger games monkeys 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.830
 catching fire panem run 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.449
 great principles 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.830
 except that they are no longer monkeys 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.630
 who are chasing you but a swarm of 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.470
 killer wasps that will catch you 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.690
 as soon as you have the misfortune of 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.160
 slow down your run a little bit 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.389
 you're going to have to defy fight 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.850
 your friends while riding through the 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.889
 post apocalyptic nation of panem jumps 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.419
 dodged destroy some obstacles while 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.860
 by recovering sparks and other 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.080
 materials that can be transformed 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.720
 as a bonus to improve your character 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.520
 here is a game catching fire panic room 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.440
 is part of these endless games very 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.000
 addictive that we do not get tired of and where 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.139
 in addition we can challenge other players 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.449
 online 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.680
 while you're a fan or not 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.090
 hunger games this game really deserves 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.590
 still the detour especially as it 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.479
 is free and then it changes anyway 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.740
 a little 2 tons a year you like the 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.990

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.150
 already there is an application 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.949

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.080
 a true global success i want to talk about 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.270
 e-djing because they dj is a 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.800
 a real virtual mixer that did not 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.510

 which is good with e-djing too 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.479
 that this app they do not reserve for 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.919
 only informed users and even if 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.300
