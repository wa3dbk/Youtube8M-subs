00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
 [Laughs] 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.870
 [Music] 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.730
 greetings to all readers of 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.740
 telefonino.net we are with the skin 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.429
 fifth of the LG that presents us the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.379
 new el series 3d lg is the series 3 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.210
 or the third generation of products 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.369
 suitable for a young audience that 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.320
 they want to have a distinctive design e 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.359
 of course an excellent quality ratio 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.420
 three products are still priced there 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.160
 you see here are the 40 l 70 and the 90 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.720
 so they are three products that they share 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.430
 the same design line and see between 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.469
 the other also very well looked after in the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.360
 entry level product where we find a 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.190
 silver profile and a processing 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.559
 particular on the back cover while instead 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.950
 l 90 is a little more refined and above all 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.270
 in the back cover it is smoother and more 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.250
 we say beautiful to touch 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.410
 regarding the features e 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.840
 40 and 70 of the 90 as all of them 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.610
 and of the series of products have 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.309
 increasing characteristics depending on the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.980
 number therefore l 40 we find a display 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.820
 3.5 inch processor inside 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.920
 it's dual core 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.129
 then we have the 3 megapixel camera 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.049
 and the 1540 milian battery for hours e 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.369
 the 70 instead always a dual processor 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.320
 but the display becomes core 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.020
 significantly larger because you see is 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.869
 a 4.5 inch technology naturally 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.340
 ips just like it is 40 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.909
 then we find a rear camera 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.850
 5 megapixel camera and a battery really 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.470
 very large and 2,100 hours for milian 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.790
 then we have the 90 which is going to grow 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.610
 further it becomes the top of the range 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.920
 of the l series and has a more display 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.750
 large and therefore 4.7 inches but 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.549
 especially a quad core processor a 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.740
 which makes this even more responsive 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.390
 to be indicated also for the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.540
 multitasking and then especially one 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.070
 2,540 miles per hour internal battery 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.600
 which will allow you to safely 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.280
 arrive until the end of the day 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.439
 these three products are all of them 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.659
 3g products and I share a large one 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.140
 novelty that is that of knock on and noc 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.090
 cod 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.530
 the neck you already know the no with and the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.509
 functionality that we introduced with 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.640
 g2 which allows you to press twice on 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.500
 display to turn it off or on and 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.840
 then 40 l see for example the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.469
 no function with the north what it is 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.610
 imagine that you need to 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.110
 touch the screen to 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.940
 and then after that you need to enter a 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.140
 pin or you have to type yours 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.810
 sequence to protect yours 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.400
 privacy well with tails made both 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.800
 things in one like this in an operation 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.670
 alone or when my screen is 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.680
 turned off 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.810
 that's when we turn off on the 70 I have 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.610
 set a sequence for which i don't 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.890
 just touch the display twice 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.570
 you see the display does not turn on but I have to 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.670
 enter my sequence of touches you can 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:38.590
 set from 2 to 8 cups in this case 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.850
 you set it 4 1 2 3 4 and he turns on the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.290
 display this is a feature 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.790
 particularly practical that unites 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.280
 precisely the convenience of entertainment 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.320
 of the function with safety 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.100
 of a code that precisely protects the 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.570
 our privacy 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.670
 after that as for the others 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.480
 functionality is found for example on l 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.930
 52 and sorry about l70 we find the la 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.850
 function plus slide 2.5 to work in 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.010
 multitasking for example by opening several 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.620
 windows in this case I opened the die 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.900
 aler but we can also open what I know 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.560
 the calendar or the messages we can 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.209
 then put the features in 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.670
 transparency in such a way as to 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.530
 use here what we gather the pope 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.630
 before Christmas to use what 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.900
 there is then the function plus slides 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.250
 for multitasking while the 90 is 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.170
 the most complete product from the point of 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.709
 view of the features naturally a 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.190
 the cuse never laughs even the quick 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.959
 remote 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.480
 here you see it whose three bikes is not 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.150
 other than the possibility of using 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.590
 the universal ray remote control 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.690
 infrared you see the door here 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.120
 infrared rays to control a TV 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.220
 or a blu ray player 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.320
 or a DVD player and then among others 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.630
 functionality obviously has the camera 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.910
 8 megapixel with sensor 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.459
 backlit that also functionality 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.799
 particulars like time and therefore 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.549
 40 and 70 and all 90 available 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:03.970
 and three by the end of March in Italy 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:06.130
 with white colors as you see 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.750
 here and black among other things there will also be 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.550
 an accessory called here then 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.650
 cover that is nothing but the cover that 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.930
 you have already seen on g2 that allows 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.790
 use the smartphone even when the 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.050
 cover is closed because it is a window 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.570
 window from which you can 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:23.170
 check the weather forecast 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:26.740
 or notifications or check again 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.690
 the ones that are the ones to start the 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.890
 audio player 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.810
 so this is all for what 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.500
 regards the novelties is the left from 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.500
