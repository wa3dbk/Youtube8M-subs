00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
calling a secret shop let's call it

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.599 
calling a secret shop let's call it
shelf<00:00:28.840> number<00:00:29.109> 15<00:00:29.439> I'm<00:00:29.710> going<00:00:29.920> to<00:00:29.980> use<00:00:30.130> three

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
shelf number 15 I'm going to use three

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.439 
shelf number 15 I'm going to use three
sets<00:00:30.970> of<00:00:31.029> numbers<00:00:31.300> so<00:00:32.019> if<00:00:32.260> I<00:00:32.349> was<00:00:32.470> to<00:00:32.559> say<00:00:33.449> 530

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
sets of numbers so if I was to say 530

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.119 
sets of numbers so if I was to say 530
then<00:00:34.780> I<00:00:34.870> would<00:00:34.989> go<00:00:35.110> to<00:00:35.140> shelf<00:00:35.470> five<00:00:35.710> which<00:00:36.040> is

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
then I would go to shelf five which is

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:37.890 
then I would go to shelf five which is
up<00:00:36.250> here<00:00:36.489> and<00:00:36.699> I<00:00:37.180> would<00:00:37.300> go<00:00:37.420> across<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:37.809> book

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
up here and I would go across the book

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.869 
up here and I would go across the book
30<00:00:38.170> I<00:00:38.500> would<00:00:38.680> take<00:00:38.949> it<00:00:39.040> off<00:00:39.129> the<00:00:39.190> shelf<00:00:39.220> and<00:00:39.610> I

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
30 I would take it off the shelf and I

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:41.130 
30 I would take it off the shelf and I
would<00:00:40.000> talk<00:00:40.150> to<00:00:40.210> you<00:00:40.360> about<00:00:40.449> it<00:00:40.750> I<00:00:40.899> will<00:00:40.989> then

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
would talk to you about it I will then

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.959 
would talk to you about it I will then
do<00:00:41.350> the<00:00:41.440> same<00:00:41.590> for<00:00:41.739> two<00:00:41.800> of<00:00:42.130> the<00:00:42.280> books<00:00:42.550> my

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
do the same for two of the books my

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:44.430 
do the same for two of the books my
theory<00:00:43.300> is<00:00:43.390> that<00:00:43.420> every<00:00:43.750> book<00:00:43.899> has<00:00:44.079> a<00:00:44.140> story

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
theory is that every book has a story

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.170 
theory is that every book has a story
where<00:00:44.739> you<00:00:44.890> bought<00:00:45.130> it<00:00:45.160> what<00:00:45.550> it<00:00:45.670> means<00:00:45.850> to<00:00:46.059> you

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
where you bought it what it means to you

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.639 
where you bought it what it means to you
and<00:00:46.390> of<00:00:46.540> course<00:00:46.750> whether<00:00:46.989> it<00:00:47.079> was<00:00:47.230> any<00:00:47.320> good<00:00:47.559> or

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
and of course whether it was any good or

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.500 
and of course whether it was any good or
not<00:00:47.680> once<00:00:48.160> its<00:00:48.340> game<00:00:48.460> is<00:00:48.550> over<00:00:48.670> I<00:00:48.940> would<00:00:49.210> love

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
not once its game is over I would love

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.360 
not once its game is over I would love
you<00:00:49.660> till<00:00:50.050> the<00:00:50.079> end<00:00:50.200> of<00:00:50.350> time<00:00:50.620> if<00:00:50.950> you<00:00:51.160> were<00:00:51.250> to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370

this<00:01:09.729> it's<00:01:09.880> actually<00:01:10.000> very<00:01:10.300> simple<00:01:10.509> so<00:01:10.720> let's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
this it's actually very simple so let's

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:19.580

I may have just remembered the only real

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.040 
I may have just remembered the only real
problem<00:03:53.030> we<00:03:53.240> have<00:03:53.360> here<00:03:53.540> is<00:03:53.630> that<00:03:53.660> I<00:03:53.840> can't

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
problem we have here is that I can't

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.870 
problem we have here is that I can't
remember<00:03:54.200> much<00:03:54.410> about<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.740> film<00:03:54.980> either<00:03:55.250> and

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
remember much about the film either and

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.250 
remember much about the film either and
even<00:03:56.210> better<00:03:56.360> I<00:03:56.600> can't<00:03:56.870> actually<00:03:57.050> remember

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
even better I can't actually remember

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.770 
even better I can't actually remember
how<00:03:57.980> I<00:03:58.010> came<00:03:58.370> upon<00:03:58.610> this<00:03:59.120> particular<00:03:59.270> book

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
how I came upon this particular book

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.720 
how I came upon this particular book
where<00:04:00.050> I<00:04:00.080> bought<00:04:00.290> it<00:04:00.500> from<00:04:00.620> what<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:01.280> story<00:04:01.550> is

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
where I bought it from what the story is

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:02.980 
where I bought it from what the story is
so<00:04:02.060> this<00:04:02.180> makes<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.480> whole<00:04:02.600> premise<00:04:02.810> of

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
so this makes the whole premise of

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.700 
so this makes the whole premise of
what's<00:04:03.740> on<00:04:03.920> my<00:04:04.040> shelf<00:04:04.310> pretty<00:04:05.270> much<00:04:05.710> pretty

what's on my shelf pretty much pretty

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.910 
what's on my shelf pretty much pretty
much<00:04:06.830> a<00:04:07.600> shambles<00:04:08.600> anyway<00:04:09.140> that's<00:04:09.350> it<00:04:09.500> it<00:04:09.740> can

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
much a shambles anyway that's it it can

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.350 
much a shambles anyway that's it it can
only<00:04:10.010> get<00:04:10.190> better<00:04:10.340> from<00:04:10.520> here<00:04:10.700> on<00:04:10.850> in<00:04:11.030> what<00:04:11.270> you

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
only get better from here on in what you

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.970 
only get better from here on in what you
need<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.600> do<00:04:11.720> now<00:04:11.930> if<00:04:12.200> you<00:04:12.440> really<00:04:12.710> don't<00:04:12.890> mind

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
need to do now if you really don't mind

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.640 
need to do now if you really don't mind
is<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.550> leave<00:04:13.700> two<00:04:13.910> numbers<00:04:14.240> in<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.650> comments

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
you go up to about 40 that should do it

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.360 
you go up to about 40 that should do it
and<00:04:24.260> of<00:04:24.440> course<00:04:24.650> if<00:04:24.830> you'd<00:04:25.010> like<00:04:25.040> to<00:04:25.250> play

I'd love to see those videos so let me
know<00:04:36.020> if<00:04:36.140> you<00:04:36.230> do<00:04:36.350> do<00:04:36.500> do<00:04:36.980> do<00:04:37.130> do<00:04:37.310> do<00:04:37.910> that

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.020 

I<00:04:40.200> just<00:04:40.530> realized<00:04:40.830> that<00:04:40.950> I<00:04:41.040> have<00:04:41.700> to<00:04:41.850> remember

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
I just realized that I have to remember

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.610 
I just realized that I have to remember
exactly<00:04:42.840> where<00:04:43.020> I<00:04:43.050> got<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.380> books<00:04:43.560> from

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
exactly where I got the books from

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.770 
exactly where I got the books from
otherwise<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.280> game<00:04:44.430> won't<00:04:44.610> work<00:04:44.880> long<00:04:45.750> term

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
otherwise the game won't work long term

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.930 
otherwise the game won't work long term
because<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:47.220> numbers<00:04:47.550> will<00:04:47.700> be<00:04:47.790> different

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
because the numbers will be different

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.730 
because the numbers will be different
