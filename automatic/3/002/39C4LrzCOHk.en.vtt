00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.260
 Battlefield 4 is finally here and us 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.450
 could equal the ps4 version 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.610
 Test stockholm and yes we have to say 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.160
 and really well done to the game 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.550
 just something the story of the campaign 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.050
 As for 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.050
 Michael is your own opinion 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:31.310
 So that's really a military shooter 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.500
 standard the chinese accuse the 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.520
 American one of the Chinese leaders 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.490
 to have shot 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.079
 and it comes to war and just like that 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.300
 The story actually remains clichÃ©d 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.800
 until the end but it has it 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.900
 playfully done a lot 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.180
 eg single player mode we are allowed now 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.550
 give us orders to the colleagues 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.560
 but it is very easy to do 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.360
 just an attack command and then 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.390
 try your own teammates that 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.800
 to make the best of it 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.090
 yes that works more or less well 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.230
 sometimes they just can not do it 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.810
 an opponent behind the cover 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.449
 usually they are shooting back 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.030
 at least as cover quite useful just 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.670
 The second nice one is one collecting points 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.369
 a campaign and gets a bronze 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.869
 badge and so on nice feature 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.310
 there are even new weapons on 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.289
 unlocked if you are a little better 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.179
 Yes, there is such a thing 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.909
 the feeling of the multiplayer first end 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:24.619
 The supplement does not like something good 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.270
 succeeded is the emotional 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.850
 moments the developers hamburg claims 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.920
 the game would be more emotional 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.710
 moments stuck and you can 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.020
 Count off these 10 and this one hand 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.359
 also not very moving so it is me 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.979
 when no tears ran down though 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.990
 All have become beautiful 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.729
 vehicle stories again and again 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.960
 it happens that we have a tank 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.350
 allowed to drive or with a speedboat 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.210
 like here the interest for beautiful 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.759
 variety and you also really fun 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.469
 but are quite simple yes 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.119
 So it really could be 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:58.310
 handy and rails say you have to get one 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.929
 Departure here and all opponents 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.880
 shoot under it but it does 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.940
 of course in battlefield money very much 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.800
 fun 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.110
 and nice is that now more 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.390
 freedom for you mission is like this 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.210
 penthouse teeth we are allowed in advance then 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.580
 I lay some mines and then 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.600
 attack the Chinese at once and 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.880
 then you have to just two 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.040
 attack waves through and through 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.800
 if you do not act very smartly 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.510
 that's pretty hard 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.340
 being difficult is such a keyword because 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.110
 The campaign is not too difficult 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.240
 at least not on the normal only 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.800
 light switzerland clearly no but there is 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.810
 yes still a third difficulty 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.000
 and there you are a bit 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.650
 I would challenge these people 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.240
 what more often play recommend yes 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.120
 otherwise is the singleplayer campaign 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.400
 after about five hours to the end and then 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.200
 is synonymous in the multiplayer and the 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.840
 multiplayer mode was already in the predecessor 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.940
 from the battlefield 3 grandiose and now 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.709
 you would have to invent a new word 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.780
 the whole thing is still there 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.320
 extensive even more beautiful 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.790
 There are new modes so I can 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.700
 not enough with the multiplayer 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.990
 mode of battlefield deal with what 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.600
 I also liked it 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.180
 this is especially true in stat maps 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.860
 on which you also get more free 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.230
 There are clearly more ways to shoot 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.239
 in battlefield 3 there was again 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.320
 house walls were there and could 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.570
 you do not shoot away 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.950
 This time you can usually and 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.769
 It is also positive that the consoles 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.959
 version speaks the nextgen consoles 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.650
 version now with the pc 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.810
 are 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.739
 that means we have 64 64 games 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.920
 conquest mode 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.590
 the cards are big and yes there are 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.930
 fish, of course, still differences 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.470
 to the pc version but it keeps itself in 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.330
 border 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.860
 of course we speak in the case too 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.220
 from pcs have the proper performance 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.350
 the best exactly and two new modes 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.489
 Hard once managed the fuse 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.350
 it does not play like counterstrike 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.989
 Actually that means if you too 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.390
 Once this is in this mode this is necessary 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.070
 you first watch and see what 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.090
 the other players do it like that 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.620
 there were only 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.940
 board again in the next round 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.410
 Basically, it's about being one 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.090
 So a bomb has to be put together by a team 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.250
 had to put bomb then stop 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.720
 defuse 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.349
 some may know as search and 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.019
 destroy in call of duty exactly the second 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.060
 new is operation and there is also 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.970
 again about a bomb but there is one 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.919
 bomb altogether so in the map and 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.800
 Both teams must first bomb this 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:27.020
 collect and experience it affects the 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.699
 first look very chaotic because of the 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.889
 action at a point just where the 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.530
 Bomb is currently taking place 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.540
 but after a few hours you are there 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.940
 fully in it and with this mode one has 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.770
 really fun between three and 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.139
 throw in between quick nomination power 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.240
 It is quite fun so accordingly 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.050
 i can only use battlefield 4 for the ps4 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.510
 Recommend 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.830
 in my opinion real reason 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.539
 to acquire the new console 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.100
 just because of the 64 players in the 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.250
 multiplayer mode around the sowing 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.270
 properly free graphics 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.340
 I was also very much of it 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.510
 convinced you hardly have to cut back on 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.289
 make the pc version 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.289
 very nice
