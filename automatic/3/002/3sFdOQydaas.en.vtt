00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 Hello from the knapsacks the best 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.309
 wishes come to me like this 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.540
 query if I can quickly and tasty 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.350
 make a dessert of products which 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.170
 I have at the moment in the house I 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.580
 without thinking twice, opened the fridge 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.670
 I opened a locker where I have stored 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.779
 all sorts of different cookies 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:31.320
 honey and and fruit basket in general what 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.989
 I found in my bins so 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.649
 let's say now we will prepare a little Lena 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.100
 from all this very delicious dessert 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.050
 it will be a fruit salad with 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.940
 currant liqueur 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:51.600
 banana strawberry blueberry fashion with propolis 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.789
 and that's such a waffle and so on one 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.000
 I cut a portion of dessert like this 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.710
 steep half slices of banana and 2 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.340
 large strawberries 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.670
 I laid out a container for dessert 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.280
 here's a waffle then okay I'll 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:16.650
 lay constantly alternating strawberries 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:20.640
 like this then bananas then 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.689
 again some strawberries then I will put 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.979
 a handful of blueberries 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:30.079
 then we go here again 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:35.250
 bananas 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:37.049
 Well, in general, the principle you understand so here 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.650
 looks like my cremon point 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.140
 with fruit salad here 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.140
 add of course another scoop of ice cream 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.229
 it is at your request 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:53.329
 then I add quite a bit where 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:57.270
 Is this probably a dessert spoon? 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:02:00.360
 currant liqueur and quite 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.670
 some honey with propolis 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.969
 Well, you can take any such 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.239
 which you love only he necessarily 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.860
 must be liquid well and the final touch 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:16.420
 this is such 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:20.820
 a cookie like it's called a cigar like this 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.540
 here we install all this we correct and 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.900
 our dessert 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.110

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.500

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.500
