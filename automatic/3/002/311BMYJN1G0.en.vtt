number three is pursuing wrong hands

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.440 
number three is pursuing wrong hands
honestly<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:07.890> never<00:01:08.220> done<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.420> I

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
honestly I have never done this so I

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.060 
honestly I have never done this so I
only<00:01:09.689> know<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.080> needle<00:01:10.350> goes<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.770> you

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
only know the needle goes here and you

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.060 
only know the needle goes here and you
adjust<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.580> here<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.180> there<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.650> sort<00:01:13.920> of

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
adjust it here and there is this sort of

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.030 
adjust it here and there is this sort of
system<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.580> between<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.650> looks<00:01:16.890> very

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
system in between and it looks very

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.830 
system in between and it looks very
complicated<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.180> no<00:01:18.330> idea<00:01:18.360> what's

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
complicated and I have no idea what's

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.039 
complicated and I have no idea what's
done<00:01:19.080> but<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.470> know<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:19.920> for<00:01:19.950> Rohan<00:01:21.049> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
done but I know it's for Rohan the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.170 
done but I know it's for Rohan the
second<00:01:22.439> one<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.890> fourth<00:01:23.220> one<00:01:24.590> is<00:01:26.180> an

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
second one the fourth one is an

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.020 
second one the fourth one is an
old-fashioned<00:01:28.170> one<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:28.619> zippers<00:01:28.979> as<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.820> see

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
old-fashioned one for zippers as you see

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.390 
old-fashioned one for zippers as you see
it<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.360> much<00:01:30.990> less<00:01:31.259> complicated<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.220> can

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
it is much less complicated and you can

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.160 
it is much less complicated and you can
just<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:32.970> one<00:01:33.180> side<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.720> here's<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
just have it on one side and here's the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.200 
just have it on one side and here's the
hole<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.860> can<00:01:34.950> only<00:01:35.220> super<00:01:35.850> from<00:01:36.060> this

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
hole so you can only super from this

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.140 
hole so you can only super from this
side<00:01:36.450> which<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.930> from<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.290> side<00:01:38.150> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
side which is it from this side the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.550 
side which is it from this side the
zipper<00:01:39.390> one<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.320> also<00:01:40.560> very<00:01:40.710> useful<00:01:41.189> for<00:01:41.490> suing

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
zipper one is also very useful for suing

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.859 
zipper one is also very useful for suing
hands<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.860> are<00:01:44.009> very<00:01:44.280> small<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.090> really

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
hands that are very small and you really

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.719 
hands that are very small and you really
have<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.140> be<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> border<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:49.500> fifth<00:01:50.340> one

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
have to be on the border the fifth one

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.859 
have to be on the border the fifth one
is<00:01:52.100> for<00:01:53.100> also<00:01:53.820> for<00:01:53.850> old<00:01:54.329> ends<00:01:55.219> and<00:01:56.540> it<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
is for also for old ends and it is a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.370 
is for also for old ends and it is a
much<00:01:58.380> less<00:01:58.680> complicated<00:01:59.250> one<00:02:00.079> although<00:02:01.079> I

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
much less complicated one although I

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.330 
much less complicated one although I
also<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.920> no<00:02:02.040> idea

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
also have no idea

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.589 
also have no idea
Elizabeth<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:05.180> sixth<00:02:06.180> one<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:07.250> for

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
Elizabeth the sixth one is for

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.360 
Elizabeth the sixth one is for
embroidering<00:02:09.599> by<00:02:09.840> Machine<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.190> where

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
embroidering by Machine this is where

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.610 
embroidering by Machine this is where
the<00:02:11.489> needle<00:02:11.610> goes<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.810> adjusted<00:02:13.260> on<00:02:13.379> this

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
