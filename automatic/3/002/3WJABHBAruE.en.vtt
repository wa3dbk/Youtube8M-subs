really like is do not handle with care I
am<00:01:32.460> bulletproof<00:01:33.499> and<00:01:34.499> here<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.219> base

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
am bulletproof and here is the base

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.190 
am bulletproof and here is the base
itself<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:36.329> have<00:01:36.600> your<00:01:36.630> piece<00:01:36.899> of<00:01:36.929> wood

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
itself you just have your piece of wood

elements but it comes like this and then

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.520 
elements but it comes like this and then
here<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.639> 2x4<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.450> tightened<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.049> with

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
here the 2x4 is just tightened in with

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.099 
here the 2x4 is just tightened in with
this<00:01:46.710> screw<00:01:47.039> you<00:01:47.999> can<00:01:48.149> tighten<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.600> down<00:01:48.659> to

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109 
this screw you can tighten this down to

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.989 
this screw you can tighten this down to
really<00:01:49.319> get<00:01:49.469> this<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.649> good<00:01:49.950> solid<00:01:50.280> system<00:01:50.639> but

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:50.999 
really get this a good solid system but

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:52.279 
really get this a good solid system but
the<00:01:51.060> good<00:01:51.179> thing<00:01:51.299> about<00:01:51.359> this<00:01:51.600> base<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.139> this

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
the good thing about this base is this

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:53.179 
the good thing about this base is this
not<00:01:52.469> going<00:01:52.799> anywhere

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
not going anywhere

one thing I want you to notice is that

one thing I want you to notice is that
trench<00:03:30.239> this<00:03:30.480> right<00:03:30.720> there<00:03:30.900> in<00:03:31.049> front<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.380> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
trench this right there in front of the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.009 
trench this right there in front of the
target<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:31.980> that<00:03:32.579> lead<00:03:32.850> is<00:03:33.180> going<00:03:33.569> somewhere

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
target and that lead is going somewhere

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.870 
target and that lead is going somewhere
and<00:03:34.290> with<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.650> angle<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.130> this<00:03:35.220> target<00:03:35.730> it

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
and with the angle of this target it

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.759 
and with the angle of this target it
goes<00:03:36.090> straight<00:03:36.239> down<00:03:36.630> now<00:03:37.079> I<00:03:37.140> am<00:03:37.319> on<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.500> slight

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
goes straight down now I am on a slight

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.370 
goes straight down now I am on a slight
incline<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.640> my<00:03:39.090> target<00:03:39.329> is<00:03:39.600> turning<00:03:39.989> just<00:03:40.230> a

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
incline so my target is turning just a

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.349 
incline so my target is turning just a
touch<00:03:40.620> so<00:03:40.950> what<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.250> might<00:03:41.400> end<00:03:41.489> up<00:03:41.579> doing<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:42.120> is

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
touch so what I might end up doing is is

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:43.729 
touch so what I might end up doing is is
digging<00:03:42.720> this<00:03:42.840> out<00:03:43.079> to<00:03:43.290> be<00:03:43.410> able<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.560> make<00:03:43.709> a

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
digging this out to be able to make a

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.009 
digging this out to be able to make a
very<00:03:44.010> level<00:03:44.400> spot<00:03:44.670> I'm<00:03:45.120> on<00:03:45.329> sort<00:03:45.569> of<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.720> slope

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
very level spot I'm on sort of a slope

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.569 
very level spot I'm on sort of a slope
here<00:03:46.049> so<00:03:46.650> I'm<00:03:46.709> getting<00:03:46.859> a<00:03:47.010> little<00:03:47.190> bit<00:03:47.430> of

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
here so I'm getting a little bit of

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.059 
here so I'm getting a little bit of
