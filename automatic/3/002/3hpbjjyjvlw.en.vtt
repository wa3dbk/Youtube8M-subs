00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:10.389 
okay guys I'm on that making the best

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.359 
okay guys I'm on that making the best
video<00:00:10.660> here<00:00:10.929> but<00:00:11.110> actually<00:00:11.889> this<00:00:12.160> is<00:00:12.340> really

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:12.369 
video here but actually this is really

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.789 
video here but actually this is really
high<00:00:12.699> up<00:00:12.730> right<00:00:13.029> now<00:00:13.410> but<00:00:14.410> there's<00:00:14.619> the

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799 
high up right now but there's the

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.370 
high up right now but there's the
harmonic<00:00:15.190> balancer<00:00:15.219> but<00:00:15.759> I<00:00:15.789> used<00:00:15.969> one<00:00:16.180> on<00:00:16.380> to

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
harmonic balancer but I used one on to

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.200 
harmonic balancer but I used one on to
pull<00:00:17.560> the<00:00:17.710> old<00:00:17.740> one<00:00:17.980> off<00:00:19.230> here<00:00:20.230> it<00:00:20.349> is<00:00:21.210> you

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
pull the old one off here it is you

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.480 
pull the old one off here it is you
gotta<00:00:22.360> use<00:00:22.570> a<00:00:22.599> polar

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:34.049 

Center<00:00:27.490> screw<00:00:27.759> I<00:00:31.050> have<00:00:32.050> over<00:00:32.290> here<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.820> again

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
Center screw I have over here so again

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.280 
Center screw I have over here so again
use<00:00:34.210> a<00:00:34.239> polar<00:00:34.769> these<00:00:35.769> slide<00:00:36.070> over<00:00:36.960> thread<00:00:37.960> into

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
use a polar these slide over thread into

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.040 
use a polar these slide over thread into
it<00:00:38.879> right<00:00:39.879> there<00:00:40.089> center<00:00:40.570> screw<00:00:40.719> goes<00:00:40.899> down

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
it right there center screw goes down

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.529 
it right there center screw goes down
and<00:00:41.199> pushes<00:00:41.469> against<00:00:41.680> the<00:00:41.739> crankshaft

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
and pushes against the crankshaft

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.970 
and pushes against the crankshaft
tighten<00:00:43.539> down<00:00:43.570> all<00:00:43.960> you'll<00:00:44.469> eventually<00:00:44.680> come

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
tighten down all you'll eventually come

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.619 
tighten down all you'll eventually come
off<00:00:45.300> um<00:00:47.670> explain<00:00:48.670> it<00:00:48.850> further<00:00:49.000> but<00:00:49.329> normally

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
off um explain it further but normally

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.650 
off um explain it further but normally
the<00:00:49.840> engine<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.879> crank<00:00:52.090> pulley<00:00:52.239> will<00:00:52.390> be<00:00:52.449> down

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
the engine the crank pulley will be down

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.029 
the engine the crank pulley will be down
you<00:00:52.870> can<00:00:52.989> get<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.170> two<00:00:53.260> bolts<00:00:53.469> above<00:00:53.800> right

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
you can get the two bolts above right

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.080 
you can get the two bolts above right
here<00:00:54.309> where<00:00:54.640> this<00:00:54.760> AC<00:00:54.969> line<00:00:55.300> is<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:56.530> put<00:00:56.739> that

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
here where this AC line is to put that

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.360 
here where this AC line is to put that
back<00:00:58.090> in<00:00:58.269> this<00:00:58.359> home<00:00:58.539> AC<00:00:59.440> line<00:00:59.769> isn't<00:00:59.980> one<00:01:00.190> down

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
back in this home AC line isn't one down

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.359 
back in this home AC line isn't one down
here<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:00.820> reason<00:01:00.940> it<00:01:01.149> is<00:01:01.239> jacked<00:01:01.510> up<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:05.369> I

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
here the reason it is jacked up is I

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:07.560 
here the reason it is jacked up is I
have<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.520> wood<00:01:06.670> block<00:01:06.789> under<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.179> engine<00:01:07.300> right

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
have a wood block under the engine right

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.700 
have a wood block under the engine right
now<00:01:08.190> so<00:01:09.190> once<00:01:09.340> you<00:01:09.780> use<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.929> 50ml<00:01:11.380> bolt<00:01:11.590> and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
now so once you use the 50ml bolt and

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.680 
now so once you use the 50ml bolt and
put<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.860> new<00:01:12.009> crank<00:01:12.250> pulley<00:01:12.459> on<00:01:12.690> recommend

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
put the new crank pulley on recommend

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.859 
put the new crank pulley on recommend
replacing<00:01:14.289> the<00:01:14.619> serpentine<00:01:15.099> belt<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.840> you

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
replacing the serpentine belt so you

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.960 
replacing the serpentine belt so you
actually<00:01:17.050> need<00:01:17.229> to<00:01:17.349> do<00:01:17.440> is<00:01:17.700> jack<00:01:18.700> up<00:01:18.849> the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
actually need to do is jack up the

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.270 
actually need to do is jack up the
engine<00:01:19.830> as<00:01:20.830> you<00:01:21.009> see<00:01:21.250> in<00:01:21.729> here<00:01:22.090> you<00:01:22.300> to<00:01:22.479> remove

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
engine as you see in here you to remove

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.190 
engine as you see in here you to remove
it<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.429> motor<00:01:24.610> mount<00:01:24.849> out<00:01:25.209> of<00:01:25.599> the<00:01:25.660> way<00:01:25.840> so<00:01:26.140> you

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
it the motor mount out of the way so you

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.169 
it the motor mount out of the way so you
can<00:01:26.289> if<00:01:26.380> you<00:01:26.470> slide<00:01:26.739> the<00:01:26.860> belt<00:01:27.090> through<00:01:28.090> this

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
can if you slide the belt through this

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:29.249 
can if you slide the belt through this
otherwise<00:01:28.569> there's<00:01:28.780> no<00:01:28.869> way<00:01:28.989> to<00:01:29.050> get<00:01:29.170> it

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
otherwise there's no way to get it

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.859 
otherwise there's no way to get it
completely<00:01:29.560> around<00:01:29.709> the<00:01:29.860> pulleys<00:01:30.539> on<00:01:31.539> this<00:01:31.780> is

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
completely around the pulleys on this is

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.229 
completely around the pulleys on this is
a<00:01:31.899> 3/4<00:01:32.349> liter<00:01:32.530> on<00:01:32.830> a<00:01:32.890> Grand<00:01:33.489> Am<00:01:33.700> and<00:01:33.940> I<00:01:34.030> don't

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:34.239 
a 3/4 liter on a Grand Am and I don't

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:35.400 
a 3/4 liter on a Grand Am and I don't
see<00:01:34.390> some<00:01:34.599> of<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.750> other<00:01:34.869> ones<00:01:35.080> about<00:01:35.319> the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
see some of the other ones about the

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.139 
see some of the other ones about the
Grand<00:01:35.619> Am<00:01:35.739> so<00:01:35.860> I<00:01:35.920> got<00:01:36.039> top<00:01:36.310> motor<00:01:36.550> mount<00:01:36.819> most

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
Grand Am so I got top motor mount most

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.330 
Grand Am so I got top motor mount most
of<00:01:37.300> them<00:01:37.420> get<00:01:37.539> around<00:01:37.950> I'll<00:01:38.950> put<00:01:39.130> it<00:01:39.190> on<00:01:39.220> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
of them get around I'll put it on the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.589 
of them get around I'll put it on the
link<00:01:39.489> in<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.640> description<00:01:40.030> of<00:01:40.119> a<00:01:40.209> video<00:01:40.300> of

how<00:01:40.750> to<00:01:40.810> do<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.530> serpentine<00:01:42.220> belt<00:01:42.250> on<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.140> 3<00:01:44.140> 1

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
how to do the serpentine belt on a 3 1

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.050 
how to do the serpentine belt on a 3 1
liter<00:01:44.470> it's<00:01:44.649> the<00:01:44.709> same<00:01:44.920> concept<00:01:45.310> just<00:01:45.369> keep<00:01:45.940> in

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
liter it's the same concept just keep in

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.490 
liter it's the same concept just keep in
mind<00:01:46.289> this<00:01:47.289> one's<00:01:47.619> got<00:01:47.830> a<00:01:47.860> pulley<00:01:49.170> down<00:01:50.170> here

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
mind this one's got a pulley down here

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.809 
mind this one's got a pulley down here
that's<00:01:51.220> different<00:01:51.429> and<00:01:53.190> a<00:01:54.190> little<00:01:54.489> different

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
that's different and a little different

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.669 
that's different and a little different
diagram<00:01:55.410> then<00:01:56.410> what's<00:01:56.560> on<00:01:56.679> the<00:01:56.770> rest<00:01:56.979> of<00:01:57.099> them

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
diagram then what's on the rest of them

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.469 
diagram then what's on the rest of them
so<00:01:59.700> there's<00:02:00.700> all<00:02:00.879> I'm<00:02:00.940> going<00:02:01.030> to<00:02:01.119> put<00:02:01.209> the<00:02:01.300> belt

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
so there's all I'm going to put the belt

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.699 
so there's all I'm going to put the belt
back<00:02:01.599> on<00:02:02.879> the<00:02:03.879> crank<00:02:04.119> pulley<00:02:04.300> is<00:02:04.660> on<00:02:05.819> and

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
back on the crank pulley is on and

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.309 
back on the crank pulley is on and
bricks<00:02:08.709> around<00:02:08.860> everything<00:02:09.369> else<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:11.020> that's

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
bricks around everything else so that's

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.479 
bricks around everything else so that's
how<00:02:11.500> you<00:02:11.560> do<00:02:11.770> it<00:02:11.920> on<00:02:12.989> basically<00:02:14.280> tap<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.400> on

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
how you do it on basically tap it on

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.770 
how you do it on basically tap it on
with<00:02:15.610> large<00:02:15.790> socket<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:16.329> you<00:02:16.510> got<00:02:16.629> to<00:02:16.689> take

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
with large socket and you got to take

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.040 
with large socket and you got to take
this<00:02:18.120> turning<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.150> little

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
this turning a little

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.680 
this turning a little
better<00:02:21.050> lighting<00:02:21.350> here<00:02:22.270> all<00:02:23.270> this<00:02:23.480> plastic

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
better lighting here all this plastic

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.250 
better lighting here all this plastic
shielding<00:02:24.230> off<00:02:24.350> here<00:02:25.570> this<00:02:26.570> comes<00:02:27.110> off

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
shielding off here this comes off

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.390 
shielding off here this comes off
there's<00:02:27.470> couple<00:02:27.680> clips<00:02:28.090> one<00:02:29.090> bolt<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:30.400> a

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
there's couple clips one bolt and a

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.270 
there's couple clips one bolt and a
couple<00:02:31.790> things<00:02:32.030> underneath<00:02:32.330> here<00:02:33.230> like<00:02:34.130> the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
couple things underneath here like the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.530 
couple things underneath here like the
bumper<00:02:34.610> support<00:02:34.730> bolts<00:02:35.180> got<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.420> come<00:02:35.510> up

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
bumper support bolts got to come up

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.880 
bumper support bolts got to come up
that's<00:02:35.960> why<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.460> actually<00:02:37.460> Wiggles<00:02:38.000> a<00:02:38.060> little

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
that's why it actually Wiggles a little

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.230 
that's why it actually Wiggles a little
but<00:02:40.240> it's<00:02:41.240> pretty<00:02:41.450> straightforward<00:02:42.670> I<00:02:43.670> just

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
but it's pretty straightforward I just

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.640 
but it's pretty straightforward I just
use<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.510> little<00:02:44.570> bit<00:02:44.750> of<00:02:44.810> penetrating<00:02:45.440> oil<00:02:45.470> to

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
use a little bit of penetrating oil to

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.870 
use a little bit of penetrating oil to
get<00:02:45.770> it<00:02:45.890> off<00:02:48.250> probably<00:02:49.250> as<00:02:49.460> a<00:02:49.490> torque<00:02:49.730> sequence

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
get it off probably as a torque sequence

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.760 
get it off probably as a torque sequence
for<00:02:50.300> it<00:02:50.450> but<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:50.990> didn't<00:02:51.380> know<00:02:51.440> what<00:02:51.530> it<00:02:51.650> was

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
for it but I didn't know what it was

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.740 
for it but I didn't know what it was
though<00:02:52.640> it<00:02:52.760> just<00:02:52.910> got<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.060> one<00:02:53.240> centered<00:02:53.540> bulb

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
though it just got the one centered bulb

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.900 
though it just got the one centered bulb
I<00:02:54.080> tapped<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.770> on<00:02:54.860> with<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.010> socket<00:02:55.250> as<00:02:55.550> far<00:02:55.730> as<00:02:55.850> I

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
I tapped it on with a socket as far as I

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.630 
I tapped it on with a socket as far as I
could<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.440> then<00:02:57.440> ran<00:02:57.980> it<00:02:58.130> on<00:02:58.190> with<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.430> bolt

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
could and then ran it on with the bolt

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.850 
could and then ran it on with the bolt
and<00:02:59.380> made<00:03:00.380> sure<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.560> was<00:03:00.709> tight<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.740> get

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
and made sure it was tight so and to get

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.290 
and made sure it was tight so and to get
this<00:03:04.010> off<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.580> just<00:03:04.730> can<00:03:04.820> remove<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.120> cruise

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
this off you just can remove the cruise

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.190 
this off you just can remove the cruise
control<00:03:06.370> which<00:03:07.370> is<00:03:07.550> this<00:03:07.760> little<00:03:08.200> clipper

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
control which is this little clipper

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.110 
control which is this little clipper
here<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:09.950> cruise<00:03:10.160> control<00:03:10.190> box<00:03:10.790> comes

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
here and the cruise control box comes

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.430 
here and the cruise control box comes
out<00:03:11.240> of<00:03:11.360> place<00:03:12.490> use<00:03:13.490> your<00:03:13.670> 3/8<00:03:14.230> wrench<00:03:15.230> or

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
out of place use your 3/8 wrench or

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.470 
out of place use your 3/8 wrench or
whatever<00:03:15.680> for<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:15.980> tensioner<00:03:16.370> wherever<00:03:17.330> you

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
whatever for the tensioner wherever you

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.310 
whatever for the tensioner wherever you
got<00:03:17.600> handy<00:03:17.990> and<00:03:18.880> just<00:03:19.880> put<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:20.750> belt<00:03:20.959> back<00:03:21.080> on

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
got handy and just put the belt back on

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.900 
got handy and just put the belt back on
as<00:03:22.330> follows<00:03:23.330> and<00:03:23.540> it's<00:03:23.690> kind<00:03:23.840> of<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:24.910> little

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
as follows and it's kind of a little

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.960 
as follows and it's kind of a little
difficult<00:03:28.989> we'll<00:03:30.310> see<00:03:31.310> what<00:03:31.459> we<00:03:31.550> can<00:03:31.670> do<00:03:31.820> with

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
difficult we'll see what we can do with

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:39.330 
difficult we'll see what we can do with
it<00:03:36.519> and<00:03:37.519> I<00:03:37.580> reckon<00:03:37.910> it<00:03:38.000> is<00:03:38.120> easier<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.450> actually

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
it and I reckon it is easier to actually

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.470 
it and I reckon it is easier to actually
drop<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.370> engine<00:03:40.730> back<00:03:40.880> down<00:03:43.150> okay<00:03:44.150> so<00:03:44.209> now

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
drop the engine back down okay so now

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.300 
drop the engine back down okay so now
I've<00:03:44.630> dropped<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.290> motor<00:03:45.500> down<00:03:45.680> you<00:03:46.070> can<00:03:46.160> see

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
I've dropped the motor down you can see

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.170 
I've dropped the motor down you can see
it<00:03:46.340> it's<00:03:46.970> kind<00:03:47.209> of<00:03:47.300> and<00:03:48.170> tighten<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.190> nuts

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
it it's kind of and tighten the nuts

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.460 
it it's kind of and tighten the nuts
back<00:03:50.420> on<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.660> motor<00:03:50.840> mounting<00:03:51.170> so<00:03:51.230> we<00:03:51.290> got<00:03:51.410> to

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
back on the motor mounting so we got to

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.810 
back on the motor mounting so we got to
get<00:03:51.560> those<00:03:51.709> finished<00:03:52.160> I<00:03:52.310> was<00:03:52.489> going<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:52.700> show

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
get those finished I was going to show

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:59.740 
get those finished I was going to show
you<00:03:53.980> where<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.160> crank<00:03:55.600> about<00:03:56.600> sits<00:03:58.570> when<00:03:59.570> you

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
you where the crank about sits when you

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.390 
you where the crank about sits when you
see<00:04:00.080> so<00:04:00.380> now<00:04:00.530> it's<00:04:00.709> actually<00:04:01.040> putting

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
see so now it's actually putting

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.210 
see so now it's actually putting
accessible<00:04:01.850> with<00:04:01.970> a<00:04:02.030> polar<00:04:02.239> with<00:04:02.450> long<00:04:02.630> bolts

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
accessible with a polar with long bolts

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.210 
accessible with a polar with long bolts
you<00:04:04.220> can<00:04:04.340> get<00:04:04.430> right<00:04:04.610> around<00:04:04.850> the<00:04:05.180> AC<00:04:05.690> line

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
you can get right around the AC line

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.960 
you can get right around the AC line
look<00:04:07.220> at<00:04:07.280> it<00:04:07.370> looks<00:04:07.489> like<00:04:07.580> it's<00:04:07.700> right<00:04:07.820> in<00:04:07.910> the

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
look at it looks like it's right in the

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.410 
look at it looks like it's right in the
way<00:04:08.090> but<00:04:08.950> it's<00:04:09.950> really<00:04:10.130> not<00:04:10.340> kind<00:04:11.030> of<00:04:11.120> you<00:04:11.330> know

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
way but it's really not kind of you know

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.410 
way but it's really not kind of you know
right<00:04:11.660> off<00:04:11.690> center<00:04:12.110> so<00:04:12.970> I'm<00:04:13.970> gonna<00:04:14.150> get<00:04:14.269> the

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
right off center so I'm gonna get the

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.199 
right off center so I'm gonna get the
belt<00:04:14.780> on<00:04:14.959> it's<00:04:15.350> kind<00:04:15.500> of<00:04:15.530> easier<00:04:15.769> to<00:04:15.830> do<00:04:15.950> this

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
belt on it's kind of easier to do this

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.949 
belt on it's kind of easier to do this
with<00:04:17.209> this<00:04:17.299> piece<00:04:17.479> all<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.660> way<00:04:17.690> you<00:04:17.810> get

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
with this piece all the way you get

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.030 
with this piece all the way you get
around<00:04:18.140> the<00:04:18.260> crank<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:18.590> around<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:18.859> pulley

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
around the crank and around the pulley

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.280 
around the crank and around the pulley
and<00:04:19.220> everything<00:04:19.780> so<00:04:20.780> like<00:04:20.900> I<00:04:20.930> said<00:04:20.989> it's<00:04:21.229> just
