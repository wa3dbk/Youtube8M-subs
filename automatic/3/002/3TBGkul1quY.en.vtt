00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.950 

and<00:00:28.960> I<00:00:29.620> got<00:00:30.220> one<00:00:30.490> set<00:00:30.790> of<00:00:30.910> trapezoidal<00:00:31.540> on<00:00:31.780> one

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
and I got one set of trapezoidal on one

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.220 
and I got one set of trapezoidal on one
set<00:00:32.200> of<00:00:32.700> spots<00:00:33.700> the<00:00:34.090> older<00:00:34.780> ones<00:00:34.990> are<00:00:35.110> the

set of spots the older ones are the

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.220 
set of spots the older ones are the
spots<00:00:35.620> for<00:00:35.980> my<00:00:36.100> main<00:00:37.060> high<00:00:37.450> beams<00:00:37.690> and<00:00:38.080> the

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
spots for my main high beams and the

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.410 
spots for my main high beams and the
inner<00:00:38.320> ones<00:00:38.590> are<00:00:38.830> trapezoidal<00:00:39.489> is<00:00:39.670> a<00:00:39.790> reason

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
inner ones are trapezoidal is a reason

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.840 
inner ones are trapezoidal is a reason
for<00:00:40.450> low<00:00:41.290> beams<00:00:41.970> and<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:45.160> is<00:00:45.340> what<00:00:45.520> they<00:00:45.670> look

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
for low beams and that is what they look

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.520 
for low beams and that is what they look
like<00:00:45.879> when<00:00:46.090> they're<00:00:46.360> off<00:00:46.540> we'll<00:00:47.020> turn<00:00:47.260> them<00:00:47.379> on

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
like when they're off we'll turn them on

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.960 
like when they're off we'll turn them on
shortly<00:00:50.100> reason<00:00:51.100> I<00:00:51.190> wanted<00:00:51.489> to<00:00:51.550> go<00:00:51.670> to<00:00:51.820> these

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
shortly reason I wanted to go to these

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.380 
shortly reason I wanted to go to these
is<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.449> lessen<00:00:52.690> the<00:00:53.020> electrical<00:00:53.650> mode<00:00:53.920> on<00:00:54.160> my

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
is to lessen the electrical mode on my

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.580 
is to lessen the electrical mode on my
charging<00:00:55.390> system<00:00:55.809> the<00:00:58.320> elegance<00:00:59.320> is

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
charging system the elegance is

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.200 
charging system the elegance is
literally<00:00:59.949> halogens<00:01:00.610> that<00:01:00.730> I<00:01:00.790> used<00:01:00.940> to<00:01:01.059> have

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
literally halogens that I used to have

literally halogens that I used to have
one<00:01:01.239> has<00:01:01.690> set<00:01:01.930> of<00:01:02.020> four<00:01:02.320> four<00:01:03.100> of<00:01:03.220> those<00:01:03.370> on<00:01:03.640> it

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
one has set of four four of those on it

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:11.280 
one has set of four four of those on it
each<00:01:04.270> one<00:01:04.600> of<00:01:04.630> those<00:01:04.839> drew<00:01:06.540> 4.6<00:01:07.540> amps<00:01:10.290> these

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
each one of those drew 4.6 amps these

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.620 
each one of those drew 4.6 amps these
ones<00:01:11.530> are<00:01:11.800> rated<00:01:12.190> at<00:01:12.280> point<00:01:12.729> eight<00:01:13.000> amp<00:01:13.330> draw

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
ones are rated at point eight amp draw

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.100 
ones are rated at point eight amp draw
per<00:01:14.170> unit<00:01:14.590> I<00:01:14.940> did<00:01:15.940> some<00:01:16.090> testing<00:01:16.540> this<00:01:16.660> morning

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
per unit I did some testing this morning

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.040 
per unit I did some testing this morning
and<00:01:17.790> I've<00:01:18.790> got<00:01:18.970> them<00:01:19.060> where<00:01:19.090> despairs<00:01:19.780> I

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
and I've got them where despairs I

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.980 
and I've got them where despairs I
tested<00:01:20.440> a<00:01:20.500> pair<00:01:20.860> and<00:01:21.130> a<00:01:22.000> pair<00:01:22.300> of<00:01:22.330> them<00:01:22.600> is

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
tested a pair and a pair of them is

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.279 
tested a pair and a pair of them is
pulling<00:01:25.800> 2.1<00:01:26.800> amp<00:01:27.160> so<00:01:28.149> I<00:01:28.180> can<00:01:28.539> have<00:01:28.720> all<00:01:28.930> four

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
pulling 2.1 amp so I can have all four

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.190 
pulling 2.1 amp so I can have all four
of<00:01:29.320> these<00:01:29.470> lights<00:01:29.830> on<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.420> be<00:01:31.420> drawing<00:01:31.780> less

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
of these lights on and be drawing less

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.620 
of these lights on and be drawing less
powerless<00:01:32.950> current<00:01:33.399> that<00:01:33.729> I<00:01:33.789> was<00:01:34.149> with<00:01:34.360> just

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
powerless current that I was with just

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.440 
powerless current that I was with just
one<00:01:34.959> of<00:01:35.080> those<00:01:35.140> halogens<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:36.209> they<00:01:37.209> are

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
one of those halogens and they are

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.590 
one of those halogens and they are
considerably<00:01:38.020> brighter<00:01:38.440> than<00:01:38.740> allergies<00:01:39.600> so

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
considerably brighter than allergies so

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.910 
considerably brighter than allergies so
let's<00:01:40.929> turn<00:01:41.170> them<00:01:41.259> on<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:41.470> see<00:01:41.709> what<00:01:41.800> they

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
let's turn them on and see what they

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:58.100 
let's turn them on and see what they
look<00:01:41.950> like

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.230 

pretty<00:01:58.740> bright<00:01:58.980> pretty<00:01:59.610> hard<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.880> look<00:02:00.060> at

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
pretty bright pretty hard to look at

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.500 
pretty bright pretty hard to look at
have<00:02:01.230> another<00:02:01.440> golden<00:02:01.800> trail<00:02:02.040> yet<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:02.610> I'm

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
have another golden trail yet but I'm

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.290 
have another golden trail yet but I'm
sure<00:02:03.540> they're<00:02:03.900> going<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.940> provide<00:02:05.940> a<00:02:06.000> lot<00:02:06.270> of

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
sure they're going to provide a lot of

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:13.760 
sure they're going to provide a lot of
illumination<00:02:07.100> so<00:02:10.310> thanks<00:02:11.310> for<00:02:11.370> watching
