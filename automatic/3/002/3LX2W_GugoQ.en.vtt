00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.080
 what they need will be only one time 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.240
 normal sheet of paper then a base 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.119
 I'm coming to us here from the p2 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.310
 base in kerkow you can over for it 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.770
 outside use french manicure nail polish 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.090
 So just what he would rather then 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.350
 she needs a white nail polish for her 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.740
 but also any other color 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.810
 to take 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.900
 I have the french here now 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.370
 manicure nail polish from rivaldo da 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.170
 but only applies to the brush 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.140
 because I think he is not like that 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.879
 good and from manhattan the pro friendship 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.420
 Manhattan is now quite one 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.340
 thin brush and the rival praise has 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.469
 a normal nail polish brush 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.899
 I 'm also the french now 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.219
 manicure brush of essens but wonders 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.629
 you light is the paint off so 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.030
 looks strange that gave me too 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.420
 wet and yes normally does not look that way 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.760
 out 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.399
 and you also need a top 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.780
 coat and I use the p2 from the 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:09.780
 Mega seems to come 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.910
 The first thing you do is to take care of yourself 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.770
 Sheet of paper and the white nail polish 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.240
 and then you just do a little bit 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.240
 what about the nail polish on the paper 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.479
 Now I take the brush and the 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.729
 Just a little bit in that 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.109
 ready for driving 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.859
 Now I take a page from that 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:37.609
 brush it with a page of the 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.609
 nail on 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.140
 then I start the departure 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.369
 and then 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.409
 namely the tips of it and made 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.710
 just so that's just being redeveloped 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.710
 becomes 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.870
 yes and what I already show 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.410
 get close to you again 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:12.100
 So I paint the brush in the color 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:18.000
 then with a side of brush because I 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.000
 one to one, then the other 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.360
 then connects 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.950
 if it is not quite perfect yet 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.849
 but it is not bad because you 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.319
 can still after one 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.569
 cotton swabs take a bit 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.160
 nail polish remover and then what you can 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.830
 can has so slipped a little bit here 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.300
 you still have to leave 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.550
 now I show you how you all that 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.430
 make normal with his thin brush 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.019
 you can and indeed you stroke the brush 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.459
 just a little bit off the side of the road 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.160
 so not quite as much color on it 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.930
 is and then you do both 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.930
 outer edges two small lines 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.060
 and then you just see one here 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:06.170
 line for that you need a something 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.170
 just pay once over 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.690
 then you just have to lower the bottom 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.690
 fill out area 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.260
 Lastly, I'll show you just like you 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.330
 that with a normal nail polish 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:47.220
 you can take island then you take 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:50.160
 just a little bit of color and then 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.190
 You can also go to one 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.920
 half that never pull over and then 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:00.950
 take a bit of color again and 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.950
 then from the other side to the middle 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.050
 if you then cleaned the edges 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.580
 have and the places where the nail polish 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.800
 not quite as opaque was probably 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.660
 then you have gone over it then you see 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.280
 It's kind of like that and you just have to 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.270
 still with the top head over it go so 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.270
 it also lasts a long time 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:46.180
 and that's how it looks
