the VGA adapter actually hooked up to
your<00:00:37.770> macbook<00:00:38.540> what<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.719> should<00:00:39.989> see<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.559> your

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
your macbook what you should see is your

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.030 
your macbook what you should see is your
desktop<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.940> your<00:00:42.030> macbook<00:00:42.690> here<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.559> then<00:00:43.860> if

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
desktop on your macbook here and then if

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.040 
desktop on your macbook here and then if
you<00:00:44.160> look<00:00:44.340> at<00:00:44.520> your<00:00:44.700> projection<00:00:45.360> screen<00:00:45.719> and

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
you look at your projection screen and

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.250 
you look at your projection screen and
I'm<00:00:46.379> looking<00:00:46.680> down<00:00:46.860> here<00:00:47.070> at<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> web<00:00:47.399> pane

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
I'm looking down here at the web pane

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.990 
I'm looking down here at the web pane
what<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.379> see<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.860> different<00:00:50.460> view<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.879> I've

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
what you see is a different view so I've

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.330 
what you see is a different view so I've
got<00:00:51.180> zebras<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.870> my<00:00:52.020> desktop<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.800> if<00:00:53.190> you

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
got zebras here on my desktop and if you

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.770 
got zebras here on my desktop and if you
look<00:00:53.550> at<00:00:53.789> what<00:00:54.030> I'm<00:00:54.120> projecting<00:00:54.329> I'm

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
look at what I'm projecting I'm

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.630 
look at what I'm projecting I'm
projecting<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.410> nice<00:00:55.620> galaxy<00:00:56.219> scene<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
projecting this nice galaxy scene and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.810 
projecting this nice galaxy scene and
that's<00:00:56.730> because<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.480> set<00:00:57.690> up<00:00:57.809> in

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
that's because this is set up in

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.340 
that's because this is set up in
parallel<00:00:59.820> not<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.510> mirror<00:01:00.809> mode<00:01:01.079> basically

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
parallel not in mirror mode basically

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.770 
parallel not in mirror mode basically
what<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.800> means<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.449> my

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
what that means is that I have my

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.320 
what that means is that I have my
desktop<00:01:04.290> here<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.640> am<00:01:06.420> not<00:01:07.490> showing<00:01:08.490> my

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
desktop here and I am not showing my

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.060 
desktop here and I am not showing my
same<00:01:09.659> desktop<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.439> if<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.590> move<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.890> all<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
same desktop so if I move that all the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.950 
same desktop so if I move that all the
way<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.430> side<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:11.970> see<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.240> it's

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
way to the side you can see that it's

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.350 
way to the side you can see that it's
basically<00:01:13.170> making<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:14.010> for<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> side<00:01:15.119> by

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
basically making it for like a side by

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.270 
basically making it for like a side by
side<00:01:15.390> monitor<00:01:16.229> display<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.920> don't<00:01:17.100> want
