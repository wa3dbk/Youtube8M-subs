00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:20.090
 hello a big hello to all friends 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.789
 subscribers youtube is in a tutorial 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.800
 I will go to blogs institutor and I will show you 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.619
 how to extract songs from a disc 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.990
 music without loss of quality that is 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.050
 do not lose anything of quality these musics 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.540
 just as the disk is and also that 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.089
 it has been extracted in mp3 but obviously 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.280
 when it is extracted in or mp3 there is loss 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:42.650
 of quality and good what we will do 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.020
 first is to use the wind program 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.440
 windows media player 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.180
 and we're going to have to put our disk 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.820
 that we want to extract the songs from 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.410
 We want to extract what is not 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.690
 we can do it's good if we open the 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.239
 disc we see that there are several tracks not 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.850
 we can only copy them in the 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.670
 route that we want because when 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.160
 are are encrypted files then 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.530
 well we are going to have to use this 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.330
 windows media program and what we're going 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.250
 to do is to right click the disk 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.860
 that we want to extract the songs note 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.869
 the right click and on playing do not 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.690
 we are because let it pause before 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.479
 that reproduces here and we're going to have 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.440
 to give in changing to library 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.020
 automatically will we maximize 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.880
 a little more the window here let's see 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.470
 all the songs in this case 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.150
 they baptize a poster of santa me 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.370
 I really like this rap group 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.050
 and from here what we can see if we want 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.570
 extract all the songs we have to 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.130
 select all is valid in this case 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.190
 only to select one because 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.810
 it takes a lot and it's going to select this 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.480
 we're going to have to check the box and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.160
 select it eye is check the box and 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.840
 select the is here that the all 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.630
 we can make all the selections 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.190
 all what we are going to do then is to say 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.910
 our copy configuration from 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.800
 sidi let's see click and here in format 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.390
 here we can see that there are several in this 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.119
 case as I said we can use 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.770
 the mp3 that obviously when that mp3 there 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.959
 loss of quality is not going to be heard 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.310
 just as it is on the disk in this case 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.890
 it's an original record and when it's not 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.080
 Listen perfect as you know how they are 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.610
 the originals sound very good but 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.550
 obviously if I'm going to convert it here to 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.950
 What mp3 will do is loss of quality a 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.600
 little bit is not much but yes if you notice 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.670
 to be honest 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.740
 but well, there are those that do not have 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.510
 loss of quality that would be goodbye without 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.700
 loss of windows media and wap without 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.980
 loss are these two songs of 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.750
 our formats but they do not have 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.660
 lost but well obviously it's going to 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.780
 Despite much and does the mp3 is a 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.810
 Very well known format and especially 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.180
 very compatible no and well first I'm going to 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.160
 start with the mp3 format I do it in 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.930
 mp3 format 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.540
 and here we have already chosen the 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.170
 configuration and now yes when 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.480
 want 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.030
 extract them we have seen here good but 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.700
 here when the selection 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.440
 mp3 there is audio quality and obviously if 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.970
 we want the least loss of quality 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.580
 possible we have to select the 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.920
 Optimal quality will obviously increase 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.900
 the weight and here you should see here that 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.730
 what quality do you want not if you want little 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.830
 weight then select the size plus 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.170
 small but obviously less quality 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.420
 which is the optimum quality but a little 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.940
 heavier I will choose in this case 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.460
 the optimum quality I will give you here in 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.110
 copy from sidi more than 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.540
 selected here the configuration of 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.280
 mp3 format and the audio quality is going 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.840
 to give in copy I decided and we have 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.670
 selected the songs in this case 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.410
 one and here it says that if you want 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.170
 add protection against copying the 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.360
 music to which it refers is that you're not going 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.730
 to be able to play on any computer and 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.550
 on any positive day whatever they are 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.010
 cell phone tablet etcetera and I recommend 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.420
 a lot that you who is not add 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.970
 protection because here you can do 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.890
 copies of whatever you can pass 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.420
 any cell phone and play it without 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.490
 problems 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.290
 well here you would have to select 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.440
 this box and we will give in accept 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.170
 ok here says it's copying I decided 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.989
 and here is the bar not how much low 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:15.130
 in this case everything will be stored in the 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:17.139
 music folder and here we see that it 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.120
 created the folder of our disk did not 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.730
 let's double- click already thematically 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.020
 well here another double click and 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.850
 it will automatically seem that the 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.490
 extracted song we see that it has a 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:32.860
 mp3 file format and a size of 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:35.080
 7.0 or 5 megabytes and the duration here 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.950
 we see that this mp3 is worth here I know that it is 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.979
 copied not now let's convert it to 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.870
 lossless formats is going to go back 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.000
 to select this box and I'm going to 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.310
 choose to setup forms 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.960
 of lossless format in this case for 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.970
 choose audio without loss of windows 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.910
 mean and now here audio quality does not 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.680
 it can be modified because good 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.470
 he says he has no loss then good 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.210
 will choose the optimum quality and now 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.620
 yes we are going to have to click again 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.870
 in copy I decided and automatically 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.760
 to copy again 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.950
 when what protection appeared 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.740
 a while ago is when it is to prevent 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.630
 can not upload it on the networks in 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.670
 internet because they would not be infringing 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.760
 copyright rights more than anything 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.860
 it is for personal use and now it already 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.730
 happened here the music folder what 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:30.480
 it would be any update and good here 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:33.000
 we see that it is in a dvd format w the 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.190
 size of 23 megabyte points but 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.690
 when it has no audio it has no loss 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.700
 that's why it weighs much more than 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.160
 the mp3 as he had said not long ago 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:44.250
 the mp3 has obviously going to have here 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.860
 a loss when 50 x say according to 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.930
 programs that make it mp3 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.880
 I lost nothing, believe me it 's a lie 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.550
 because the mp3 will always have loss 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.220
 there can not be one without loss then 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.140
 It says here they put the weight w and 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.610
 obviously without but you can also 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.350
 choose what would be good we go to 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.990
 select again and you can also 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:07.020
 choosing what would be ww depends 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.870
 any one is equal has no loss is 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.210
 the same as this one but it would be good 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.200
 more than all the format not because a 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.570
 loss in both 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.580
 just the format there what the 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.730
 greater and in your lot accept of this 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.380
 better format and this and well there already 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.450
 you have to see what the format would be 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.670
 what you want when there is not when 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.080
 you want losses but mp3 when you want 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.690
 pass it to your site but obviously 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.730
 I will repeat again there will be but it is worth 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.290
 then well this would be all I hope 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.090
 that you liked here can you 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.900
 use for any disk either 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:42.780
 original disc or a disc copy that there 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.340
 is burned but do not let it not be extracted 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.440
 the music manually have to do it 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.730
 with this program but good more than 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.160
 everything is used for original discs 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:53.700
 not that these have a great 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.590
 sound quality and good there 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.290
 we will use what would be the audio without 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.460
 loss so we can hear it 

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.020
 our friends passed and good that 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.210
 listen to and also the audio without 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.980
 loss and good this would be all I hope 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:08.370
 that you liked them I leave my banner 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:10.110
