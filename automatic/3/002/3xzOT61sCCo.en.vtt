done this is my second round the first
round<00:00:14.519> what<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:14.880> did<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.269> basically<00:00:15.870> what

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
round what I did is that basically what

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.859 
round what I did is that basically what
you<00:00:16.230> can<00:00:16.410> see<00:00:16.619> here<00:00:17.270> this<00:00:18.270> one<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.510> probably

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
you can see here this one is probably

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.340 
you can see here this one is probably
the<00:00:18.960> best<00:00:19.230> option<00:00:19.670> on<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> video<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.660> I

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
the best option on a video of it is I

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.470 
the best option on a video of it is I
cut<00:00:22.590> one<00:00:22.830> sweet<00:00:23.279> potato<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.730> half<00:00:23.910> put<00:00:24.300> both

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
cut one sweet potato in half put both

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.349 
cut one sweet potato in half put both
sides<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:24.990> container<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.650> basically<00:00:26.359> every

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
sides in a container and basically every

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.839 
sides in a container and basically every
other<00:00:27.990> day<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.650> would<00:00:28.980> empty<00:00:29.550> out<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.820> water

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
other day I would empty out the water

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.089 
other day I would empty out the water
replace<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.960> water<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.410> make<00:00:31.560> sure<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:31.980> at

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
replace the water and make sure that at

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.220 
replace the water and make sure that at
least<00:00:32.309> an<00:00:32.520> inch<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.210> covered<00:00:33.510> that's

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
least an inch of it is covered that's

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.540 
least an inch of it is covered that's
when<00:00:34.440> I've<00:00:34.530> moved<00:00:34.800> around<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.280> that's<00:00:35.370> why

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
when I've moved around so that's why

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.370 
when I've moved around so that's why
it's<00:00:35.700> not<00:00:35.820> completely<00:00:36.360> under<00:00:36.690> but<00:00:37.230> what

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
it's not completely under but what

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.410 
it's not completely under but what
happened<00:00:37.710> with<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> last<00:00:38.129> ones<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.239> can

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
happened with the last ones and you can

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.959 
happened with the last ones and you can
see<00:00:39.600> right<00:00:39.750> there<00:00:40.100> these<00:00:41.100> ones<00:00:41.430> look<00:00:41.520> okay<00:00:41.940> so

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
see right there these ones look okay so

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.520 
see right there these ones look okay so
far<00:00:42.480> but<00:00:42.600> they're<00:00:42.750> starting<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.140> get<00:00:43.290> mushy

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
far but they're starting to get mushy

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.299 
far but they're starting to get mushy
underneath<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.360> they're<00:00:45.360> starting<00:00:45.660> to

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
underneath and they're starting to

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.330 
underneath and they're starting to
basically<00:00:47.309> decompose<00:00:48.680> this<00:00:49.680> one<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:49.980> cut<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
basically decompose this one I cut the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.450 
basically decompose this one I cut the
top<00:00:50.550> off<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.449> see<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.750> right<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:51.930> and

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
top off of you can see it right here and

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.770 
top off of you can see it right here and
down<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.730> bottom<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.329> did<00:00:54.570> that

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
down in the bottom and I did that

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.939 
down in the bottom and I did that
because<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.289> looked<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.590> there<00:00:55.710> was<00:00:55.800> already

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
because it looked like there was already

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.619 
because it looked like there was already
a<00:00:56.100> sprout<00:00:56.370> growing<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.059> turns<00:00:57.239> out<00:00:57.449> that

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
a sprout growing and it turns out that

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.299 
a sprout growing and it turns out that
little<00:00:57.899> piece<00:00:58.140> turn<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.680> mold<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.280> that's

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
little piece turn to mold so that's

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.670 
little piece turn to mold so that's
going<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.640> get<00:00:59.789> tossed<00:01:00.000> today<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:01.260> basically

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
going to get tossed today but basically

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.410 
going to get tossed today but basically
I'm<00:01:01.770> running<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> little<00:01:02.250> experiment<00:01:02.730> because

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
I'm running a little experiment because

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.850 
I'm running a little experiment because
I<00:01:03.449> had<00:01:03.870> read<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.260> internet<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.739> you

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
I had read on the internet that you

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.800 
I had read on the internet that you
could<00:01:05.010> grow<00:01:05.159> sprouts<00:01:05.460> sprouts<00:01:06.180> excuse<00:01:06.659> me

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
could grow sprouts sprouts excuse me

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.940 
could grow sprouts sprouts excuse me
from<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:08.180> sweet<00:01:09.180> potato<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.500> should<00:01:10.920> be

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
from a sweet potato but it should be

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.039 
from a sweet potato but it should be
organic<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> first<00:01:12.180> one<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.420> tried<00:01:12.450> was<00:01:12.840> not

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
organic so the first one I tried was not

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.350 
organic so the first one I tried was not
and<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.409> rotted<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.430> decided<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.030> go<00:01:15.150> out<00:01:15.240> and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
and it rotted so I decided to go out and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.020 
and it rotted so I decided to go out and
I<00:01:15.390> bought<00:01:15.540> two<00:01:15.810> organic<00:01:16.619> sweet<00:01:16.830> potatoes<00:01:17.310> this

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.980 
there right there's a long one so my
analysis<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:48.000> should<00:01:48.270> suspend<00:01:48.720> them

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
analysis is you should suspend them

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.440 
analysis is you should suspend them
because<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:49.920> am<00:01:50.280> getting<00:01:50.549> sprouts<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> one

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
because I am getting sprouts on the one

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.969 
because I am getting sprouts on the one
that's<00:01:51.659> suspended<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.350> I'm<00:01:52.439> not<00:01:52.680> getting

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
that's suspended and I'm not getting

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.679 
that's suspended and I'm not getting
anything<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.520> rot<00:01:53.759> on<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.119> ones<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.600> are

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
anything but rot on the ones that are

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.920 
anything but rot on the ones that are
not<00:01:54.810> suspended<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.520> I'll<00:01:57.000> keep<00:01:57.240> drawing<00:01:57.600> I'm

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
not suspended so I'll keep drawing I'm

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.450 
not suspended so I'll keep drawing I'm
going<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.320> continue<00:01:58.619> with<00:01:58.860> these<00:01:59.040> two<00:01:59.340> I'm

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
going to continue with these two I'm

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.280 
going to continue with these two I'm
going<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.700> actually<00:02:00.000> separate<00:02:00.390> them<00:02:00.600> put<00:02:01.200> them

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
going to actually separate them put them

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.690 
going to actually separate them put them
in<00:02:01.409> their<00:02:01.530> own<00:02:01.619> containers<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.340> see<00:02:02.490> if<00:02:02.549> that

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
in their own containers to see if that

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.940 
in their own containers to see if that
makes<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.030> difference<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:03.990> not<00:02:04.229> suspend<00:02:04.799> them

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
makes a difference but not suspend them

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.469 
makes a difference but not suspend them
and<00:02:05.130> then<00:02:05.430> I'm<00:02:05.520> gonna<00:02:05.670> have<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:06.000> one<00:02:06.210> here

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
and then I'm gonna have this one here

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.440 
and then I'm gonna have this one here
still<00:02:06.780> suspended<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.560> see<00:02:08.069> how<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.369> does<00:02:08.450> from

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
still suspended and see how it does from

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.059 
still suspended and see how it does from
whatever<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.989> trick<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.379> keep<00:02:10.679> about<00:02:10.920> an

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
whatever the trick is you keep about an

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.680 
whatever the trick is you keep about an
inch<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.760> water<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.270> see<00:02:12.450> how

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
inch of it in the water and see how

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.960 
inch of it in the water and see how
goes<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.710> until<00:02:14.070> next<00:02:14.220> time<00:02:14.400> I'll<00:02:14.760> give<00:02:14.880> you

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
goes so until next time I'll give you

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.380 
goes so until next time I'll give you
updates<00:02:15.270> in<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.450> few<00:02:15.630> weeks<00:02:15.750> but<00:02:16.260> by
