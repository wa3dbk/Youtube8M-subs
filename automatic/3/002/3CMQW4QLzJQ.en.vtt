light up I'm like okay that's that's

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.639 
light up I'm like okay that's that's
pretty<00:00:56.399> cool<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.719> think<00:00:57.780> skyped<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.410> then

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
pretty cool and I think skyped and then

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.430 
pretty cool and I think skyped and then
I<00:00:58.680> realized<00:00:59.129> oh<00:00:59.460> look<00:01:00.420> some<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.050> them<00:01:01.140> give<00:01:01.320> off

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
I realized oh look some of them give off

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.369 
I realized oh look some of them give off
more<00:01:01.680> light<00:01:01.859> than<00:01:01.890> other<00:01:02.219> others<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.989> seems

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
more light than other others so it seems

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.690 
more light than other others so it seems
that<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> more<00:01:04.739> rare<00:01:04.979> ones<00:01:05.220> actually<00:01:05.430> give

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
that the more rare ones actually give

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.550 
that the more rare ones actually give
more<00:01:06.000> light<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.600> cold<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:06.960> iron<00:01:07.229> actually

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
more light so cold and iron actually

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.170 
more light so cold and iron actually
give<00:01:07.680> off<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.979> list<00:01:08.280> amount<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.670> light<00:01:08.820> seems

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
give off the list amount of light seems

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.880 
give off the list amount of light seems
so<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.869> can<00:01:10.200> have<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.530> path<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.909> lightness

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
so I can have this path of a lightness

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.230 
so I can have this path of a lightness
have<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.040> path<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.430> lightness<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.060> what<00:01:15.150> I'm

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
have the path of lightness is what I'm

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.440 
have the path of lightness is what I'm
gonna<00:01:15.390> call<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.310> anyway<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:17.909> go<00:01:18.270> by

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
gonna call it and anyway you just go by

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.899 
gonna call it and anyway you just go by
and<00:01:18.810> then<00:01:19.220> some<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.400> words<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.670> you'll

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
and then some of the words that you'll

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.050 
and then some of the words that you'll
see<00:01:21.060> are<00:01:21.180> actually<00:01:21.299> naturally<00:01:21.630> occurring<00:01:22.320> so

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
see are actually naturally occurring so

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.340 
see are actually naturally occurring so
um<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.630> not<00:01:24.780> meant<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.170> way<00:01:25.229> but

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
um it's not meant to be that way but

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.320 
um it's not meant to be that way but
they<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:25.890> Barack<00:01:26.100> through<00:01:26.369> there<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.970> this

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
they just Barack through there so this

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.690 
they just Barack through there so this
is<00:01:27.360> iron<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.350> then<00:01:28.710> as<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.310> see<00:01:29.549> this

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
is iron and then as you can see this

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.249 
is iron and then as you can see this
diamond<00:01:30.180> seems<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.450> give<00:01:30.540> I'll<00:01:30.659> give<00:01:31.110> off<00:01:31.229> a

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
diamond seems to give I'll give off a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.590 
diamond seems to give I'll give off a
lot<00:01:31.439> more<00:01:31.740> light<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.400> may<00:01:32.640> also<00:01:32.820> be<00:01:33.270> just

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
lot more light that may also be just

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.929 
lot more light that may also be just
because<00:01:33.900> there's<00:01:34.110> an<00:01:34.290> opening<00:01:34.740> though<00:01:34.939> maybe

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
because there's an opening though maybe

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.850 
because there's an opening though maybe
I'm<00:01:36.390> not<00:01:36.750> actually<00:01:36.990> sure<00:01:37.200> if<00:01:37.290> that's<00:01:37.500> there<00:01:37.740> or

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
I'm not actually sure if that's there or

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.210 
I'm not actually sure if that's there or
not<00:01:37.979> or<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:39.000> actually<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.259> mod<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:41.009> just

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
not or and actually in the mod it just

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.760 
not or and actually in the mod it just
seems<00:01:41.460> like<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.820> me<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.380> then<00:01:43.380> Cole

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
seems like that to me and then Cole

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.740 
seems like that to me and then Cole
seems<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> give<00:01:44.369> off<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:45.149> least<00:01:45.390> amount<00:01:45.630> of

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
seems to give off the least amount of

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.899 
seems to give off the least amount of
light<00:01:46.140> or<00:01:46.350> I'm<00:01:47.100> not<00:01:47.280> sure<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.549> gives<00:01:47.670> off

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
light or I'm not sure if it gives off

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.999 
light or I'm not sure if it gives off
the<00:01:48.149> same<00:01:48.329> amount<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.630> iron<00:01:48.899> or<00:01:49.140> what<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:49.829> it's

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
the same amount of iron or what but it's

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.639 
the same amount of iron or what but it's
still<00:01:50.250> it's<00:01:51.149> pretty<00:01:51.329> cool<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.229> lapis

diamond<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.689> probably<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.259> most<00:02:04.290> useful<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.610> I

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
diamond is probably the most useful so I

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.800

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810
