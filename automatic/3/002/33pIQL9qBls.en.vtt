00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.849
 So guys, in this video, I'm going to teach. 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.450
 for you how to set up memory 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:20.860
 virtual 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.789
 the first will explain how she 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:28.119
 it works the following you have this 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:31.929
 memory and the memory 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.780
 virtual you will simulate practically 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:37.360
 will almost Mullah the ram 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.160
 but inside your hard drive 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.680
 then you select a part of the 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.300
 hard drive and a small part of it 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.789
 will become a ram 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.809
 so you will expand the number of 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.180
 RAM memory 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.920
 but that this expansion of the number of 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.930
 ram memory will not appear in the 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:01:00.460
 system configurations and this is also 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.829
 virtual memory ram it is not as fast 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.440
 how much RAM has been installed in the 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.320
 computer because the hard drive 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.479
 of the hard drive because it it does not 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.679
 is as fast as ram memory 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.470
 have on the computer 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:15.670
 so this is it and now you will see how 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.130
 configure it 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.430
 You press a pin on windows 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:25.960
 on the keyboard and the break breaks button goes 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:29.320
 open this is this setting here and 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.759
 for you to have a sense of difference 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.350
 speed 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.960
 I come here in the index of experience 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.299
 the windows you see you will not 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.040
 will see here that the hard drive 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.939
 primary the transfer rate 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:47.140
 Data transfer is 5.9 and water 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:50.500
 memory operation per second is 7.2 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.570
 on a scale ranging from 1 to 7 to 9 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.759
 so it's only for this graph to have 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.640
 a notion of how much the hard drive is 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.310
 slow compared to ram 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.829
 but to see now you see in that 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.630
 page here come advanced settings 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:12.280
 system comes here in performance comes 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:16.269
 settings and then come 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.910
 you see virtual memory here and it comes 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.250
 change is already here to manage 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.790
 file performance automatically 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.190
 such 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.600
 you will uncheck this option 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:31.630
 and will have that is generated by the system in 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.820
 Disco seeger I recommend leaving always 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.270
 on the operating system disk installed 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:40.360
 in the case always without exception will be the 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.150
 You have two points and you come here 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:49.150
 Customizing the recommended size is 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:52.030
 you have so much memory from two to 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.640
 three times the number of both ram 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.750
 that you have is that in the case it is see in 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:05.530
 megabytes or 1 1 gig has 1,024 mega 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:07.720
 bytes soon two gigas have 2048 mega 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.610
 bytes my case here I have four 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:15.220
 gigas on my computer 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.770
 so I have 4096 megabytes and I go 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.220
 put of the initial size that is the 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:25.780
 number as much as I have and the limit I 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.040
 I'll put the double that's 4 is 8192 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.870
 megabyte 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.180
 That's it, it's just you come to mark this 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:41.040
 option here 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:41.040
 done that you come you click the goal 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:53.780
 put here again 4096 and here 8192 a 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.519
 remember why you did not get 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.579
 always when you made the change 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.370
 Do you see that set there will stay 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.540
 ready ready there you will click what 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.500
 it will ask you to restart the 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.269
 computer 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.609
 I click ok but I do not want to 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.310
 start my computer now then I 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:11.720
 I'll do it and I'll explain what it is that he 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.069
 will ask you to ask again for 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.409
 restart your computer 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.000
 I come in to restart after remembering 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.560
 that the changes that you have made not only 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.310
 will do when you restart the 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.530
 computer 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.900
 so this is nice if you liked 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.940
 A video of a young man had and 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.800
 my channel any doubt 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.620
 write in comments 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.930
 If you want, you have a great time too. 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.050
 channel that I'll leave the description of it 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.660
 I'm not going to leave his link here in the 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.900
 description of the video that is a channel on 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:45.289
 video editing for graphic design 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.139
 these things is the name of the channel is the tek 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.300
 makes dye and will be in the description 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:54.250
 So this is a big hug to 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.250
 everyone and be well
