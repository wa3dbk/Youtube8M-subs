 home bar in the individual and visitors 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.680
 this pitch and we are pulling now 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:35.629
 from above is on the left side 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:39.170
 the line and right the street so 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:41.210
 noise I think that has followed 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.690
 that many say hey I want to go there 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.550
 not out is totally wrong 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.280
 Considering because I have today 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.880
 Here, something looked around here one afternoon 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.870
 looks so much for the eye it is here 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.760
 schmaus and tells that the g端nther 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:05.600
 from the pitch 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:07.940
 that's why he should come to that 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.700
 gone to find easy also have 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:16.130
 Much seen what our beautiful night and 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.009

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.100
 beautiful place visitors themselves we travel 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.810
 for 15 years with the mobile home 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.539
 put us here then a few days 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.009
 and have just tried it 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.140
 then the money is taken in hand and 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.020
 have the necessary installation here 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.270

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.819
 come back 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.160
 That was the right decision 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:43.209
 an expensive program just not only 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.190
 Wohnmobilisten but in numerous 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:48.920
 the one out in the car the one coming 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.380
 other motorcycle and the eifel stretch 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.979
 are special challenges for the 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.770
 mother 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.050
 That's why it sometimes comes in beautiful 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.410
 weekends on the holidays of the 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.420
 Road to a bit more noise pollution 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.970
 but nothing about that 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.819
 notice when you lie down g端nther 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.520
 so use the moment in the picture and 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.140
 shipping companies g端nther it is so bad at all 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.030
 not I am here now we have 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.610
 today is a nice day and 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.450
 motorcycles because past it is so bad 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:24.380
 not and ride the train on the day 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.630
 as an hour or you notice 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.750
 does not bother the only thing at all 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.270
 it's a bit disturbing if that's because 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.480
 here in station is the place here 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.910
 the trains and three run in the morning 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.160
 let it run then if we like 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.430
 but that would be the only thing 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.640
 This may be annoying here 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.400
 There is so much beauty here 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.170

 the art nouveau power plant a little further away 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.850
 It's almost worth the dare 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.740
 from here to move to the parking lot 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.020

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.530
