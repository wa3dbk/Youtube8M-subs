00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
time you know easy multitasking it's

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.619 
time you know easy multitasking it's
brilliant<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.530> we<00:00:47.460> also<00:00:47.610> know<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.420> comes

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
brilliant and we also know that it comes

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.209 
brilliant and we also know that it comes
with<00:00:48.780> something<00:00:49.350> called<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:50.820> s-pen<00:00:52.219> now

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
with something called the s-pen now

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.849 
with something called the s-pen now
these<00:00:53.399> suspends<00:00:53.940> very<00:00:54.210> clever<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:55.469> kind<00:00:55.739> of

00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:55.859 
these suspends very clever it kind of

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:58.729 
these suspends very clever it kind of
works<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> magnetic<00:00:57.000> induction<00:00:57.660> loop<00:00:58.410> and

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
works on a magnetic induction loop and

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.619 
works on a magnetic induction loop and
it's<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:59.129> its<00:00:59.340> pressure<00:00:59.640> sensitive<00:01:00.210> as<00:01:00.449> well

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
it's for its pressure sensitive as well

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.509 
it's for its pressure sensitive as well
so<00:01:01.019> just<00:01:01.519> demonstrate<00:01:02.519> that<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:05.100> harder<00:01:05.430> you

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
so just demonstrate that the harder you

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.210 
so just demonstrate that the harder you
press<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:07.020> thick<00:01:07.230> of<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.410> line<00:01:10.100> compared<00:01:11.100> to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
press the thick of the line compared to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.130 
press the thick of the line compared to
if<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.400> press<00:01:11.610> lightly<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.840> get<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> thin<00:01:13.229> line

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
if you press lightly you get a thin line

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.230 
if you press lightly you get a thin line
what<00:01:16.140> else<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:16.500> know<00:01:16.710> about<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.520> Galaxy

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
what else do we know about the Galaxy

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.340 
what else do we know about the Galaxy
Note<00:01:18.350> we<00:01:19.350> know<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:19.860> got<00:01:20.040> 1<00:01:20.340> gig<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.820> ram

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
Note we know that it's got 1 gig of ram

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.990 
Note we know that it's got 1 gig of ram
which<00:01:22.350> helps<00:01:22.650> with<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.799> multitasking<00:01:23.220> also

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
which helps with that multitasking also

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.350 
which helps with that multitasking also
we<00:01:24.689> know<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.170> got<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.759> 5.3<00:01:26.759> inch<00:01:30.770> HD

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
we know that it's got a 5.3 inch HD

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:40.149 
we know that it's got a 5.3 inch HD
Super<00:01:33.360> AMOLED<00:01:33.479> screen

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.389 

perfect<00:01:41.030> for<00:01:41.179> watching<00:01:41.479> videos<00:01:41.920> we<00:01:42.920> also<00:01:43.100> know

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
perfect for watching videos we also know

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.330 
perfect for watching videos we also know
that<00:01:43.429> it's<00:01:43.759> got<00:01:43.969> 8<00:01:44.740> megapixel<00:01:45.740> camera<00:01:46.100> on<00:01:46.249> the

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
that it's got 8 megapixel camera on the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.630 
that it's got 8 megapixel camera on the
back<00:01:46.520> and<00:01:48.069> a<00:01:49.069> 2<00:01:50.060> megapixel<00:01:50.799> camera<00:01:51.799> on<00:01:51.979> the

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
back and a 2 megapixel camera on the

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.289 
back and a 2 megapixel camera on the
front<00:01:52.929> so<00:01:53.929> that<00:01:53.959> makes<00:01:54.319> video<00:01:55.069> calling<00:01:55.490> very

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
front so that makes video calling very

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.839 
front so that makes video calling very
easy<00:01:57.250> and<00:01:58.840> what<00:01:59.840> else<00:02:00.020> it's<00:02:00.560> a<00:02:00.649> bit<00:02:00.859> across<00:02:01.579> but

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:01.849 
easy and what else it's a bit across but

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:03.399 
easy and what else it's a bit across but
it<00:02:01.969> makes<00:02:02.240> phone<00:02:02.509> calls<00:02:02.539> and<00:02:02.929> you<00:02:03.020> can<00:02:03.170> send

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
it makes phone calls and you can send

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:04.990 
it makes phone calls and you can send
texts<00:02:03.799> so<00:02:03.920> it's<00:02:04.099> still<00:02:04.250> classed<00:02:04.549> as<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.759> phone

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
texts so it's still classed as a phone

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.419 
texts so it's still classed as a phone
but<00:02:05.329> it's<00:02:05.479> me<00:02:05.750> really<00:02:06.259> really<00:02:06.709> big<00:02:06.950> enough<00:02:07.159> to

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
but it's me really really big enough to

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.180 
but it's me really really big enough to
be<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.060> tablet<00:02:08.569> so<00:02:09.200> it's<00:02:09.379> something<00:02:10.009> that<00:02:10.160> I

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
be a tablet so it's something that I

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.610 
be a tablet so it's something that I
call<00:02:10.549> a<00:02:10.789> phablet<00:02:14.230> because<00:02:15.230> it's<00:02:15.379> cross

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
call a phablet because it's cross

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.490 
call a phablet because it's cross
between<00:02:15.769> a<00:02:15.980> phone<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.900> tablet<00:02:20.200> I've<00:02:21.200> heard

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
between a phone and a tablet I've heard

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.319 
between a phone and a tablet I've heard
that<00:02:21.560> saying<00:02:21.950> quite<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.280> lot<00:02:22.519> it's<00:02:22.760> also<00:02:22.879> a<00:02:23.090> very

creative device here's a an animation
that<00:02:29.569> I<00:02:29.720> made<00:02:29.959> as<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.410> animated<00:02:31.160> ecard<00:02:31.730> for

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
that I made as a animated ecard for

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.670 
that I made as a animated ecard for
Christmas<00:02:35.079> so<00:02:36.079> you<00:02:36.170> can<00:02:36.319> make<00:02:36.440> your<00:02:36.590> own

Christmas so you can make your own
animations<00:02:37.340> you<00:02:37.459> just<00:02:37.670> drag<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:39.260> slide<00:02:39.849> each

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
animations you just drag the slide each

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.349 
animations you just drag the slide each
frame<00:02:41.299> differently<00:02:42.109> how<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.410> want<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:42.829> then

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359
