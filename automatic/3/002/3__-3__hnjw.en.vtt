if<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:55.739> don't<00:00:55.949> recycle<00:00:56.250> waste<00:00:56.750> it<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:57.960> gets

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
if we don't recycle waste it just gets

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.950 
if we don't recycle waste it just gets
put<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.680> big<00:00:58.920> hole<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.520> ground<00:00:59.809> but<00:01:00.809> to
