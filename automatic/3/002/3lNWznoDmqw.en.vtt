00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.319
 adventure that somewhere in this 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.270

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.270

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.859

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.859
 a complete 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.020

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.930

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:40.840

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.840

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.120
 I found them exactly in the basement of 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.470
 transition for food so I asked 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.510

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.500

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.400

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.920

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.130
 You would see clearly that 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.030

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.030
