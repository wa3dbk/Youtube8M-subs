00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.299
 good morning today we are going to make a 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.390
 exquisite carrot pudding for the 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:16.510
 that we are going to need to put in a bowl 4 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.770
 eggs 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.770
 with a cup of sugar 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.740
 and let's beat them pointed white 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.980
 once we beat the eggs with the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.570
 sugar to white let's put a cup and 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.300
 brutal pre-mix media 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:47.260
 and mix with movements 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.260
 envelopes 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.390
 a little bit of vanilla 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.410
 a spoonful of 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:03.010
 cinnamon to give it an intense flavor 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.010
 preparation 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.990
 a quarter cup of oil 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.360
 we use fresh carrots and we incorporate 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.360
 2 cups grated carrot 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.909
 finally 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.030
 We put a teaspoon of 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.030
 to bake 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.820
 we integrate all the ingredients well 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.820
 once they are all 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.650
 take some containers in this case 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.549
 some individual money but two more 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.790
 three quarters of the flannel with the 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.610
 preparation and we take it to a plate to 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.479
 a preheated oven at 200 degrees 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.479
 the lapse of 20 minutes 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.479
 once we get out of the oven for the 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.590
 puddings we are going to mount a little cream 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.590
 to half a point 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.819
 let's take advantage of some fruits of 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.819
 station 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.920
 to decorate and taste 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.170
 we can only decorate with a little 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.740
 mint 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.740
