00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.380
 Holger Vogt test on the way to his studio 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.230
 He lives and works in Wassenach. He is married and has three children 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.809
 Holger Fuchs is a sculptor, that is he models sculptures 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:20.159
 He specializes in living is first and foremost people 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:24.489
 So he already practices a demanding artist profession from Brink 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:25.909
 a lot of experience with 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:28.909
 Franz explains that he starts with a job 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.070
 that is now big around a plaster and with that it can arise 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.990
 So you need such a checked 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.790
 and in those big Cantons offered as I want that one 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.830
 do 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.720
 Be careful if we are happy that boil over with special mood 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.920
 and pretty 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.060
 you have to get out of this tone 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.610
 Moosmann 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.850
 The posthumous would like to be nominated in this following bank values 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.370
 UN then a plaster cast is made 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.240
 and then the sculpture can be poured into its final Montreal 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.810
 that can be, for example, Gibbs or Brand 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.290
 Examples of creating fox are enough to find in his studio 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.930
 Naturalistic pictures and abstracted sculptures stand there 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.320
 the spectrum is high on high-yielding today 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.880
 but above all, he looks at the human being 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.710
 if on what subject otherwise could you as an artist have a better relationship 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.240
 produce 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.200
 Kurt Fuchs sell his works to all those interested in art 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.160
 so 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.780
 they would be sold through galleries 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.640
 and percent another essential part of my job is that 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.540
 yourself 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.980
 So make art in public space if someone comes with a special one 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.930
 Desire that he wants something 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.930
 and then that's not a question of money 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.700
 for example 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.910
 a Cain and Abel sculptures 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.430
 with this split people picture fruit expressing that nothing with his 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.750
 At the same time brother has slain a part of himself 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.700
 but Holger Fuchs not only designs large sculptures for public 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.729
 courts 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:17.229
 even very small sculptures to fine imprints belonged to his 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:20.229
 the pot was 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.959
 so in the jungle 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.939
 Make your own basket an artistic Prokop 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:28.800
 and 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.789
 young person 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:34.269
 drawn painted and also 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.269
 Figures made percent but that's it then 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.479
 wanted to do it professionally and then in Dusseldorf 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:44.699
 then test Danzmann learned my profession and then cheers 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:47.579
 someday studied art 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.809
 feels where Rolf Beyer and and then pop me determined duos 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.019
 keep your eyes open 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.749
 The next time they give up NATO 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:02.939
 even if they do not want to buy Vogts figurines in the garden 10 definitely 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:03.769
 nice to look at
