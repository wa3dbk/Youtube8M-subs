00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.270 
becoming yellow and yellow we're not a
touch<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:24.060> blue<00:02:24.300> in<00:02:24.450> sight

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
touch of blue in sight

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.040 
touch of blue in sight
so<00:02:26.280> let's<00:02:26.489> unravel<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.180> mystery<00:02:27.599> once<00:02:27.870> and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
so let's unravel this mystery once and

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.650 
so let's unravel this mystery once and
for<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.620> see<00:02:29.099> how<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.400> do<00:02:29.700> color<00:02:29.940> perspective

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
for and see how to do color perspective

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.089 
for and see how to do color perspective
correctly<00:02:31.940> can<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.090> perspective<00:02:33.830> works<00:02:34.830> in

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
correctly can that perspective works in

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.309 
correctly can that perspective works in
with<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.849> nice<00:02:36.090> curtain<00:02:36.510> effect<00:02:36.599> that<00:02:37.170> we

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
with the nice curtain effect that we

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.580 
with the nice curtain effect that we
talked<00:02:37.590> about<00:02:37.739> in<00:02:38.280> aerial<00:02:38.819> perspective<00:02:39.590> you

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
talked about in aerial perspective you

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.640 
talked about in aerial perspective you
see<00:02:41.090> those<00:02:42.090> particles<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.930> sky<00:02:43.200> are

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
see those particles in the sky are

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.000 
see those particles in the sky are
reflecting<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.250> sky<00:02:44.700> color<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:45.900> if<00:02:46.290> we<00:02:46.590> have<00:02:46.800> a

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
reflecting the sky color so if we have a

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.729 
reflecting the sky color so if we have a
blue<00:02:47.280> sky<00:02:47.670> those<00:02:48.209> particles<00:02:48.930> would<00:02:49.440> reflect

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
blue sky those particles would reflect

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.360 
blue sky those particles would reflect
the<00:02:50.310> blue<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.849> the<00:02:50.880> sky<00:02:51.500> if<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.860> like<00:02:53.100> in<00:02:53.280> the

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
the blue of the sky if it like in the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.070 
the blue of the sky if it like in the
photographs<00:02:53.850> we've<00:02:54.060> just<00:02:54.269> taken<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.690> look<00:02:54.840> at

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
photographs we've just taken a look at

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.410 
photographs we've just taken a look at
the<00:02:55.590> sky<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.310> fact<00:02:56.549> yellow<00:02:57.030> those

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
the sky is in fact yellow those

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.710 
the sky is in fact yellow those
particles<00:02:58.170> will<00:02:58.380> also<00:02:58.920> reflect<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.430> yellow

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
particles will also reflect the yellow

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.259 
particles will also reflect the yellow
so<00:03:00.720> there<00:03:01.230> is<00:03:01.350> your<00:03:01.500> secret<00:03:01.739> if<00:03:02.549> you<00:03:02.850> want<00:03:03.090> to

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
so there is your secret if you want to

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.479 
so there is your secret if you want to
create<00:03:03.540> good<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.530> natural<00:03:05.250> color

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
create good and natural color

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.870 
create good and natural color
perspective<00:03:06.180> in<00:03:06.540> your<00:03:06.599> paintings<00:03:07.880> reflect

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
perspective in your paintings reflect

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.190 
perspective in your paintings reflect
the<00:03:09.840> sky<00:03:10.319> color<00:03:10.709> in<00:03:11.580> your<00:03:12.060> distant<00:03:12.599> objects

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
the sky color in your distant objects

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.039 
the sky color in your distant objects
the<00:03:13.500> further<00:03:13.799> away<00:03:14.250> they<00:03:14.730> are<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.540> more<00:03:15.840> of

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
the further away they are the more of

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.020 
the further away they are the more of
the<00:03:16.230> sky<00:03:16.500> color<00:03:16.769> they'll<00:03:17.099> reflect<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.790> the

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
the sky color they'll reflect and the
