00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.540 
actually slide live at the top of that
and<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.590> was<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> lot<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:55.980> our<00:00:56.190> thoughts

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
and that was a lot of our thoughts

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.090 
and that was a lot of our thoughts
behind<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.239> design<00:00:57.539> was<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.840> recapture<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
behind the design was to recapture the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.830 
behind the design was to recapture the
space<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.489> your<00:00:59.520> kitchen<00:00:59.940> rice<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.420> commonly<00:01:00.750> a

space of your kitchen rice is commonly a

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.630

dead<00:01:01.050> space<00:01:01.289> your<00:01:01.559> sink<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:02.070> now<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.370> becomes

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
dead space your sink but now it becomes

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.549 
dead space your sink but now it becomes
a<00:01:02.730> working<00:01:03.090> stage<00:01:03.359> correct<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.229> again<00:01:04.409> that's

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
a working stage correct and again that's

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.929 
a working stage correct and again that's
part<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> reason<00:01:05.159> for<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.369> size<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.820> this

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
part of the reason for the size on this

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.789 
part of the reason for the size on this
as<00:01:06.119> well<00:01:06.330> people<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.990> now<00:01:07.110> work<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.650> this

as well people can now work in this

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.260 
as well people can now work in this
rather<00:01:08.130> than<00:01:08.310> taking<00:01:08.490> away<00:01:08.670> space<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.210> your

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.260 
juices flow into the large basin again
making<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:25.979> more<00:01:26.100> efficient<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.670> cleaner<00:01:27.119> in

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270

we<00:01:30.619> have<00:01:30.740> a<00:01:30.770> cutting<00:01:31.039> board<00:01:31.159> over<00:01:31.310> here<00:01:31.460> again

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
we have a cutting board over here again

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.429 
we have a cutting board over here again
as<00:01:32.060> I<00:01:32.149> said<00:01:32.210> that<00:01:32.509> fits<00:01:32.810> right<00:01:33.049> into<00:01:33.259> this

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
as I said that fits right into this

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.169 
as I said that fits right into this
kitchen<00:01:33.649> sink<00:01:34.039> like<00:01:34.159> this<00:01:34.340> I<00:01:34.460> can<00:01:34.670> now<00:01:34.789> do<00:01:34.850> some

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
kitchen sink like this I can now do some

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:36.730 
kitchen sink like this I can now do some
other<00:01:35.299> work<00:01:35.390> in<00:01:35.689> here<00:01:35.840> this<00:01:36.320> could<00:01:36.500> be<00:01:36.590> used

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
other work in here this could be used

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.069 
other work in here this could be used
for<00:01:36.950> example<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.579> cut<00:01:37.850> chicken<00:01:38.270> any<00:01:38.869> of<00:01:38.990> the

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
for example to cut chicken any of the

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.510 
for example to cut chicken any of the
juices<00:01:39.259> that<00:01:39.619> come<00:01:39.860> from<00:01:39.979> that<00:01:40.189> chicken

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
juices that come from that chicken

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.010 
juices that come from that chicken
instead<00:01:40.729> of<00:01:40.850> now<00:01:41.030> running<00:01:41.329> onto<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:41.659> counter

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
instead of now running onto the counter

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.999 
instead of now running onto the counter
because<00:01:42.320> they<00:01:42.409> have<00:01:42.500> my<00:01:42.590> cutting<00:01:42.829> below<00:01:42.950> in

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
because they have my cutting below in

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.350 
because they have my cutting below in
the<00:01:43.069> counter<00:01:43.369> they'll<00:01:43.700> actually<00:01:43.880> run<00:01:44.210> down

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
the counter they'll actually run down

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.240 
the counter they'll actually run down
into<00:01:44.689> the<00:01:44.810> kitchen<00:01:44.960> sink<00:01:45.380> one<00:01:45.859> of<00:01:45.950> my<00:01:46.009> favorite
