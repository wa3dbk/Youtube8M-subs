00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.870
 just released I find it nice 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.480
 tell you about this title for several 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.520
 motives are worth the first one is because as 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.220
 good console player the one of me piss is 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.550
 a genre in this case emme fps this is 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.980
 a player this is a multi forgiveness game 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.990
 massive multiplayer fish person shooter 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.650
 true person shooter in this case is a 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.930
 massive multiplayer online and 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.820
 As you well know many of you is 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.490
 a genre that is not styled too much in 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.079
 in consoles not to say directly 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.640
 and on the other hand I also like 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.520
 tell you about him because it's about the 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:22.000
 first transmedia television series or 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.310
 something like this a somewhat new concept and 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.020
 strange in which good so much the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.210
 scifi channel television series like 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.130
 the video game go hand in hand 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.289
 the good as the story told in the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.270
 series directly affecting the 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.890
 video game good as you could see 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.229
 in the different menus that we show you 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.110
 in the video the title as good comes 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.189
 completely in English at least 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.780
 bring subtitles so we can 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.330
 find out about the story and I that you 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.679
 I promise that I am not an expert in 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.259
 Shakespeare's language I promise you that 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.789
 let's assure you I can follow him 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.170
 game without major complications so 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.659
 you should not if you like this kind of 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.060
 titles you should not worry about the 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.590
 theme of the language further comment 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.640
 Well, for example things like 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.289
 that you are seeing right now how 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.020
 We have various vehicles for 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.310
 move around a huge map to 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.850
 those who do not know with whom not 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.590
 you know the story of hans it's about 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.180
 of a science fiction story in a 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.959
 future more or less 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.409
 close in which is a failure 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.909
 alien invasion leaves the world is 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.549
 pretty changed just like 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.500
 we know in a kind of good 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:31.010
 of this post-apocalyptic world very 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.950
 style mad max reich failed audi this guy 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.540
 of stories 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.090
 neither are we going to shed anything more than 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.200
 for that is already the series and well then 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.329
 right now for example you are seeing what 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.639
 which is called a hard folk in a fall 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:47.409

 allows us to move properly by 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.900
