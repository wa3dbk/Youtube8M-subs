00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.430
 oracle meet your needs and present you the photos in the album 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.970
 photo point fr you're more efficient on TV while waiting 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.679
 the challenge for the last two years 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.890
 you promised we test his three kids the caf in the port packing 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.749
 knows pretty basic 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:23.349
 inside there are little papers said like that that does not run 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.009
 necessarily the reflection of books 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.829
 his president karfa% it happened to me to seize 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:31.970
 go away so 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.190
 I have a little corner here that is damaged 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.820
 she also took 6 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.980
 so 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.590
 here's struggling to manage a no way you have to rango who did in two 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.360
 for iran 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.360
 go a little bit in that state 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.560
 so you would be this information by 37 th 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.039
 this new format at home 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.469
 the beta too 95 so it's not very expensive for this format 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.360
 for 24 pages% 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.490
 it's a custom hard cover 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.510
 so I was able to put the picture here 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.240
 but on the back of the text 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.140
 you have 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.560
 right here 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.050
 their website addresses 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.180
 could he do on the slice 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.180
 and it's paper that makes only 170 golfers 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.770
 inside so it's not for that format it's starting to make a 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.300
 little bit light 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.040
 but good rastani% 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.210
 to pray a little low so 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.360
 This is understandable 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.200
 afraid of the order that's not bad you can add a word 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.010
 in Europe 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.620
 when your order so if you make a delivery to a friend it can be 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.840
 friendly 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.840
 I think the other airports should be inspired by it 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.870
 it allows to make it a gift at a distance while being a word 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.400
 recipient 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.400
 so the book looked together 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.290
 overall enough 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.470
 go a mean pressure that is false 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.249
 not so good 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:10.089
 sure % 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:13.229
 on this photo there for example I do not know if it's okay upstream to the 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:14.229
 camera 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:16.499
 but we see 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:20.899
 d 10% and streaks% and especially hen high as in all the sky 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:28.459
 all in all it's a certain moment there the weft the stone pressure 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.959
 who did that so on the photos for a photo like that it's not seen 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.719
 not but on the 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:38.609
 these photos have brought to be not bad even steel color with its terraces 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.609
 to receive 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.479
 you go the software and as you have% 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:57.259
 a little trick is a step like that a meter 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.639
 the flesh tones are snow davignon 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.249
 I can tell you that it's okay 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.829
 why I made a double page 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.829
 with the software 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.709
 so here we find in the sky the problem you indicate everything to 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.709
 time 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.019
 slightly excessive saturation mayor 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.849
 nothing serious it is in the average 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.239
 here it is again with 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.390
 a picture in June the gradient of blue and heavy 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:44.489
 the problem 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.489
 we will be back 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:49.740
 it's the same 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.740
 watch more closely 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.829
 so all that is halal degraded air 

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:03.169
 after an air hole 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.069
 another topic to the problem 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.909
 but at least I keep these details but% 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:12.819
 like again 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.819
 not bad this workshop points 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.709
 these cells these lines 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.709
 the little the visit 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.680
 franck must put some must turn in the background like that on both 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.909
 pages makes jute carry southern 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.069
 Michel was a bit unlikely 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.590
 he claims pressure in vain 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.660
 is not terrible after that are the sea lions that are quite low so 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.569
 it depends on you if you want% 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.689
 something not too expensive because we still have 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:58.560
 the questioned the survival of their personality and format 30 years 30 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.370
 but after if you want% and to make you events and that it was 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.370
 rare and other laboratories that satisfy you better 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.169
 see you soon for more tests on all labs points like
