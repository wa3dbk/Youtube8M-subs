00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.250
 great you understand us today new 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.010
 video called deck review 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:13.230
 blindly and let's see what we have 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:16.170
 in this bitch here we have boyse q &amp; q 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.529
 this is an unusual deck and now you will understand 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.960
 why what we see in general only 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.439
 We look at her, of course, no bright 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.390
 paint is really environmentally friendly 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.410
 clean deck as it says 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.739
 the manufacturer is the only thing here 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.270
 chemistry is this one 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.090
 plastic tongue 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.210
 it serves to hang here 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.710
 so here's a deck on a shop window on 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.110
 any way there but besides 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.030
 there is no more tongue here 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:57.449
 chemical everything is clean 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:00.690
 Environmentally we look at the box with us 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.149
 made from blank cardboard and we see 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.250
 Again, I repeat no bright colors 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.340
 as the manufacturer says 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.450
 Now I will tell you what the pump is 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.540
 us in this deck 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.520
 the first is that the cards are made from 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.740
 pure wood 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.549
 no chemical additives here 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.759
 is used 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:25.259
 the second is that we have arcachon coating 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:29.070
 finish but this is generally not done with 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.650
 chemistry and thanks to natural as we 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.180
 we understand the starch that is made from 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.070
 as you understood 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:42.000
 plants so drove on 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:46.170
 paint as we see here only dark 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.320
 they are made from vegetable processing 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.070
 fruits I mean products are not here 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.860
 no red chemicals what 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.110
 the main thing that is absolutely completely 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.840
 deck 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.420
 meet environmental standards very 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.409
 cool well done what did this deck 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.660
 but so we understand one deck 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.850
 Generally not a deck of basic 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.790
 poles and only one deck 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.160
 ecologically clean it is unfortunately bad 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.370
 Well, let's see what we have 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.360
 picking joker really 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.940
 of course 2 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.750
 guarantee joker routine like a kill 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.320
 standard 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.960
 and here we are, we see the troops 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.790
 standard stopped black what 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.350
 joker here we have such a dark green 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.360
 then we go all the cards on the glass 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.470
 standard the only thing different is 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.630
 these are the numbers of ki and letters on the maps 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.060
 with faces 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.120
 they are quite a bit different in 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.000
 the size and the rest is all identical afraid 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.880
 Who is the standard further thoughts here cards with 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.180
 their faces are different only 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.870
 coloring the color scheme where we 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:08.010
 should be yellow and red with us 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.480
 everything is dark green and again I repeat 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.780
 what is not used here 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.170
 no chemical paints are all natural 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.860
 after processing products 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:22.740
 King went on home and then at 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.110
 us go red cards here they are too 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.270
 red nowhere is such a 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.040
 dark green 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.140
 then we go here such cards here 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.750
 already where used 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:40.170
 the yellow color is not even ice and the colors are here from 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.140
 use some points like this 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.350
 that's brighter green as a dish 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.300
 yellow here is such as is still 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.690
 no color is used again 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.270
 chemistry repeat next we go 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.209
 normal under the standard only friends 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.840
 a little characters here and here again 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:04.680
 again, everything is like an apiary standard 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:08.120
 so what else do we have here 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.190
 two cards first card we have advertising 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.870
 we have the second card 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.770
 similarly adware as a presentation 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.630
 eco edition of the deck and here is such a she 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:23.500
 rear basic editions 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:26.200
 there is such a deck here that means 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:32.320
 what is this real real deck 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:34.510
 no fake so look at shirt 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.250
 shirt so catch rub most 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.300
 basic all standard 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:43.210
 but eco no paint here 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.950
 only recycled 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.200
 products from thanks to these 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.380
 recycled product is displayed here 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.050
 so here's the color I honestly right away 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.540
 thought that 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.710
 no ecological deck at all 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:02.490
 will be much worse than the standard requested 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:06.060
 will not succeed because 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:09.460
 starch he might somehow not there 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.730
 evaporates will remain on the hands in the very 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:16.450
 really nothing true this deck whit 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:19.990
 better than standard Barsika it even more 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:26.200
 it turned out better I have been with her for a long time 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:28.720
 Engaged in more than a year but with her so 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:33.700
 as with other cards nothing 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:36.430
 happen if we take the right say 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:40.480
 pick up basic from standard and it's fighters 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:43.840
 canines what in my opinion they have 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:47.200
 the differences first are ecological 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.230
 part of the net card is a big plus 1 on 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.840
 secondly they will not last longer 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:56.260
 same standards either dried up I don't know what with 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:06:00.280
 it is connected but in my opinion already this experience 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:02.050
 deck has served longer than 100 here 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.380
 such a deck here all thanks for 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:08.430
 attention sign up like 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.430
 new meetings yet
