00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
three or four different kinds I'm going

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.420 
three or four different kinds I'm going
to<00:00:18.189> have<00:00:18.340> like<00:00:18.520> a<00:00:18.550> regular<00:00:18.880> they<00:00:19.840> have

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
to have like a regular they have
