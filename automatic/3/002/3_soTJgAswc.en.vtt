00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.140 
Mazda rx-7 now this is a car that I

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
think I probably should have done a

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.330 
think I probably should have done a
while<00:02:33.420> back<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.870> be<00:02:33.990> honest<00:02:34.230> with<00:02:34.380> you<00:02:34.500> it's<00:02:35.010> a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
while back to be honest with you it's a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.610 
while back to be honest with you it's a

great looking car it just it's just a
beast<00:02:41.760> car<00:02:42.180> that's<00:02:42.540> really<00:02:42.870> all<00:02:43.230> there<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.560> to

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
beast car that's really all there is to

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.090 
beast car that's really all there is to
it<00:02:44.190> now<00:02:44.790> as<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.540> saw<00:02:45.810> earlier<00:02:46.050> in<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.440> video<00:02:46.650> I

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
it now as you saw earlier in the video I

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.230 
it now as you saw earlier in the video I
put<00:02:48.170> full-size<00:02:49.170> Greek<00:02:49.860> front<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.550> rear<00:02:50.820> tires

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
put full-size Greek front and rear tires

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.420 
put full-size Greek front and rear tires
on<00:02:51.600> this<00:02:51.960> car<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.740> think<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.160> might<00:02:53.340> have

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
on this car and I think that might have

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.460 
on this car and I think that might have
been<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.610> mistake<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.240> think<00:02:54.270> I<00:02:54.720> should<00:02:55.380> have

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
been a mistake I think I should have

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.220 
been a mistake I think I should have
gone<00:02:55.740> a<00:02:55.800> little<00:02:56.070> bit<00:02:56.220> smaller<00:02:56.820> on<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.270> front

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
gone a little bit smaller on the front

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.610 
gone a little bit smaller on the front
tires<00:02:58.590> because<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.610> think<00:03:00.510> going<00:03:01.140> too<00:03:01.320> big<00:03:01.500> on

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
tires because I think going too big on

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.500 
tires because I think going too big on
the<00:03:01.710> front<00:03:01.950> tires<00:03:02.220> made<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.060> car<00:03:03.300> a<00:03:03.330> little

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
the front tires made the car a little

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.840 
the front tires made the car a little
twitchy<00:03:03.960> I<00:03:04.260> mean<00:03:04.710> it's<00:03:04.890> still<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.160> good<00:03:05.490> drift

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
twitchy I mean it's still a good drift

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.000 
twitchy I mean it's still a good drift
car<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.210> still<00:03:06.420> works<00:03:06.690> well<00:03:06.990> but<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:07.980> next

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
car it still works well but the next

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.190 
car it still works well but the next
time<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.460> use<00:03:08.670> this<00:03:08.850> car<00:03:09.120> I'm<00:03:09.330> definitely<00:03:10.050> going

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
time I use this car I'm definitely going

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.660 
time I use this car I'm definitely going
to<00:03:10.290> reduce<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.800> size<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.160> front<00:03:11.340> tires

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
to reduce the size of the front tires

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.220 
to reduce the size of the front tires
because<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.150> think<00:03:12.210> it's<00:03:12.450> making<00:03:12.630> it<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:13.020> bit

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
because I think it's making it a bit

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.040 
because I think it's making it a bit
twitchy<00:03:13.560> come<00:03:14.400> in<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:15.180> know<00:03:15.330> in<00:03:15.480> comparison

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
of this car into position in to get it

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.570 
of this car into position in to get it
to<00:03:44.489> actually<00:03:44.910> stay<00:03:45.680> welded<00:03:46.680> into<00:03:46.920> this<00:03:47.130> drift

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
to actually stay welded into this drift

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.500 
to actually stay welded into this drift
oh<00:03:47.700> no<00:03:47.760> it's<00:03:47.940> welded

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
oh no it's welded

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.070 
oh no it's welded
to<00:03:48.599> the<00:03:48.689> drift<00:03:48.959> is<00:03:49.110> an<00:03:49.200> actual<00:03:49.530> term<00:03:50.430> but

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
to the drift is an actual term but

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.630 
to the drift is an actual term but
anyway<00:03:52.080> you<00:03:52.230> could<00:03:52.379> see<00:03:52.590> we<00:03:53.069> wanted<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.400> swing

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
anyway you could see we wanted to swing

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.470 
anyway you could see we wanted to swing
back<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.970> other<00:03:54.120> way

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
back the other way

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.369 
back the other way
so<00:03:54.840> get<00:03:55.530> very<00:03:55.860> twitchy<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:57.079> that's<00:03:58.079> why

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
so get very twitchy and that's why

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.259 
so get very twitchy and that's why
that's<00:03:58.799> why<00:03:59.040> from<00:03:59.310> now<00:03:59.370> on<00:03:59.700> I'm<00:03:59.939> not<00:04:00.120> gonna

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
that's why from now on I'm not gonna

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.940 
that's why from now on I'm not gonna
upgrade<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.870> front<00:04:01.110> tires<00:04:01.349> all<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.769> way<00:04:01.920> I

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
upgrade the front tires all the way I

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.699 
upgrade the front tires all the way I
think<00:04:02.310> I'm<00:04:02.430> just<00:04:02.670> gonna<00:04:02.790> go<00:04:03.090> half<00:04:03.659> way<00:04:03.689> if<00:04:04.319> that

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
think I'm just gonna go half way if that

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.009 
think I'm just gonna go half way if that
because<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:06.030> seems<00:04:06.360> to<00:04:06.510> me<00:04:06.540> that<00:04:06.629> whenever<00:04:06.959> I
