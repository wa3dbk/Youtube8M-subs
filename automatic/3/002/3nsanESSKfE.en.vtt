I<00:00:25.490> don't<00:00:26.490> want<00:00:26.640> noise<00:00:29.090> so<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:31.309> if

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
I don't want noise so that so that if

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.940 
I don't want noise so that so that if
you<00:00:32.399> go<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.520> CPU<00:00:32.910> Contech<00:00:33.620> disable<00:00:34.620> cool<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
you go to CPU Contech disable cool and

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.280 
you go to CPU Contech disable cool and
quiet<00:00:35.130> because<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.880> slows<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.690> process<00:00:37.140> it

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
quiet because it slows to process it

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.459

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
in use which is a good feature but it

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.319 
in use which is a good feature but it
will<00:00:43.710> mess<00:00:43.890> your<00:00:44.040> own<00:00:44.219> clock<00:00:44.460> up<00:00:44.670> sometimes

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
will mess your own clock up sometimes

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.650 
will mess your own clock up sometimes

you're<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:53.039> likely<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.520> use<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.210> disable

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
you're not likely to use that so disable

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.770

so<00:04:28.870> saving<00:04:29.110> resets<00:04:29.940> not<00:04:30.940> sure<00:04:31.150> yours<00:04:31.450> will<00:04:31.600> be

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
so saving resets not sure yours will be

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.600 
so saving resets not sure yours will be
but<00:04:32.320> I<00:04:32.500> wouldn't<00:04:32.770> recommend<00:04:33.070> putting<00:04:33.280> any

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
but I wouldn't recommend putting any

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.210 
but I wouldn't recommend putting any
more<00:04:33.760> about<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.120> turn<00:04:34.180> nine<00:04:34.330> because<00:04:34.990> well<00:04:35.260> it

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
more about to turn nine because well it

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.510 
more about to turn nine because well it
will<00:04:36.400> ruin<00:04:36.669> a<00:04:36.820> bit<00:04:36.940> toasty
