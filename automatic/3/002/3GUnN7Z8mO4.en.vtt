00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
I've put this on low heat and we are

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.450 
I've put this on low heat and we are
going<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.000> begin<00:01:06.150> by<00:01:06.680> melting<00:01:07.680> our<00:01:08.010> butter<00:01:08.280> in

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
going to begin by melting our butter in

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.240 
going to begin by melting our butter in
here<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:09.720> let<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.200> melt<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.680> then<00:01:11.100> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
here so just let this melt and then the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.120 
here so just let this melt and then the
next<00:01:11.280> step<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:11.970> whisk<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.930> our<00:01:13.729> flour<00:01:16.130> when

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
next step is to whisk in our flour when

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.530 
next step is to whisk in our flour when
you're<00:01:17.250> adding<00:01:17.400> flour<00:01:17.729> into<00:01:18.030> any<00:01:18.240> sort<00:01:18.420> of

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
you're adding flour into any sort of

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.760 
you're adding flour into any sort of
liquid<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.110> always<00:01:19.320> want<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.530> do<00:01:19.650> it

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
liquid you always want to do it

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.950 
liquid you always want to do it
gradually<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> liquid<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.420> absorb

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
gradually so that the liquid can absorb

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.570 
gradually so that the liquid can absorb
the<00:01:22.140> flower<00:01:22.380> rather<00:01:23.040> than<00:01:23.189> kind<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.460> like

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
the flower rather than kind of like

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.800 
the flower rather than kind of like
overwhelming<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:26.060> just<00:01:27.060> whisk<00:01:27.420> whisk<00:01:27.600> whisk

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
overwhelming it just whisk whisk whisk

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.330 
overwhelming it just whisk whisk whisk
so<00:01:28.229> we're<00:01:28.320> going<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.500> keep<00:01:28.680> going<00:01:28.890> until<00:01:29.159> this

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
so we're going to keep going until this

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.600 
so we're going to keep going until this
is<00:01:29.520> all<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.729> here<00:01:30.060> incorporated<00:01:31.310> now<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.369> are

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
is all in here incorporated now we are

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.880 
is all in here incorporated now we are
going<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.030> gradually<00:01:33.990> add<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.590> our<00:01:34.799> milk<00:01:36.890> these

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
going to gradually add in our milk these

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.920 
going to gradually add in our milk these
little<00:01:38.220> sort<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.460> like<00:01:38.640> little<00:01:39.360> falls<00:01:39.689> of

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
will start to melt into a paste as you

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.240 
will start to melt into a paste as you
incorporate<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.540> milk<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.130> be
