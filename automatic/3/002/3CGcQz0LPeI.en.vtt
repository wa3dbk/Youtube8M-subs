00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:08.500
 after three years that for me they are going to 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.950
 be unforgettable for my family 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.980
 and above all 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.220
 the most important thing to thank the treatment 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.290
 I have received all this time from the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.330
 my teammates' club hobby and 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.119
 I do not expect anything to go very well in 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.450
 I wish her a lot of luck and for me she is 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.960
 a 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.300
 a new project a change in my life 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.430
 I think it's good for me for my family 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.150
 what is important also and follow 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.340
 growing 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.470
 I believe that 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.840
 that could have been and I think it's a 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.140
 good operation for good valence 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.840
 for me 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.400
 and all this time that swims a side 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.360
 If I have not done it, it has been for no 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.640
 damage the image of valenciÃ  

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.610
 so as not to prejudice the process of 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.140
 operation and I think it was convenient not to 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.230
 talk to talk or farewell when 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.250
 be clear and I motivate my progress 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.720
 is 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.490
 that I do not trust the project I think that 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.310
 that the president of all this time has 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.260
 told many lies to me 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.910
 personally by phone at times 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.920
 I talk to him I think to you the 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.540
 information that you have given much I believe 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.260
 that is his fault for things that has 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.870
 filtered and that good thing has made me 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.360
 a lot of damage to me to my agents that stops 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.200
 me is like new they are like my family 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.490
 and I'm hurt because of that because I've 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.290
 said is a good operation for the 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.200
 two parts I think it could have been done 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.690
 everything as clearly as possible with 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.360
 sincerity I think they have lacked the 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.390
 true many things and I say I am here 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.770
 to see no reason why I'm 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.250
 hurt specifically with the club 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.320
 why 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.930
 I think they do not benefit anything 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.460
 to this project that he has in mind not 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.530
 I want to harm neither, much less 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.260
 to my colleagues who left them there with 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.509
 all the illusion of the world and I do not believe 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:13.409
 in its forms in your project 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.939
 and I wish I was wrong and good this 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.379
 president mark a time that is the 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:18.269
 president that more titles consider the 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.909
 valencia- and he is already wishing you much 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.080
 luck to him to valencia to valencianismo 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.690
 what 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.890
 has joined is very strong and what good 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.890
 that both me and my family 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.990
 we 're going to have everyone in our hearts and 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.990
 It is done
