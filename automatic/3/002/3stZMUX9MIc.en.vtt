especially because super simple recipe
you<00:00:20.440> can<00:00:20.590> make<00:00:20.770> it<00:00:20.950> complicated<00:00:21.610> and<00:00:21.910> make<00:00:22.000> it

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
you can make it complicated and make it

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.330 
you can make it complicated and make it
more<00:00:22.210> interesting<00:00:22.750> and<00:00:22.869> complex<00:00:23.230> but<00:00:24.010> this<00:00:24.190> is

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
more interesting and complex but this is

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.220 
more interesting and complex but this is
just<00:00:24.580> the<00:00:24.730> most<00:00:24.910> simple<00:00:25.390> recipe<00:00:25.900> that<00:00:26.110> I've

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
just the most simple recipe that I've

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.019 
just the most simple recipe that I've
done<00:00:26.470> and<00:00:26.920> I<00:00:27.010> kind<00:00:27.220> of<00:00:27.250> just<00:00:27.430> did<00:00:27.640> it<00:00:27.790> when<00:00:28.000> I

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
done and I kind of just did it when I

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.700 
done and I kind of just did it when I
didn't<00:00:28.390> have<00:00:28.510> my<00:00:28.660> normal<00:00:28.720> ingredients<00:00:29.560> that<00:00:29.680> I

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
didn't have my normal ingredients that I

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.170 
didn't have my normal ingredients that I
usually<00:00:29.890> do<00:00:30.250> it<00:00:30.369> with<00:00:30.490> and<00:00:30.700> I<00:00:30.730> wanted<00:00:30.970> to<00:00:31.029> make

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
usually do it with and I wanted to make

usually do it with and I wanted to make
it<00:00:31.329> really<00:00:31.509> fast<00:00:31.750> so<00:00:32.650> I'm<00:00:33.250> going<00:00:33.520> to<00:00:33.550> be<00:00:33.700> using

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
it really fast so I'm going to be using

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.770 
it really fast so I'm going to be using

seasoning<00:00:40.450> so<00:00:41.410> you<00:00:41.860> can<00:00:42.040> use<00:00:42.220> whatever<00:00:42.460> nut

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
seasoning so you can use whatever nut

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.900 
seasoning so you can use whatever nut
you<00:00:42.970> want<00:00:43.239> I<00:00:43.510> tend<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.440> use<00:00:44.530> walnuts<00:00:45.280> typically

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
you want I tend to use walnuts typically

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.660 
you want I tend to use walnuts typically
but<00:00:46.149> almonds<00:00:46.570> work<00:00:46.840> really<00:00:47.079> well<00:00:47.380> too<00:00:47.590> so<00:00:48.190> I'm

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
but almonds work really well too so I'm

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.920 
but almonds work really well too so I'm
just<00:00:48.850> gonna<00:00:48.970> chop<00:00:49.360> up<00:00:49.740> some<00:00:50.740> of<00:00:50.860> this<00:00:50.980> carrot

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
just gonna chop up some of this carrot

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.180 
just gonna chop up some of this carrot
we're<00:00:52.930> gonna<00:00:53.050> make<00:00:53.230> this<00:00:53.350> meat<00:00:53.620> in<00:00:53.830> the<00:00:54.040> food

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
we're gonna make this meat in the food

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.400 
we're gonna make this meat in the food
processor<00:00:55.830> not<00:00:56.830> gonna<00:00:57.070> really<00:00:57.280> measure<00:00:58.410> I

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
processor not gonna really measure I

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.170 
processor not gonna really measure I
think<00:00:59.890> it's<00:01:00.040> a<00:01:00.160> good<00:01:00.340> idea<00:01:00.460> to<00:01:00.790> get<00:01:00.910> in<00:01:01.090> the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
think it's a good idea to get in the

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.960 
think it's a good idea to get in the
habit<00:01:01.360> of<00:01:01.680> not<00:01:02.680> having<00:01:03.130> to<00:01:03.160> measure<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:03.790> just

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
habit of not having to measure and just

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.240 
habit of not having to measure and just
being<00:01:04.150> able<00:01:04.239> to<00:01:04.420> kind<00:01:04.720> of<00:01:04.780> eyeball<00:01:05.259> it<00:01:05.799> or<00:01:05.979> gasp

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
being able to kind of eyeball it or gasp

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:17.270 
being able to kind of eyeball it or gasp
go<00:01:07.210> with<00:01:07.360> your<00:01:07.509> intuition<00:01:14.759> okay<00:01:15.759> so<00:01:15.970> this<00:01:16.270> is

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
go with your intuition okay so this is

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:28.890 
go with your intuition okay so this is
probably<00:01:18.810> one<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:19.930> a<00:01:19.960> half<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.320> two<00:01:20.470> cups<00:01:27.900> to

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
probably one and a half to two cups to

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.070 
probably one and a half to two cups to
two<00:01:29.080> cups<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.850> could<00:01:31.000> also<00:01:31.150> use<00:01:31.510> soap<00:01:31.870> to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
two cups you could also use soap to

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.200 
two cups you could also use soap to
sunflower<00:01:32.680> seeds<00:01:33.070> those<00:01:33.340> work<00:01:33.580> really<00:01:33.610> well<00:01:34.000> I

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
sunflower seeds those work really well I

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.240 
sunflower seeds those work really well I
have<00:01:34.420> never<00:01:34.630> done<00:01:35.320> this<00:01:35.650> recipe<00:01:36.040> with<00:01:36.220> just

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
have never done this recipe with just

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.090 
have never done this recipe with just
soap<00:01:36.940> sunflower<00:01:37.450> seeds<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:37.870> carrots<00:01:38.229> but<00:01:38.440> if

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
soap sunflower seeds and carrots but if

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.460 
soap sunflower seeds and carrots but if
I<00:01:39.310> were<00:01:39.490> using<00:01:39.670> them<00:01:39.970> I<00:01:40.000> would<00:01:40.270> do<00:01:40.420> half<00:01:40.659> half

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
I were using them I would do half half

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.800 
I were using them I would do half half
the<00:01:41.650> nuts<00:01:41.860> and<00:01:42.360> substitute<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.479> rest<00:01:43.659> of

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
the nuts and substitute the rest of

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.690 
the nuts and substitute the rest of
those<00:01:43.930> nuts<00:01:44.170> with<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.620> sunflower<00:01:45.370> seeds

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
those nuts with the sunflower seeds

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.330 
those nuts with the sunflower seeds
they're<00:01:45.909> just<00:01:46.409> if<00:01:47.409> you're<00:01:47.620> trying<00:01:47.950> to<00:01:48.010> do<00:01:48.159> less

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
they're just if you're trying to do less

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.740 
they're just if you're trying to do less
nuts<00:01:48.640> it's<00:01:48.820> nice<00:01:48.970> to<00:01:49.120> do<00:01:49.240> that<00:01:49.390> and<00:01:49.540> they<00:01:49.600> offer

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
nuts it's nice to do that and they offer

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.390 
nuts it's nice to do that and they offer
a<00:01:49.930> different<00:01:50.350> texture<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:50.920> sort<00:01:51.159> of<00:01:51.220> just

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
a different texture and sort of just

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.130 
a different texture and sort of just
another<00:01:51.729> level<00:01:52.000> of<00:01:52.210> flavor<00:01:52.390> so<00:01:52.630> that's<00:01:52.990> always

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
another level of flavor so that's always

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.620 
another level of flavor so that's always
an<00:01:53.350> option<00:01:53.790> alright<00:01:54.790> and<00:01:55.000> I'm<00:01:55.120> just<00:01:55.299> going<00:01:55.510> to

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
an option alright and I'm just going to

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.300 
an option alright and I'm just going to
add<00:01:56.260> some<00:01:57.010> sea<00:01:57.370> salt<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:59.159> when<00:02:00.159> you're

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
add some sea salt and when you're

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.100 
add some sea salt and when you're
eyeballing<00:02:00.760> it<00:02:01.330> playing<00:02:01.690> around<00:02:01.840> with<00:02:01.960> in

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
eyeballing it playing around with in

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.780 
eyeballing it playing around with in
developing<00:02:02.530> this<00:02:02.680> kind<00:02:02.860> of<00:02:02.950> scale<00:02:03.159> always<00:02:03.490> go

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
developing this kind of scale always go

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.460 
developing this kind of scale always go
with<00:02:04.060> less<00:02:04.390> because<00:02:04.750> you<00:02:04.840> can<00:02:04.960> always<00:02:05.110> add

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
with less because you can always add

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.740 
with less because you can always add
more<00:02:05.500> if<00:02:06.400> you<00:02:06.460> need<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:06.970> later<00:02:07.210> or<00:02:07.390> so<00:02:07.570> it's

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
more if you need to later or so it's

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.960 
more if you need to later or so it's
harder<00:02:08.049> to<00:02:08.259> change<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.679> recipe<00:02:09.129> when<00:02:09.429> you've

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
harder to change a recipe when you've

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.460 
harder to change a recipe when you've
added<00:02:10.119> a<00:02:10.299> whole<00:02:10.420> bunch<00:02:10.479> of<00:02:10.720> salt<00:02:10.929> and<00:02:11.230> then<00:02:11.349> you

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
added a whole bunch of salt and then you

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.080 
added a whole bunch of salt and then you
taste<00:02:11.709> it<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.189> then<00:02:12.310> it's<00:02:12.430> way<00:02:12.640> too<00:02:12.700> salty

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
taste it and then it's way too salty

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.240 
taste it and then it's way too salty
then<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.019> have<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.260> add<00:02:14.379> a<00:02:14.409> bunch<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.799> one<00:02:14.980> or

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
then you have to add a bunch of one or

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.369 
then you have to add a bunch of one or
add<00:02:15.549> a<00:02:15.580> bunch<00:02:15.819> of<00:02:15.970> more<00:02:16.569> of<00:02:16.689> the<00:02:16.810> almonds<00:02:17.230> add

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
add a bunch of more of the almonds add

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.720 
add a bunch of more of the almonds add
more<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.799> carrots<00:02:18.129> and<00:02:18.250> then<00:02:18.340> you<00:02:18.459> end<00:02:18.610> up

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
more of the carrots and then you end up

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.550 
more of the carrots and then you end up
with<00:02:18.849> a<00:02:18.879> huge<00:02:19.150> batch<00:02:19.390> just<00:02:19.750> because<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.349> kind

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
with a huge batch just because you kind

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.860 
with a huge batch just because you kind
of<00:02:20.620> started<00:02:20.920> off<00:02:21.040> with<00:02:21.189> too<00:02:21.340> much<00:02:21.489> salt<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.090> go

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
of started off with too much salt so go

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.650 
of started off with too much salt so go
with<00:02:22.959> less<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.410> then<00:02:23.500> add<00:02:23.680> more<00:02:23.890> as<00:02:24.099> needed

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
with less and then add more as needed

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.120 
with less and then add more as needed
and<00:02:25.660> I'm<00:02:25.990> probably<00:02:26.140> doing<00:02:26.319> a<00:02:26.500> tablespoon

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
and I'm probably doing a tablespoon

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.210 
and I'm probably doing a tablespoon
maybe<00:02:27.940> one<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.480> half<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.290> taco

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
maybe one and a half of the taco

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.100 
maybe one and a half of the taco
seasoning<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:31.150> then<00:02:31.330> that's<00:02:31.569> it<00:02:31.840> for<00:02:32.050> the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
seasoning and then that's it for the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.390 
seasoning and then that's it for the
meat<00:02:32.260> we're<00:02:32.410> just<00:02:32.560> going<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:32.770> process<00:02:32.980> this

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
meat we're just going to process this

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.210 
meat we're just going to process this
until<00:02:34.360> it's<00:02:34.900> kind<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.170> crumbly<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:35.620> it'll

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
until it's kind of crumbly and it'll

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.309 
until it's kind of crumbly and it'll
become<00:02:36.340> very<00:02:36.520> obvious<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.270> it<00:02:37.420> becomes<00:02:38.050> this

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
become very obvious that it becomes this

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.800 
become very obvious that it becomes this
texture<00:02:38.830> up<00:02:39.010> kind<00:02:39.190> of<00:02:39.220> like<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.370> taco<00:02:39.640> meat<00:02:39.910> all

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
texture up kind of like a taco meat all

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.559 
texture up kind of like a taco meat all
right<00:02:40.959> so<00:02:41.110> we've<00:02:41.260> got<00:02:41.440> our<00:02:41.590> taco<00:02:42.180> done<00:02:43.209> I'm

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
right so we've got our taco done I'm

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.790 
right so we've got our taco done I'm
just<00:02:43.750> pull<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.530> blade<00:02:44.800> out<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.250> here<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:47.319> you

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
just pull the blade out of here and you

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.520 
just pull the blade out of here and you
can<00:02:47.920> see<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:48.520> looks<00:02:49.239> like<00:02:49.360> taco<00:02:49.810> meat<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.230> if

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
can see it looks like taco meat and if

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.839 
can see it looks like taco meat and if
you<00:02:50.650> want<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.130> have<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.310> stronger<00:02:51.700> flavor

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
you want it to have a stronger flavor

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.790 
you want it to have a stronger flavor
then<00:02:52.390> definitely<00:02:52.690> just<00:02:53.020> add<00:02:53.290> more<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.650> the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
then definitely just add more of the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.550 
then definitely just add more of the
taco<00:02:54.010> seasoning<00:02:54.750> all<00:02:55.750> right<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.080> I<00:02:56.110> really

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
taco seasoning all right so I really

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.770 
taco seasoning all right so I really
like<00:02:56.770> using<00:02:56.980> romaine<00:02:57.520> for<00:02:57.849> this<00:02:58.000> because<00:02:58.330> the

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
like using romaine for this because the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.809 
like using romaine for this because the
taco<00:02:59.170> meat<00:02:59.319> is<00:02:59.560> like<00:02:59.680> nice<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.130> hearty<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.550> so

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
taco meat is like nice and hearty and so

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.190 
taco meat is like nice and hearty and so
I<00:03:00.849> want<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.120> use<00:03:01.209> something<00:03:01.420> crisp<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.020> kind

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
I want to use something crisp and kind

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.229 
I want to use something crisp and kind
of<00:03:02.290> with<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:02.890> little<00:03:03.160> more<00:03:03.280> water<00:03:03.520> content<00:03:04.090> or

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
of with a little more water content or

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.720 
of with a little more water content or
the<00:03:04.630> actual<00:03:05.050> taco<00:03:05.980> leaf<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:08.440> she's<00:03:09.310> gonna<00:03:09.430> take

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
the actual taco leaf so she's gonna take

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.750 
the actual taco leaf so she's gonna take
a<00:03:10.030> big<00:03:10.360> old<00:03:10.540> broom<00:03:11.380> a<00:03:11.530> leaf<00:03:11.800> lettuce<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.520> I

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
a big old broom a leaf lettuce and I

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.540 
a big old broom a leaf lettuce and I
broke<00:03:13.390> it<00:03:13.540> off<00:03:13.660> because<00:03:14.560> this<00:03:14.830> bottom<00:03:15.160> part<00:03:15.400> is

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
broke it off because this bottom part is

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.580 
broke it off because this bottom part is
kind<00:03:15.849> of<00:03:15.910> just<00:03:16.209> it's<00:03:16.510> very<00:03:16.840> very<00:03:17.110> crunchy<00:03:17.319> and

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
kind of just it's very very crunchy and

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.260 
kind of just it's very very crunchy and
you<00:03:17.680> can't<00:03:17.920> fit<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.220> whole<00:03:18.489> lot<00:03:18.700> in<00:03:18.879> there<00:03:19.060> like

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
you can't fit a whole lot in there like

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.850 
you can't fit a whole lot in there like
when<00:03:19.420> you<00:03:19.510> try<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.690> wrap<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.110> up<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:20.410> kind<00:03:20.739> of

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
when you try to wrap it up it kind of

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.250 
when you try to wrap it up it kind of
just<00:03:21.040> falls<00:03:21.550> out<00:03:21.879> at<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.360> place<00:03:22.599> so<00:03:23.230> I

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
just falls out at that place so I

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.290 
just falls out at that place so I
usually<00:03:23.650> just<00:03:23.830> stick<00:03:24.580> it<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.879> side<00:03:25.090> and

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
usually just stick it to the side and

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.020 
usually just stick it to the side and
don't<00:03:25.390> bother<00:03:25.599> with<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:27.330> and<00:03:29.879> just<00:03:30.879> gonna

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
don't bother with it and just gonna

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.449 
don't bother with it and just gonna
scoop<00:03:31.450> a<00:03:31.660> little<00:03:31.900> bit<00:03:32.050> of<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.440> taco<00:03:33.069> meat<00:03:33.099> in

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
scoop a little bit of the taco meat in

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:42.780 
scoop a little bit of the taco meat in
there

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.979 

and<00:03:43.790> then<00:03:43.909> I've<00:03:44.030> got<00:03:44.209> a<00:03:44.239> little<00:03:44.510> bit<00:03:44.599> of<00:03:44.689> corn

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
and then I've got a little bit of corn

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.869 
and then I've got a little bit of corn
and<00:03:45.319> the<00:03:45.439> trick<00:03:45.650> that<00:03:45.769> I<00:03:45.860> found<00:03:46.069> with<00:03:46.219> corn<00:03:46.519> is

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
and the trick that I found with corn is

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.660 
and the trick that I found with corn is
you<00:03:47.599> can<00:03:47.780> typically<00:03:48.200> get<00:03:48.500> some<00:03:48.799> non-gmo

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
you can typically get some non-gmo

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.599 
you can typically get some non-gmo
organic<00:03:50.260> frozen<00:03:51.260> corn<00:03:51.620> in<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:52.010> store<00:03:52.280> and

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
organic frozen corn in the store and

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:53.979 
organic frozen corn in the store and
there<00:03:52.730> are<00:03:52.879> times<00:03:53.329> of<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.599> year<00:03:53.780> where<00:03:53.959> you

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
there are times of the year where you

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.110 
there are times of the year where you
can<00:03:54.230> get<00:03:54.319> it<00:03:54.439> fresh<00:03:54.650> but<00:03:55.280> what<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:55.459> like<00:03:55.670> the

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
can get it fresh but what I like the

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.240 
can get it fresh but what I like the
frozen<00:03:56.659> corn<00:03:56.870> for<00:03:57.079> is<00:03:57.379> that<00:03:57.560> because<00:03:57.859> it's<00:03:58.010> raw

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
frozen corn for is that because it's raw

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.339 
frozen corn for is that because it's raw
and<00:03:58.430> you're<00:03:58.519> not<00:03:58.640> cooking<00:03:58.849> it<00:03:59.150> we<00:03:59.840> new<00:03:59.959> defrost

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
and you're not cooking it we new defrost

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.190 
and you're not cooking it we new defrost
frozen<00:04:00.739> corn<00:04:01.159> it<00:04:01.280> actually<00:04:01.939> gets<00:04:02.569> kind<00:04:03.109> of

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
frozen corn it actually gets kind of
