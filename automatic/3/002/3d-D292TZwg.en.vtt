there we do a couple practices try to
figure<00:02:08.789> out<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.270> timing<00:02:09.509> things<00:02:09.899> like<00:02:10.080> that

we take the data process it get into the

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.619 
we take the data process it get into the
computer<00:02:17.129> exaggerate<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.239> well<00:02:18.390> beyond

cut-and-dried system for doing there

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.100 
cut-and-dried system for doing there
were<00:04:48.910> a<00:04:48.940> lot<00:04:49.180> of<00:04:49.210> cheats<00:04:49.690> and<00:04:49.840> sleight<00:04:50.080> of

were a lot of cheats and sleight of

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.810 
were a lot of cheats and sleight of
hands<00:04:50.350> that<00:04:50.470> we'd<00:04:50.590> used<00:04:50.889> to<00:04:51.190> make<00:04:51.370> that<00:04:51.580> work

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
hands that we'd used to make that work

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.730 
hands that we'd used to make that work
we<00:04:52.030> use<00:04:52.210> a<00:04:52.240> basically<00:04:52.900> a<00:04:52.960> beam<00:04:53.260> just<00:04:53.530> an

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
we use a basically a beam just an

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.550 
we use a basically a beam just an
ability<00:04:54.250> in<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.580> engine<00:04:54.910> to<00:04:55.060> draw<00:04:55.360> a<00:04:55.900> mesh

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560

from one point to another

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.250 
from one point to another
basically<00:04:58.180> attaching<00:04:58.630> one<00:04:58.750> end<00:04:58.930> to<00:04:58.960> reptiles

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
basically attaching one end to reptiles

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.629 
basically attaching one end to reptiles
head<00:04:59.500> and<00:04:59.680> one<00:04:59.830> end<00:05:00.010> of<00:05:00.070> the<00:05:00.160> victim's<00:05:00.460> head

head and one end of the victim's head

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.850 
head and one end of the victim's head
and<00:05:00.940> then<00:05:01.120> introducing<00:05:01.810> material<00:05:02.530> driven

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
and then introducing material driven

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.800 
and then introducing material driven
noise<00:05:03.100> to<00:05:03.400> that<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:03.790> make<00:05:03.970> it<00:05:04.000> seem<00:05:04.389> as<00:05:04.600> though

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
noise to that to make it seem as though

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.110 
noise to that to make it seem as though
there's<00:05:05.050> an<00:05:05.169> elastic<00:05:05.470> tongue<00:05:06.160> where<00:05:06.460> really

there's an elastic tongue where really

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.659 
there's an elastic tongue where really
it's<00:05:07.360> just<00:05:07.450> a<00:05:07.900> you<00:05:08.260> know<00:05:08.320> a<00:05:08.380> code<00:05:08.740> driven<00:05:09.160> mesh

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
it's just a you know a code driven mesh

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:10.680 
it's just a you know a code driven mesh
that's<00:05:09.880> going<00:05:10.060> from<00:05:10.210> one<00:05:10.330> point<00:05:10.479> to<00:05:10.660> another

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
that's going from one point to another

that's going from one point to another
some<00:05:11.530> of<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.680> key<00:05:11.919> points<00:05:12.400> that<00:05:12.460> we<00:05:12.580> really

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
some of the key points that we really

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.430 
some of the key points that we really
try<00:05:13.030> to<00:05:13.060> focus<00:05:13.180> on<00:05:13.570> is<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:13.810> make<00:05:13.930> sure<00:05:14.200> that

to get right fluids and liquids are a
difficult<00:06:13.180> thing<00:06:13.510> to<00:06:13.539> do<00:06:13.690> in<00:06:13.720> particles<00:06:14.229> it

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
difficult thing to do in particles it

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.740 
difficult thing to do in particles it
even<00:06:14.530> more<00:06:14.710> difficult<00:06:15.220> to<00:06:15.400> do<00:06:15.580> in<00:06:16.210> real<00:06:16.510> time

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
even more difficult to do in real time

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.779 
even more difficult to do in real time
when<00:06:16.930> we<00:06:17.050> don't<00:06:17.260> have<00:06:17.350> the<00:06:17.470> ability<00:06:17.950> to<00:06:18.010> render

when we don't have the ability to render

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:21.120 
when we don't have the ability to render
something<00:06:19.210> when<00:06:19.870> we<00:06:20.229> have<00:06:20.350> to<00:06:20.530> do<00:06:20.830> a<00:06:20.860> graphic

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
something when we have to do a graphic

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.070 
something when we have to do a graphic
that<00:06:21.340> will<00:06:21.580> update<00:06:21.760> 60<00:06:22.240> times<00:06:22.450> a<00:06:22.539> second<00:06:22.930> and

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
that will update 60 times a second and

that will update 60 times a second and
so<00:06:23.410> even<00:06:23.800> just<00:06:23.830> the<00:06:24.190> the<00:06:24.610> rudiments<00:06:25.030> of

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
so even just the the rudiments of

so even just the the rudiments of
getting<00:06:25.360> the<00:06:25.450> liquids<00:06:25.750> to<00:06:25.900> look<00:06:26.080> good<00:06:26.260> had<00:06:26.560> its

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
getting the liquids to look good had its

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.290 
getting the liquids to look good had its
own<00:06:26.800> challenges<00:06:27.070> one<00:06:27.760> of<00:06:27.850> the<00:06:27.910> really<00:06:28.150> cool

really<00:07:12.840> violent<00:07:13.380> but<00:07:13.770> at<00:07:13.860> the<00:07:13.950> same<00:07:14.130> time<00:07:14.400> have

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:14.730 
really violent but at the same time have

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.570 
really violent but at the same time have
a<00:07:14.760> comedic<00:07:15.690> tone<00:07:16.560> to<00:07:16.830> it<00:07:16.860> those<00:07:17.280> are<00:07:17.430> always

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 
a comedic tone to it those are always

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.700 
a comedic tone to it those are always
the<00:07:17.700> best<00:07:17.850> ones<00:07:18.360> most<00:07:18.840> of<00:07:18.990> them<00:07:19.110> actually<00:07:19.290> have

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 
a comedic tone to it and I think that's

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.760 
a comedic tone to it and I think that's
what<00:07:22.290> makes<00:07:22.500> fatalities<00:07:23.070> popular
