00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
attack on a 29 inch wheel is a lot

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.349 
attack on a 29 inch wheel is a lot
shallower<00:02:20.319> compared<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.129> a<00:02:21.160> 26<00:02:21.760> inch<00:02:22.060> wheel

that's<00:02:23.140> why<00:02:23.349> the<00:02:23.410> front<00:02:23.769> wheel<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.280> lot

that's why the front wheel is a lot

that's why the front wheel is a lot
