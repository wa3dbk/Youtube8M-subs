00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.849

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.090
 different that worked it and value what 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:14.530
 I worked and what this 86,000 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:24.170
 people or in the final of argentina 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:26.240
 the action that always happened what 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.240
 at the time of the hymn I remembered 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.770
 from all over the whole family 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.309
 even from my friends since I remembered 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.110
 from a teacher a teacher that I had from 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.030
 primary and primary school knows why I 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.960
 I remembered her because she was me 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.420
 Accomplice with me and my dad to leave me 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.790
 leave three times in the week one hour 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.370
 before to be able to reach union to 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.629
 practice this I remembered all the 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.699
 world 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.280
 you can not fail the whole world 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.960
 when it starts but you rogatory 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.269
 aitor life you know what you have to do 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.000
 but what it says how to do is 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.000
 agreed black when they hit the stick 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.799
 it was a thing I say good hit in the 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.810
 stick does not win it anymore because it happened to me 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.690
 out there they do not earn it anymore and I'm going to throw it away 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.380
 this to the moon of that digital moment and 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.710
 He grabbed it by volley and threw it with the 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.710
 quill 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.960
 and I'm going to die with that was with that 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.960
 glorious anger 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.579
 to the rostrum 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.250
 when the move happens that is the point 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.439
 to ace and hit the stick when it hits the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.829
 stick I felt the silence in the stadium 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:52.520
 this silence is to say he trains and 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:55.640
 when he delays it he took it off 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.740
 the bow but I get the ovation felt 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.140
 as if they were a goal 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.090
 is what I felt for example the goal that 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.770
 he makes France was beautiful for me 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.189
 first because you have told the 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.189
 ball 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.890
 comes a play that comes very to the world 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.220
 of times against holland he threw two 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:29.390
 times on the floor 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:34.209
 the ball got up and it was in that 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:42.380
 moment that it was for me to feel that my 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:44.360
 friend when he pulled and listened was like 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.840
 we were not all they were only 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.209
 users but I got ready 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.140
 thousand by thousands but in the sense I'll 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.140
 I say if you go to work 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:02.640
 is more enlarged what do you think 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.640
 exciting ever for the 78 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.280
 two weeks ago remembering the 78 that 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.360
 they passed everything there, looking at the 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:18.710
 images yes and I analyze myself that the 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:23.720
 touch of the ball has dropped this gold and I 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:26.090
 I put but why not for the memories 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.010
 well we ended up launching the toast that 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.510
 I wanted the tone we started with the 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.360
 subcapitan, it seems to me I read what you 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.370
 I ask the players 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.980
 going up a little bit more for the people 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.610
 because the people from hitting good wave goes 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.940
 to have the best and if we put everything in 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.980
 Positive energy can be reached 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.960
 achieve what we all want and the 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.540
 people to record the party and the people 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.210
 is that you have patience that does not have bad 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.890
 wave that the versions that do not press 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:01.230
 and burn and look 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:04.780
 a forum match with faith with this one 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.640
 with all the best because it 's all that 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.000
 is positive 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.500
 one can receive it and I believe that these 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.890
 boys are in a position to give 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.540
 a great skill 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.579
 be world champion for during the 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.549
 cup and the most that can happen to 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.859
 a soccer player and a level athlete 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.990
 World only thing I ask you also 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.820
 to players who think of this 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.130
 global give a joy to the people who 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.740
 he needs it and that when people 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.840
 put to see the game as it says I read 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.320
 positive and support the team throughout 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.850

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.820

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.130

 that we are in good hands with the 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.419

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:08.129
 because this argentina srl is the cece 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.279

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:22.470
 the last before offering to feel the 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:25.969
 Cup in hand is the ultimate 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.809

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:34.069
 grab to lift the 6 kilo and a half and 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:38.319
