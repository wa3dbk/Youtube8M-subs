00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello welcome to the talking channel of 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.779
 apples and today we are going to make a 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.780
 comparative between the two most phones 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.200
 Powerful Market Samsung Galaxy S 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.350
 6 and iphone 6 so let's go with the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.449
 video the samsung galaxy s 6 has 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.490
 more resolution in your camera what we 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.400
 will allow photographs to have 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.050
 in principle a superior quality although 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.019
 we have already seen as not always more 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.599
 resolution is higher quality in this case 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.270
 concrete the day photographs of 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.700
 samsung e6 if they present a higher 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.640
 detail however when there is little light 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.280
 the photographs of ls 6 have a lot 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.079
 noise and are better than the iphone in 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.640
 As for colors we have to say 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.890
 that the iphone has a few more colors 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.680
 natural and real while the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.260
 samsung tends to unreal colors and very 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.329
 saturated on all occasions the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.640
 saturation of colors is a very thing 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.160
 subjective now people that if you 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.329
 like and others that you will not like between 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.690
 the professionals of photography 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.610
 always tends to the actual colors and 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.420
 the saturated is something that is wanted 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.540
 do 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.460
 a photograph in hdr therefore 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.530
 we think that in this aspect the iphone 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.110
 another aspect is better too 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.210
 related to the camera is the flash the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.729
 samsung has greater reach but not 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.340
 allows the modification of the power 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.259
 of it , therefore, sometimes 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.200
 photographs appear very white 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.880
 burned in addition the white balance does not 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.070
 it's as good as the one with the iphone 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.259
 the iphone flash has a performance 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.390
 excellent when we take pictures 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.369
 of people who leave the flash of 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.780
 samsung in evidence in most 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.090
 occasions but we have to have in 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.830
 account that has less power the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.659
 autonomy is something quite essential in 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.729
 a mobile phone the samsung has a 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.250
 pretty good autonomy just like what 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.350
 has the iphone 6 plus so we have 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.179
 to say that the iphone 6 of 4 with 7 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.250
 inches is one step below 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.709
 regarding these two great phones 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.299
 in performance another pretty matter 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.069
 important considering that 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.409
 we are talking about phones over 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.319
 600 euros we have not noticed a difference 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.090
 significant between the models and in 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.459
 sometimes the samsung is more 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.870
 fast generally with applications of 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.209
 Google 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.950
 but at other times the iphone is more 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.840
 fast as the time to browse 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.450
 internet or to see pictures and videos 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.099
 from our reel the speaker could be 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.560
 one of the small differences that 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.360
 there are between the two models the 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.280
 samsung has more power but 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.680
 It distorts music a lot 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.629
 general while the speaker of the 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.819
 iphone is sharper and has better 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.769
 quality but logically and how we finished 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.349
 to say he does not have that much power 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.090
 the fingerprint reader sounds so loud 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.489
 fingerprinting has been an innovation of 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.640
 support and that samsung wanted to copy in 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.349
 the samsung that share 5 the finger by the 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.079
 sensor being pretty bad your 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.209
 working in this s 6s 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.890
 operation has been copied and now it's 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.500
 very similar for not saying that it is 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.420
 identical to that of the iphone however the 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.190
 iphone touch aid sensor and it is more 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.769
 big so reading our 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.450
 Footprint is more effective in situations 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.810
 where we do not have the phone located 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.000
 perfectly aligned as it can be 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.159
 when it is placed in the support of the 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.560
 car on a table and is not oriented 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.569
 towards us the two phones offer 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.650
 a good response to the sensor 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.900
 fingerprints 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.549
 something that does not cool anything on the phone 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.560
 samsung is that it has a lot of slack 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.900
 when we put the phone on a 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.180
 flat surface because your camera 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.209
 a lot stands out that also happens 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.680
 on the iphone but it is less accented 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.629
 we could say that both phones are 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.609
 very similar with very different 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.890
 small and that do not suppose a stay of 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.409
 decision or that we can not decant 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.299
 for one model or another however 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:46.519
 we have not talked about the system yet 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.489
 operating something basic comparing 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.500
 direct competition phones like 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.180
 we already know the samsung galaxy s 6 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.010
 implements the android system 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.889
 lollipop the latest version that has 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.959
 launched google to the market while 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.690
 the iphone implements ios 8 the last 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.430
 apple system we are not going to go into 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.260
 which system is better since we have 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.209
 talked a lot about this topic on the web 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.700
 and in the youtube channel as in the 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.040
 podcast we'll just say that if you're 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.870
 an android user the most logical thing is 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.609
 that you keep betting on the system of 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.590
 google unless you've had some 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.410
 mismatch or that you simply want 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.360
 try and two if on the contrary you are a 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.590
 apple user do you have other products 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.290
 of support such as an ipad 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.760
 we recommend you to continue 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.280
 that the ecosystem created between 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.110
 all the devices is not comparable 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.570
 if we talk about the design of both 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.180
 phones we have to say that great 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.330
 Part of the design of the Samsung Galaxy S 6 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.080
 is an exact and identical copy of the 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.080
 iphone 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.720
 samsung had not manufactured phones with 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.430
 that distribution of buttons not so much in 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.220
 the bottom nor as its parts 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.800
 side as we have left you a video 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.780
 in the youtube channel showing these 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.330
 differences in video so that 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.650
 have a very graphic shape 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.540
 you just have to see them and have 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.180
 your own opinion if we had 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.070
 to get wet choosing a device and 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.200
 we made it clear that this is not information 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.120
 but that is a personal opinion is 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.580
 we would take the iphone because as we say 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.950
 we consider that although samsung has done 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.260
 a good job with your s6 still having 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.020
 failures with colors or design 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.760
 that for us are important in addition 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.160
 and as we mentioned the ecosystem 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.960
 that is created between our imac our 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.760
 ipad and our iphone does not have 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.070
 any comparison on android since 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.070
 there simply is no such ecosystem
