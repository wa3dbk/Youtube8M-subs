00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.000
 Kostya this congratulations comment on myself 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.610
 thank you very much 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.850
 that's what he wants to say firstly 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:40.489
 was my very very difficult fight was one 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:46.190
 of the most difficult fights to date 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:50.390
 day and not everything turned out of course as 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.620
 I would like to but from this need to do 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.050
 Of course, the conclusions work on errors 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.360
 but of course I already talked to the coach 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.010
 with promoters with managers 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:08.780
 Well, we did some work conclusions 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:13.880
 conclusions and we will work but the disadvantages 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.500
 of course but it is in terms of legs in terms of 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.270
 legs are not enough maybe maybe 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:23.630
 somewhere functional training exactly 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.280
 It is exactly on the feet of the photo so with this 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.310
 rival needed to move 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.210
 keep moving and not stagnate on 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:37.520
 place but it turned out that I 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.710
 I had to converge with him I work with 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.510
 him at close range but it was him 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.450
 manner 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.460
 Bill is he pretty tough and what 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.690
 he had to work this principle on 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.360
 close range that's sure my 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.550
 error I wanted to tell you 1 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.050
 half the battle is constantly close combat he 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.920
 you impose and he is not very you 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.080
 went well 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.700
 and the second half of the fight to turn down appeared 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.010
 began to work at a distance at once all of you 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.510
 did the coach equal you ? 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.390
 you yourself already almost thickness is empty on 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.930
 the distances lie to me prompted this all 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.300
 it was my trainer alexey alexey yes 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.720
 all spoke of course Alexey Vasiliev 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.000
 Yevgeny free match, that is, everyone said 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.020
 everyone shouted for me to move my legs 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 worked with the front hand here but again 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.870
 I repeat that you need more 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.060
 work exactly on the coats of arms more 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:36.650
 do the work on the legs ie hands 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.870
 normal flew well well not was not 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.150
 problems about hands breathing principle too 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.350
 ok enough but here it is the feet of the day 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.890
 somewhere a small gift 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.410
 the very number of well-being is not bad 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.750
 you can see a little on the face that we are constantly 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.840
 banged their heads and a lot 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.470
 food constantly just collided and 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.739
 I missed a lot from left 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.750
 hands well and here is just this side u 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.239
 me with fluff 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.300
 that is, well, we will work 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.840
 work to draw conclusions and you can 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.840
 you are welcome 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.720
 don't sit you just come please i 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.670
 there was one question what are the prospects now 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.540
 to fall from side to side we are all codes 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.310
 now on to what's next work 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.770
 and once again work as bequeathed 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.130
 Vladimir Lenin here is one perspective 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.470
 you need to work like you saw a fight 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:39.580
 this bone teeth commented on you 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:47.980
 comment and now but comment 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:50.590
 pabotali on the results or the bones 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.900
 said i want to say what is good what 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.230
 this fight happened at this stage of his 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:00.460
 careers this is the hardest fight in his 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.860
 life right here if there was 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.310
 a bit higher class opponent 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.890
 would have to be even harder here 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.960
 there were those errors that were and 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.360
 earlier you his fights will be more vivid here 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.850
 he understood but who actually is on 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.040
 this moment in time we all see him 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:23.080
 great perspective but have to work for 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.550
 In order to become a champion measures now 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.110
 you are leaving 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.850
 los angeles or where im doing what 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.530
 be back in los angeles literally and on 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.700
 the next day he treated in russia but we 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.460
 agreed by the coach that I have 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.580
 prescribe and plan my training plan already 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:47.010
 in Russia and we will perform the installation 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.010
 trainer oscar promoter kettle on 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:56.650
 well i think bones should 4 5 fights 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.300
 hold here top rank if bones 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.810
 had a bright fight and showed himself 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.940
 good about him they are us tonight 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.500
 before the fights they called very strong 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.600
 rivals whom bones can 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.600
 box that is at least as long as their 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.300
 may you still not not not ready for this 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.540
 we are not ready to go to this level yet 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.340
 so if he holds four fights with 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.490
 the same rival even slightly 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.100
 higher will be very wonderful and we want 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:27.550
 we want this step with every step 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.680
 step to move the bone is still very young 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:34.690
 bright boxers are still ahead 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:37.300
 winter I congratulate you on the victory of Russia 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.560
 very nice apparently it was me she 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.560
 special box is necessary
