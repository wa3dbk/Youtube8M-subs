00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.360
 Hello, Today I am making an easy chocolate chip cake cake ice cream dough. 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.770
 First, in line with the plastic sheet on the bottom of the plate 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.910
 Arrange a loop more. 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.210
 Then put a plastic cake ring into the mold. 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.200
 In a bowl, add in 3 tablespoons of unsalted butter softened, 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.620
 1/3 cup light brown sugar, 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.320
 1/8 teaspoon salt, 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.820
 And 1/4 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.820
 And whisk up homogenously combined. 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.460
 Add in 1/2 cup of whole-purpose flour and mix. 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.030
 Sift flour if you take it from a tightly packed bag. 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.030
 And finally fold into 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.440
 This is eggles cake dough. 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.770
 Roll the dough into a thin rope. 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.570
 Cutting and shaping the ball. 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.870
 Repeat with only half of the dough. 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.870
 The remaining half will be used later. 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.070
 Now whip 1 cup of heavy cream until stiffened. 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.570
 Add in 7 tablespoons of condensed condensed milk 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.570
 And 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and accurately fold even combined. 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.910
 I do not add in the cookie cut dough now 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.910
 Because with a lot of frozen dough cake, I can not reduce the cake clean. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.190
 Arrange the balls of chocolate cake chip chip on the bottom of the ring. 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.280
 Fill the mold with only half a full batter. 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.100
 Then sprinkle with 3 tablespoons of cookie crumbs. 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.500
 Any cookies are fine. Just avoid the very sweet cookies. 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.000
 I have some cookie recipes in separate videos. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.400
 The remaining mixture is poured into the mold 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.900
 Clean the top with a spoon-set. 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.900
 Then freeze overnight. 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.200
 From the freezer, remove the ring. 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.200
 Put chocolate chip cookie dough and cut with ring. 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.750
 Cover cake with round dough cake 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.750
 And turn it upside down. 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.750
 Sprinkle with cookie crumbs 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.750
 Decorate with chocolate cake dough chip. 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.750
 Voila. 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.750
 Homemade Eggless Chocolate Chip Cake Dough Ice Cream Cake. 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.250
 If you are making ice cream, why not turn it into a holiday ice cream cake? It only takes a little more effort. 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.240
 Bon appetite. 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.240
 I love lovely vanilla ice cream cookies with crumbs and chocolate chunky cookie dough chip. 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.950
