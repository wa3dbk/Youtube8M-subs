however today we're going to be making
potting<00:00:10.650> compost<00:00:11.070> for<00:00:11.550> carrots<00:00:13.730> as<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.820> can

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
potting compost for carrots as you can

see<00:00:15.059> I've<00:00:15.120> lined<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.570> butter<00:00:15.780> with<00:00:16.230> some

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
see I've lined the butter with some

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.300 
see I've lined the butter with some
black<00:00:17.789> plastic<00:00:18.500> this<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.560> just<00:00:19.890> some<00:00:20.070> slits

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
black plastic this is just some slits

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.010 
black plastic this is just some slits
I'm<00:00:20.550> warning<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:21.090> place<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.570> thought<00:00:21.720> I'll<00:00:21.900> get

I'm warning in place we thought I'll get

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.230 
I'm warning in place we thought I'll get
the<00:00:22.199> weight<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.619> some<00:00:22.830> compost<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.460> there<00:00:23.730> and

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
the weight of some compost in there and

the weight of some compost in there and
this<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.810> riddle<00:00:25.019> I'm<00:00:25.199> going<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.560> be<00:00:25.680> using

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
this is the riddle I'm going to be using

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.220 
this is the riddle I'm going to be using
because<00:00:26.189> as<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.640> know<00:00:26.820> connects<00:00:27.779> don't<00:00:28.050> like

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
because as you know connects don't like

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.870 
because as you know connects don't like
the<00:00:28.349> with<00:00:28.470> any<00:00:28.650> obstructions<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> growth

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
the with any obstructions as the growth

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.630 
the with any obstructions as the growth
or<00:00:30.060> wise<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.420> roots<00:00:30.599> will<00:00:30.810> fork<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.460> guess

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
or wise the roots will fork and I guess

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.580 
or wise the roots will fork and I guess
the<00:00:32.790> same<00:00:33.030> applies<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.420> parsnips<00:00:34.320> if<00:00:34.469> you've

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
the same applies to parsnips if you've

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.709 
the same applies to parsnips if you've
grown<00:00:34.800> parsnips<00:00:35.370> or<00:00:35.489> anything<00:00:35.700> with<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> long

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
grown parsnips or anything with a long

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.170 
grown parsnips or anything with a long
pointed<00:00:37.140> root<00:00:38.120> that<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.270> don't<00:00:39.450> want<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.780> for

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
pointed root that you don't want to for

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.529 
pointed root that you don't want to for
you<00:00:42.180> need<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> mix<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:43.290> doesn't<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.800> any<00:00:44.539> any

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
you need a mix that doesn't have any any

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.569 
you need a mix that doesn't have any any
storms<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.289> for<00:00:46.469> example<00:00:46.590> or<00:00:47.309> anything

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
storms in it for example or anything

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.600 
storms in it for example or anything
that<00:00:47.789> would<00:00:48.200> would<00:00:49.200> prevent<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.309> cut<00:00:50.520> of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
that would would prevent the cut of

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.369 
that would would prevent the cut of
getting<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> long<00:00:51.090> straight<00:00:51.480> rope<00:00:51.750> down<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
getting a long straight rope down in the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:01.160 
getting a long straight rope down in the
pot<00:00:52.620> okay

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.040 

this<00:01:02.170> is<00:01:02.320> my<00:01:02.530> or<00:01:02.980> mid<00:01:03.310> compost<00:01:03.850> this<00:01:04.720> is<00:01:04.870> what

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
this is my or mid compost this is what

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.810 
this is my or mid compost this is what
I've<00:01:05.170> been<00:01:05.400> overwintering<00:01:06.400> on<00:01:06.550> the<00:01:06.670> raised

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
I've been overwintering on the raised

I've been overwintering on the raised
beds<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.370> mixture<00:01:09.640> of<00:01:10.410> topsoil<00:01:11.410> from

beds it's a mixture of topsoil from
Orioles<00:01:13.560> spent<00:01:14.560> compost<00:01:15.270> leaves<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:16.510> grass

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
Orioles spent compost leaves and grass

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.360 
Orioles spent compost leaves and grass
and<00:01:16.750> seaweed<00:01:17.320> okay

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
and seaweed okay

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.430 
and seaweed okay
the<00:01:18.490> Lots<00:01:18.700> in<00:01:18.910> there<00:01:19.180> but<00:01:19.960> there<00:01:20.080> are<00:01:20.170> some

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
the Lots in there but there are some

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.730 
the Lots in there but there are some
bits<00:01:21.430> in<00:01:21.610> there<00:01:21.790> that<00:01:21.970> would<00:01:22.410> would<00:01:23.410> affect

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
bits in there that would would affect

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.010 
bits in there that would would affect
the<00:01:23.830> growth<00:01:24.010> of<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.280> carrots<00:01:24.610> or<00:01:24.840> we're<00:01:25.840> going

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
the growth of the carrots or we're going

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.360 
the growth of the carrots or we're going
to<00:01:26.110> put<00:01:26.260> these<00:01:26.380> through<00:01:26.620> the<00:01:26.770> riddle<00:01:26.980> to<00:01:27.070> start

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
to put these through the riddle to start

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:44.800 
to put these through the riddle to start
with

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:53.020 

I<00:01:50.560> should<00:01:51.560> empty<00:01:51.799> that<00:01:51.950> out<00:01:52.100> now<00:01:52.340> but<00:01:52.909> I've

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
I should empty that out now but I've

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.640 
I should empty that out now but I've
started<00:01:53.299> doing<00:01:53.479> this<00:01:53.900> video<00:01:54.259> and<00:01:54.560> I've

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
started doing this video and I've

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.350 
started doing this video and I've
nowhere<00:01:54.830> to<00:01:55.040> empty<00:01:55.430> it<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:55.700> that's<00:01:55.909> standing

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
nowhere to empty it so that's standing

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:27.600 
nowhere to empty it so that's standing
we<00:01:56.600> finished

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.400 

okay<00:02:28.610> now<00:02:28.790> while<00:02:29.060> I'm<00:02:29.209> doing<00:02:29.510> this<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:30.050> you

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
okay now while I'm doing this and you

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.960 
okay now while I'm doing this and you
see<00:02:30.620> what<00:02:30.740> I'm<00:02:30.830> going<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.100> add<00:02:31.280> next<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:31.819> might

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
see what I'm going to add next you might

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.250 
see what I'm going to add next you might
think<00:02:32.270> well<00:02:32.500> what<00:02:33.500> about<00:02:33.650> quantities<00:02:35.260> what

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
think well what about quantities what

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.160 
think well what about quantities what
quantity<00:02:36.830> are<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:37.069> using<00:02:37.810> I'll<00:02:38.810> tell<00:02:39.080> you

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
quantity are you using I'll tell you

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.449 
quantity are you using I'll tell you
what<00:02:39.319> quantity<00:02:39.800> I'm<00:02:39.890> using<00:02:40.130> I'm<00:02:40.430> using

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
what quantity I'm using I'm using

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.080 
what quantity I'm using I'm using
whatever<00:02:41.000> I've<00:02:41.150> got<00:02:41.290> left<00:02:42.290> after<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.730> I've<00:02:43.940> got

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
whatever I've got left after so I've got

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.059 
whatever I've got left after so I've got
a<00:02:44.120> lot<00:02:44.360> of<00:02:44.420> one<00:02:44.750> thing<00:02:45.020> that<00:02:45.230> I'm<00:02:45.440> using<00:02:45.680> if<00:02:45.980> I

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
a lot of one thing that I'm using if I

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.559 
a lot of one thing that I'm using if I
haven't<00:02:46.280> got<00:02:46.370> much<00:02:46.520> of<00:02:46.580> another<00:02:47.030> thing<00:02:47.270> that

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
haven't got much of another thing that

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:48.750 
haven't got much of another thing that
I'm<00:02:47.690> using

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
I'm using

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.300 
I'm using
okay<00:02:50.110> so<00:02:51.110> now<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.290> solids<00:02:51.770> you<00:02:52.040> can<00:02:52.190> actually

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
okay so now the solids you can actually

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.130 
okay so now the solids you can actually
see<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:52.850> this<00:02:52.970> is<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.180> clear<00:02:53.510> soil

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
see that this is a clear soil

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.780 
see that this is a clear soil
um<00:02:56.680> but<00:02:57.680> anyway<00:02:57.920> we've<00:02:58.010> got<00:02:58.040> doors<00:02:58.400> out<00:02:58.640> you

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
um but anyway we've got doors out you

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.460 
um but anyway we've got doors out you
can<00:02:58.880> see<00:02:59.030> this<00:02:59.180> is<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.390> lot<00:02:59.630> finer<00:02:59.900> than<00:03:00.110> it<00:03:00.260> was

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
can see this is a lot finer than it was

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.750 
can see this is a lot finer than it was
and<00:03:01.250> now<00:03:01.489> I<00:03:01.519> can<00:03:01.760> take<00:03:01.940> these<00:03:02.180> slits<00:03:02.600> out

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
and now I can take these slits out

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.090 
and now I can take these slits out
because<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:05.200> black<00:03:06.200> plastic<00:03:06.440> is<00:03:06.769> held<00:03:06.950> in

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
because the black plastic is held in

that I've collected locally and it's
very<00:03:41.680> very<00:03:42.040> fine<00:03:42.370> very<00:03:43.239> fine<00:03:43.500> we'll<00:03:44.500> put<00:03:44.709> it<00:03:44.830> to

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
very very fine very fine we'll put it to

this<00:03:45.160> riddle<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:45.580> I'll<00:03:45.700> be<00:03:45.819> surprised<00:03:46.150> if<00:03:46.330> the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
this riddle and I'll be surprised if the

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.740 
this riddle and I'll be surprised if the
riddle<00:03:46.720> brings<00:03:46.930> anything<00:03:47.200> out<00:03:47.440> of<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:48.510> okay

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
riddle brings anything out of it okay

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.930 
riddle brings anything out of it okay
and<00:03:50.500> I<00:03:50.590> think<00:03:50.769> if<00:03:50.890> you<00:03:50.950> see<00:03:51.099> any<00:03:51.280> other<00:03:51.370> carrot

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
and I think if you see any other carrot

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.259 
and I think if you see any other carrot
growing<00:03:52.209> videos<00:03:53.069> on<00:03:54.069> YouTube<00:03:54.730> you'll<00:03:54.970> know

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
growing videos on YouTube you'll know

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.729 
growing videos on YouTube you'll know
that<00:03:55.890> it<00:03:56.890> is<00:03:57.010> sandy<00:03:57.489> involved<00:03:57.970> it<00:03:58.660> just

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
that it is sandy involved it just

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.780 
that it is sandy involved it just
lightens<00:03:59.739> up<00:03:59.829> the<00:04:00.010> mixture<00:04:00.280> look<00:04:00.549> at<00:04:00.640> that

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
lightens up the mixture look at that

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.640 
lightens up the mixture look at that
I've<00:04:01.390> just<00:04:01.599> lifted<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:02.019> right<00:04:02.230> through<00:04:02.530> that

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
I've just lifted it right through that

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.410 
I've just lifted it right through that
mix<00:04:02.920> just<00:04:03.610> lift<00:04:03.790> it<00:04:03.880> it's<00:04:04.060> trade<00:04:04.299> off<00:04:06.420> so

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
mix just lift it it's trade off so

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.190 
mix just lift it it's trade off so
that's<00:04:07.599> really<00:04:07.959> fine<00:04:08.140> okay<00:04:08.799> and<00:04:09.870> last<00:04:10.870> but<00:04:11.019> not

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
that's really fine okay and last but not

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:19.490 
that's really fine okay and last but not
least<00:04:12.930> some<00:04:13.930> Corker<00:04:14.290> koi<00:04:17.820> here

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
least some Corker koi here

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.960 
least some Corker koi here
so<00:04:20.500> what<00:04:20.650> we're<00:04:20.799> after<00:04:20.919> is<00:04:21.130> is<00:04:21.459> an<00:04:21.609> open

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
so what we're after is is an open

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.129 
so what we're after is is an open
mixture<00:04:23.160> nor<00:04:24.160> solids<00:04:24.610> nor<00:04:25.419> big<00:04:25.600> solids<00:04:26.020> that

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
mixture nor solids nor big solids that

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:26.400 
mixture nor solids nor big solids that
is

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
is

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.140 
is
um<00:04:27.330> with<00:04:28.330> something<00:04:28.780> in<00:04:28.900> it<00:04:29.639> that<00:04:30.639> the<00:04:30.760> carrots

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
um with something in it that the carrots

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.300 
um with something in it that the carrots
can<00:04:31.840> actually<00:04:32.200> take<00:04:32.470> open<00:04:32.770> it'll<00:04:32.919> make<00:04:33.100> them

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
can actually take open it'll make them

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.830 
can actually take open it'll make them
grow<00:04:33.520> on<00:04:33.700> they'll<00:04:33.970> get<00:04:34.150> that<00:04:34.300> from<00:04:34.600> the

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
grow on they'll get that from the

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.580 
grow on they'll get that from the
compost<00:04:35.740> mixture<00:04:36.130> that<00:04:36.310> are<00:04:36.430> put<00:04:36.580> in<00:04:36.700> first

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
compost mixture that are put in first

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:44.370 
compost mixture that are put in first
and<00:04:38.590> this<00:04:38.860> Koya<00:04:39.490> and<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:43.060> sand<00:04:43.330> I'll<00:04:44.080> just

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
and this Koya and and the sand I'll just

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.830 
and this Koya and and the sand I'll just
keep<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:44.740> as<00:04:44.830> an<00:04:44.950> open<00:04:45.099> structure<00:04:45.639> and<00:04:46.630> add<00:04:46.810> a

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
keep it as an open structure and add a

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:54.920 
keep it as an open structure and add a
bit<00:04:47.020> of<00:04:47.169> bulk<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.620> it<00:04:47.650> okay
