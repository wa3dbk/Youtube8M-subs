00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.990
 a small variation was there at 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.900
 tiki taca match the ball when sebastian 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.210
 war game to not hannes the ball 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.549
 but plays dirty glass of the game 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.199
 but important about the third is hannes 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.119
 if you played the ball that you have one 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.279
 I'm the room is exactly because is in the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.890
 play again when I play your opponent 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.350
 Just play how you are david 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.150
 You're there exactly and I would therefore 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.800
 perhaps respond to difficult and 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.610
 the room gets a bit bigger, so 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.960
 now primarily lassan immediately 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.100
 that is, you have to go a little faster 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.920
 run because you have this now 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.340
 between pass not cream one all 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.290
 ready 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:50.100
 and 12 great class so well off times 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.780
 the quality and gave a precise six 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.320
 just play a lot more than that now 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.469
 third 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.510
 Now you play the stitch pas rhein 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.370
 then quickly through the interface 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.949
 Do not run too early the ball is removed 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.160
 play in the anteroom the player 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.160
 choice 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.640
 michaela firmly ok last stage if times 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.840
 everything to make a contact 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.460
 to play schaaf and now has to 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.590
 of course true because all may be one 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.810
 contact and think again 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.850
 should hÃ¼tchen after symbolize go 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.890
 I became a hat-it's not big 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.500
 rest it always in the hat 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.820
 work space he plays on the vaal and 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.229
 then you stand then he notices himself if 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.880
 the ball comes again that you then 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.740
 back to quiet position in 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.750
 a movement position must go 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.130
 Whole time in motion often exhausting 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.020
 but soccer is somehow too 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.920
 a bit exhausting so everything 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.920
 contact me try 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.859
 12 try not to turn contact 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.719
 get in well into the form 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:53.689
 now is good from now flat again 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:56.090

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.310
 have then opening pass then has 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.420
 interface pass has then three ex 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.679
 couple back in there 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.929
 heavy riders later come back one 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:16.160
 Well not that much cut in the balls 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:23.480
 play something in the anteroom and how was 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:29.380
 which is now a bunch sprint in the room 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.160
 in the class great class very good very good 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.220
