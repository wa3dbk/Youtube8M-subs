00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.690 
I said it's a budget thing and you don't
really<00:02:48.079> need<00:02:48.319> it<00:02:48.500> from<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.799> get-go<00:02:49.069> so<00:02:49.250> if

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
really need it from the get-go so if

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.039 
really need it from the get-go so if
you're<00:02:49.910> gonna<00:02:50.030> spend<00:02:50.360> some<00:02:50.480> money<00:02:50.750> on<00:02:50.870> you

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
you're gonna spend some money on you

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.539 
you're gonna spend some money on you
you're<00:02:51.380> just<00:02:51.680> starting<00:02:51.860> to<00:02:52.010> build<00:02:52.220> this<00:02:52.340> out

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
you're just starting to build this out

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.990 
you're just starting to build this out
you<00:02:52.849> don't<00:02:52.970> need<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.180> bipod<00:02:53.569> yet<00:02:55.000> obviously

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
PMAG right here I'm gonna fill it up all

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.940 
PMAG right here I'm gonna fill it up all
the<00:02:58.430> way<00:02:58.519> so<00:02:58.640> you<00:02:58.849> can<00:02:58.879> see<00:02:59.150> that<00:02:59.299> up<00:02:59.920> you<00:03:00.920> can

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.500 
the way so you can see that up you can
clearly<00:03:01.370> see<00:03:01.459> through<00:03:01.819> the<00:03:01.910> window<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.239> got

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
clearly see through the window I got

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.930 
clearly see through the window I got
about<00:03:02.690> 20<00:03:03.170> rounds<00:03:04.129> in<00:03:04.250> there<00:03:04.370> if<00:03:04.549> not<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.760> little

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
about 20 rounds in there if not a little

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.960 
about 20 rounds in there if not a little
more<00:03:05.299> but<00:03:05.540> um<00:03:06.459> yep<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:09.310> this<00:03:10.310> is<00:03:10.459> my<00:03:10.610> tangle

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
more but um yep and this is my tangle

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.369 
more but um yep and this is my tangle
down<00:03:11.120> screws<00:03:11.840> in<00:03:12.079> it's<00:03:12.620> kind<00:03:12.890> of<00:03:13.010> like<00:03:13.160> snap<00:03:13.430> in

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
down screws in it's kind of like snap in

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.690 
down screws in it's kind of like snap in
I'm<00:03:15.379> still<00:03:15.709> working<00:03:16.010> on<00:03:16.069> the<00:03:16.190> spot<00:03:16.430> depending

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
I'm still working on the spot depending

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.550 
I'm still working on the spot depending
on<00:03:17.090> if<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:17.329> have<00:03:17.359> a<00:03:17.480> bipod<00:03:17.840> or<00:03:17.870> not<00:03:18.139> this<00:03:18.350> may

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
on if you have a bipod or not this may

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.539 
on if you have a bipod or not this may
move<00:03:18.769> back<00:03:19.069> and<00:03:19.220> forward<00:03:20.620> obviously<00:03:21.620> it's<00:03:22.430> a

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
move back and forward obviously it's a

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.250 
move back and forward obviously it's a
personal<00:03:23.030> preference<00:03:23.480> and<00:03:23.660> probably<00:03:24.079> on<00:03:24.139> your

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
personal preference and probably on your

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.050 
personal preference and probably on your
arms<00:03:24.560> are<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:25.010> all<00:03:25.100> that<00:03:25.130> it's<00:03:25.519> a<00:03:25.639> tie<00:03:25.850> gets

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
arms are and all that it's a tie gets

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.879 
arms are and all that it's a tie gets
into<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.389> equation<00:03:27.260> when<00:03:27.470> you<00:03:27.560> put<00:03:27.799> in

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
into the equation when you put in

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.129 
into the equation when you put in
something<00:03:28.069> like<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.459> as<00:03:29.239> far<00:03:29.510> as<00:03:29.630> where<00:03:29.780> your

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
something like that as far as where your

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.539 
something like that as far as where your
tech<00:03:30.380> goes<00:03:32.530> don't<00:03:33.530> put<00:03:33.739> it<00:03:33.829> too<00:03:33.859> close<00:03:33.980> don't

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
tech goes don't put it too close don't

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:35.170 
tech goes don't put it too close don't
put<00:03:34.670> it<00:03:34.760> too<00:03:34.880> far

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
put it too far

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.559 
put it too far
kind<00:03:35.989> of<00:03:36.049> find<00:03:36.319> my<00:03:36.620> way<00:03:36.859> um<00:03:37.190> my<00:03:38.060> spot<00:03:38.420> right

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
kind of find my way um my spot right

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.229 
kind of find my way um my spot right
there<00:03:38.630> um<00:03:39.290> I'm<00:03:40.069> still<00:03:40.430> debating<00:03:40.639> if<00:03:41.090> I<00:03:41.209> should

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
there um I'm still debating if I should

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.650 
there um I'm still debating if I should
put<00:03:41.540> it<00:03:41.630> a<00:03:41.720> little<00:03:42.069> further<00:03:43.069> out<00:03:43.190> but<00:03:43.639> um<00:03:43.849> I'm

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
put it a little further out but um I'm

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.960 
put it a little further out but um I'm
liking<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:45.349> right<00:03:45.530> now<00:03:45.709> I'm<00:03:46.010> giving<00:03:46.519> it<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:46.790> shot

at the range knob see what it shows you

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:50.920 
at the range knob see what it shows you
know<00:03:49.579> after<00:03:49.849> like<00:03:50.060> few<00:03:50.239> thousand<00:03:50.630> rounds<00:03:50.720> of

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
know after like few thousand rounds of

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.890 
know after like few thousand rounds of
shooting<00:03:51.260> um<00:03:51.590> you'll<00:03:52.280> probably<00:03:52.549> know<00:03:52.900> where

have this dual collar you can play with
it<00:04:34.009> you<00:04:34.189> don't<00:04:34.370> necessarily<00:04:34.490> need<00:04:35.030> that<00:04:35.240> also

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
it you don't necessarily need that also

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
mine won just fine when I got it sling

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.830 
mine won just fine when I got it sling
I'm<00:04:39.860> using<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.520> two<00:04:40.969> point<00:04:41.210> sling<00:04:41.419> right<00:04:41.659> now
