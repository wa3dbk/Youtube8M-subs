00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
different to normal so this is the

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.660 
different to normal so this is the
second<00:00:04.410> request<00:00:04.710> game<00:00:05.069> or<00:00:05.480> games<00:00:06.480> as<00:00:06.839> it<00:00:06.960> were

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
second request game or games as it were

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.549 
second request game or games as it were
this<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:08.820> actually<00:00:09.179> i'm<00:00:09.870> doing<00:00:10.110> this<00:00:10.200> time<00:00:10.440> is

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
this is actually i'm doing this time is

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.700 
this is actually i'm doing this time is
actually<00:00:10.710> putting<00:00:11.150> two<00:00:12.150> games<00:00:12.420> together<00:00:12.710> by

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
actually putting two games together by

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.700 
actually putting two games together by
picking<00:00:14.070> i<00:00:14.969> think<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.599> first<00:00:15.750> one<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.020> like<00:00:16.230> 16

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
picking i think the first one is like 16

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.810 
picking i think the first one is like 16
to<00:00:16.890> one<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.850> second<00:00:18.150> one<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:19.490> 22<00:00:20.490> or

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
to one and the second one is 22 or

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.290 
to one and the second one is 22 or
something<00:00:21.470> but<00:00:22.470> for<00:00:22.980> whatever<00:00:23.189> reason<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:24.060> I

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
something but for whatever reason that I

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.150 
something but for whatever reason that I
seem<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.779> just<00:00:25.019> against<00:00:25.320> cause<00:00:25.619> like<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:25.949> I

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
seem to just against cause like that I

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.550 
seem to just against cause like that I
mean<00:00:26.609> if<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:27.060> think<00:00:27.090> about<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:28.199> kill<00:00:28.410> death

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
mean if you think about the kill death

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.330 
mean if you think about the kill death
ratio<00:00:28.910> it's<00:00:29.910> actually<00:00:30.679> the<00:00:31.679> sort<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.009> thing<00:00:32.250> I

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
ratio it's actually the sort of thing I

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.799 
ratio it's actually the sort of thing I
was<00:00:32.399> aiming<00:00:32.700> for<00:00:32.730> by<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.149> need<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.450> go<00:00:33.600> for

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
was aiming for by you need to go for

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.990 
was aiming for by you need to go for
more<00:00:33.989> because<00:00:34.410> while<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.309> just<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:35.850> not

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
more because while I just just not

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.200 
more because while I just just not
interesting<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.540> watch<00:00:36.829> so<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> figured<00:00:38.340> still

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
interesting to watch so I figured still

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.330 
interesting to watch so I figured still
decent<00:00:39.390> games<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:40.140> not<00:00:40.320> very<00:00:40.469> interesting<00:00:41.070> so

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
decent games but not very interesting so

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.690 
decent games but not very interesting so
if<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:41.700> skip<00:00:42.300> out<00:00:42.480> on<00:00:42.510> Border<00:00:42.960> bits<00:00:43.170> and

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
if I just skip out on Border bits and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.190 
if I just skip out on Border bits and
put<00:00:44.700> together<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.570> should<00:00:45.870> be<00:00:45.989> all<00:00:46.020> right

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
put together that should be all right

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.470 
put together that should be all right
because<00:00:47.010> otherwise<00:00:47.940> I've<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.270> been<00:00:48.420> going

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
because otherwise I've just been going

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.319 
because otherwise I've just been going
on<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:48.960> ages<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.260> ages<00:00:49.520> is<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.700> get<00:00:50.850> really

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
on for ages and ages is to get really

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.910 
on for ages and ages is to get really
high<00:00:51.480> scores<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.960> not<00:00:52.079> only<00:00:52.230> need<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.590> be<00:00:52.710> play

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
high scores you not only need to be play

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.250 
high scores you not only need to be play
well<00:00:53.190> which<00:00:53.910> gets<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> good<00:00:54.539> ratio<00:00:54.809> but

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
well which gets you the good ratio but

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.660 
well which gets you the good ratio but
you<00:00:55.350> also<00:00:55.440> need<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.710> have<00:00:55.800> teammates<00:00:56.250> don't

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
you also need to have teammates don't

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.869 
you also need to have teammates don't
get<00:00:56.910> many<00:00:57.059> kills<00:00:57.360> because<00:00:57.600> otherwise<00:00:58.670> like<00:00:59.670> if

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
get many kills because otherwise like if

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.639 
get many kills because otherwise like if
it<00:01:00.180> comes<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.420> spread<00:01:00.690> evenly<00:01:00.960> only<00:01:01.350> people

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
it comes to spread evenly only people

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.969 
it comes to spread evenly only people
would<00:01:01.859> only<00:01:02.010> get<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.809> what<00:01:03.809> 15<00:01:04.409> kills<00:01:04.799> each

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
would only get like what 15 kills each

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.320 
would only get like what 15 kills each
or<00:01:05.189> something<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.580> that's<00:01:05.729> pretty<00:01:05.909> much<00:01:06.030> what

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
or something and that's pretty much what

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.010 
or something and that's pretty much what
I<00:01:06.360> got<00:01:06.570> cuz<00:01:07.350> I'd<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.770> decent<00:01:08.580> team<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.939> I'm<00:01:09.720> just

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
going to talk through the tactics of

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.600 
going to talk through the tactics of
what<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.490> um<00:01:12.049> what<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.140> guys<00:01:13.229> wanted<00:01:13.619> that

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
there was the sea floor we want to do

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.160 
there was the sea floor we want to do

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
through and you don't need to exactly

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.740 
through and you don't need to exactly
know<00:01:23.340> where<00:01:23.549> they<00:01:23.759> where<00:01:24.210> they<00:01:24.330> are<00:01:24.509> when<00:01:24.689> you

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
know where they where they are when you

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.590 
know where they where they are when you
put<00:01:24.930> when<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.259> set<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.530> off<00:01:25.650> because<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.600> does

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
put when you set it off because it does

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.760 
put when you set it off because it does
have<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> big<00:01:28.049> radius<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.590> la<00:01:28.850> radius<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.030> blast

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
have a big radius of la radius of blast

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.130 
have a big radius of la radius of blast
blast<00:01:31.770> radius<00:01:32.100> because<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:33.930> powerful

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
blast radius because it's just powerful

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.899 
blast radius because it's just powerful
even<00:01:34.560> without<00:01:34.770> daily<00:01:35.040> close<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:36.590> really<00:01:37.590> you

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
even without daily close and really you

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.130 
even without daily close and really you
this<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.060> much<00:01:39.509> easier<00:01:39.540> when<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:39.990> go<00:01:40.079> ahead

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
this is much easier when you go ahead

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.010 
this is much easier when you go ahead
step<00:01:40.530> but<00:01:40.799> users<00:01:41.640> an<00:01:41.970> alternative<00:01:42.509> claim<00:01:42.810> or

put<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.439> spots<00:01:43.909> when<00:01:44.909> you're<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.240> facing

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
put it in spots when you're like facing

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.530 
put it in spots when you're like facing
one<00:01:45.750> direction<00:01:45.780> know<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:47.210> when<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.299> think

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
one direction know it up when you think

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.780 
one direction know it up when you think
they're<00:01:48.720> there<00:01:49.369> it's<00:01:50.369> actually<00:01:50.490> what's

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
they're there it's actually what's

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.100 
they're there it's actually what's
really<00:01:50.970> well<00:01:51.210> I'm<00:01:51.270> happy<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.960> while

reliable secondary than the shop and
attachment<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:42.720> also<00:03:42.870> switches<00:03:43.350> out<00:03:43.470> pretty

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
attachment it also switches out pretty

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.180 
attachment it also switches out pretty
fast<00:03:43.920> but<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:45.390> shotgun<00:03:45.829> does<00:03:46.829> actually

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
fast but the the shotgun does actually

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.360 
fast but the the shotgun does actually
is<00:03:48.120> very<00:03:48.329> quick<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:49.049> switch<00:03:49.590> between<00:03:49.709> rifle

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
is very quick to switch between rifle

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.520 
is very quick to switch between rifle
mode<00:03:50.519> and<00:03:50.790> shotgun<00:03:51.209> mode<00:03:51.360> so<00:03:52.230> if<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.410> in<00:03:52.470> a

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
mode and shotgun mode so if you in a

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.250 
mode and shotgun mode so if you in a
tight<00:03:52.739> situation<00:03:53.060> it<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.420> can<00:03:54.690> it<00:03:55.049> is

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
tight situation it you can it is

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.530 
tight situation it you can it is
actually<00:03:55.920> pretty<00:03:56.130> useful<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.549> have<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:57.269> just

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
actually pretty useful to have to just

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.000 
actually pretty useful to have to just
have<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:57.900> if<00:03:58.079> you<00:03:58.560> are<00:03:58.680> thinking<00:03:58.769> about

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
have that if you are thinking about

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.940 
have that if you are thinking about
using<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.459> goes<00:03:59.640> really<00:03:59.850> well<00:04:00.090> with<00:04:00.150> the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
using it it goes really well with the

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:08.569 
using it it goes really well with the
likes<00:04:01.950> of<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:03.450> FAL<00:04:05.660> what<00:04:06.660> else<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:07.410> guess<00:04:08.370> any

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
likes of the FAL what else I guess any

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.190 
likes of the FAL what else I guess any
rifle<00:04:09.060> is<00:04:09.150> not<00:04:09.329> very<00:04:09.510> good<00:04:09.660> at<00:04:09.780> short<00:04:10.019> range

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
rifle is not very good at short range

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.539 
rifle is not very good at short range
and<00:04:12.799> especially<00:04:13.799> when<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:14.130> don't<00:04:14.280> have<00:04:14.489> a

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
and especially when you don't have a

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.909 
and especially when you don't have a
secondary<00:04:15.000> like<00:04:15.239> if<00:04:15.450> you've<00:04:15.600> got<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:16.079> launcher

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
secondary like if you've got a launcher

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.830 
secondary like if you've got a launcher
as<00:04:17.040> a<00:04:17.070> second<00:04:17.400> jury<00:04:17.609> or<00:04:17.880> perhaps<00:04:18.209> using<00:04:18.570> one

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
as a second jury or perhaps using one

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.630 
as a second jury or perhaps using one
man<00:04:18.989> army<00:04:19.200> that<00:04:19.859> is<00:04:20.010> when<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.220> want<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.489> use<00:04:20.609> it

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
man army that is when you want to use it

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.690 
man army that is when you want to use it
really<00:04:21.030> they<00:04:21.660> are<00:04:21.810> good<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:23.310> I'll<00:04:23.460> probably

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
really they are good and I'll probably

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.030 
really they are good and I'll probably
get<00:04:23.910> a<00:04:23.970> better

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
get a better

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.470 
get a better

the end actually from a completely
different<00:04:38.280> game<00:04:38.550> which<00:04:38.880> I'll<00:04:39.030> show<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:39.270> is

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
different game which I'll show you is

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.440 
different game which I'll show you is
installed<00:04:39.990> this<00:04:40.140> set<00:04:40.350> up<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.710> not<00:04:41.180> stand<00:04:42.180> and

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
installed this set up to not stand and

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.360 
installed this set up to not stand and
ce4<00:04:42.870> can<00:04:43.080> actually<00:04:43.350> be<00:04:43.470> really<00:04:43.680> effective<00:04:43.950> if

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
ce4 can actually be really effective if

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.180 
ce4 can actually be really effective if
you<00:04:44.490> use<00:04:44.610> it<00:04:44.760> properly<00:04:44.910> so<00:04:45.980> i'll<00:04:46.980> show<00:04:47.160> that

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
you use it properly so i'll show that

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.870 
you use it properly so i'll show that
Liam<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:48.570> other<00:04:48.720> stuff<00:04:49.050> on<00:04:49.260> here<00:04:49.580> all<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:50.610> think

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
Liam and other stuff on here all I think

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.250 
Liam and other stuff on here all I think
about<00:04:51.030> stuff<00:04:51.300> bomber<00:04:51.540> I<00:04:51.750> think<00:04:52.020> it's<00:04:52.110> pretty

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
about stuff bomber I think it's pretty

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.960 
about stuff bomber I think it's pretty
damn<00:04:52.560> good<00:04:52.800> but<00:04:53.040> probably<00:04:53.310> nowhere<00:04:53.550> near<00:04:53.850> as

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
damn good but probably nowhere near as

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.280 
damn good but probably nowhere near as
good<00:04:54.000> as<00:04:54.180> a<00:04:54.240> pavelow<00:04:54.480> so<00:04:54.840> that<00:04:54.960> maybe<00:04:55.050> this

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
good as a pavelow so that maybe this

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.200 
good as a pavelow so that maybe this
should<00:04:55.380> be<00:04:55.440> R<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:55.860> guess<00:04:56.820> in<00:04:56.970> a<00:04:57.210> killstreak<00:04:57.630> cool

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
should be R I guess in a killstreak cool

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.280 
should be R I guess in a killstreak cool
maybe<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.360> should<00:05:00.480> put<00:05:00.600> Harry<00:05:00.810> is<00:05:00.960> up<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.200> 8

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
maybe the should put Harry is up to 8

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.790 
maybe the should put Harry is up to 8

either<00:05:04.800> no<00:05:05.100> you're<00:05:05.370> just<00:05:06.590> this<00:05:07.590> massive

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190

damage<00:05:08.550> put<00:05:08.970> it<00:05:09.060> right<00:05:09.210> on<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.480> edge<00:05:09.570> of<00:05:09.660> the

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
damage put it right on the edge of the

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.980 
damage put it right on the edge of the
map<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.730> it<00:05:11.730> will<00:05:11.880> basically<00:05:12.390> go<00:05:12.660> across<00:05:12.810> the

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
map and it will basically go across the

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.170 
map and it will basically go across the
entire<00:05:13.320> map<00:05:13.590> and<00:05:13.860> in<00:05:14.310> the<00:05:14.520> direction<00:05:14.850> that<00:05:15.060> you

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
entire map and in the direction that you

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.850 
entire map and in the direction that you
put<00:05:15.330> the<00:05:15.360> arrow<00:05:15.540> and<00:05:15.870> it<00:05:15.930> will<00:05:16.050> just<00:05:16.320> glitter

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
put the arrow and it will just glitter

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.510 
put the arrow and it will just glitter
or<00:05:17.040> anything<00:05:18.290> but<00:05:19.290> this<00:05:19.890> is<00:05:20.040> a<00:05:20.070> map<00:05:20.310> where

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
or anything but this is a map where

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.920 
or anything but this is a map where
those<00:05:20.670> people<00:05:20.970> hiding<00:05:21.150> building<00:05:21.540> so<00:05:21.780> you're

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
those people hiding building so you're

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.190 
those people hiding building so you're
not<00:05:22.020> going<00:05:22.170> to<00:05:22.260> get<00:05:22.320> that<00:05:22.470> money<00:05:23.360> so<00:05:24.360> really<00:05:24.750> I

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
not going to get that money so really I

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.990 
not going to get that money so really I
think<00:05:25.320> the<00:05:25.530> game<00:05:25.710> is<00:05:25.740> coming<00:05:25.950> to<00:05:26.130> a<00:05:26.160> close<00:05:26.220> so<00:05:26.610> I

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
think the game is coming to a close so I

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.490 
think the game is coming to a close so I
hope<00:05:27.270> you<00:05:27.420> don't<00:05:27.570> mind<00:05:27.690> me<00:05:27.870> making<00:05:28.110> this<00:05:28.350> kind

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
hope you don't mind me making this kind

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.680 
hope you don't mind me making this kind
