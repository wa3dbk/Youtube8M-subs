halfway I want to squeeze it again yeah

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.170 
halfway I want to squeeze it again yeah
that's<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:16.709> all<00:03:17.709> right<00:03:17.770> that's<00:03:17.950> number<00:03:18.459> one

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
that's it all right that's number one

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.270 
that's it all right that's number one
wherever<00:03:20.110> you<00:03:20.260> put<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.500> crimp<00:03:20.739> you<00:03:20.860> can<00:03:21.040> see<00:03:21.160> how

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
wherever you put a crimp you can see how

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.010 
wherever you put a crimp you can see how
easy<00:03:21.459> that<00:03:21.580> was<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:22.030> get<00:03:22.180> our<00:03:22.270> cold<00:03:22.510> water<00:03:22.720> line

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
easy that was to get our cold water line

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.600 
easy that was to get our cold water line
on<00:03:23.050> we're<00:03:23.380> basically<00:03:23.800> done<00:03:24.130> with<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.370> cold

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
on we're basically done with the cold

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.580 
on we're basically done with the cold
water<00:03:24.790> line<00:03:25.030> because<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.989> hot<00:03:26.200> I'm<00:03:26.380> going<00:03:26.440> to

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
water line because the hot I'm going to

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.960 
water line because the hot I'm going to
come<00:03:26.739> higher<00:03:27.070> ah<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:30.400> you<00:03:30.519> don't<00:03:30.730> want<00:03:30.910> to

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
come higher ah and you don't want to

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.020 
come higher ah and you don't want to
forget<00:03:31.150> one<00:03:31.570> of<00:03:31.600> these<00:03:31.780> grips<00:03:32.080> though<00:03:32.970> now<00:03:33.970> you

forget one of these grips though now you

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.460 
forget one of these grips though now you
want<00:03:34.330> to<00:03:34.420> double<00:03:34.750> check<00:03:34.780> make<00:03:35.110> sure<00:03:35.320> you've

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
want to double check make sure you've

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.440 
want to double check make sure you've
clipped<00:03:35.800> everything<00:03:36.310> if<00:03:36.550> we<00:03:36.670> turn<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.300> water

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
clipped everything if we turn the water

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.320 
clipped everything if we turn the water
back<00:03:37.570> out<00:03:39.570> good

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
back out good

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.979 
back out good
okay<00:03:43.330> now<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.720> left<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.200> right<00:03:44.410> crimp<00:03:44.860> rings

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
okay now the left and right crimp rings

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.180 
okay now the left and right crimp rings
yeah<00:03:46.989> I<00:03:47.019> leave<00:03:47.260> like<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.440> little<00:03:47.709> eighth<00:03:47.920> inch

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
yeah I leave like a little eighth inch

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.460 
yeah I leave like a little eighth inch
by<00:03:48.550> eight<00:03:48.730> hundred<00:03:48.970> eight<00:03:49.570> inch<00:03:49.810> of<00:03:49.989> plastic

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
by eight hundred eight inch of plastic

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.120 
by eight hundred eight inch of plastic
shell<00:03:50.739> on

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
shell on

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.050 
shell on
to<00:03:53.680> see<00:03:54.680> how<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:54.890> room<00:03:55.400> doesn't<00:03:55.640> go<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:55.940> whole

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
to see how the room doesn't go the whole

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.340 
to see how the room doesn't go the whole
way<00:03:56.150> out<00:03:56.300> to<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.570> end<00:03:56.720> it's<00:03:56.900> like<00:03:57.080> an<00:03:57.200> eighth

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
way out to the end it's like an eighth

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.750 
way out to the end it's like an eighth
of<00:03:57.500> an<00:03:57.620> inch<00:03:57.710> back<00:03:58.040> from<00:03:58.280> the<00:03:58.370> edge<00:03:58.520> of<00:03:58.550> the

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
of an inch back from the edge of the

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:08.050 
of an inch back from the edge of the
white<00:03:58.940> -<00:04:06.520> that's<00:04:07.520> it

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
white - that's it

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.500 
white - that's it
that's<00:04:08.960> a<00:04:09.110> watertight<00:04:09.440> seal<00:04:09.680> right<00:04:10.250> there<00:04:10.510> all

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
that's a watertight seal right there all

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.390 
that's a watertight seal right there all
right<00:04:11.540> shouts<00:04:11.900> so<00:04:12.170> how<00:04:12.320> easy<00:04:12.470> that<00:04:12.950> is<00:04:13.010> to<00:04:13.190> do

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
right shouts so how easy that is to do

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.190 
right shouts so how easy that is to do
compared<00:04:13.850> to<00:04:13.910> using<00:04:14.150> solder<00:04:14.630> and<00:04:14.990> a<00:04:15.320> torch<00:04:15.620> I

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
compared to using solder and a torch I

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.420 
compared to using solder and a torch I
gotta<00:04:18.200> get<00:04:18.350> that<00:04:18.470> one<00:04:18.530> over<00:04:18.920> there<00:04:19.070> for<00:04:19.280> that

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
gotta get that one over there for that

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.760 
gotta get that one over there for that
1x<00:04:19.760> line<00:04:19.970> actually<00:04:20.239> has<00:04:20.570> a<00:04:20.600> higher<00:04:21.050> blowout

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
1x line actually has a higher blowout

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.160 
1x line actually has a higher blowout
rating<00:04:22.280> than<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.640> copper<00:04:23.300> it<00:04:23.510> doesn't<00:04:23.840> freeze

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
rating than the copper it doesn't freeze

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.820 
rating than the copper it doesn't freeze
and<00:04:24.410> crack<00:04:25.480> you<00:04:26.480> don't<00:04:26.660> need<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:27.080> solder<00:04:27.500> your

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
and crack you don't need to solder your

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.030 
and crack you don't need to solder your
lenses<00:04:28.220> together<00:04:28.580> it's<00:04:28.940> just<00:04:29.830> flex<00:04:30.830> your<00:04:30.920> pecs

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
lenses together it's just flex your pecs

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.190 
lenses together it's just flex your pecs
line<00:04:31.460> into<00:04:31.760> position<00:04:32.270> get<00:04:32.540> over<00:04:32.780> top<00:04:32.990> your

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
line into position get over top your

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.020 
line into position get over top your
pecs<00:04:33.470> fittings<00:04:33.890> put<00:04:34.100> a<00:04:34.130> ring<00:04:34.400> on<00:04:34.550> and<00:04:34.910> just

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
pecs fittings put a ring on and just

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:42.940 
pecs fittings put a ring on and just
crumble<00:04:40.090> ring<00:04:41.090> on<00:04:41.240> there<00:04:41.510> and<00:04:41.720> just<00:04:41.950> squeeze
