everything from carpentry to mechanics

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.229 
everything from carpentry to mechanics
to<00:00:30.660> electronics<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.920> even<00:00:32.279> just<00:00:32.640> design<00:00:32.969> stuff

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
to electronics to even just design stuff

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.970 
to electronics to even just design stuff
is<00:00:33.420> all<00:00:33.540> kind<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.809> compounded<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.530> top<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.860> each

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
is all kind of compounded on top of each

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.729 
is all kind of compounded on top of each
other<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.370> now<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.239> feel<00:00:36.780> comfortable<00:00:36.899> kind<00:00:37.620> of

other and now I feel comfortable kind of
tackling<00:00:38.190> almost<00:00:38.489> anything<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:39.059> kind<00:00:39.210> of

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
tackling almost anything it kind of

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.630 
tackling almost anything it kind of
clicked<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:39.809> me<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.410> prefer<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.399> things

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
clicked for me that I prefer the things

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.459 
clicked for me that I prefer the things
that<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.910> build<00:00:42.300> over<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> things<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.230> can

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
that I build over the things that I can

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.279 
that I build over the things that I can
buy<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.610> started<00:00:44.910> with<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.149> table<00:00:45.570> that

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
buy and it started with the table that

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.420 
buy and it started with the table that
we're<00:00:46.440> actually<00:00:46.559> sitting<00:00:46.890> at<00:00:47.070> right<00:00:47.219> now

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
we're actually sitting at right now

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.950 
we're actually sitting at right now
basically<00:00:48.000> they<00:00:48.210> needed<00:00:48.570> high<00:00:48.719> top<00:00:48.930> tables

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
basically they needed high top tables

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.619 
basically they needed high top tables
but<00:00:49.800> they<00:00:49.920> used<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.430> room<00:00:50.760> other<00:00:51.210> days<00:00:51.510> of

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
but they used this room other days of

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.029 
but they used this room other days of
the<00:00:51.690> week<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:52.110> meetings<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.770> things<00:00:52.860> like

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
the week for meetings and things like

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.139 
the week for meetings and things like
that<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.309> they<00:00:53.399> needed<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.730> able<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.940> roll

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
that so they needed to be able to roll

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.549 
that so they needed to be able to roll
away<00:00:54.270> but<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.930> didn't<00:00:55.079> want<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.410> put

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
away but I didn't want to just put

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.139 
away but I didn't want to just put
casters<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.070> them<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.340> made<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.670> where<00:00:56.969> you

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
casters on them so I made it where you

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.200 
casters on them so I made it where you
put<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.480> little<00:00:57.629> socket<00:00:57.930> on<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:59.210> turn

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
put in this little socket on here turn

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.970 
put in this little socket on here turn
and<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> wheels<00:01:00.660> pop<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:01.020> how<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.710> works<00:01:01.859> is

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and the wheels pop up how it works is

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.410 
and the wheels pop up how it works is
you<00:01:02.010> get<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.190> rod<00:01:02.370> going<00:01:02.760> across<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.120> center

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
you get a rod going across the center

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.780 
you get a rod going across the center
and<00:01:03.629> you've<00:01:04.019> got<00:01:04.170> an<00:01:04.350> oblong<00:01:04.890> circle<00:01:05.400> here<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
and you've got an oblong circle here and

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.429 
and you've got an oblong circle here and
then<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.390> wheels<00:01:06.659> are<00:01:06.990> attached<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
then the wheels are attached to the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.570 
then the wheels are attached to the
bottom<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:07.860> when<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.040> turn<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:11.159> wheels<00:01:11.340> come

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
bottom so when you turn the wheels come

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.190 
bottom so when you turn the wheels come
up<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.909> got<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.210> thinking<00:01:12.720> all<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
up I got to thinking all of the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.130 
up I got to thinking all of the
different<00:01:13.500> stages<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:14.070> DIY<00:01:15.000> competency<00:01:15.780> that

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
different stages of DIY competency that

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.440 
different stages of DIY competency that
I<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.590> remember<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.150> what<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.299> came

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
I can remember and this is what I came

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.030 
I can remember and this is what I came
up<00:01:18.540> with<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.750> think<00:01:18.930> there's<00:01:19.080> four<00:01:19.290> stages<00:01:19.680> to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
up with I think there's four stages to

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.640 
up with I think there's four stages to
DIY<00:01:20.880> know-how<00:01:21.240> stage<00:01:21.659> one<00:01:21.930> unavoidable

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
DIY know-how stage one unavoidable

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.859 
DIY know-how stage one unavoidable
frustration<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.939> me<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.570> feels<00:01:24.750> like

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
frustration this is me it feels like

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.420 
frustration this is me it feels like
every<00:01:25.110> project<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.710> start<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.250> turned

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
every project that I start just turned

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.219 
every project that I start just turned
out<00:01:26.549> horribly<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.390> for<00:01:27.659> me<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:28.110> remember

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
out horribly and for me I can remember

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.219 
out horribly and for me I can remember
back<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.950> when<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.189> was<00:01:29.220> fifteen<00:01:30.030> or<00:01:30.420> sixteen<00:01:30.659> I

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
back to when I was fifteen or sixteen I

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.590 
back to when I was fifteen or sixteen I
installed<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.159> car<00:01:32.340> stereo<00:01:32.579> in<00:01:32.970> my<00:01:33.030> first<00:01:33.360> car

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
installed a car stereo in my first car

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.859 
installed a car stereo in my first car
and<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.500> ended<00:01:34.799> up<00:01:35.009> horrible<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.850> thing<00:01:36.689> in

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
and it ended up horrible the thing in

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.510 
and it ended up horrible the thing in
the<00:01:36.960> dash<00:01:37.170> was<00:01:37.409> all<00:01:37.560> shaky<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.280> broke<00:01:38.490> a

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the dash was all shaky and I broke a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.819 
the dash was all shaky and I broke a
bunch<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.850> trim<00:01:39.060> pieces<00:01:39.299> at<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.960> stage<00:01:40.560> you

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
bunch of trim pieces at this stage you

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.800 
bunch of trim pieces at this stage you
need<00:01:41.040> very<00:01:41.729> clear<00:01:42.090> step-by-step

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
need very clear step-by-step

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.030 
need very clear step-by-step
instructions<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.500> get<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.740> through<00:01:43.920> any

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
instructions to get you through any

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.280 
instructions to get you through any
project<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:44.820> even<00:01:45.149> one<00:01:45.329> step<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.869> unclear

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
project and if even one step is unclear

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.780 
project and if even one step is unclear
then<00:01:46.770> your<00:01:46.950> whole<00:01:47.070> day<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.220> ruined

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
then your whole day is ruined

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.789 
then your whole day is ruined
Stage<00:01:48.149> two<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.570> questionable<00:01:49.079> confidence<00:01:49.590> and

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
Stage two is questionable confidence and

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.170 
Stage two is questionable confidence and
this<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.070> when<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.579> show<00:01:50.759> your<00:01:50.790> finished

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
this is when you show your finished

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.700 
this is when you show your finished
project<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.750> your<00:01:51.840> friends<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.380> they

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
project to your friends and they

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.380 
project to your friends and they
complement<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.250> through<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.460> four<00:01:53.670> smile<00:01:53.970> and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
complement it through a four smile and

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.649 
complement it through a four smile and
for<00:01:55.079> me<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.280> when<00:01:56.460> nothing<00:01:56.909> was<00:01:57.090> quite<00:01:57.329> as

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
for me this is when nothing was quite as

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.200 
for me this is when nothing was quite as
good<00:01:57.840> as<00:01:58.020> store-bought<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.790> it<00:01:59.790> was<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
good as store-bought and it was the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.359 
good as store-bought and it was the
joinery<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.899> was<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.350> worst<00:02:01.560> for<00:02:01.829> me<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.159> any

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
joinery that was the worst for me in any

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.590 
joinery that was the worst for me in any
sort<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.610> woodworking<00:02:02.909> project<00:02:03.360> everything

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
sort of woodworking project everything

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.270 
sort of woodworking project everything
was<00:02:03.869> kind<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.350> slightly<00:02:04.710> crooked<00:02:04.890> or

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
was kind of just slightly crooked or

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.940 
was kind of just slightly crooked or
overhanging<00:02:05.759> nothing<00:02:06.719> was<00:02:06.869> ever<00:02:06.899> plumb<00:02:07.409> level

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
overhanging nothing was ever plumb level

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.190 
overhanging nothing was ever plumb level
or<00:02:08.160> square<00:02:08.550> but<00:02:09.300> at<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.840> point<00:02:10.020> you're

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
or square but at this point you're

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.760 
or square but at this point you're
really<00:02:10.319> proud<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.649> your<00:02:10.860> work

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
really proud of your work

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.960 
really proud of your work
you<00:02:11.920> want<00:02:12.070> to<00:02:12.160> show<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.400> off<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:12.730> you<00:02:12.790> think

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
you want to show it off and you think

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.640 
you want to show it off and you think
you<00:02:13.030> can<00:02:13.150> tackle<00:02:13.330> anything<00:02:13.630> stage<00:02:14.110> three<00:02:14.470> is

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
you can tackle anything stage three is

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.710 
you can tackle anything stage three is
passing<00:02:15.490> grave<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.000> this<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.300> when<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.540> can

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
passing grave and this is when you can

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.940 
passing grave and this is when you can
see<00:02:16.840> something<00:02:17.020> on<00:02:17.230> Pinterest<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.740> pretty

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
see something on Pinterest and pretty

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.850 
see something on Pinterest and pretty
much<00:02:18.070> replicated<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.270> for<00:02:19.570> me<00:02:19.690> this<00:02:20.020> is<00:02:20.290> when

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
much replicated and for me this is when

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.700 
much replicated and for me this is when
things<00:02:21.390> aren't<00:02:22.390> quite<00:02:22.840> as<00:02:23.080> good<00:02:23.260> as<00:02:23.530> they

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
things aren't quite as good as they

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.050 
things aren't quite as good as they
could<00:02:23.770> be<00:02:23.920> when<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:24.310> buy<00:02:24.430> them<00:02:24.610> at<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.820> store

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
could be when you buy them at the store

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.150 
could be when you buy them at the store
but<00:02:25.510> you're<00:02:26.140> still<00:02:26.380> really<00:02:26.470> proud<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.710> it<00:02:26.890> into

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
but you're still really proud of it into

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.400 
but you're still really proud of it into
an<00:02:27.250> untrained<00:02:27.700> eye<00:02:27.970> no<00:02:28.810> one<00:02:28.930> can<00:02:29.080> really<00:02:29.170> tell

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
an untrained eye no one can really tell

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.290 
an untrained eye no one can really tell
the<00:02:29.440> difference<00:02:29.830> at<00:02:30.040> this<00:02:30.190> stage<00:02:30.400> no<00:02:30.730> specific

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
the difference at this stage no specific

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.910 
the difference at this stage no specific
instructions<00:02:31.840> are<00:02:31.960> needed<00:02:32.230> but<00:02:32.770> you're

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
instructions are needed but you're

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.590 
instructions are needed but you're
really<00:02:33.520> just<00:02:33.670> copying<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.180> lot<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.450> other

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
people's work you're not really doing

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.470 
people's work you're not really doing
anything<00:02:36.040> original<00:02:36.370> or<00:02:36.730> on<00:02:36.880> your<00:02:37.000> own<00:02:37.150> stage

anything original or on your own stage
for<00:02:37.720> better<00:02:38.020> than<00:02:38.110> buying<00:02:38.410> this<00:02:39.250> is<00:02:39.430> when<00:02:39.580> you

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
for better than buying this is when you

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.120 
for better than buying this is when you
start<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.210> notice<00:02:40.450> faults<00:02:41.170> in<00:02:41.320> manufactured

materials<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:43.420> kind<00:02:43.690> of<00:02:43.870> when<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:44.710> set

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
materials that you kind of when you set

out<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.100> do<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.220> project<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.700> can<00:02:45.850> not<00:02:46.000> only

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
out to do a project you can not only

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.330 
out to do a project you can not only
just<00:02:46.420> see<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.990> end<00:02:47.140> result<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.860> vision<00:02:48.220> it

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
just see the end result and vision it

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.800 
just see the end result and vision it
but<00:02:48.490> you<00:02:48.580> can<00:02:48.730> also<00:02:48.910> see<00:02:49.240> the<00:02:49.360> problems<00:02:49.750> that

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
but you can also see the problems that

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.910 
but you can also see the problems that
you're<00:02:49.960> gonna<00:02:50.050> have<00:02:50.260> along<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.590> way<00:02:50.710> you

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
you're gonna have along the way you

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.400 
you're gonna have along the way you
don't<00:02:51.100> need<00:02:51.280> any<00:02:51.460> instructions<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.360> kind<00:02:53.320> of

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
don't need any instructions you kind of

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.200 
don't need any instructions you kind of
visualize<00:02:53.800> it<00:02:53.980> in<00:02:54.070> your<00:02:54.190> own<00:02:54.280> mind<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:54.760> see

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
visualize it in your own mind and see

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.340 
visualize it in your own mind and see
what<00:02:55.360> you're<00:02:55.450> gonna<00:02:55.510> need<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.750> do<00:02:55.930> every<00:02:56.290> step

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
what you're gonna need to do every step

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.840 
what you're gonna need to do every step
of<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.680> way<00:02:56.740> you<00:02:56.920> can<00:02:57.070> often<00:02:57.190> build<00:02:57.580> or<00:02:57.820> fix

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
of the way you can often build or fix

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.390 
of the way you can often build or fix
things<00:02:58.240> cheaper<00:02:58.750> better<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.860> sometimes<00:03:00.190> even

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
things cheaper better and sometimes even

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.190 
things cheaper better and sometimes even
faster<00:03:00.550> than<00:03:00.820> hiring<00:03:01.150> someone<00:03:01.690> else<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.960> do<00:03:02.080> it

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
faster than hiring someone else to do it

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.570 
faster than hiring someone else to do it
and<00:03:02.380> this<00:03:02.470> is<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.650> point<00:03:02.890> where<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.160> prefer

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
and this is the point where you prefer

I<00:03:10.150> recently<00:03:10.330> had<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.630> conversation<00:03:10.780> about<00:03:11.350> how

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
I recently had a conversation about how

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.370 
I recently had a conversation about how
people<00:03:12.610> aren't<00:03:12.880> as<00:03:12.940> capable<00:03:13.120> as<00:03:13.630> fixing<00:03:14.260> or

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
people aren't as capable as fixing or

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.350 
people aren't as capable as fixing or
repairing<00:03:14.830> their<00:03:14.980> own<00:03:15.070> things<00:03:15.400> as<00:03:15.640> I<00:03:15.910> expect

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
repairing their own things as I expect

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.730 
repairing their own things as I expect
I'm<00:03:16.570> not<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:16.840> sure<00:03:17.020> about<00:03:17.050> that<00:03:17.230> but<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.590> brings

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
I'm not so sure about that but it brings

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.680 
I'm not so sure about that but it brings
up<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:17.950> question<00:03:18.070> is<00:03:18.490> everyone<00:03:19.030> capable<00:03:19.480> of

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
up the question is everyone capable of

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.480 
up the question is everyone capable of
going<00:03:19.840> through<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.200> four<00:03:20.350> stages<00:03:20.560> of<00:03:20.740> DIY<00:03:21.220> I

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
going through the four stages of DIY I

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.949 
going through the four stages of DIY I
think<00:03:21.700> with<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:21.910> internet<00:03:21.940> and<00:03:22.480> YouTube<00:03:22.840> at

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
think with the internet and YouTube at

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.930 
think with the internet and YouTube at
our<00:03:23.050> fingertips<00:03:23.290> anybody<00:03:24.100> can<00:03:24.400> learn<00:03:24.670> how<00:03:24.910> to

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
our fingertips anybody can learn how to

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.850 
our fingertips anybody can learn how to
turn<00:03:25.390> a<00:03:25.420> wrench<00:03:25.690> or<00:03:25.870> pound<00:03:26.110> a<00:03:26.230> hammer<00:03:26.410> where<00:03:26.830> I

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
turn a wrench or pound a hammer where I

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.590 
turn a wrench or pound a hammer where I
think<00:03:27.130> most<00:03:27.340> people<00:03:27.670> have<00:03:27.850> trouble<00:03:28.120> is<00:03:28.420> in<00:03:28.510> the

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
think most people have trouble is in the

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.720 
think most people have trouble is in the
diagnosis<00:03:29.230> because<00:03:29.740> anyone<00:03:30.190> can<00:03:30.340> change<00:03:30.370> the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
diagnosis because anyone can change the

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.580 
diagnosis because anyone can change the
battery<00:03:31.060> in<00:03:31.150> their<00:03:31.330> car<00:03:31.600> but<00:03:31.840> not<00:03:31.990> everyone

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
battery in their car but not everyone

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.380 
battery in their car but not everyone
can<00:03:32.860> figure<00:03:33.280> out<00:03:33.430> why<00:03:33.790> their<00:03:34.030> car<00:03:34.240> isn't

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
can figure out why their car isn't

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.270 
can figure out why their car isn't
started<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.050> this<00:03:35.200> is<00:03:35.350> where<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.680> paradox<00:03:36.100> of

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
started and this is where the paradox of

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.460 
started and this is where the paradox of
the<00:03:36.490> heat<00:03:36.610> comes<00:03:36.850> in<00:03:37.060> because<00:03:37.240> as<00:03:37.660> you<00:03:38.140> slowly

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
the heat comes in because as you slowly

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.560 
the heat comes in because as you slowly
acquire<00:03:39.070> skills<00:03:39.459> by<00:03:39.670> getting<00:03:40.000> just<00:03:40.270> slightly

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
acquire skills by getting just slightly

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.690 
acquire skills by getting just slightly
out<00:03:40.720> of<00:03:40.990> your<00:03:41.110> comfort<00:03:41.320> zone<00:03:41.680> eventually<00:03:42.520> all

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
out of your comfort zone eventually all

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.000 
out of your comfort zone eventually all
that<00:03:42.820> knowledge<00:03:43.090> compounds<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.200> you<00:03:44.590> develop

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
that knowledge compounds and you develop

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.920 
that knowledge compounds and you develop
some<00:03:45.190> basic<00:03:45.550> problem-solving<00:03:46.150> skills<00:03:46.420> what
