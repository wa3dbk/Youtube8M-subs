00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
from the goal line to the ten we talked

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.589 
from the goal line to the ten we talked
about<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.309> area<00:00:14.670> being<00:00:14.880> our<00:00:15.089> coming-out

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
about that area being our coming-out

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.320 
about that area being our coming-out
zone<00:00:15.990> okay<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.430> coming<00:00:17.760> out<00:00:17.910> zone<00:00:18.150> you

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
zone okay and in the coming out zone you

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.240 
zone okay and in the coming out zone you
can<00:00:18.359> see<00:00:18.720> on<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.080> opposite<00:00:19.770> side<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.039> the

can see on the opposite side of the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.390 
can see on the opposite side of the
slide<00:00:20.550> here<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:21.720> feel<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.350> that's<00:00:22.949> an<00:00:23.189> area

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
slide here we feel that that's an area

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.349 
slide here we feel that that's an area
you<00:00:23.910> know<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:25.470> could<00:00:25.650> take<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> shot<00:00:26.189> at<00:00:26.609> so

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
you know we could take a shot at so

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.120 
you know we could take a shot at so
basically<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:28.109> have<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> vertical<00:00:28.619> throw

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
basically we have a vertical throw

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.020 
basically we have a vertical throw
within<00:00:30.090> our<00:00:30.269> package<00:00:31.080> down<00:00:31.320> there<00:00:31.679> or<00:00:31.920> plan<00:00:32.700> in

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
within our package down there or plan in

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.850 
within our package down there or plan in
that<00:00:33.059> particular<00:00:33.600> portion<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
that particular portion of the of the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.830 
that particular portion of the of the
field<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.940> be<00:00:36.059> able<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.300> take<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> shot

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
field to be able to take a shot

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.619 
field to be able to take a shot
vertically<00:00:37.410> down<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.829> field<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.969> also<00:00:39.000> want

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
vertically down the field we also want

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.139 
vertically down the field we also want
to<00:00:39.690> manage<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> clock<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.489> what<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.850> means

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
to manage the clock so what that means

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.750 
to manage the clock so what that means
is<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> following<00:00:42.590> if<00:00:43.590> there's<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.190> know<00:00:44.399> if

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
this situation or fill position for us

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.489 
this situation or fill position for us
we<00:02:13.379> call<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.859> yellow<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:15.030> an<00:02:15.510> extent<00:02:15.930> or

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
closer we get to the 40-yard line we can

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.890 
closer we get to the 40-yard line we can
end<00:02:23.099> up<00:02:23.189> changing<00:02:23.489> field<00:02:24.030> position<00:02:24.659> for<00:02:24.689> the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
end up changing field position for the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.720 
end up changing field position for the
