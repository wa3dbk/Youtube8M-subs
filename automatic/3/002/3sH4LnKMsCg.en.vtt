00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
going by going in the opposite direction

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.720 
going by going in the opposite direction
that<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.420> did<00:00:45.570> not<00:00:45.719> come<00:00:46.020> from<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.730> but

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
that and it did not come from that but

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.100 
that and it did not come from that but
it<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.000> went<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.360> show<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.719> at<00:00:48.870> any<00:00:49.020> given

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
it just went to show that at any given

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.590 
it just went to show that at any given
time<00:00:49.820> something<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:50.940> drop<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.180> out<00:00:51.390> of

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
time something can drop that out of

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.139 
time something can drop that out of
space<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.250> they<00:00:53.250> obviously<00:00:53.460> cannot<00:00:53.969> keep

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
space and they obviously cannot keep

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.040 
space and they obviously cannot keep

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.219 
vision can hold true and you can go back
and<00:01:47.759> say<00:01:47.880> oh<00:01:47.909> my<00:01:48.180> gosh<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.600> guy<00:01:48.780> actually

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
and say oh my gosh this guy actually

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.870 
and say oh my gosh this guy actually
called<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.799> was<00:01:49.950> true<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.310> was<00:01:50.430> real<00:01:50.640> and

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
called it it was true it was real and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.130 
called it it was true it was real and
then<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.119> could<00:01:51.240> start<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.540> take<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> look<00:01:52.020> at

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
then you could start to take a look at

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.310 
then you could start to take a look at
that<00:01:52.259> person's<00:01:52.710> validity<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:54.180> if<00:01:55.140> they're

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
that person's validity and if they're

this<00:03:59.900> limited<00:04:00.590> number<00:04:00.980> of<00:04:01.450> observations<00:04:02.450> on

this limited number of observations on

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.240 
this limited number of observations on
it<00:04:03.460> and<00:04:04.870> they<00:04:05.870> had<00:04:06.110> watched<00:04:06.530> this<00:04:06.800> thing<00:04:07.070> for

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
it and they had watched this thing for

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.970 
it and they had watched this thing for
some<00:04:07.370> time<00:04:07.580> and<00:04:08.410> they<00:04:09.410> gave<00:04:09.650> it<00:04:09.680> that

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
some time and they gave it that

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.120 
some time and they gave it that
probability<00:04:10.730> event<00:04:11.330> of<00:04:11.510> an<00:04:11.660> impact<00:04:11.990> okay<00:04:12.920> at

some<00:04:13.400> point<00:04:13.700> time<00:04:14.650> after<00:04:15.650> all<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:16.010> talk<00:04:16.220> I

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
some point time after all the talk I

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.719 
some point time after all the talk I
kicked<00:04:16.760> up<00:04:18.520> just<00:04:19.520> four<00:04:19.880> days<00:04:20.150> later<00:04:21.490> four<00:04:22.490> days

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
kicked up just four days later four days

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.300 
kicked up just four days later four days
which<00:04:23.150> at<00:04:23.450> all<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.229> time<00:04:24.500> you<00:04:24.620> had<00:04:24.740> four<00:04:25.040> days

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
which at all that time you had four days

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.720 
which at all that time you had four days
of

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
of

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.610 
of
possible<00:04:26.090> observations<00:04:26.840> there's<00:04:27.200> no<00:04:27.410> way

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
possible observations there's no way

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.300 
possible observations there's no way
that<00:04:28.040> it<00:04:28.310> had<00:04:28.430> changed<00:04:29.650> their<00:04:30.650> calculations

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
that it had changed their calculations

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.850 
that it had changed their calculations
that<00:04:31.370> much<00:04:31.930> but<00:04:32.930> they're<00:04:33.080> saying<00:04:33.260> it<00:04:33.410> did<00:04:33.590> and

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
that much but they're saying it did and

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.030 
that much but they're saying it did and
that<00:04:34.330> they<00:04:35.330> do<00:04:35.390> not<00:04:35.900> believe<00:04:36.380> they're<00:04:36.890> gonna

the stuff flying around out there how

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.750 
the stuff flying around out there how
come<00:05:47.930> we're<00:05:48.080> not<00:05:48.110> hit<00:05:48.530> more<00:05:49.100> how<00:05:49.400> come<00:05:49.610> we're

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
come we're not hit more how come we're

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.120 
come we're not hit more how come we're
not<00:05:49.910> the<00:05:50.150> moons<00:05:50.390> not<00:05:50.690> hit<00:05:51.080> all<00:05:51.290> the<00:05:51.680> time<00:05:51.890> and

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
this planet in a sense that will

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.770 
this planet in a sense that will
penetrate<00:06:18.770> things<00:06:19.280> and<00:06:19.610> is<00:06:20.240> there<00:06:20.450> technology

penetrate things and is there technology
out<00:06:21.170> there<00:06:21.200> on<00:06:21.890> a<00:06:21.950> higher<00:06:22.310> level<00:06:22.340> than<00:06:22.820> most

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
out there on a higher level than most

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.040 
out there on a higher level than most
people<00:06:23.270> could<00:06:23.390> even<00:06:23.540> wrap<00:06:23.750> their<00:06:23.930> head<00:06:24.020> around

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
people could even wrap their head around

that's<00:06:24.530> blowing<00:06:25.070> stuff<00:06:25.280> up<00:06:25.520> knocking<00:06:26.060> things

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
that's blowing stuff up knocking things

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.020 
that's blowing stuff up knocking things
out<00:06:26.420> of<00:06:26.450> orbit<00:06:26.900> and<00:06:27.050> keeping<00:06:28.330> this<00:06:29.330> place<00:06:29.660> safe

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
out of orbit and keeping this place safe

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.340 
out of orbit and keeping this place safe
from<00:06:32.030> a<00:06:32.150> distance<00:06:32.570> they<00:06:32.720> see<00:06:32.780> something<00:06:33.260> even

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
from a distance they see something even

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.960 
from a distance they see something even
coming<00:06:33.740> into<00:06:33.860> our<00:06:34.010> solar<00:06:34.250> system<00:06:34.670> that<00:06:34.700> might

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
coming into our solar system that might

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.260 
coming into our solar system that might
be<00:06:35.000> on<00:06:35.210> track<00:06:35.420> to<00:06:36.490> knock<00:06:37.490> out<00:06:37.730> the<00:06:37.880> life<00:06:38.060> we

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
everything that's floating out in space

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.340 
everything that's floating out in space
but<00:06:55.750> either<00:06:56.750> way<00:06:57.110> it<00:06:57.230> goes<00:06:57.440> this<00:06:57.800> object

00:06:59.340 --> 00:06:59.350
