a very early build still that they're
running<00:04:55.840> so<00:04:56.320> you<00:04:56.380> can't<00:04:56.740> you<00:04:56.949> know<00:04:57.070> judge

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
running so you can't you know judge

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:06.600 
running so you can't you know judge
things<00:04:57.820> on<00:04:57.970> that<00:05:04.830> this<00:05:05.830> looks<00:05:06.250> like<00:05:06.430> in

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
things on that this looks like in

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.260 
things on that this looks like in
portrait<00:05:07.330> mode<00:05:08.400> it's<00:05:09.400> not<00:05:09.580> focusing<00:05:10.060> very

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
well but you get the idea so yeah this

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.990 
well but you get the idea so yeah this
is<00:05:15.430> a<00:05:15.610> quick<00:05:16.120> look<00:05:16.360> at<00:05:16.600> the<00:05:16.990> Nokia<00:05:17.500> n8<00:05:18.160> which

Symbian so stay tuned I will probably

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.850 
Symbian so stay tuned I will probably
have<00:05:33.250> more<00:05:33.280> coverage<00:05:33.729> on<00:05:33.880> the<00:05:34.030> n8<00:05:34.300> with<00:05:35.110> in<00:05:35.650> due

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
have more coverage on the n8 with in due

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.650 
have more coverage on the n8 with in due
