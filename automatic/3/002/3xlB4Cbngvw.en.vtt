 jaraíz de la vera and is the son and grandson of

 paprikaeros good josemaría since 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.440
 We have the raw material with which 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.210
 you work on one of the products 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.320
 well I'm not going to tell you the richest 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.629
 world but the richest there is in 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.220
 Spain paprika de la vera no 

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:35.870
 we as you see this is the matter 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.450
 premium that we buy like this in this way 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.360
 and dehydrated to buy 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.490
 farmers like cider change this 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.230
 product put one or two depending on the 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.050
 Dryer size by linked two 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.750
 firewood with oak or oak firewood 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.480
 is what the regulatory council demands already 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.220
 that are human let's say humans in 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.230
 the deviation becomes clear is a 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.739
 vertical combustion that gives a bit of a 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.140
 little heat 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.569
 the fire has to be very dim and the 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.560
 process has to last according to the council 

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:10.939
 regulator between 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.640
 and 15 days and that's why the pepper gets 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.840
 is the flavor this aroma this ship and 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.820
 later also that the smoke gives 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.680
 color stability and it's the difference 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.960
 of other nearby pepper is that what 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.540
 they make the air let's say then also 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.580
 three times at least you have to pass 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.640
 by the stone mills if you get 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.369
 also decades and give that color that 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.979
 texture that finesse and especially that 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.799
 consistency that also with color 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.000
 mills what we do is wind 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.610
 we rolled the seeds and took it out 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.830
 juice that ultimately is the oil the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.110
 fat and good although you like tomato 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.869
 the paprika with anyone the preferred 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.490
 in a very simple thing 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.350
 sprinkle you very little in an egg 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.270
 fried 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.790
 It is folded and bread with tomato and a little 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.070
 paprika or the tomato itself throw a 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.860
 little paprika and some good salt 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.710
 but for recipes with paprika that better 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.929
 that women give to see of jarandilla 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.940

 with onion, pepper and paprika 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:18.579
 Extremadura say it is extreme and hard 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:20.650
