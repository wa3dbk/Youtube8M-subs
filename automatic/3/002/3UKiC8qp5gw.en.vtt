drive<00:03:27.200> system<00:03:27.530> when<00:03:28.130> when<00:03:28.609> you<00:03:28.640> start<00:03:29.060> when

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
drive system when when you start when

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.720 
drive system when when you start when
you<00:03:29.329> launch<00:03:29.600> a<00:03:29.870> clip<00:03:30.440> pull<00:03:30.709> back<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.400> then

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
you launch a clip pull back and then

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.080 
you launch a clip pull back and then
like<00:03:32.000> a<00:03:32.030> semi<00:03:32.840> flat<00:03:33.200> pops<00:03:33.500> out<00:03:33.880> giving<00:03:34.880> us<00:03:34.970> one

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
of a defensive little bit but then when

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.729 
of a defensive little bit but then when
it<00:03:37.100> slows<00:03:37.280> down<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.730> goes<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:39.470> rubber

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
it slows down it goes and the rubber

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.069 
it slows down it goes and the rubber
it's<00:03:40.190> like<00:03:40.340> a<00:03:40.370> rubber<00:03:40.609> whole<00:03:40.819> flat<00:03:41.079> activates
