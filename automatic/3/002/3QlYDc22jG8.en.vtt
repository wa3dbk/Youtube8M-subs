00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.310
 hey people we'll be back at the 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.500
 Master and yes and today is about something 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.809
 very special we can already see 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.570
 is here so major in the background yes me 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.099
 ' ve recently unpacked that and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.260
 Incidentally , I also got that 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.390
 and let it be and I will have it 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.220
 something really great and would be mine 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.230
 assistant times ask me the vase over 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.460
 to push 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.109
 thank you my assistant it works 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.320
 namely, the inception on zelda the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.890
 wind waker hd view bundle with the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.210
 console plus the game as a download code 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.800
 yes I have to say the packaging is 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.390
 ever beautiful on the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.710
 I like the back very much with the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.850
 great u and the map of zelda 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.620
 I can say that this is me 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.570
 actually bought me around is 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.289
 to leave packed and just away 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.670
 deliver 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.760
 I have decided now but 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.930
 but also to do it because then 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.329
 nothing is closed and that is 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.100
 simply one would not make the difference 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.980
 see if it is needed or new 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.090
 that's why pack is out and we are 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.600
 Just take a look now 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.320
 more closely and I would say we lay 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.970
 lux i'll open this page 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.350
 and otherwise I would say of the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.720
 Packaging does not look different 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.450
 another necessarily get from 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.310
 whole cellar motives and if we do that 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.900
 the other wise have opened 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:26.580
 I try that right around time 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:30.000
 get out once so and then have 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.660
 already very nice things put on that 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.770
 here 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.930
 I see the whole one down 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.880
 great things yes here we have the way 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.480
 I will not code you once 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.880
 will show so that is likely of namely 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.230
 to be in the game what you just download 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.720
 Code in it is what I shit pretty much 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.310
 but you can not help it 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.990
 That's why I have the game yes 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.940
 still bought what they all 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.320
 should also do and how he does it 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.150
 Not 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.590
 And I want more now 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.870
 do not say anything because that's going to happen anyway 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.510
 the standard cable in there in my 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.130
 song you back in there too I was gonna 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.690
 Unboxing and linking 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.160
 if you want to see the whole day 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.960
 then watch this video rather 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.700
 is this all about more and 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.680
 gamepad because that's the only 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.540
 what does it look like other than the rest 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.170
 That's why I'm only telling you 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:21.170
 Show that and the whole time in 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.800
 this beautiful wrapper here and 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.990
 look at how great that looks and 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.030
 I have to say it looks really great 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.120
 and very nice golden very nice 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.140
 decorated and here is always one 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.540
 look at it 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.280
 yes, I think it's pretty cool 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.350
 the triforce with it is then stop 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.110
 all this ornament on the edge that the 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.239
 Keys are in gold so it is 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.280
 just really stylish out and for 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.700
 Of course every view owner is a must 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.410
 have 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.000
 Incidentally, I find it harmful that one 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.160
 that can not buy individually but 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.050
 that he tied the money to the console 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.780
 is and you therefore buy this blanket 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.300
 if you want to have that 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.010
 but well you have to stop by and as 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.950
 You just have to do that with zelda 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.110
 yes that was it with this one too 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.020
 unboxing here I would say because of 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.910
 rest looks like me too 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.670
 but still have a little thing 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.730
 to say that I would be the code 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.230
 want to sell for the zelda game 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.610
 I have the game as I said in the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.020
 normal version and I want that now 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.239
 not even really download or 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.920
 so if someone has interest 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.910
 should just write and 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.070
 maybe you can get a small price 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.269
 make or not and if I am 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.739
 maybe for a few days now 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.550
 No one reports sale is elsewhere or 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.080
 anything else 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.590
 but you have the first time 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.300
 chance to get hold of it and that 's it 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.290
 then already with this little video 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.549
 to the legend of zelda hd wandel 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.110
 I hope you have a little bit 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.000
 you like the gamepad 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.959
 seen and may interest 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.219
 to buy you something like that and 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.109
 then that's it with this video we 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:56.239
 See you the next time you're fine 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.569
 there and that is again a Bernese 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.569
 master
