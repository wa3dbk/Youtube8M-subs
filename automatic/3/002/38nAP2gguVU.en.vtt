00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
hi my name is penny and today I will be

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.240 
hi my name is penny and today I will be
explaining<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:03.030> you<00:00:03.179> why<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:04.200> soccer<00:00:04.529> ball<00:00:04.710> curs

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
explaining to you why a soccer ball curs

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.920 
explaining to you why a soccer ball curs
but<00:00:05.759> first<00:00:06.000> let<00:00:06.420> me<00:00:06.450> show<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.779> little

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
but first let me show you a little

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.430 
but first let me show you a little
demonstration<00:00:09.410> if<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.650> get<00:00:10.889> an<00:00:11.070> inclined<00:00:12.000> plane

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
demonstration if I get an inclined plane

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.470 
demonstration if I get an inclined plane
with<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> pencil<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.460> roll<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.910> pencil<00:00:15.299> off

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
with a pencil and I roll the pencil off

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.630 
with a pencil and I roll the pencil off
the<00:00:15.750> inclined<00:00:16.109> plane<00:00:16.250> what<00:00:17.250> should<00:00:17.400> happen

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
the inclined plane what should happen

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.210 
the inclined plane what should happen
the<00:00:18.570> pencil<00:00:19.020> should<00:00:19.199> fall<00:00:19.410> directly<00:00:20.039> down

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the pencil should fall directly down

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.609 
the pencil should fall directly down
onto<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.699> ground<00:00:22.010> as<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.340> but<00:00:24.260> if<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.439> get<00:00:25.500> a

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
onto the ground as so but if I get a

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.859 
onto the ground as so but if I get a
piece<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.980> paper<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.880> has<00:00:27.060> been<00:00:27.090> rolled<00:00:27.539> and

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
piece of paper that has been rolled and

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.260 
piece of paper that has been rolled and
taped<00:00:28.470> watch<00:00:29.429> what<00:00:29.609> will<00:00:29.699> happen<00:00:30.000> instead<00:00:31.130> as

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
taped watch what will happen instead as

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:43.319 
taped watch what will happen instead as
you<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.450> see<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:34.410> curves

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.990 

now<00:00:43.840> why<00:00:44.140> does<00:00:44.350> this<00:00:44.469> happen<00:00:44.680> we<00:00:45.489> can<00:00:45.670> explain

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
now why does this happen we can explain

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.270 
now why does this happen we can explain
this<00:00:46.180> evening<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.629> Magnus<00:00:47.140> force<00:00:47.440> the<00:00:48.010> same

this evening the Magnus force the same

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.900 
this evening the Magnus force the same
same<00:00:49.000> thing<00:00:49.030> that<00:00:49.450> curves<00:00:49.720> a<00:00:49.960> soccer<00:00:50.290> ball

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
same thing that curves a soccer ball

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.860 
same thing that curves a soccer ball
we'll<00:00:51.910> show<00:00:52.059> you<00:00:52.090> demonstration<00:00:52.270> of<00:00:52.780> the

we'll show you demonstration of the

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.860 
we'll show you demonstration of the
soccer<00:00:53.079> ball<00:00:53.350> third<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:55.210> we're<00:00:55.449> at<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:55.629> soccer

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
soccer ball third so we're at the soccer

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.420 
soccer ball third so we're at the soccer
field<00:00:55.989> here<00:00:56.379> and<00:00:56.559> we're<00:00:56.860> gonna<00:00:56.949> show<00:00:57.190> you<00:00:57.250> how

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
field here and we're gonna show you how

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.149 
field here and we're gonna show you how
to<00:00:57.489> curve<00:00:57.760> some<00:00:57.970> balls<00:00:58.589> now<00:00:59.589> what<00:00:59.800> the<00:00:59.920> trick

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
to curve some balls now what the trick

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:01.829 
to curve some balls now what the trick
is<00:01:00.190> to<00:01:00.610> curve<00:01:00.790> the<00:01:00.909> ball<00:01:01.089> good<00:01:01.540> you<00:01:01.659> have<00:01:01.750> to

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
is to curve the ball good you have to

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.499 
is to curve the ball good you have to
try<00:01:02.019> to<00:01:02.079> hit<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:02.500> ball<00:01:02.650> right<00:01:03.280> here<00:01:03.309> so<00:01:04.269> to<00:01:04.330> get

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
try to hit the ball right here so to get

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.840 
try to hit the ball right here so to get
generate<00:01:05.140> some<00:01:05.320> spin<00:01:05.650> on<00:01:05.680> that<00:01:06.400> way<00:01:06.610> as<00:01:06.820> it

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
generate some spin on that way as it

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.310 
generate some spin on that way as it
spins<00:01:07.210> there<00:01:07.479> we<00:01:07.540> go<00:01:07.750> towards<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.860> goal<00:01:10.320> now

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
spins there we go towards the goal now

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.570 
spins there we go towards the goal now
we<00:01:11.380> know<00:01:11.619> how<00:01:11.770> to<00:01:11.800> hit<00:01:12.009> the<00:01:12.190> ball

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
we know how to hit the ball

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:22.710 
we know how to hit the ball
let's<00:01:12.759> curve<00:01:13.090> it<00:01:21.060> okay<00:01:22.060> let's<00:01:22.300> get<00:01:22.450> down<00:01:22.690> to

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
let's curve it okay let's get down to

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.560 
let's curve it okay let's get down to
the<00:01:22.960> real<00:01:23.229> science<00:01:23.679> why<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:23.890> ball<00:01:24.250> curved<00:01:24.670> it

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
the real science why the ball curved it

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.010 
the real science why the ball curved it
was<00:01:25.810> found<00:01:26.050> by<00:01:26.350> Heinrich<00:01:27.100> Gustav<00:01:27.759> Magnus<00:01:28.390> why

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
was found by Heinrich Gustav Magnus why

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.889 
was found by Heinrich Gustav Magnus why
the<00:01:29.080> ball<00:01:29.500> curves<00:01:29.860> it<00:01:30.220> was<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:31.000> result<00:01:31.390> of<00:01:31.570> air

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
the ball curves it was the result of air

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.320 
the ball curves it was the result of air
resistance<00:01:32.470> against<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.460> ball<00:01:33.640> causing

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
resistance against the ball causing

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.779 
resistance against the ball causing
friction<00:01:34.600> as<00:01:35.140> you<00:01:35.800> can<00:01:35.950> see<00:01:36.160> in<00:01:36.340> this<00:01:36.520> diagram

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
friction as you can see in this diagram

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.499 
friction as you can see in this diagram
as<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.960> ball<00:01:38.170> is<00:01:38.380> moving<00:01:38.410> counterclockwise

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
as the ball is moving counterclockwise

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.540 
as the ball is moving counterclockwise
there<00:01:40.509> is<00:01:40.690> some<00:01:40.899> air<00:01:41.140> resistance<00:01:41.530> against<00:01:42.399> the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
there is some air resistance against the

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.660 
there is some air resistance against the
ball<00:01:42.869> indicated<00:01:43.869> with<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.200> small<00:01:44.590> blue<00:01:45.369> and
