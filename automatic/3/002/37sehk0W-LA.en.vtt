00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
this card they had to work for them I'm

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.509 
this card they had to work for them I'm
not<00:02:35.410> sure<00:02:35.590> about<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.890> try<00:02:36.070> that<00:02:36.220> went<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.430> the

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
not sure about the try that went to the

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:37.979 
not sure about the try that went to the
video<00:02:36.640> ref<00:02:36.910> I'll<00:02:37.030> have<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.180> look<00:02:37.299> at<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.600> it

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
video ref I'll have a look at that it

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.590 
video ref I'll have a look at that it
looked<00:02:38.260> like<00:02:38.440> his<00:02:38.769> elbow<00:02:39.459> touchdown<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.239> I

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
looked like his elbow touchdown and I

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.539 
looked like his elbow touchdown and I
think<00:02:41.140> that's<00:02:41.260> one<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.410> them<00:02:41.500> 50<00:02:41.830> 50<00:02:42.100> calls<00:02:42.310> but

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
think that's one of them 50 50 calls but

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.479 
think that's one of them 50 50 calls but
as<00:02:42.760> I've<00:02:43.239> been<00:02:43.269> saying<00:02:43.570> all<00:02:43.720> along<00:02:44.019> you

sometimes<00:02:45.489> you<00:02:45.580> get<00:02:45.670> lost<00:02:45.820> sometimes<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.330> do

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
sometimes you get lost sometimes you do

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.270

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
it you've got to take care of the things

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.620 
it you've got to take care of the things
that<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.489> can<00:02:48.670> control<00:02:49.030> which<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.360> thought<00:02:49.540> we
