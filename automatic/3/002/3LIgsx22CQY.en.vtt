do if you're getting a bit overwhelmed

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.359 
do if you're getting a bit overwhelmed
just<00:01:53.700> have<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> portal<00:01:54.329> set<00:01:54.570> up<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.219> the<00:01:56.219> other

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
just have a portal set up and the other

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.840 
just have a portal set up and the other
one<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:57.140> to<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> left<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.040> area<00:01:59.399> just

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
one just to the left of the area just

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.499 
one just to the left of the area just
outside<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.899> spawn<00:02:01.409> zone<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:02.759> mines

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
outside of the spawn zone so mines

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.539 
outside of the spawn zone so mines
probably<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.930> bit<00:02:04.110> close<00:02:04.409> still<00:02:04.799> but<00:02:05.100> basically

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
probably a bit close still but basically

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.180 
probably a bit close still but basically
all<00:02:06.509> I've<00:02:06.719> done<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:06.960> build<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.530> long<00:02:07.710> catwalk

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
all I've done is build a long catwalk

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.490 
all I've done is build a long catwalk
and<00:02:08.459> then<00:02:09.420> when<00:02:09.569> I've<00:02:09.690> healed<00:02:10.020> up<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.349> I'm

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
and then when I've healed up and I'm

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.080 
and then when I've healed up and I'm
ready<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.739> fight<00:02:11.039> again<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.430> can<00:02:11.610> walk<00:02:11.790> back

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
ready to fight again I can walk back

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.090 
ready to fight again I can walk back
into<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.540> zone

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
into the zone

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.420 
into the zone
and<00:02:13.360> start<00:02:14.360> fighting<00:02:14.660> again<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:15.380> this<00:02:16.250> is

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
and start fighting again and this is

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.550 
and start fighting again and this is
super<00:02:17.000> easy<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.360> set<00:02:17.720> up<00:02:17.780> this<00:02:18.050> took<00:02:18.200> me<00:02:18.320> about

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
super easy to set up this took me about

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.550 
super easy to set up this took me about
a<00:02:18.920> minute<00:02:19.430> or<00:02:19.730> two<00:02:19.910> because<00:02:20.690> all<00:02:21.080> it<00:02:21.260> is<00:02:21.380> is<00:02:21.530> a

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
a minute or two because all it is is a

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.040 
a minute or two because all it is is a
platform<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:22.400> yeah<00:02:22.970> all<00:02:23.540> I've<00:02:23.720> done<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:23.930> put

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
platform and yeah all I've done is put

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.020 
platform and yeah all I've done is put
some<00:02:24.380> blocks<00:02:24.650> high<00:02:24.890> enough<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.280> cast<00:02:25.460> a<00:02:25.700> portal

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
some blocks high enough to cast a portal

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.150 
some blocks high enough to cast a portal
on<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.450> that's<00:02:27.230> pretty<00:02:27.410> much<00:02:27.620> it

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
on and that's pretty much it

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.760 
on and that's pretty much it
another<00:02:29.000> thing<00:02:29.270> I'm<00:02:29.450> finding<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:30.140> portal<00:02:30.740> gun

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
another thing I'm finding the portal gun

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.280 
another thing I'm finding the portal gun
really<00:02:31.490> useful<00:02:31.940> for<00:02:32.210> is<00:02:32.420> when<00:02:32.630> you're<00:02:32.750> doing<00:02:32.870> a

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
really useful for is when you're doing a

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.710 
really useful for is when you're doing a
bit<00:02:33.710> of<00:02:33.830> Base<00:02:34.010> building<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:35.570> you're

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
bit of Base building and so you're

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.390 
bit of Base building and so you're
trying<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:35.990> move<00:02:36.200> some<00:02:36.560> stuff<00:02:36.590> from<00:02:36.950> one<00:02:37.190> area

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
trying to move some stuff from one area

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.340 
trying to move some stuff from one area
to<00:02:37.550> another<00:02:37.700> or<00:02:38.270> you're<00:02:38.450> just<00:02:38.480> trying<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:39.200> make

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
to another or you're just trying to make

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.080 
to another or you're just trying to make
sure<00:02:39.380> your<00:02:39.890> whole<00:02:40.040> base<00:02:40.220> looks<00:02:40.490> symmetrical

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
sure your whole base looks symmetrical

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.520 
sure your whole base looks symmetrical
and<00:02:41.240> things<00:02:41.360> like<00:02:41.480> that<00:02:41.660> what<00:02:42.290> I've<00:02:42.380> been

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
then quickly go back to the other area

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.560 
then quickly go back to the other area
and<00:03:03.860> just<00:03:04.010> start<00:03:04.280> working<00:03:04.430> on<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:04.910> it's

items across super quickly I've been
using<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.580> bit<00:03:14.030> for<00:03:14.270> base<00:03:14.420> defense<00:03:14.750> I<00:03:14.840> really

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
using a bit for base defense I really

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.380 
using a bit for base defense I really
like<00:03:15.440> it<00:03:15.620> for<00:03:15.800> that<00:03:15.920> defense<00:03:16.370> I<00:03:16.790> mean<00:03:17.030> building

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
like it for that defense I mean building

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.150 
like it for that defense I mean building
