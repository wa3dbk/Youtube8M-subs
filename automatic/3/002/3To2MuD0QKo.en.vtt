00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.020 
the farm dog race each other first and
it<00:05:33.080> could<00:05:33.200> teach<00:05:33.410> each<00:05:33.440> one<00:05:33.890> to<00:05:34.100> stay<00:05:34.370> and<00:05:34.790> then

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
it could teach each one to stay and then

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.370 
it could teach each one to stay and then
the<00:05:35.240> co<00:05:35.450> when<00:05:35.660> i<00:05:35.750> see<00:05:35.960> i<00:05:35.990> knew<00:05:36.170> where<00:05:36.290> i<00:05:36.320> could

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
the co when i see i knew where i could

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.890 
the co when i see i knew where i could
take<00:05:36.650> goal<00:05:36.890> but<00:05:37.790> maybe<00:05:38.030> the<00:05:38.210> hardest<00:05:38.450> thing<00:05:38.840> of

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
take goal but maybe the hardest thing of

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.510 
take goal but maybe the hardest thing of
the<00:05:38.990> whole<00:05:39.050> thing<00:05:39.200> will<00:05:39.650> i<00:05:39.950> have<00:05:40.340> to

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
the whole thing will i have to

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.180 
the whole thing will i have to
desensitize<00:05:41.030> zip<00:05:41.900> to<00:05:42.350> being<00:05:42.650> with<00:05:42.740> the<00:05:42.920> pig

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
desensitize zip to being with the pig

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.640 
desensitize zip to being with the pig
because<00:05:44.090> dogs<00:05:44.540> naturally<00:05:44.870> they<00:05:45.380> get<00:05:45.530> all

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
because dogs naturally they get all

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.190 
because dogs naturally they get all
hyped<00:05:45.950> up<00:05:46.160> in<00:05:46.370> the<00:05:46.430> presence<00:05:46.850> of<00:05:46.970> a<00:05:47.090> pig<00:05:47.980> tip<00:05:48.980> 3

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
hyped up in the presence of a pig tip 3

00:05:50.200 --> 00:06:32.940 
hyped up in the presence of a pig tip 3
you<00:05:51.200> could<00:05:51.470> do<00:05:51.740> it<00:05:51.920> though

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:57.400 

I<00:06:33.010> think

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:57.410 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:06.200 

go<00:07:03.950> probably<00:07:04.950> shouldn't<00:07:05.400> try<00:07:05.550> to<00:07:05.580> turn<00:07:05.850> it<00:07:05.910> to

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:06.210 
go probably shouldn't try to turn it to

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.760 
go probably shouldn't try to turn it to
good<00:07:06.450> because<00:07:06.660> I<00:07:06.780> really<00:07:07.020> don't<00:07:07.230> want<00:07:07.410> my<00:07:07.530> dog

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
good because I really don't want my dog

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.460 
good because I really don't want my dog
getting<00:07:08.070> people
