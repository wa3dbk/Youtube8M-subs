answer<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.500> we<00:00:25.680> need<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.920> look<00:00:26.100> at<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.640> few

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
answer this we need to look at a few

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.910 
answer this we need to look at a few
factors<00:00:27.540> a<00:00:29.330> like<00:00:30.330> how<00:00:30.779> strong<00:00:31.170> was<00:00:31.470> red<00:00:31.740> at<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
factors a like how strong was red at the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.670 
factors a like how strong was red at the
space<00:00:32.279> power<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.940> B<00:00:33.629> would<00:00:33.960> even<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.320> able<00:00:34.440> to

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
space power and B would even be able to

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.420 
space power and B would even be able to
turn<00:00:34.860> Super<00:00:35.220> Saiyan<00:00:36.140> now<00:00:37.140> for<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.190> sake<00:00:38.400> of

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
turn Super Saiyan now for the sake of

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.000 
turn Super Saiyan now for the sake of
simplicity<00:00:38.670> let's<00:00:39.180> say<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.870> Raddatz<00:00:40.290> turned

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
simplicity let's say that Raddatz turned

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.650 
simplicity let's say that Raddatz turned
to<00:00:41.220> a<00:00:41.250> Super<00:00:41.670> Saiyan<00:00:43.400> when<00:00:44.400> he<00:00:44.489> fought<00:00:44.790> pickle

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
to a Super Saiyan when he fought pickle

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.729 
to a Super Saiyan when he fought pickle
in<00:00:45.900> piccolo<00:00:47.840> but<00:00:48.840> let's<00:00:48.989> also<00:00:49.170> compare<00:00:49.410> this

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
in piccolo but let's also compare this

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.190 
in piccolo but let's also compare this
so<00:00:49.980> later<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.430> let's<00:00:50.820> say<00:00:51.000> when<00:00:51.239> after<00:00:51.720> Goku

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
so later on let's say when after Goku

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.060 
so later on let's say when after Goku
becomes<00:00:52.620> Super<00:00:52.980> Saiyan<00:00:53.780> now<00:00:54.780> Raddatz<00:00:55.770> turned

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
becomes Super Saiyan now Raddatz turned

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.280 
becomes Super Saiyan now Raddatz turned
into<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.280> Super<00:00:56.700> Saiyan<00:00:56.730> when<00:00:57.329> he<00:00:57.420> fought<00:00:57.660> go

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
into a Super Saiyan when he fought go

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.080 
into a Super Saiyan when he fought go
from<00:00:58.470> the<00:00:58.530> piccolo<00:00:58.980> there's<00:00:59.309> no<00:00:59.489> question<00:00:59.970> he

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
from the piccolo there's no question he

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.510 
from the piccolo there's no question he
would<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.329> annihilated<00:01:01.399> Goku<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.610> piccolo

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
would have annihilated Goku and piccolo

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.720 
would have annihilated Goku and piccolo
I<00:01:03.810> mean<00:01:04.950> starters<00:01:06.210> he<00:01:07.210> was<00:01:07.360> basically

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
I mean starters he was basically

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.180 
I mean starters he was basically
stronger<00:01:09.730> than<00:01:09.880> Goku<00:01:10.120> and<00:01:10.270> piccolo<00:01:10.360> combined

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
stronger than Goku and piccolo combined

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.130 
stronger than Goku and piccolo combined
and<00:01:12.190> he's<00:01:12.580> basically<00:01:13.030> strategy<00:01:13.750> nor<00:01:13.990> if<00:01:14.050> you

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
and he's basically strategy nor if you

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.530 
and he's basically strategy nor if you
can<00:01:14.290> feed<00:01:14.500> him<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.640> naturally<00:01:16.150> that<00:01:16.180> would

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
can feed him so naturally that would

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.210 
can feed him so naturally that would
make<00:01:16.720> Reds<00:01:17.190> even<00:01:18.190> stronger<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:19.510> probably<00:01:20.220> if

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
make Reds even stronger and probably if

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.850 
make Reds even stronger and probably if
not<00:01:21.490> resistant<00:01:22.000> that<00:01:22.060> at<00:01:22.210> least<00:01:22.650> would<00:01:23.650> be

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
not resistant that at least would be

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:31.290 
not resistant that at least would be
able<00:01:23.950> to<00:01:24.100> easily<00:01:26.880> go<00:01:27.880> off<00:01:28.180> in<00:01:28.360> his<00:01:28.390> back<00:01:30.300> not

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
able to easily go off in his back not

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.260 
able to easily go off in his back not
allowing<00:01:31.840> it<00:01:32.020> glowed<00:01:32.760> fired<00:01:33.760> especially

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
allowing it glowed fired especially

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.030 
allowing it glowed fired especially
being<00:01:34.390> an<00:01:34.660> atom<00:01:35.050> because<00:01:35.290> we<00:01:35.410> read<00:01:35.590> it<00:01:35.740> got

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
being an atom because we read it got

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.830 
being an atom because we read it got
dangerous<00:01:36.220> it<00:01:36.640> was<00:01:36.820> least<00:01:37.390> him<00:01:37.690> in<00:01:38.170> games<00:01:40.770> and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
dangerous it was least him in games and

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
dangerous it was least him in games and
let's<00:01:43.840> say<00:01:44.020> for<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:44.260> sake<00:01:44.440> of<00:01:44.500> argument

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
let's say for the sake of argument

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.310 
let's say for the sake of argument
Raddatz<00:01:45.369> were<00:01:45.550> to<00:01:45.700> come<00:01:46.450> back<00:01:46.479> like<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:46.990> lot<00:01:47.200> of

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
Raddatz were to come back like a lot of

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.430 
Raddatz were to come back like a lot of
fans<00:01:47.530> speculate<00:01:48.300> later<00:01:49.300> on<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.720> series<00:01:50.140> like

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
fans speculate later on the series like

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.460 
fans speculate later on the series like
I<00:01:50.680> don't<00:01:50.950> know<00:01:51.130> let's<00:01:51.340> say<00:01:51.550> the<00:01:51.990> early<00:01:52.990> Android

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
I don't know let's say the early Android

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.890 
I don't know let's say the early Android
saga<00:01:53.890> what's<00:01:54.100> thanks<00:01:54.490> and<00:01:54.760> he<00:01:55.600> would<00:01:55.780> have

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
saga what's thanks and he would have

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.840 
saga what's thanks and he would have
come<00:01:56.050> to<00:01:56.229> earth<00:01:56.440> and<00:01:56.770> he<00:01:56.979> were<00:01:57.160> super<00:01:57.580> saying

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
come to earth and he were super saying

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.950 
come to earth and he were super saying
how<00:01:58.510> strong<00:01:58.900> would<00:01:59.080> he<00:01:59.170> be<00:01:59.820> well<00:02:00.869> started<00:02:01.869> as

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
how strong would he be well started as

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.810 
how strong would he be well started as
he<00:02:02.110> wouldn't<00:02:02.440> have<00:02:02.530> been<00:02:02.800> able<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.130> train<00:02:03.490> the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
he wouldn't have been able to train the

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.290 
he wouldn't have been able to train the
alkaloid<00:02:04.300> because<00:02:04.600> he<00:02:04.690> didn't<00:02:04.900> have<00:02:05.020> a<00:02:05.050> body

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
alkaloid because he didn't have a body

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.969 
alkaloid because he didn't have a body
slide<00:02:07.300> for<00:02:07.450> example<00:02:07.479> Vegeta<00:02:08.200> didn't<00:02:08.710> train

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
slide for example Vegeta didn't train

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.620 
slide for example Vegeta didn't train
when<00:02:09.160> he<00:02:09.280> was<00:02:09.429> dead<00:02:09.670> he<00:02:09.940> basically<00:02:12.480> are<00:02:13.480> you

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
when he was dead he basically are you

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.650 
when he was dead he basically are you
basically

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.300 

with<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.230> strong<00:02:17.650> before<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:18.930> mean<00:02:19.930> I'd<00:02:20.920> say<00:02:21.160> the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
with a strong before I mean I'd say the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.880 
with a strong before I mean I'd say the
skills<00:02:21.670> got<00:02:21.820> rusty<00:02:22.330> but<00:02:22.600> whatever<00:02:23.820> anyway

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
skills got rusty but whatever anyway

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.770 
skills got rusty but whatever anyway
without<00:02:26.890> any<00:02:27.430> training<00:02:27.910> rats<00:02:28.240> would<00:02:28.450> simply

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
without any training rats would simply

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.440 
without any training rats would simply
be<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:28.960> same<00:02:29.200> strength<00:02:29.650> now<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.700> understand

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
be the same strength now to understand

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.150 
be the same strength now to understand
this<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.780> have<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:32.020> understand<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.590> rat<00:02:32.980> is

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
this you have to understand that rat is

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.680 
this you have to understand that rat is
basically<00:02:34.000> only<00:02:36.510> 1,100<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.600> believe<00:02:39.690> power

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
basically only 1,100 I believe power

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.900 
basically only 1,100 I believe power
level<00:02:41.550> that's<00:02:42.550> pretty<00:02:43.120> low<00:02:43.480> think<00:02:44.050> about<00:02:44.350> it

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
level that's pretty low think about it

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.550 
level that's pretty low think about it
by<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:45.940> time<00:02:46.150> of<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.480> Android<00:02:46.900> saw<00:02:47.110> even

Rad's<00:04:13.959> will<00:04:14.200> be<00:04:14.290> so<00:04:14.500> weak<00:04:14.739> that<00:04:15.010> any<00:04:15.430> of<00:04:16.269> them

Rad's will be so weak that any of them
to<00:04:16.539> probably<00:04:16.870> handled<00:04:17.639> Raddatz

least<00:04:21.669> Goku<00:04:22.090> and<00:04:22.240> Vegeta<00:04:22.690> should<00:04:23.759> come<00:04:24.759> think

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
least Goku and Vegeta should come think

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.460

so<00:04:31.120> all<00:04:31.389> honestly<00:04:31.870> really<00:04:32.500> wouldn't<00:04:32.770> be<00:04:32.830> that

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
could possibly work is if Raddatz were

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.270 
could possibly work is if Raddatz were

addition to this we also have to look at

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.690 
addition to this we also have to look at
whether<00:05:14.660> or<00:05:14.870> not<00:05:14.990> Radisson<00:05:15.710> even<00:05:16.010> transformed

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
whether or not Radisson even transformed

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.150 
whether or not Radisson even transformed
into<00:05:16.940> a<00:05:17.150> Super<00:05:17.450> Saiyan<00:05:17.480> I<00:05:18.020> think<00:05:18.800> the<00:05:18.920> answer

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
into a Super Saiyan I think the answer

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.280 
into a Super Saiyan I think the answer
is<00:05:19.220> probably<00:05:19.460> no<00:05:19.910> now<00:05:20.660> I<00:05:20.690> don't<00:05:21.050> think<00:05:21.200> it's

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
is probably no now I don't think it's

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.020 
is probably no now I don't think it's
been<00:05:21.410> stated<00:05:21.860> that<00:05:21.950> you<00:05:22.100> need<00:05:22.250> a<00:05:22.310> base<00:05:22.580> power

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
been stated that you need a base power

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.340 
been stated that you need a base power
level<00:05:23.390> in<00:05:23.450> order<00:05:23.660> to<00:05:23.720> become<00:05:23.810> a<00:05:23.990> Super<00:05:24.320> Saiyan

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
level in order to become a Super Saiyan

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:31.240 
level in order to become a Super Saiyan
just<00:05:24.950> that<00:05:25.570> you<00:05:26.570> need<00:05:29.440> there's<00:05:30.440> basically

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
just that you need there's basically

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.580 
just that you need there's basically
like<00:05:31.520> special<00:05:32.210> circumstances<00:05:32.990> but<00:05:33.260> I<00:05:33.290> don't

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
like special circumstances but I don't

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.830 
like special circumstances but I don't
think<00:05:34.070> that<00:05:34.310> they're<00:05:34.430> necessarily

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
think that they're necessarily

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.060 
think that they're necessarily
associated<00:05:35.840> with<00:05:36.050> power<00:05:36.770> level<00:05:37.750> although<00:05:39.070> it

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
associated with power level although it

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.950 
associated with power level although it
is<00:05:40.460> possible<00:05:40.670> there<00:05:41.030> could<00:05:41.180> be<00:05:41.210> a<00:05:41.300> base<00:05:41.600> power

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
is possible there could be a base power

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.830 
is possible there could be a base power
level<00:05:42.670> know<00:05:43.670> what<00:05:43.850> let's<00:05:44.090> say<00:05:44.270> for<00:05:44.630> sake<00:05:44.780> of

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
level know what let's say for sake of

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.360 
level know what let's say for sake of
simplicity<00:05:45.020> there<00:05:45.620> is<00:05:45.740> some<00:05:45.920> sort<00:05:46.130> of<00:05:46.160> base

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
simplicity there is some sort of base

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.420 
simplicity there is some sort of base
power<00:05:47.470> even<00:05:48.470> if<00:05:48.590> Raddatz<00:05:49.040> had<00:05:49.160> the<00:05:49.280> right

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
power even if Raddatz had the right

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.770 
power even if Raddatz had the right
motivation<00:05:49.550> I<00:05:50.090> doubt<00:05:50.300> he<00:05:50.420> could<00:05:50.540> even

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
motivation I doubt he could even

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.990 
motivation I doubt he could even
transform<00:05:51.290> into<00:05:51.500> a<00:05:51.650> Super<00:05:52.040> Saiyan<00:05:52.100> unless<00:05:52.790> see

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
transform into a Super Saiyan unless see

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.690 
transform into a Super Saiyan unless see
where<00:05:53.240> to<00:05:53.360> get<00:05:53.480> stronger<00:05:53.900> I<00:05:54.550> would<00:05:55.550> say<00:05:55.670> a

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
where to get stronger I would say a

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.550 
where to get stronger I would say a
power<00:05:55.970> level<00:05:56.180> should<00:05:56.510> have<00:05:56.870> to<00:05:57.080> be<00:05:57.200> at<00:05:57.320> least

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
power level should have to be at least

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.940 
power level should have to be at least
maybe<00:05:58.040> 10,000<00:05:58.850> or<00:05:58.910> so<00:05:59.120> in<00:05:59.300> order<00:05:59.450> to<00:05:59.920> become<00:06:00.920> a

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
maybe 10,000 or so in order to become a

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.150 
maybe 10,000 or so in order to become a
Super<00:06:01.310> Saiyan<00:06:01.340> and<00:06:02.440> that's<00:06:03.440> saying<00:06:03.980> that

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
Super Saiyan and that's saying that

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.290 
Super Saiyan and that's saying that
because<00:06:06.370> Bartok<00:06:07.370> was<00:06:07.550> able<00:06:07.820> to<00:06:07.850> turn<00:06:08.060> into<00:06:08.210> a

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
because Bartok was able to turn into a

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.270 
because Bartok was able to turn into a
Super<00:06:08.660> Saiyan<00:06:08.690> although<00:06:09.410> a<00:06:09.710> lot<00:06:09.950> of<00:06:10.040> people

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 
Super Saiyan although a lot of people

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.960 
Super Saiyan although a lot of people
say<00:06:10.460> that<00:06:10.640> once<00:06:10.820> the<00:06:10.910> can<00:06:11.180> input<00:06:11.770> nonetheless

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
say that once the can input nonetheless

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.400 
say that once the can input nonetheless
they<00:06:13.970> still<00:06:14.000> had<00:06:14.390> Bartok<00:06:14.750> transforming<00:06:15.290> to<00:06:15.380> a

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
they still had Bartok transforming to a

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.380 
they still had Bartok transforming to a
Super<00:06:15.800> Saiyan<00:06:15.830> and<00:06:16.400> his<00:06:16.670> power<00:06:16.910> level<00:06:17.240> isn't

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
Super Saiyan and his power level isn't

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.910 
Super Saiyan and his power level isn't
that<00:06:17.690> high<00:06:17.930> compared<00:06:18.380> to<00:06:18.440> the<00:06:18.530> others

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:18.920 
that high compared to the others

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.960 
that high compared to the others
transfer<00:06:19.460> not<00:06:20.180> even<00:06:20.480> Goten<00:06:20.840> and<00:06:20.870> Trunks<00:06:21.850> so<00:06:22.850> at

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:22.970 
transfer not even Goten and Trunks so at

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.890 
transfer not even Goten and Trunks so at
that<00:06:23.090> point<00:06:23.420> I<00:06:24.160> would<00:06:25.160> say<00:06:25.490> around<00:06:25.900> 10,000

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
that point I would say around 10,000

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.450 
that point I would say around 10,000
perhaps<00:06:27.230> maybe<00:06:27.620> a<00:06:27.740> little<00:06:27.920> bit<00:06:28.100> more<00:06:28.280> than

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
perhaps maybe a little bit more than

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.330 
perhaps maybe a little bit more than
that<00:06:28.580> it's<00:06:28.820> the<00:06:28.910> base<00:06:29.590> for<00:06:30.590> one<00:06:30.800> to<00:06:30.950> be<00:06:31.100> able<00:06:31.160> to

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
that it's the base for one to be able to

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.790 
that it's the base for one to be able to
turn<00:06:31.490> to<00:06:31.700> a<00:06:31.730> super<00:06:32.090> team<00:06:32.270> possibly<00:06:32.900> molded

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
turn to a super team possibly molded

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.560 
turn to a super team possibly molded
depending<00:06:34.130> on<00:06:34.190> how<00:06:34.280> high<00:06:34.580> bartók's<00:06:35.270> power

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:35.570

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.940 
depending on how high bartók's power
level<00:06:35.930> was<00:06:36.140> in<00:06:37.040> episode<00:06:37.820> of<00:06:38.210> Bardock<00:06:38.950> so

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.950 
level was in episode of Bardock so

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.260 
level was in episode of Bardock so
