00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.870
 Stupid people still have the aspirant who will complete a new mike nahar as a baby 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.450
 in the background watching TV were 2 and much less known you can immediately 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.420
 after the start pay attention 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.249
 i hear i have a bit of ex looking down on the floor 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.550
 we are just going to see what we have from our own market 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.130
 The problem was that I had this person with his tenderness in his hands 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.800
 a few more 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.119
 both I unfortunately could not view more knowledge this lag is near 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.099
 is there test driver testing day that I go to the tour and actors and for that it 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.460
 team a quick tackle tim unpacks luckily neither can I pick him up 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.910
 ball 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.120
 I have experienced that I am not before, because something is naturally ruined 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.610
 and I would be proud if we as consumers and gardens now have a chance to win 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.190
 the fairgrounds for half an hour 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.840
 and yet a bit of cable that was time to pay and that is something to tell 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.760
 of course 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.080
 the latter did of course have brought a lot for Calvin 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.159
 again what things are going better things fixed and fixed 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.569
 I am happy with it I have some fun in the game and persone 

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:58.519
 the game was once 8 very many actions visible virtue car very much 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:00:59.950
 quickly with you about a band 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.360
 robson is of course the last added time something to let people naturally 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.270
 code came from the fact that I was gone 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.920
 and I like the idea of ​​what to play but there are some things aditi 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.410
 los angeles the about thing to choose from the first 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.790
 there is a lot of action of course just a plus because kallen vidosic all 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.610
 Criticism is that it is not always very much activity that everyone can do 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.890
 drost son 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.000
 everyone is running a lot of action 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.100
 thereby getting packs of belongings in knightly church 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.409
 two thing the school system first on the one hand looks a bit exciting 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:30.820
 because the five construction pit 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.299
 crush all other side 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.130
 if you don't expect them to clean up next to the bede 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.729
 dead and you can start again mixed mixed rail system 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.780
 then again for working on another work 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.060
 but of course I am keen to collect a nice sweden new demo 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.710
 to make 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.600
 what should have been done is the dumbest residay you should go on the zone 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.920
 lie every neighborhood comes of course the new sons so you get points 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.750
 to win for the team and I have packs for it 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.090
 what they should have done 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.280
 is she had to change the cap in a separate project 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.610
 and then just 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.520
 that if you are so light on the mess that you get points for your team you don't make it 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.460
 the church get peeters because what you get now is you come to us and parties 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.140
 i'm just going for a church pec they own per online percent odink 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.489
 say 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.370
 the first thing that doesn't matter that the referee then you can't do anything yourself 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.920
 do more if they don't go to church i'm a person 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.600
 i played on will for the guys 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.230
 it doesn't matter if i win but yes that loss i don't care if the church 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.010
 when it might be somewhere in the folder I had already picked it up again 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.739
 I make quite kills, see this action game play 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.319
 and what many people have estimated it to be such a big one and the big one again 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.490
 get church ps but i thought i was just so annoying that something stupid 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.449
 berlin alleys you get yes 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:44.389
 one of the two stitches involved otherwise says what people just ignite 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:45.189
 yummy 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.279
 opdorp sometime or on the drop will get due to reversal price who could bed that 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:51.269
 there maybe still i hope so 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.860
 that she will change the top so that she made a variation 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.389
 that you get twente when the bedrocks are so light but no longer make church packs 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.969
 in addition to that saying he just adds a fun game to play 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:06.129
 really a totally new experience where does that chose what I now 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.779
 played 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:08.530
 i played good food i got there 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.000
 The day before yesterday three karzai was withdrawn in in 45 minutes or would it be very bad 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.869
 fast but i'm played 3 knows his tie 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:19.389
 yes i work i think it is really brilliant in the mood to play and i just think so 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.609
 nice to have and it is copco player bus for two and a half minutes, he knows it is there again 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.520
 on I also had an acquaintance with them 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.250
 from the one and only church texaan start of the game pre the region and say goodbye 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.390
 on man quite such a completely changed course 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.190
 and some also a doctor's 80 suitcases 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.960
 a lot of people were in some strange way with dundee folds of van 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.010
 search engines and I do not know if it is up to the players that mess 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.440
 of playing but it is just super evening get a whole team against that 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.550
 only one month of bicycle use is allowed but it will be a new fad 11 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.030
 summer 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.499
 yes that is of course really annoying when you make it against 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.810
 yes if you do not have a profile yet play test is for yourself 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.329
 my tactic is said very simply 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:03:59.409
 above all, stay yourself 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.260
 because on such a he goes everyone can grab the most lager but pay attention 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.449
 on the alley track people can just be tense and it is not going 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.379
 try to go only for church texts what if you are only for the 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.989
 church pec sheep damn then the five of course no more kills with you 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.769
 weapon and I know that myself on the Wii 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:17.620
 and 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.299
 yes i'm just very nice work comes to play that's what it comes down to 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.949
 We almost won your game what I thought about Katwijk and 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:23.700
 fruit bowl 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.780
 I think the all is fine I try my team is just to exercise on 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.400
 make the dow like that and then under German who die one after the other 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.040
 That always happens when you start thinking that the leak stuck, you die 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.210
 that the car is dead 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.599
 so you that I at the entrance to the Mennonite I am in the potty 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.370
 and is ready 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.560
 ball at the pot with a final score of 65 to 9 the code is there 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.400
 paid even though almost one knows I will only open was dead 17 8 is that 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.300
 head in between 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.169
 quite a bit of shame of course as one of the three games released in 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:51.990
 make a game 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.870
 I don't care, I hope a big of both times could have been afterwards 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.440
 enters 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.510
 I am a broker with the band about the dropzone but of course I was away 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.800
 was a weekend getaway to sea aunts and fire watching 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.710
 and not to appear and to the mercy of more people
