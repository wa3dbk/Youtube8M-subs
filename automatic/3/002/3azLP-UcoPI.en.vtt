00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
they were $16 I think and then there

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.720 
they were $16 I think and then there
were<00:02:29.810> ten<00:02:30.140> with<00:02:30.500> these<00:02:30.740> for<00:02:31.040> yourself<00:02:31.400> so

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
were ten with these for yourself so

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.850 
were ten with these for yourself so
