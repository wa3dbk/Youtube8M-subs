00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:11.469
 small video answer to the question well I 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:15.009
 just the person who asked the question I 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:17.380
 he gave a link to the video to see but 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:21.460
 so I decided to still further and to make a video about 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.090
 The video gave a link to the review of the barbecue 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.390
 by hands 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:29.740
 I think so called or brazier 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.510
 do it yourself for what's in 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.570
 than salt man asks here he is 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:39.429
 made two goats 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.440
 on the tennis table with metal and legs 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:44.579
 make sure they don't fall through 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.829
 I'm just always my favorite thing 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.739
 modeled but I had under 45 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.879
 degrees and therefore and so he has of course 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:59.469
 this url is less but the principle is the same sulcem 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.960
 Here I have such brass otters and this 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:08.860
 let 's say yes after here you take this 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:10.509
 heat four here brew you eat 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.009
 you cut holes in Ryazan 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:20.409
 and here so fasten this wipe 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:23.259
 This is the first option 2 of the sea 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:28.360
 metal and a half points just dress up 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:31.719
 cut it into certain parts here 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:38.289
 so this is that part of you maybe like this 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:41.380
 cut and get and then just like that 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.159
 weld and all but on one side 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.549
 only 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:53.420
 so here you are of course cut off and so 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:57.380
 but one more me that I wanted 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.770
 sometime too do homemade myself 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.810
 tennis table well, so it did not work out and 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:10.849
 here's how goats are good yes yes but I 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:15.620
 creates his own design show dare 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:18.980
 do it because the wife wants to 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.890
 tennis ah play amateur so 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.510
 I will develop it and then 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:30.349
 let's demonstrate well for now 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:33.829
 make goat legs so they don't 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.840
 fell into the ground cut down the channel 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.879
 useful tips adaptations to give 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.379
 and at home 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.379
