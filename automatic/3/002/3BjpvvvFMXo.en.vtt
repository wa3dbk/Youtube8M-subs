playing an HD if you don't have an HDTV

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.910 
playing an HD if you don't have an HDTV
which<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.689> think<00:01:51.930> some<00:01:52.439> people<00:01:52.710> would<00:01:52.770> just

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
which I think some people would just

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.969 
which I think some people would just
aren't<00:01:53.220> paying<00:01:53.520> attention<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.979> this

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
aren't paying attention to and this

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.690 
aren't paying attention to and this
little<00:01:56.189> coupler<00:01:56.850> dude<00:01:57.030> right<00:01:57.210> here<00:01:58.460> it's<00:01:59.460> like

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
little coupler dude right here it's like

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.219 
little coupler dude right here it's like
three<00:02:00.360> or<00:02:00.479> four<00:02:00.509> bucks<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.170> think<00:02:01.530> anyway<00:02:03.229> so

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
three or four bucks I think anyway so

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.300 
three or four bucks I think anyway so
