00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.300 
out so you bounce back over to the
coping<00:01:33.780> once<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.710> you're<00:01:35.040> pretty

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
coping once you do that you're pretty

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.460 
coping once you do that you're pretty
much<00:01:35.369> rolling<00:01:35.759> away<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.990> said<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.380> a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
much rolling away like I said it's a

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.469 
much rolling away like I said it's a
trick<00:01:37.680> that's<00:01:37.829> easy<00:01:38.100> enough<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.329> can

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
trick that's easy enough that you can

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.179 
trick that's easy enough that you can
you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.200> million<00:01:40.409> times<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.979> just

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
you can do it a million times and just

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.039 
you can do it a million times and just
keep<00:01:41.640> chickening<00:01:42.090> out<00:01:42.119> just<00:01:42.600> put<00:01:42.780> your<00:01:42.869> foot

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
keep chickening out just put your foot

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.020 
keep chickening out just put your foot
in<00:01:43.200> let<00:01:43.740> your<00:01:43.829> back-end<00:01:44.040> drop<00:01:44.430> down<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.880> put

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
in let your back-end drop down and put

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.060 
in let your back-end drop down and put
your<00:01:45.060> foot<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.450> take<00:01:45.689> your<00:01:45.869> foot<00:01:46.020> out<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.560> get

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
your foot in take your foot out and get

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.039 
your foot in take your foot out and get
get<00:01:47.369> too<00:01:47.549> steep<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.090> just<00:01:48.360> like<00:01:48.540> run<00:01:48.780> across

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
get too steep and just like run across

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.530 
get too steep and just like run across
the<00:01:49.200> deck<00:01:49.549> it's<00:01:50.549> more<00:01:50.790> about<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.060> speed<00:01:51.329> if

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
the deck it's more about the speed if

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.899 
the deck it's more about the speed if
you<00:01:51.689> go<00:01:51.840> slow<00:01:52.170> enough<00:01:52.200> you'll<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.399> pop<00:01:53.729> in

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
you go slow enough you'll just pop in

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.670 
you go slow enough you'll just pop in
there<00:01:54.030> perfect<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.659> know<00:01:55.170> you're<00:01:55.350> right<00:01:55.470> near

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
there perfect you know you're right near

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.010 
there perfect you know you're right near
the<00:01:55.770> coping<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.420> hop<00:01:57.570> back<00:01:57.630> in

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the coping and you can just hop back in

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.530 
the coping and you can just hop back in
if<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.619> go<00:01:58.770> too<00:01:58.829> fast<00:01:59.280> you'll<00:01:59.909> just<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.180> out<00:02:00.299> to

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
if you go too fast you'll just be out to

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.020 
if you go too fast you'll just be out to
five<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.170> won't<00:02:01.350> ever<00:02:01.560> get<00:02:01.829> back<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.219> or<00:02:02.759> drop

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
five you won't ever get back in or drop

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
five you won't ever get back in or drop
to<00:02:03.180> disaster<00:02:03.719> or<00:02:03.869> something

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
to disaster or something

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.960 
to disaster or something
I<00:02:05.110> think<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.620> hardest<00:02:05.890> part<00:02:05.980> is<00:02:06.220> just<00:02:06.280> finding

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
I think the hardest part is just finding

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.359 
I think the hardest part is just finding
that<00:02:07.090> speed<00:02:07.480> and<00:02:07.750> and<00:02:07.990> whatnot<00:02:08.800> once<00:02:09.100> you<00:02:09.220> do

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
that speed and and whatnot once you do

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:17.940 
that speed and and whatnot once you do
that<00:02:09.400> it's<00:02:10.090> game<00:02:10.960> it's<00:02:11.380> so<00:02:11.500> much<00:02:11.800> fun<00:02:16.890> as<00:02:17.890> you

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
that it's game it's so much fun as you

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.620 
that it's game it's so much fun as you
saw<00:02:18.310> just<00:02:18.550> then<00:02:18.760> that's<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.090> worst<00:02:19.330> thing<00:02:19.420> to

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
saw just then that's the worst thing to

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.960 
saw just then that's the worst thing to
do<00:02:19.780> in<00:02:20.050> foot<00:02:20.350> jams<00:02:20.620> when<00:02:21.130> you<00:02:21.250> put<00:02:21.430> um<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:21.790> want

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
do in foot jams when you put um you want

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.030 
do in foot jams when you put um you want
to<00:02:22.030> quit<00:02:22.840> your<00:02:22.960> foot<00:02:23.170> in<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.470> pull<00:02:23.800> it<00:02:23.920> out

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
to quit your foot in and pull it out

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.040 
to quit your foot in and pull it out
like<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.460> same<00:02:24.700> way<00:02:24.910> it's<00:02:25.660> not<00:02:25.810> like<00:02:26.020> that

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
like the same way it's not like that

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.760 
like the same way it's not like that
foot<00:02:26.860> jam<00:02:27.210> push<00:02:28.210> your<00:02:28.330> foot<00:02:28.510> in<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:28.900> roll<00:02:29.560> it

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
foot jam push your foot in and roll it

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.740 
foot jam push your foot in and roll it
back<00:02:29.920> like<00:02:30.490> getting<00:02:30.940> lazy<00:02:31.180> on<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.480> trick

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
back like getting lazy on the trick

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.840 
back like getting lazy on the trick
really<00:02:32.080> because<00:02:32.290> then<00:02:32.470> all<00:02:32.770> that<00:02:33.400> does<00:02:33.610> is

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
really because then all that does is

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.000 
really because then all that does is
pull<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.540> steeper<00:02:34.990> and<00:02:35.170> you'll<00:02:35.500> flip<00:02:35.710> straight

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
pull it steeper and you'll flip straight

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.850 
pull it steeper and you'll flip straight
over<00:02:36.250> like<00:02:36.640> that
