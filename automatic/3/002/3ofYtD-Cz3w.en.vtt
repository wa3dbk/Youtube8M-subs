electronics and it's going to be a
sequence<00:02:19.770> of<00:02:19.920> different<00:02:20.730> switches<00:02:21.060> like<00:02:21.240> for

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
sequence of different switches like for

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.090 
sequence of different switches like for
example<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:23.340> may<00:02:23.520> have<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:24.440> in<00:02:25.440> order<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.710> open

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
example you may have to in order to open

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.190 
example you may have to in order to open
the<00:02:26.190> box<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.700> may<00:02:26.850> have<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.240> for<00:02:28.140> example

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
the box you may have to for example

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.080 
the box you may have to for example
press<00:02:28.620> on<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.860> brake<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.370> then<00:02:29.490> hit<00:02:30.000> the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
press on a brake and then hit the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.550 
press on a brake and then hit the
defrost<00:02:30.480> or<00:02:30.750> something<00:02:31.020> like<00:02:31.110> that

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
defrost or something like that

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.360 
defrost or something like that
whatever<00:02:32.370> sequence<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.680> makes<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.860> almost

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
whatever sequence it is makes it almost

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.310 
whatever sequence it is makes it almost
impossible<00:02:35.670> for<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.300> thief<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.590> access<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.800> so

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
impossible for a thief to access it so

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.190 
impossible for a thief to access it so
with<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:42.030> need<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.270> make<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.540> call<00:02:42.690> it's

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
with that you need to make the call it's

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.180 
with that you need to make the call it's
just<00:02:43.470> that<00:02:43.650> simple

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
just that simple
