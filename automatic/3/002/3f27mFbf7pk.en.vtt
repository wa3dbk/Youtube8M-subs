 the foot are rehearsing the students of the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.080
 academia your next presentations by 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.440
 there of course we see ourselves with brands 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.950
 before you thought I saw that kevin 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.170
 Kevin 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.770
 you do not want to be anyone's copy 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.770
 true 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.090
 and you looked too much like a brand and that 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.610
 I do not like it because you have 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.720
 own personality and that can not 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:43.020
 happen this song is very good 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.730
 song you have worn is very good you 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.940
 performance because you have not tuned 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.790
 practically nothing but be yourself not 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.520
 let yourself be carried away by the character of ansÃ³n 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.690
 and you have to be you okay that's my 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.989
 advice 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.520
 we go with the qualification we started with 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:06.160
 July 9 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:10.630
 on Tuesday, the 7th of marta cruz has the vote 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:15.340
 hidden and already go tells us that he has a 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:18.960
 option 24 points so that gives us a 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.960
 total of 24 points
