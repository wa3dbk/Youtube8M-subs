in<00:00:00.480> this<00:00:00.690> problem<00:00:00.989> we<00:00:01.140> have<00:00:01.260> a<00:00:01.319> cube<00:00:01.530> of

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
in this problem we have a cube of

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.860 
in this problem we have a cube of
gelatin<00:00:02.159> that<00:00:02.790> we're<00:00:03.000> pushing<00:00:03.240> with<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.540> force

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
gelatin that we're pushing with a force

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.860

seven<00:00:20.880> centimeters<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.619> when<00:00:22.800> we<00:00:22.890> push<00:00:23.100> it

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
seven centimeters so when we push it

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.750 
seven centimeters so when we push it
tilts<00:00:24.300> over<00:00:24.680> say<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.070> kind<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.460> final

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
tilts over say this is kind of the final

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:39.350 
tilts over say this is kind of the final
arrangement<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:34.370> right<00:00:35.370> here<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:38.360> Delta

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
to find the force F to cause this now we

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:57.770 
to find the force F to cause this now we
use<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.390> formula<00:00:49.879> F<00:00:50.879> over<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:53.449> equals<00:00:54.890> s<00:00:56.780> Delta

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
use the formula F over a equals s Delta

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.750 
use the formula F over a equals s Delta
x<00:00:58.140> over<00:00:59.329> L<00:01:00.980> okay<00:01:02.480> this<00:01:03.480> L<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.750> our<00:01:04.019> length<00:01:04.760> 6.2

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
x over L okay this L is our length 6.2

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.270 
x over L okay this L is our length 6.2
centimeters<00:01:06.380> Delta<00:01:07.380> X<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.770> mouth<00:01:08.040> it's

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
centimeters Delta X is the mouth it's

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.130 
centimeters Delta X is the mouth it's
pushed<00:01:08.549> over<00:01:08.700> which<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.570> 0<00:01:09.720> point<00:01:09.930> four<00:01:10.110> seven

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140

seven<00:01:10.710> years<00:01:10.920> s<00:01:11.990> 1105<00:01:12.990> scales<00:01:13.320> F<00:01:14.130> what<00:01:14.430> we're

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
seven years s 1105 scales F what we're

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.350 
seven years s 1105 scales F what we're
looking<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.590> big<00:01:16.590> area<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.340> side<00:01:17.610> that

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
looking for a big area of the side that

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.130 
looking for a big area of the side that
we're<00:01:18.509> pushing<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:19.700> so<00:01:20.700> all<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.049> is

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
we're pushing on so all we have to do is

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.380 
we're pushing on so all we have to do is
figure<00:01:22.320> out<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> area<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> side<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:24.060> cube

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
figure out the area of the side the cube

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.270 
figure out the area of the side the cube
so<00:01:24.659> it's<00:01:24.780> pretty<00:01:24.930> easy<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.530> length

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
so it's pretty easy it's just length

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.920 
so it's pretty easy it's just length
times<00:01:26.580> length<00:01:26.909> length<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.540> same<00:01:27.750> is

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
times length length it's the same is

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.179 
times length length it's the same is
going<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.140> be<00:01:28.200> six<00:01:28.380> point<00:01:28.619> two<00:01:28.680> centimeters

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
going to be six point two centimeters

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.920 
going to be six point two centimeters
squared<00:01:29.460> okay<00:01:31.009> so<00:01:32.009> we'll<00:01:32.850> put<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.450> let's<00:01:33.689> solve

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
squared okay so we'll put in let's solve

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.710 
squared okay so we'll put in let's solve
for<00:01:34.229> our<00:01:34.409> F<00:01:34.710> which<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.340> what<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.549> want<00:01:35.729> F<00:01:35.939> equals

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
for our F which is what we want F equals

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.639 
for our F which is what we want F equals
x<00:01:37.369> delta<00:01:38.369> x<00:01:38.850> EI<00:01:39.710> over<00:01:40.710> l<00:01:41.960> okay<00:01:42.960> let's<00:01:43.259> plug<00:01:43.500> in

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
x delta x EI over l okay let's plug in

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.179 
x delta x EI over l okay let's plug in
our<00:01:43.710> knowns<00:01:44.899> actually<00:01:45.899> that's<00:01:46.049> something<00:01:46.320> for

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
our knowns actually that's something for

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.380 
our knowns actually that's something for
a<00:01:47.220> first<00:01:47.790> Delta<00:01:48.659> X<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:50.159> going<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.729> L<00:01:51.030> times

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
a first Delta X a is going to be L times

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.850 
a first Delta X a is going to be L times
L<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.200> l<00:01:52.530> squared<00:01:53.369> over<00:01:54.329> L<00:01:54.810> one<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.500> those<00:01:55.590> else

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
L so l squared over L one of those else

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.270 
L so l squared over L one of those else
cancels<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.850> we're<00:01:57.000> left<00:01:57.149> with<00:01:57.420> s<00:01:58.610> Delta<00:01:59.610> X<00:02:00.030> now

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
cancels so we're left with s Delta X now

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.319 
cancels so we're left with s Delta X now
one<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.310> these<00:02:02.460> sales<00:02:02.640> councils<00:02:03.149> with<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
one of these sales councils with the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:12.870 
one of these sales councils with the
square<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:05.420> s<00:02:07.099> 1100<00:02:08.099> Pascal's

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.820 

Delta<00:02:13.880> X<00:02:14.090> is<00:02:15.250> 147<00:02:16.250> centimeters<00:02:17.350> so<00:02:18.350> let's

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
Delta X is 147 centimeters so let's

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.320 
Delta X is 147 centimeters so let's
write<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.070> in<00:02:19.610> meters<00:02:20.000> which<00:02:20.720> is<00:02:23.740> 0.00<00:02:25.330> 47

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
write that in meters which is 0.00 47

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.700 
write that in meters which is 0.00 47
meters<00:02:28.090> move<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.210> decimal<00:02:29.390> place<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:29.960> over<00:02:30.290> to

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
meters move the decimal place to over to

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.970 
meters move the decimal place to over to
get<00:02:30.830> 2<00:02:30.980> meters<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.690> our<00:02:32.690> length<00:02:32.990> is<00:02:33.200> 6<00:02:33.590> 12

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
get 2 meters and our length is 6 12

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.010 
get 2 meters and our length is 6 12
centimeters<00:02:34.550> again<00:02:35.180> write<00:02:35.390> that<00:02:35.570> in<00:02:35.690> meters

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
centimeters again write that in meters

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:47.890 
centimeters again write that in meters
so<00:02:36.860> we<00:02:36.980> get<00:02:40.900> 0.06<00:02:41.900> two<00:02:42.820> meters<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:47.540> we<00:02:47.630> plug

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
so we get 0.06 two meters so we plug

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.500 
so we get 0.06 two meters so we plug
that<00:02:48.080> all<00:02:48.350> in<00:02:48.530> multiply<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:49.220> all<00:02:49.340> together<00:02:49.550> we

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
that all in multiply it all together we

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.800 
that all in multiply it all together we
get<00:02:50.630> an<00:02:50.780> answer<00:02:51.200> of<00:02:51.730> point<00:02:52.730> three<00:02:53.150> two<00:02:53.420> that's

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
get an answer of point three two that's

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.840 
get an answer of point three two that's
after<00:02:54.080> rounding<00:02:57.040> point<00:02:58.040> three<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.430> Newton's

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850
