00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.450 

so<00:00:03.230> dopamine<00:00:03.830> is<00:00:03.920> a<00:00:03.980> very<00:00:04.190> interesting

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:04.460 
so dopamine is a very interesting

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.330 
so dopamine is a very interesting
neurotransmitter<00:00:05.240> and<00:00:06.130> what's<00:00:07.130> really

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 
neurotransmitter and what's really

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.710 
neurotransmitter and what's really
unique<00:00:07.460> about<00:00:07.760> it<00:00:07.910> it's<00:00:08.180> a<00:00:08.240> handful<00:00:08.690> of

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:08.720 
unique about it it's a handful of

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.950 
unique about it it's a handful of
neuromodulators<00:00:10.150> which<00:00:11.150> are<00:00:11.300> special<00:00:11.750> in<00:00:11.840> the

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
neuromodulators which are special in the

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.830 
neuromodulators which are special in the
sense<00:00:12.170> that<00:00:12.760> their<00:00:13.760> neurons<00:00:14.240> there's<00:00:14.600> the

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
sense that their neurons there's the

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.290 
sense that their neurons there's the
source<00:00:15.170> of<00:00:15.380> the<00:00:15.470> signal<00:00:15.650> is<00:00:16.090> localized<00:00:17.090> to

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
source of the signal is localized to

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.450 
source of the signal is localized to
specific<00:00:17.420> brain<00:00:18.080> areas<00:00:18.470> and<00:00:18.770> from<00:00:19.340> these

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
specific brain areas and from these

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.939 
specific brain areas and from these
brain<00:00:19.700> areas<00:00:20.030> they<00:00:20.180> project<00:00:20.420> all<00:00:21.080> across<00:00:21.740> the

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
brain areas they project all across the

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.980 
brain areas they project all across the
brain<00:00:22.180> there's<00:00:23.180> a<00:00:23.240> handful<00:00:23.570> of<00:00:23.600> other<00:00:23.780> ones

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
brain there's a handful of other ones

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.700 
brain there's a handful of other ones
like<00:00:24.110> serotonin<00:00:24.680> acetylcholine<00:00:25.570> and<00:00:26.710> these

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
like serotonin acetylcholine and these

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.170 
like serotonin acetylcholine and these
are<00:00:27.860> very<00:00:28.100> interesting<00:00:28.760> because<00:00:28.850> you<00:00:29.090> can

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
are very interesting because you can

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.390 
are very interesting because you can
think<00:00:29.449> of<00:00:29.539> them<00:00:29.690> as<00:00:29.779> broadcast<00:00:30.289> systems<00:00:30.680> some

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
think of them as broadcast systems some

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.979 
think of them as broadcast systems some
small<00:00:31.760> area<00:00:33.160> functionally<00:00:34.989> computing

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
small area functionally computing

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.869 
small area functionally computing
something<00:00:36.170> very<00:00:36.409> simple<00:00:36.679> perhaps<00:00:37.370> can<00:00:37.609> send

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
something very simple perhaps can send

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.079 
something very simple perhaps can send
this<00:00:37.940> information<00:00:38.239> across<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.140> brain<00:00:39.289> and<00:00:40.089> we

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:41.089 
this information across the brain and we

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:43.809 
this information across the brain and we
understand<00:00:41.449> a<00:00:41.479> lot<00:00:41.659> about<00:00:41.690> dopamine<00:00:42.639> it<00:00:43.639> turn

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:43.819 
understand a lot about dopamine it turn

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:46.389 
understand a lot about dopamine it turn
out<00:00:43.940> to<00:00:44.089> be<00:00:44.210> incredibly<00:00:45.190> interesting<00:00:46.190> and

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
out to be incredibly interesting and

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.299 
out to be incredibly interesting and
there<00:00:47.089> is<00:00:47.179> a<00:00:47.210> very<00:00:47.389> simple<00:00:47.809> summary<00:00:48.769> of<00:00:49.039> what

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
there is a very simple summary of what

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.910 
there is a very simple summary of what
we<00:00:49.429> understand<00:00:49.909> about<00:00:50.559> dopamine<00:00:51.559> which<00:00:51.739> is

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
we understand about dopamine which is

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.949 
we understand about dopamine which is
that<00:00:52.690> these<00:00:53.690> neurons<00:00:53.870> are<00:00:54.350> active<00:00:55.809> when<00:00:56.809> your

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:56.959 
that these neurons are active when your

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:59.919 
that these neurons are active when your
expectations<00:00:57.649> are<00:00:57.769> violated<00:00:58.629> they<00:00:59.629> suddenly

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
expectations are violated they suddenly

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:02.439 
expectations are violated they suddenly
send<00:01:00.769> a<00:01:00.889> burst<00:01:01.069> of<00:01:01.249> dopamine<00:01:01.639> when<00:01:02.299> you're

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
send a burst of dopamine when you're

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.689 
send a burst of dopamine when you're
expecting<00:01:02.929> something<00:01:03.430> and<00:01:04.430> you're<00:01:04.610> not

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
expecting something and you're not

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.820 
expecting something and you're not
getting<00:01:04.850> it<00:01:05.089> and<00:01:05.840> if<00:01:06.229> you<00:01:06.320> think<00:01:06.500> about<00:01:06.590> it

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
getting it and if you think about it

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.530 
getting it and if you think about it
this<00:01:06.890> is<00:01:07.010> exactly<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.610> right<00:01:07.760> kind<00:01:08.030> of<00:01:08.150> signal

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
this is exactly the right kind of signal

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.870 
this is exactly the right kind of signal
for<00:01:08.780> learning<00:01:09.080> if<00:01:09.580> you're<00:01:10.580> expecting

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
for learning if you're expecting

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.550 
for learning if you're expecting
something<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:11.690> you're<00:01:11.870> getting<00:01:12.050> it<00:01:12.290> there's

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
something and you're getting it there's

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.490 
something and you're getting it there's
nothing<00:01:13.220> to<00:01:13.310> change<00:01:13.520> about<00:01:13.640> your<00:01:13.850> behavior

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
nothing to change about your behavior

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.450 
nothing to change about your behavior
whereas<00:01:15.500> if<00:01:15.710> you're<00:01:15.830> expecting<00:01:16.070> something

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
whereas if you're expecting something

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.900 
whereas if you're expecting something
and<00:01:16.640> you're<00:01:16.730> not<00:01:16.760> getting<00:01:17.150> it<00:01:18.550> and<00:01:19.550> you<00:01:19.760> have<00:01:19.850> a

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
and you're not getting it and you have a

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.460 
and you're not getting it and you have a
burst<00:01:20.120> of<00:01:20.210> dopamine<00:01:20.540> that's<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.870> great<00:01:21.080> signal

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
burst of dopamine that's a great signal

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.280 
burst of dopamine that's a great signal
for<00:01:21.800> learning

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.460 

so<00:01:25.740> addiction<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.220> really<00:01:26.490> interesting<00:01:27.470> it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
so addiction is really interesting it

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.160 
so addiction is really interesting it
turned<00:01:28.770> out<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.570> essentially<00:01:30.570> all<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.870> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
turned out that essentially all of the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.740 
turned out that essentially all of the
addictive<00:01:31.650> drugs<00:01:31.980> that<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:32.340> know<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.550> end<00:01:33.090> up

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
addictive drugs that we know of end up

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.740 
addictive drugs that we know of end up
activating<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:35.400> dopamine<00:01:35.730> circuitry<00:01:36.210> they

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
activating the dopamine circuitry they

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.070 
activating the dopamine circuitry they
end<00:01:36.870> up<00:01:36.960> releasing<00:01:37.470> dopamine<00:01:37.910> so<00:01:38.910> an<00:01:39.600> emerging

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
end up releasing dopamine so an emerging

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.440 
end up releasing dopamine so an emerging
idea<00:01:40.410> is<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.830> what<00:01:41.010> what<00:01:41.550> happens<00:01:42.000> during

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
idea is that what what happens during

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.060 
idea is that what what happens during
addiction<00:01:43.050> is<00:01:43.410> that<00:01:43.620> you<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.800> a<00:01:43.860> normal

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
addiction is that you have a normal

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.430 
addiction is that you have a normal
computational<00:01:44.880> process<00:01:47.600> whereby<00:01:48.600> dopamine

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
computational process whereby dopamine

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.460 
computational process whereby dopamine
sends<00:01:49.800> signals<00:01:50.190> out<00:01:50.840> precisely<00:01:51.840> what's<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
sends signals out precisely what's the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.710 
sends signals out precisely what's the
degree<00:01:52.790> to<00:01:53.790> which<00:01:53.940> you<00:01:54.150> violated<00:01:54.690> your

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
degree to which you violated your

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.420 
degree to which you violated your
expectations<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.800> allows<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.280> to

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
expectations and that allows you to

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.030 
expectations and that allows you to
precisely<00:01:56.820> learn<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:58.200> proportion<00:01:58.740> to<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:01.860> what

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
precisely learn in proportion to to what

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:09.109 
precisely learn in proportion to to what
you<00:02:02.160> need<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:06.560> on<00:02:07.560> top<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.070> this<00:02:08.280> an

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
you need to and on top of this an

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.510 
you need to and on top of this an
addictive<00:02:09.600> drug<00:02:09.630> ends<00:02:10.560> up<00:02:10.619> releasing<00:02:10.890> extra

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
addictive drug ends up releasing extra

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.360 
addictive drug ends up releasing extra
do<00:02:11.640> for<00:02:11.820> me<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.150> what<00:02:13.080> happens<00:02:13.500> is<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.130> when

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
do for me so what happens is that when

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.230 
do for me so what happens is that when
you<00:02:14.460> get<00:02:14.580> those<00:02:14.790> drugs

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
you get those drugs

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.560 
you get those drugs
you<00:02:15.600> might<00:02:15.780> feel<00:02:16.020> happy<00:02:17.090> but<00:02:18.090> say<00:02:18.360> you're

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
you might feel happy but say you're

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:25.360 
you might feel happy but say you're
happy<00:02:18.810> about<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:21.050> great<00:02:23.690> chocolate<00:02:24.690> ice-cream

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
happy about a great chocolate ice-cream

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.880 
happy about a great chocolate ice-cream
over<00:02:26.370> time<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:26.760> learn<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.180> expect<00:02:27.740> that<00:02:28.740> the

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
over time you learn to expect that the

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.350 
over time you learn to expect that the
chocolate<00:02:29.100> ice<00:02:29.310> cream<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.610> really<00:02:29.790> great<00:02:30.060> and

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
chocolate ice cream is really great and

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.350 
chocolate ice cream is really great and
you<00:02:30.989> have<00:02:31.020> no<00:02:31.350> more<00:02:31.560> dopamine<00:02:32.010> released<00:02:32.640> in

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
you have no more dopamine released in

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.500 
you have no more dopamine released in
expectation<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.940> when<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.030> receive<00:02:36.330> it

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
expectation of that when you receive it

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.910 
expectation of that when you receive it
whereas<00:02:37.080> if<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.260> take<00:02:37.380> an<00:02:37.500> addictive<00:02:37.830> drug

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
whereas if you take an addictive drug

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.830 
whereas if you take an addictive drug
you<00:02:38.130> can<00:02:38.250> never<00:02:38.489> learn<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:39.000> expect<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.570> because

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
you can never learn to expect it because

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.290 
you can never learn to expect it because
the<00:02:39.989> drug<00:02:40.170> itself<00:02:40.680> will<00:02:41.580> really<00:02:41.820> is<00:02:41.910> an<00:02:42.030> act

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
the drug itself will really is an act

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.199 
the drug itself will really is an act
release<00:02:42.600> an<00:02:42.720> extra<00:02:43.110> kick<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.380> dopamine<00:02:43.739> and

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
release an extra kick of dopamine and

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.009 
release an extra kick of dopamine and
when<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.420> happens<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:47.340> value<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.780> drug

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
when that happens the value of that drug

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.420 
when that happens the value of that drug
keeps<00:02:49.260> increasing<00:02:49.440> because<00:02:50.040> now<00:02:50.220> you're

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
keeps increasing because now you're

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.420 
keeps increasing because now you're
learning<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.660> Wow<00:02:52.170> my<00:02:52.530> violations<00:02:53.220> wrecked

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
learning that Wow my violations wrecked

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.870 
learning that Wow my violations wrecked
my<00:02:54.420> expectations<00:02:54.989> were<00:02:55.080> violated<00:02:57.709> therefore

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
my expectations were violated therefore

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.979 
my expectations were violated therefore
this<00:02:59.880> must<00:03:00.000> be<00:03:00.120> much<00:03:00.330> more<00:03:00.480> valuable<00:03:00.840> than

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
this must be much more valuable than

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.600 
this must be much more valuable than
what<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.290> thought<00:03:02.160> before<00:03:03.950> so<00:03:04.950> basically<00:03:05.400> what

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
what I thought before so basically what

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.390 
what I thought before so basically what
ends<00:03:05.760> up<00:03:05.880> happening<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.630> dopamine<00:03:07.260> system

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
ends up happening the dopamine system

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.520 
ends up happening the dopamine system
gets<00:03:08.400> hijacked<00:03:08.700> by<00:03:09.570> these<00:03:09.780> drugs<00:03:10.080> so<00:03:10.200> it's<00:03:10.410> the

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
gets hijacked by these drugs so it's the

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.550 
gets hijacked by these drugs so it's the
normal<00:03:10.950> process<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.880> learning<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:13.380> gets

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
normal process of learning and it gets

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.700 
normal process of learning and it gets
hijacked<00:03:13.739> by<00:03:14.130> addictive<00:03:14.489> drugs
