like hold down like I'm doing a backflip
same<00:04:42.030> time<00:04:42.270> will<00:04:42.630> rotate<00:04:42.870> it<00:04:43.139> down<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.500> the

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.920 
same time will rotate it down to the
right<00:04:43.830> and<00:04:44.639> it'll<00:04:44.850> flatten<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.330> bike<00:04:45.540> out<00:04:45.720> and

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
right and it'll flatten the bike out and

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.240 
right and it'll flatten the bike out and
start<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.139> rotate<00:04:46.470> it<00:04:46.620> and<00:04:46.830> I<00:04:46.889> wait<00:04:47.040> for<00:04:47.160> the

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
start to rotate it and I wait for the

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.040 
start to rotate it and I wait for the
tie<00:04:47.400> if<00:04:47.610> you<00:04:47.729> look<00:04:47.970> tire<00:04:48.330> kits<00:04:48.600> like<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:48.870> Sun

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
tie if you look tire kits like the Sun

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.270 
tie if you look tire kits like the Sun
have<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.229> screen<00:04:49.470> are<00:04:49.620> a<00:04:49.650> little<00:04:49.800> above<00:04:50.100> my

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
have the screen are a little above my

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.670 
have the screen are a little above my
helmet<00:04:50.669> and<00:04:50.970> I<00:04:51.540> just<00:04:51.720> pinned<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.050> gas<00:04:52.200> and

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
helmet and I just pinned the gas and

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.800 
helmet and I just pinned the gas and
when<00:04:53.370> you<00:04:53.700> pin<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.120> gas<00:04:54.270> we're<00:04:54.450> not<00:04:54.540> living<00:04:54.750> at

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
when you pin the gas we're not living at

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.440 
when you pin the gas we're not living at
the<00:04:54.930> gas<00:04:55.139> gyro<00:04:55.620> kind<00:04:55.860> of<00:04:55.919> kicks<00:04:56.100> in<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.760> it

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
the gas gyro kind of kicks in and it

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.719 
the gas gyro kind of kicks in and it
will<00:04:57.720> with<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.169> bike<00:04:58.380> around<00:04:59.160> like<00:04:59.550> you're

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
will with the bike around like you're

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.790 
will with the bike around like you're
actually<00:04:59.880> whipping<00:05:00.390> the<00:05:00.510> bike<00:05:00.690> instead<00:05:01.650> of

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
actually whipping the bike instead of

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.770 
actually whipping the bike instead of
just<00:05:01.919> completing<00:05:02.490> of<00:05:02.729> rotation<00:05:03.270> sometimes<00:05:03.720> it

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
just completing of rotation sometimes it

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.570 
just completing of rotation sometimes it
looks<00:05:03.900> like<00:05:03.990> a<00:05:04.020> barrel<00:05:04.320> roll<00:05:04.470> but

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
looks like a barrel roll but

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.820 
looks like a barrel roll but
other<00:05:06.090> than<00:05:06.930> that<00:05:06.990> that's<00:05:07.289> pretty<00:05:07.379> much<00:05:07.680> the

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
other than that that's pretty much the

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.770 
other than that that's pretty much the
basic<00:05:08.220> if<00:05:08.610> you<00:05:08.759> want<00:05:08.940> to<00:05:09.000> do<00:05:09.060> a<00:05:09.090> lazy<00:05:09.300> boy<00:05:09.539> you

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
basic if you want to do a lazy boy you

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.909 
basic if you want to do a lazy boy you
just<00:05:09.960> go<00:05:10.310> down<00:05:11.310> to<00:05:11.729> the<00:05:11.879> right<00:05:12.060> then<00:05:12.919> swing

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
just go down to the right then swing

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.279 
just go down to the right then swing
from<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.639> right<00:05:14.819> position<00:05:15.419> all<00:05:15.629> the<00:05:15.900> way<00:05:15.990> back

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
from the right position all the way back

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.809 
from the right position all the way back
around<00:05:16.470> to<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:17.009> left<00:05:17.720> like<00:05:18.720> a<00:05:19.430> 360<00:05:20.430> pop<00:05:20.580> chop

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:20.819 
around to the left like a 360 pop chop

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:24.379 
around to the left like a 360 pop chop
if<00:05:21.030> your<00:05:21.150> state<00:05:21.419> player<00:05:22.879> you<00:05:23.879> just<00:05:24.060> do<00:05:24.120> a<00:05:24.150> light

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.629 
back around to the left and you lazy boy
it<00:05:26.550> and<00:05:26.699> let<00:05:26.849> you<00:05:26.909> let<00:05:27.090> go<00:05:27.270> but<00:05:27.780> never<00:05:28.639> really

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
it and let you let go but never really

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:33.320 
it and let you let go but never really
let<00:05:29.819> go<00:05:29.849> holding<00:05:30.389> down<00:05:30.629> because<00:05:31.590> it<00:05:31.919> will<00:05:32.330> slow

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
let go holding down because it will slow

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.909 
let go holding down because it will slow
your<00:05:33.479> rotation<00:05:33.990> which<00:05:34.169> I<00:05:34.289> crash<00:05:34.470> a<00:05:34.500> few<00:05:34.740> times

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
your rotation which I crash a few times

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.369 
your rotation which I crash a few times
in<00:05:35.039> that<00:05:35.129> video<00:05:35.720> but<00:05:36.720> this<00:05:36.960> is<00:05:37.020> pretty<00:05:37.319> much

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:37.379 
in that video but this is pretty much

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:38.689 
in that video but this is pretty much
the<00:05:37.530> end<00:05:37.560> of<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:37.770> video<00:05:37.949> that's<00:05:38.400> all<00:05:38.490> I<00:05:38.550> want

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 
the end of the video that's all I want
