00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 the people look at you carbon 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.850
 instagram buys you the left one 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.649
 get description bit of provision 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.250
 we of course no fun aside it 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.250
 Entrup 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.990
 Of course we also have the video 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.000
 seen by geo how he finished alone 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.650
 has done and yes we have too 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.849
 use product placement centers 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.829
 have somehow now also somehow 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.470
 As requested as you think so 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.579
 somehow also thought and that 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.130
 is not really possible 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.989
 then of those over youtube alone 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.890
 you are not really the camera 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:46.190
 Equipment financed keep exactly 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.850
 and that's why youtuber is actually called 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.329
 no other way the request comes out 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.730
 Product placement is exactly the question 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.870
 Of course, production as well as now 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.809
 will do for coal 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.550
 So we always have it like this 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.840
 handled when the product pipeline 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.990
 as well as 100 of the hsm 100 employees 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.600
 Boys find what they love 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.900
 Produce what you have and use it 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.159
 I really like it myself and I can feel that way 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.860
 we know how to show that 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.320
 we get something from it and we assign it 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.390
 So any orders 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.390
 packed or now like that 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.229
 Raffle therefore also the complete is 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.840
 100 package for you to draw 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.640
 released so that we actually too 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.480
 the products we place and 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.340
 thereby hold 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.230
 because prejudices he holds to you 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.000
 so back in amateur why we now 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.220
 even doing the series alone is that 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.140
 he was almost all now overflowed 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.910
 just in any video that has done 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.250
 which we did not do at the beginning 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:57.830
 where now he has a little bit of certain 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.720
 disput in the rap scene he but that 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.090
 would take 100 different topic and then 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.710
 is he simply so asked what is it? 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.570
 with flipper and placement 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.220
 what do you think about that because we have 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.640
 Do not even bother in your chips village 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.530
 So a handful of dirt just bought 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.120
 shit like I say is bought 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.800
 money is exactly right not true if we 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.350
 then they are per serving 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.290
 mostly products that we ourselves are 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.050
 mostly products we just 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.590
 celebrate personally and we qualitatively 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.720
 find high quality and if all 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.880
 place products but product 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.130
 then it would be someday too 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.720
 no longer credible because of it 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.760
 then we only have a handful or 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.440
 say okay that's cool the whole game 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.720
 about what we do not stop well 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.030
 For say simply, we have 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.060
 It also handled it that way 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.709
 made that under the song for chip 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.510
 soundcheck video for example from 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.239
 radical and in the hut description 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.420
 a missing link is if you are on it 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:05.180
 If you click on it, we get asked 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:08.270
 a small provision of radical so that 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.170
 problem is just make youtube videos 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.209
 costs money 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.620
 if we say okay we'll do it 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.450
 hours and wants my worst 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.340
 reckon that have put in the 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.320
 youtube-channel young at the 110th 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.840
 if there is such a sick sum 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:25.250
 actually never and have liszt and 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.570
 The equipment is pretty expensive 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.040
 we think as well as a few more 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.730
 months for SLR camera 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.840
 zuzulegen 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.810
 but then we start again it is us 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.330
 the worth of a camera for 1000 euro plus 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.970
 to buy and get the money again 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.440
 and that's the point we have at the moment 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.630
 Do not look because we find the money 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.459
 just not back from youtube the 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.049
 You can also make social transfers social 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.470
 Blade everything I want to do that 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.510
 program 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.959
 the margin is of course to 15,000 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.989
 Euro was of course a very typical yes 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.000
 that is a wish wishful thinking would be that 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.320
 So if we had 15,000 euros yes 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.380
 then I 'll be pretty horny thing though 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.100
 It's a bit of a fit piece 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.170
 the lower it to the beginning 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.519
 So it is not much that comes in there 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.650
 That's why you have to be youtube 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.269
 especially if you are constantly improving 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.280
 I always want to see which one 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.709
 There are possibilities there 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.130
 to consider debt financing 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.410
 only then is a question that finds the 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.920
 community that and therefore talk to 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.960
 you so what do you think of 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.890
 Product placement he would take us 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.890
 support that we 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.629
 always under the video then this one too 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.330
 Link money, for example, the vertical 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:42.759
 already in the video we think that we too 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.520
 would rather put it in the 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:48.909
 in the end it is your decision where he is 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:52.620
 ordered as you ordered you can 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:52.620
 there still give a few tips 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:03.129
 but a thing would appeal with 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:06.610
 that this documentary can hold that 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:10.960
 We now have this facebook 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.849
 gopro attitude in order given that was 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.770
 it just so small of me 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:18.370
 info to you to the people who do not 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.430
 have facebook and the course through nothing 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.430
 more 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:29.110
 I'm hungry but the rieder than me 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.740
 I wish you a lot of support 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.960
 chance to be tight and always nice 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.669
 left in the description and clicks 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.460
 then i want to have money yes 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:41.949
 Money come with an email without end 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.479
 this yes and if it is there 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:45.479
 achieves best comes you can
