you could say it's someone like a

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.770 
you could say it's someone like a
wedlock<00:00:34.859> except<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.969> don't<00:00:36.059> have<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.660> have

the same pokemon at the same time and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.669 
the same pokemon at the same time and

the middle of battle you must get rid of
it<00:01:02.190> as<00:01:02.280> soon<00:01:02.309> as<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:02.879> over<00:01:02.969> your<00:01:03.719> new<00:01:03.809> able<00:01:03.929> to

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
it as soon as it's over your new able to

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.260 
it as soon as it's over your new able to
use<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> Pokemon<00:01:04.739> unless<00:01:04.980> it's<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.400> up<00:01:05.519> here<00:01:05.550> so

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
use a Pokemon unless it's in up here so

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.760 
use a Pokemon unless it's in up here so
let's<00:01:06.450> say<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.750> example<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.320> catch<00:01:07.500> pokemon

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
let's say for example I catch pokemon

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.710 
let's say for example I catch pokemon
the<00:01:08.010> right<00:01:08.190> one<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.670> my<00:01:08.910> partner<00:01:09.300> fails<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the right one and my partner fails the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.630 
the right one and my partner fails the
catch<00:01:09.870> pokemon<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.440> that<00:01:10.560> route<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:11.070> can't<00:01:11.520> use

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
catch pokemon on that route I can't use

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.340 
catch pokemon on that route I can't use
the<00:01:11.760> pokemon<00:01:12.120> I<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.480> call<00:01:12.660> until<00:01:13.020> he<00:01:13.140> gets

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the pokemon I just call until he gets

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.020 
the pokemon I just call until he gets
something<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.710> pair<00:01:13.920> up<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.670> pokemon

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
something to pair up with the pokemon

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.340 
something to pair up with the pokemon
don't<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.300> to<00:01:15.450> come<00:01:15.630> from<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.930> same<00:01:16.080> route

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
don't have to come from the same route

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.410 
don't have to come from the same route
just<00:01:16.800> as<00:01:16.920> long<00:01:16.950> as<00:01:17.400> their<00:01:17.640> pokemon<00:01:18.090> are<00:01:18.210> paired

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
just as long as their pokemon are paired

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.820 
just as long as their pokemon are paired
up<00:01:18.510> together<00:01:18.690> that's<00:01:19.200> all<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.500> matters

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
up together that's all that matters

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.860 
up together that's all that matters
that's<00:01:20.430> pretty<00:01:20.640> much<00:01:20.760> the<00:01:20.910> only<00:01:21.120> additional

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
that's pretty much the only additional

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.660 
that's pretty much the only additional
rule<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.290> makes<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.680> dual<00:01:22.950> lock<00:01:23.310> what<00:01:23.550> it

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
rule that makes this dual lock what it

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.670 
rule that makes this dual lock what it
is<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.600> guys<00:01:24.810> basically<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.410> to<00:01:25.530> work

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
is you guys basically have to work

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.160

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
counted as the same area but of course

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.520 
counted as the same area but of course
was<00:02:10.730> just<00:02:10.910> an<00:02:11.000> example<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.630> last<00:02:12.260> but<00:02:12.350> not

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
was just an example and last but not

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.260 
was just an example and last but not
least<00:02:12.590> you<00:02:12.980> must<00:02:13.130> nickname<00:02:13.610> every<00:02:13.910> single

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
Pokemon you catch you don't necessarily

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.040 
Pokemon you catch you don't necessarily
have<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:17.000> do<00:02:17.270> this<00:02:17.420> if<00:02:17.600> you're<00:02:17.720> not<00:02:17.840> really<00:02:17.960> a

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
figured I already I'm actually going to

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.970 
figured I already I'm actually going to
be<00:02:26.480> doing<00:02:26.660> a<00:02:26.840> let's<00:02:27.020> play<00:02:27.290> using<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.770> dual

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
be doing a let's play using the dual

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.890 
be doing a let's play using the dual
lock<00:02:28.220> rules<00:02:28.490> it's<00:02:29.120> going<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.360> be<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.510> dual<00:02:29.690> log

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
lock rules it's going to be a dual log

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.780 
lock rules it's going to be a dual log
versus<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:30.860> that<00:02:31.010> will<00:02:31.130> need<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.310> be<00:02:31.490> four

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
versus so that will need to be four

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.790 
versus so that will need to be four
people<00:02:31.940> involved<00:02:32.420> those<00:02:32.840> people<00:02:32.990> are<00:02:33.290> myself

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
people involved those people are myself

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.980 
people involved those people are myself
throw<00:02:34.490> that<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.330> heated<00:02:35.570> mo<00:02:35.720> and

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
throw that the heated mo and

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.170 
throw that the heated mo and
velocity<00:02:36.710> like<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.490> explained<00:02:37.790> earlier<00:02:37.880> the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
velocity like I explained earlier the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.420 
velocity like I explained earlier the
duo<00:02:38.570> log<00:02:38.780> needs<00:02:38.960> at<00:02:39.110> least<00:02:39.140> two<00:02:39.350> people<00:02:39.800> so<00:02:40.370> of

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
duo log needs at least two people so of

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.580 
duo log needs at least two people so of
course<00:02:40.490> this<00:02:41.030> will<00:02:41.150> be<00:02:41.300> a<00:02:41.330> team<00:02:41.540> thing<00:02:41.840> through
