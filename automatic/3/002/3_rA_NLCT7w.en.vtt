00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.640
Salutations celestial sight seers! I'm David
Fuller, welcome to Eyes on the Sky; what's

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.070
up this week?

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.380
Let's begin at two well-known constellations
in the south. The first, Scorpius, may be

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.400
the easier one to to find, what with having
first magnitude Antares and some of it's other

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.830
bright stars reaching a higher elevation over
the horizon at culmination. To the east of

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.420
Scorpius is Sagittarius. While its stars are
a bit dimmer – only two of them are second

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.760
magnitude – a careful look for the many
stars that are 3.5 magnitude or brighter reveals

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.590
quite a bit of constellation here. The most
prominent shape is that of the “Teapot”

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.739
- the handle is clearly to the east, the “lid”
a simple triangle up top, and the “spout”

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.609
off to the west.

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.470
Under darker skies, the Milky Way is dense
in this area, both lit up from the collective

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.000
light of millions of distant stars, along
with darker areas due to clouds of unlit gas

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.590
and dust. And just off of the spout of the
teapot, like a kettle just about to boil,

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.009
is a brighter patch of the Milky Way. Right
in this area is the center of our Milky Way,

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.140
where the black hole Sagittarius A resides.
It is around this supermassive gravitational

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.209
entity that the rest of the stars in our galaxy
revolve, as well as the globular clusters

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.340
around it.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.830
Now look at the space between AlNasl in Sagittarius,
the star at the “spout” of the Teapot,

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.440
and Shaula, the 2-nd brightest star in Scorpius.
Take some 7x35 or larger binoculars and aim

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.440
them right between these two stars; the wonderful
open cluster Messier 7 blazes into glory.

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.190
And due to it's angular diameter of nearly
1 and a half degrees, binoculars ARE the best

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.690
way to view it compared to a telescope that
would have a narrower field of view. Keep

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.310
those binoculars handy and dust off the telescope...
we'll find a few more objects nearby.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.410
Dark Sky Fact: Have you downloaded the “Loss
of the Night” app to your smartphone? This

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.900
free app from Globe at Night is simple to
use. Let it know what brighter stars you can

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.819
see, and finally, when you can no longer see
the dimmer ones. That's it – and in so doing,

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.640
you can help track light pollution. Try it
out this week.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.290
Let's look up towards the lid of the Teapot.
The Sagittarius area is SO dense with objects,

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.349
you can really just sweep binoculars around
this area and see so many objects. But we

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.230
want to identify a few of these. First, go
to the “lid” of the teapot, at the 2.8

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.450
magnitude star, Kaus Borealis. Look at the
stars making up the bottom of the lid; Kaus

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.379
Media and Phi Sagittarii. Make a line that
is nearly parallel to that line made by those

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:59.049
two stars, but instead start at Kaus Borealis,
and move your binoculars towards the east,

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:05.370
just five degrees, within a binocular field
of view. The incredible globular cluster Messier

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.569
22 is here – one of the finest globulars
in the entire night sky to see.. and you can

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.400
spot it with simple binoculars! Now, this
object really IS better with a telescope,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.269
so go on and find it with one!. Use a magnified
finder to follow the same star hop, or even

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.409
estimate the location with a red dot finderscope.

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:31.849
From here, now draw a line from Phi, through
Kaus Borealis. Go a similar distance past

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:38.849
Kaus that those two stars are apart. You'll
find a “backwards C” shaped set of stars,

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:45.810
composed of ones from 5-th through 7-th magnitude.
Notice the first stars for the lower section

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.810
of the backwards “C”? That's the open
cluster NGC6530. Now try to block as much

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.549
extraneous light as possible – ideally go
to dark skies, but that's not possible for

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.609
all of us – and look at this cluster with
a telescope. Noticeably near the two bright

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:09.169
stars in the middle, one which is 9 Sagittarii,
is a brightening of the sky – well, actually

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:16.169
it's the nebula Messier 8. This is an active
star-forming region; much of NGC6530 was born

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.180
from this gas cloud, and it is an emission
nebula that glows from the ionization of it's

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.730
gas from nearby stars.

Keep your eyes on the sky and your outdoor

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.370
lights aimed down, so we can all see, what's
up. I'm David Fuller, wishing you clear and

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.250
dark skies.
