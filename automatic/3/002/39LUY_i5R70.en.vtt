what I was gonna do is I was gonna take
like<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.430> thought<00:00:53.969> about<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.629> was

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
like this I thought about this and I was

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.830 
like this I thought about this and I was
gonna<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.489> start<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.760> fade<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.690> I

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
gonna like start to like fade it but I

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.590 
gonna like start to like fade it but I
didn't<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.289> thought<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:59.329> you<00:01:00.329> know<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.480> just

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
didn't I thought that you know I just

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.990 
didn't I thought that you know I just
beat<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.379> looked<00:01:01.620> bad<00:01:01.920> if<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.550> just<00:01:02.730> faded

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
beat it just looked bad if it just faded

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.920 
beat it just looked bad if it just faded
directly<00:01:03.570> into<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.110> color<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> decided

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
directly into that color so I decided

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.730 
directly into that color so I decided
not<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.799> do<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.070> cuz<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:09.720> actual<00:01:10.110> obey<00:01:10.470> will

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
not to do that cuz the actual obey will

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.399 
not to do that cuz the actual obey will
go<00:01:10.950> kind<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.310> like<00:01:11.430> fades<00:01:12.000> into<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.479> white<00:01:13.170> blue

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
go kind of like fades into a white blue

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.789
