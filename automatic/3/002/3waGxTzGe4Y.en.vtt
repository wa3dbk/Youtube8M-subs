00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.870 
way if you didn't know it slow fire it's
just<00:01:30.480> a<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:30.810> black<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.640> tasted<00:01:32.640> with

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
just a little black and tasted with

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.240 
just a little black and tasted with
black<00:01:33.300> and<00:01:33.510> white<00:01:33.690> and<00:01:34.500> next<00:01:34.920> thing<00:01:35.010> you<00:01:35.070> have

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
black and white and next thing you have

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.490 
black and white and next thing you have
is<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.700> FN<00:01:36.090> us<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.510> this<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:36.840> FMS<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.380> know

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
is the FN us so this is the FMS you know

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.390 
is the FN us so this is the FMS you know
you<00:01:37.590> can<00:01:37.710> say<00:01:37.830> you're<00:01:37.980> off<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.190> that's<00:01:38.310> it

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
you can say you're off and that's it

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.520 
you can say you're off and that's it
down<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.550> think<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:38.940> a<00:01:39.120> fault<00:01:39.330> so<00:01:39.660> it<00:01:40.350> was

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
down I think it's just a fault so it was

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.650 
down I think it's just a fault so it was
nothing<00:01:40.800> really<00:01:40.830> new<00:01:41.100> with<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> FMS<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.570> we

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
nothing really new with the FMS so we

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.550 
nothing really new with the FMS so we
can<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:42.900> do<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:44.840> throw<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.230> the<00:01:46.380> fire

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
can just do that throw it in the fire

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.920 
can just do that throw it in the fire
there<00:01:47.160> you<00:01:47.250> go<00:01:47.400> you<00:01:48.240> need<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.900> rod<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:50.060> here<00:01:51.060> this

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
the bow I really like this bow I think

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.590

this<00:02:16.740> boat<00:02:16.950> was<00:02:17.010> custom-made<00:02:17.420> that's<00:02:18.420> what<00:02:18.570> I

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
this boat was custom-made that's what I

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.390 
this boat was custom-made that's what I
think<00:02:18.900> that's<00:02:19.020> at<00:02:19.590> least<00:02:19.620> what<00:02:19.890> Sampson<00:02:20.190> told

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
think that's at least what Sampson told

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.640 
think that's at least what Sampson told
me<00:02:20.490> so<00:02:20.790> I'm<00:02:21.390> sitting<00:02:21.630> with<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.380> may<00:02:22.590> be

the blue and the blue doesn't really
match<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.340> looks<00:02:32.489> kind<00:02:32.670> of<00:02:32.700> ugly

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880
