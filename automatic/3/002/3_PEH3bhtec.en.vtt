00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.580

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.610

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.649

 enemies including butterflies 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.949
 although they cause us positive 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:46.359
 emotions but very much harm our 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.229
 Russia and now there is such a lot 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:52.589

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.469
 butterflies to go down I do it 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.000
 then read as follows: 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:16.210
 a large amount of literature 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.590
 I became interested in the fact that 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:24.909
 butterflies also tag their 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.609
 territory like many animal species in 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:32.520
 including insect entomologists noticed 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:37.450

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.640
 cabbage they do not mean conquer 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.740

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:59.740
 egg shells made 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.030
 such columns with testicles or 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.920
 mushrooms 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.250
 a butterfly flies over this one 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.130
 a little strand seeing from a height 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.520
 of your flight 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:16.670
