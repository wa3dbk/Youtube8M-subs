00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.370
 And this pin vice 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.220
 If you put it on, as much as possible, it will stain the cow

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.780
 Wheels that can be used 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.310
 I'll put it on, but the corresponding wheel is also low height 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.480
 Trapezoidal and 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:01:01.650
 Trapezoid low height These three types are compatible 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.650
