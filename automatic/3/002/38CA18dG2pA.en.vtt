 question trailer the corresponds to the 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.650
 questions that we left in the before the 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.610
 video that we went up routine to take out 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.170
 impressive shoulders 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.090
 so that highlighting the videos that 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.980
 we have going up we invite you to 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.660
 subscribe to our YouTube channel

 the subscribe button in the part 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.590
 bottom of the video and join our 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.170
 page on facebook which is 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.970
 appearing on the screen let's start now 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:42.440
 yes with today's questions 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.810
 our friend antonio vivanco seminar 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.960
 tell us on youtube 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.760
 so how about my question is why 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.350
 when you do the exercise for the part 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.200
 back of the shoulders 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.660
 I feel that I also work the lats 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.340
 greetings and thank you good friend in the case 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.110
 of the subsequent elevations with 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.720
 dumbbells so you can feel 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.490
 really that your posterior shoulders 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.670
 they are the ones who are working and not your 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.800
 dorsals then when performing 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.670
 the exercise you should 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.470
 pay close attention to the following 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.520
 place the time to make them 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.950
 your elbows are brought to the body 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.310
 Your base numbers are the ones that go to 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.140
 intervene you understand but if you separate it 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.090
 the body the manasés of the sides 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.790
 you will feel that it is your shoulders 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.010
 later those who are working 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.200
 then the reason why are you 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.690
 feeling more its dorsals and us 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.000
 are the later is that these things 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.540
 we are interested in high tension glued to 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.600
 body 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.940
 ok so use that guy and there you give 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.080
 that feel that you like 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.170
 later are what are really 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.470
 working our friend danny first 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.780
 energy tells us on facebook and why 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.210
 they do not do the three military since they are 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.820
 very good 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.770
 the brother looks at you I explain the price 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.220
 Dumbbell bros becomes the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.810
 equivalent to military combat press 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.600
 we are simply varying remember 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.040
 that bar is already successful let's go to the 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.190
 next question 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.970
 our friend Jose Mario guzmán a 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.680
 ten on youtube hello toni in the first 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.069
 exercise lateral elevations with 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.920
 dumbbells we do it standing seated what 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.410
 I say to vary a bit you know leave me or 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.560
 jose as I mentioned in one of the two 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.930
 previous videos that we upload in yes no 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.880
 there is a difference in making them sit 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.489
 stopped because then the movement is 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.819
 only the same these works of the 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.670
 same way the lateral ones 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.219
 but the intention to do it for 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.950
 to make you edited is that the moment of 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.659
 do it sitting invite any trap 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.389
 at the moment of truth of exercise 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:01.510
 For example, putting on the stand there 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:06.510
 the habit of propelling oneself with the body 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.510
 the things you can avoid needed 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.269
 it wobbles a lot then does the 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.359
 you're more focused on avoiding 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.250
 central because so I already clear 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.730
 you know 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.500
 now let's move on to the next question 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.590
 Our friend Luis Lezcano Chacón 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.230
 does not say on Facebook health is of coast 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.150
 rich with how much weight is it to start or is 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.720
 maintains the same weight in all 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.160
 Greetings series and by Ávila Mare 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.080
 brother did it in the first place many 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.910
 thank you because I greet from here the 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.490
 team train at the distance of iquitos 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.900
 peru we send you a big hug from a 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.350
 greeting to all the followers of 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.420
 costa rica dry living by brother with 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.850
 Regarding your question, try to find a 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.220
 weight that allows you to meet the range of 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.040
 repetitions indicated in the plan in 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.450
 all cases for example if you do not have a 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.260
 weight who wants to do more repetitions 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:08.080
 try to increase the weight if in this 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.050
 case is difficult you do not reach the range of 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.950
 repetition established in the plan 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.810
 it diminishes or in other words 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.269
 brothers what does it mean to play 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.419
 with the weights until you find a weight 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:23.280
 adequate to make you reach the rank of 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.280
 repetitions that we establish in the plan 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.220
 Let's move on to the next question that 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.449
 our friend been average we left in 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.449
 Youtube 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:36.349
 I do not understand if they always recommend 34 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:39.790
 series here says 5 and 8 10 12 repetitions 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:42.610
 at most and here says 15 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:46.360
 good friends you must understand what to do 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:49.380
 an exercise for 8 repetitions is not what 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.430
 same as doing it for 15 repetitions 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.490
 Different types of fibers are 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.640
 recruited in both cases or is a plan 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.920
 of looking for ways to work different 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.870
 types of fiber and that's why they vary 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.350
 repeating ranges then in this 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.490
 case is usually placed at 800 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.340
 repetitions 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.380
 now we are placing 15 but with one 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.600
 these pair excellent way 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.580
 trainings and you can work the 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.350
 muscle fibers that previously 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.880
 we work one day so you will have 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.900
 excellent results 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.610
 and to finish the last question in 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.410
 what our friend gabriel castle 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.330

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.460
 impressive 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.360
 when I train shoulders that other parts 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:41.650
 of the muscles can exercise 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.310
 first congratulations for your 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.470

 thank you very much for the trust and 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.150
 we move forward with more results 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.780
 really question 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.909
 brother men can be 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.909
 trained with anyone 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:05.189
 the belief that says it's only 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:07.589
 shoulder counterweight shoulder counterweight but 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:11.450
 no brother the shoulders you can train 

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:15.330
 with a small muscle like a duck laugh 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:17.880
 forearm says I'm sad even 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.860
 also like programs like chest 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.600
 and how this plan structure 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.800
 training because you're not going to 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.820
 use that only men 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.740
 counterweight off of the head is not 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.720
 well now you know, you can combine it 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.520
 with any other muscle all the 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.840
 kind of how your plan is structured 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.639
 of training 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.070
