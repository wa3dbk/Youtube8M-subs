00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
the headshot and stuff look a little bit

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.910 
the headshot and stuff look a little bit
nice<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.280> not<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.640> big<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.119> deal<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:43.290> did

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
nice it's not that big of a deal I did

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.819 
nice it's not that big of a deal I did
have<00:01:44.159> dynamite<00:01:44.930> in<00:01:45.930> there<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.350> another<00:01:46.590> weapon

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
have dynamite in there is another weapon

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.130 
have dynamite in there is another weapon
but<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.579> was<00:01:48.259> so<00:01:49.310> badly<00:01:50.659> reviewed<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.840> guess

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
but it was so badly reviewed I guess

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.280 
but it was so badly reviewed I guess
that<00:01:52.439> no<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.340> wanted<00:01:53.790> dynamite<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.990> was<00:01:55.110> just

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
that no one wanted dynamite it was just

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.940 
that no one wanted dynamite it was just
hard<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.159> use<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:58.079> why<00:01:58.229> dynamite<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:58.649> in

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
hard to use so it's why dynamite on in

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.819 
hard to use so it's why dynamite on in
there<00:01:59.159> he<00:02:00.030> what<00:02:00.750> happened<00:02:01.049> was<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.350> throw<00:02:01.649> the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
there he what happened was you throw the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.620 
there he what happened was you throw the
dynamite<00:02:02.250> like<00:02:02.430> grenade<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.180> set<00:02:03.479> off<00:02:03.600> a

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.830 
timer and then a zombie happened to hit
the<00:02:07.290> explosion<00:02:07.799> he<00:02:07.920> died<00:02:08.190> but<00:02:09.000> then<00:02:09.509> people

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
the explosion he died but then people

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.200 
the explosion he died but then people
are<00:02:09.869> explaining<00:02:10.550> complaining<00:02:11.550> those<00:02:11.760> two

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
are explaining complaining those two

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.900 
are explaining complaining those two
so<00:02:12.990> I<00:02:13.020> changed<00:02:13.470> again<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:14.280> when<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.580> hits<00:02:14.790> a

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
so I changed again that when it hits a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.820 
so I changed again that when it hits a
zombie<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.450> explodes<00:02:15.930> but<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.440> was<00:02:16.590> still

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
zombie it explodes but that was still

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.340 
zombie it explodes but that was still
too<00:02:17.040> hard<00:02:17.250> for<00:02:17.340> people<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.760> use<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.930> manage<00:02:19.200> to

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
too hard for people to use and manage to

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.690 
too hard for people to use and manage to
use<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.620> fine<00:02:19.860> but<00:02:20.160> that's<00:02:20.310> probably<00:02:20.580> because

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
use it fine but that's probably because

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.890 
use it fine but that's probably because
I<00:02:21.210> made<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.630> weapon<00:02:21.900> know<00:02:22.050> how<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.230> use<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.610> so

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
I made the weapon know how to use it so

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.000 
I made the weapon know how to use it so
really<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.080> dynamite<00:02:25.440> was<00:02:25.590> just<00:02:25.800> like

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
really the dynamite was just like

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.060 
really the dynamite was just like
admitted<00:02:26.580> tactical<00:02:27.120> element<00:02:27.210> to<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.690> game

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
admitted tactical element to the game

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.950 
admitted tactical element to the game
and<00:02:29.070> you<00:02:29.670> see<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.970> names<00:02:30.180> give<00:02:30.570> you<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> bit

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
and you see the names give you a bit

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.800 
and you see the names give you a bit
more<00:02:30.990> teamwork<00:02:31.860> stuff<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.610> can<00:02:32.790> tell<00:02:33.570> where

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
more teamwork stuff you can tell where

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.270 
more teamwork stuff you can tell where
the<00:02:33.960> safe<00:02:34.170> zones<00:02:34.440> are<00:02:34.680> because<00:02:35.040> your

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
the safe zones are because your

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.800 
the safe zones are because your
teammates<00:02:35.880> are<00:02:36.030> there<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.480> they're<00:02:36.600> not

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
teammates are there and they're not

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.250 
teammates are there and they're not
losing<00:02:37.050> health<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:38.610> just<00:02:39.510> made<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.870> game<00:02:40.020> just

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
losing health so just made the game just

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.660 
losing health so just made the game just
a<00:02:40.530> little<00:02:40.980> bit<00:02:41.330> more<00:02:42.330> versatile<00:02:43.170> there<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.610> you

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
a little bit more versatile there so you

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.170 
a little bit more versatile there so you
play<00:02:44.910> style<00:02:45.180> just<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.540> little<00:02:45.780> bit<00:02:45.900> better<00:02:46.110> but

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
play style just a little bit better but

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.880 
play style just a little bit better but
you<00:02:48.180> can<00:02:48.390> see<00:02:48.510> I'm<00:02:48.630> camping<00:02:49.110> here<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.620> have

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
is an early stage the map I actually
