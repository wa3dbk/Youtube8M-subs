the first several nights my arm arms are
hurting<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.820> knew<00:00:21.060> which<00:00:21.240> notes<00:00:21.510> I

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
hurting is that I knew which notes I

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:22.970 
hurting is that I knew which notes I
wanted<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.050> play<00:00:22.230> but<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.410> didn't<00:00:22.680> know<00:00:22.769> how<00:00:22.920> to

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
wanted to play but I didn't know how to

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.580 
wanted to play but I didn't know how to
push<00:00:23.640> them<00:00:23.820> down<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.689> was<00:00:25.050> hurting<00:00:25.350> myself

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.470 
push them down so I was hurting myself
if<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.070> hadn't<00:00:26.400> developed<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:27.000> technique

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
if you hadn't developed a technique

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.400 
if you hadn't developed a technique
right<00:00:28.320> yet<00:00:28.760> so<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:30.060> said<00:00:30.330> one<00:00:30.630> night<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:30.900> just<00:00:31.230> I

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
decided I was going to try to make

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.150 
decided I was going to try to make
myself<00:00:32.790> look<00:00:33.149> like<00:00:33.210> mr.<00:00:33.630> crane<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.260> said<00:00:34.829> if<00:00:34.920> mr.

crane was playing this thing you make it
look<00:00:36.809> ridiculously<00:00:37.469> simple<00:00:37.850> so<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.910> started

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
look ridiculously simple so I started

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.200 
look ridiculously simple so I started
trying<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.960> use<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.149> principles<00:00:42.149> that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
trying to use the principles that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.900 
trying to use the principles that
learned<00:00:42.570> from<00:00:43.020> pool<00:00:43.290> I'm<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.829> game<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.129> pool<00:00:44.160> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910

pool table and the exact same thing here

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.349 
pool table and the exact same thing here
but<00:00:58.559> cool<00:00:58.800> players<00:00:59.129> they<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.489> tap<00:00:59.730> involves

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
realize is that there's an absence of

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.780 
realize is that there's an absence of

so<00:01:53.410> that<00:01:53.620> see<00:01:53.860> just<00:01:54.100> before<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.580> academy<00:01:55.060> of

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
so that see just before the academy of

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.210 
so that see just before the academy of
motion<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:55.870> even<00:01:56.560> if<00:01:56.650> i'm<00:01:56.770> going<00:01:56.980> all<00:01:57.190> over

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
motion and even if i'm going all over

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.430 
motion and even if i'm going all over
the<00:01:57.460> pn<00:01:59.070> like<00:02:00.070> that<00:02:00.370> i<00:02:00.640> will<00:02:01.150> i<00:02:01.420> will<00:02:01.750> arrive<00:02:02.230> at

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
the pn like that i will i will arrive at

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.500 
the pn like that i will i will arrive at
these<00:02:02.590> low<00:02:02.860> notes<00:02:03.130> with<00:02:03.550> the<00:02:03.670> least<00:02:04.000> amount<00:02:04.210> of

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
these low notes with the least amount of

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.560 
these low notes with the least amount of
motion<00:02:04.990> going<00:02:05.680> like<00:02:06.040> that<00:02:06.070> as<00:02:06.370> opposed<00:02:06.880> to

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
motion going like that as opposed to

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.510 
motion going like that as opposed to
something<00:02:07.780> like<00:02:08.020> that<00:02:08.290> ah<00:02:08.590> can<00:02:09.160> you<00:02:09.250> show<00:02:09.399> me

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
think about curving I fingers but if I

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.090 
think about curving I fingers but if I
