to where you can part it wherever you
want<00:03:58.770> you<00:03:59.280> can<00:03:59.430> make<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.730> middle<00:03:59.940> part<00:04:00.330> or<00:04:01.110> the

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
want you can make the middle part or the

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.900 
want you can make the middle part or the
side<00:04:01.710> part<00:04:02.930> it's<00:04:03.930> not<00:04:04.110> a<00:04:04.170> built-in<00:04:04.710> part<00:04:05.700> in

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910

side part it's not a built-in part in
the<00:04:06.270> closure<00:04:07.110> so<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:08.340> like<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.930> it

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
the closure so I like that and it

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.370 
the closure so I like that and it
matches<00:04:10.470> perfectly<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:11.480> hair<00:04:12.480> texture<00:04:13.080> of

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
matches perfectly the hair texture of

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.630 
matches perfectly the hair texture of
the<00:04:14.130> actual<00:04:14.580> hair<00:04:14.910> so<00:04:15.300> that's<00:04:15.840> also<00:04:16.640> good

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
the actual hair so that's also good

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.400 
the actual hair so that's also good
because<00:04:17.940> sometimes<00:04:18.540> foreclosures<00:04:19.110> don't

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
because sometimes foreclosures don't

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.270 
because sometimes foreclosures don't
really<00:04:19.650> match<00:04:19.860> the<00:04:19.890> actual<00:04:20.880> hair<00:04:21.450> bundles<00:04:22.280> so

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
really match the actual hair bundles so

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.940 
really match the actual hair bundles so
this<00:04:23.550> is<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:23.940> closure<00:04:26.300> but<00:04:27.300> home<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:28.740> hair

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
this is the closure but home the hair

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.520 
this is the closure but home the hair
didn't<00:04:29.220> come<00:04:29.400> with<00:04:29.550> any<00:04:29.730> type<00:04:30.030> of<00:04:30.060> st.<00:04:30.510> oh<00:04:30.780> it

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
when I washed the 18 inch um the the

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.370 
when I washed the 18 inch um the the
water<00:04:41.340> when<00:04:41.850> I<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:42.180> water<00:04:42.390> did<00:04:42.780> turn<00:04:43.140> like

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
water when I the water did turn like

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.190 
water when I the water did turn like
this<00:04:43.680> brownish<00:04:44.190> type<00:04:44.700> of<00:04:44.850> color<00:04:45.150> so<00:04:45.870> I<00:04:45.900> was

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
this brownish type of color so I was

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.680 
this brownish type of color so I was
assured<00:04:46.530> that<00:04:46.590> hair<00:04:46.950> was<00:04:47.130> just<00:04:47.340> dirty<00:04:47.790> or

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
assured that hair was just dirty or

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.370 
assured that hair was just dirty or
either<00:04:48.990> they<00:04:49.590> dyed<00:04:49.980> the<00:04:50.310> hair<00:04:50.340> I<00:04:50.930> think<00:04:51.930> it<00:04:52.230> was

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
either they dyed the hair I think it was

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.840 
either they dyed the hair I think it was
just<00:04:52.440> dirty<00:04:53.040> because<00:04:53.430> um<00:04:55.520> they<00:04:56.520> might<00:04:56.730> have
