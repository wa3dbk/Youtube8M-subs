and a bit of island patterns you know

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.910 
and a bit of island patterns you know
mixing<00:01:43.480> it<00:01:43.630> up<00:01:43.810> it<00:01:44.110> would<00:01:44.200> be<00:01:44.410> pretty<00:01:44.740> cool

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
mixing it up it would be pretty cool

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.730 
mixing it up it would be pretty cool
sure<00:01:45.190> that's<00:01:46.120> that's<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.840> idea<00:01:47.080> on<00:01:47.170> there<00:01:47.350> my

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
sure that's that's the idea on there my

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.950 
sure that's that's the idea on there my
right<00:01:47.920> now<00:01:48.040> I've<00:01:48.280> got<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.880> words<00:01:49.120> In<00:01:49.660> God<00:01:49.900> We

Trust there's letters

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.640 
Trust there's letters
so<00:01:54.370> there's<00:01:54.580> dots<00:01:54.790> between<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:56.200> word<00:01:56.350> gods
