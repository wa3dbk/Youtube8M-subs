00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
going through each puzzle make it

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.500 
going through each puzzle make it
through<00:02:41.900> all<00:02:41.960> 80<00:02:42.410> of<00:02:42.560> them<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.370> trick<00:02:43.820> is<00:02:43.850> it's

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
through all 80 of them the trick is it's

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.350 
through all 80 of them the trick is it's
hard<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.930> find<00:02:45.230> your<00:02:45.440> path<00:02:45.740> some<00:02:46.520> mining

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
hard to find your path some mining

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.080 
hard to find your path some mining
stones<00:02:47.900> take<00:02:48.380> two<00:02:48.650> or<00:02:48.680> three<00:02:48.890> hits<00:02:49.460> you<00:02:49.880> only

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
stones take two or three hits you only

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.300 
stones take two or three hits you only
have<00:02:50.360> so<00:02:50.630> much<00:02:50.810> energy<00:02:51.020> they're<00:02:51.620> reflected<00:02:52.220> in

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
have so much energy they're reflected in

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.460 
have so much energy they're reflected in
the<00:02:52.430> top<00:02:52.640> left<00:02:53.030> you're<00:02:53.480> trying<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.960> get<00:02:54.140> three
