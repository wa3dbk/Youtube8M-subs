it was one of the things that she really
enjoyed<00:03:57.480> from<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:57.900> from<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:59.010> one<00:03:59.160> of<00:03:59.250> the

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
enjoyed from the from the one of the

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.600 
enjoyed from the from the one of the
past<00:03:59.550> of<00:03:59.970> bark<00:04:00.600> boxes<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:01.440> this<00:04:01.709> is<00:04:01.890> good<00:04:02.190> even

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
past of bark boxes so this is good even

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.610 
past of bark boxes so this is good even
though<00:04:02.700> it's<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:02.940> repeat<00:04:03.420> all<00:04:04.140> right<00:04:04.320> and<00:04:04.470> this

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
though it's a repeat all right and this

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.560 
though it's a repeat all right and this
is<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:04.830> last<00:04:05.160> one<00:04:05.520> it<00:04:05.700> looks<00:04:05.880> like<00:04:06.150> this<00:04:06.420> is

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
is the last one it looks like this is

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.840 
is the last one it looks like this is
there's<00:04:07.200> only<00:04:07.290> four<00:04:07.709> items<00:04:08.100> apparently<00:04:08.820> I

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
there's only four items apparently I

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.260 
there's only four items apparently I
guess<00:04:09.000> maybe<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:10.290> counts<00:04:10.739> as<00:04:11.100> multiple<00:04:11.970> I

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
guess maybe that counts as multiple I

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.910 
guess maybe that counts as multiple I
