Android 4.1 or 4.2 I'm not really sure

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.750 
Android 4.1 or 4.2 I'm not really sure
but<00:02:38.970> overall<00:02:39.960> it's<00:02:40.260> really<00:02:40.380> smooth<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.340> scroll

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
lot of raindrops so I should probably

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.510 
lot of raindrops so I should probably
head<00:03:36.330> inside<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:37.680> this<00:03:37.830> basically<00:03:38.250> concludes

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
head inside so this basically concludes

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.360
