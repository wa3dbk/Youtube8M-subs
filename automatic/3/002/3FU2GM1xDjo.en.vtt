00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.840
 Y 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.160
 hello good morning girls I'm anna and it's 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.660
 Tempore Today I'll explain 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.309
 some of the ways that you 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.460
 you can put our new scarf that 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.220
 which is very simple and very versatile 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.470
 so the first way would be to go putting 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.810
 the one of the eggs by the head and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.610
 taking advantage of the second to make a 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.220
 rosette that appears on the web page 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.320
 this is done by entering the second part 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.320
 for the first gap and doing what 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.910
 it would be a sailor's knot so this face 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.379
 around it to get ahead by 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.239
 behind and you always have to have 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.000
 Be careful with your shoulders to know how you 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.480
 remains 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.550
 the second way to eat the woman 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.170
 would be by way of mandate always having 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.170
 careful that the auction 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.400

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.400

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.140
 one of our mice or even with 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.180
 a red you can also put this to 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.970
 capita mode by entering the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.610
 head through one of the gaps and another network 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.960
 through the second hole so that you 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.960

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.100
