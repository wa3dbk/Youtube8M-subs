00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
out if the Odyssey class bridge got a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.460 
out if the Odyssey class bridge got a
new<00:00:23.100> thing<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.550> let's<00:00:24.060> find<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.420> it's<00:00:25.140> not<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
new thing so let's find it it's not the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.310 
new thing so let's find it it's not the
odds<00:00:25.650> with<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> serious<00:00:27.199> sum<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.380> B<00:00:28.590> no<00:00:29.150> no

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
odds with a serious sum of a B no no

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.759 
odds with a serious sum of a B no no
where<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.439> it

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
where is it

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.350 
where is it
there<00:00:32.700> we<00:00:32.790> go<00:00:32.940> now<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.649> tactical<00:00:35.579> yep

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
there we go now this is the tactical yep

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.369 
there we go now this is the tactical yep
that's<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.160> C<00:00:38.460> store<00:00:38.670> version

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
that's it this is the C store version

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.069 
that's it this is the C store version
and<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:41.640> new<00:00:41.670> bridge<00:00:41.969> for<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.450> waters<00:00:42.719> class

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
and the new bridge for the waters class

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.830

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
is only C store I mean this is only for

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.080 
is only C store I mean this is only for
the<00:00:45.930> c-store<00:00:46.289> ships<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:47.399> makes<00:00:47.640> sense<00:00:47.850> now

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the c-store ships it makes sense now

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.310 
the c-store ships it makes sense now
that<00:00:48.300> they<00:00:48.390> were<00:00:48.480> promoting<00:00:48.930> these<00:00:49.079> ships

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
that they were promoting these ships

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.100 
that they were promoting these ships
just<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> week<00:00:50.489> ago<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.750> probably

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
just a like a week ago so it's probably

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.889

hatching<00:01:22.790> my<00:01:23.790> bridge<00:01:24.000> files<00:01:24.299> which<00:01:25.290> is

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
hatching my bridge files which is

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.810 
hatching my bridge files which is
exactly<00:01:25.799> what<00:01:25.950> happened<00:01:26.250> with<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.610> board<00:01:26.790> of

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
exactly what happened with the board of

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.480 
exactly what happened with the board of
the<00:01:26.909> class<00:01:27.119> bridge<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.320> may<00:01:29.009> go<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.340> a

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the class bridge so I may go on to a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.539 
the class bridge so I may go on to a
whole<00:01:29.700> new<00:01:29.880> bridge<00:01:30.119> right<00:01:30.360> now<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:34.020> believe

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
whole new bridge right now and I believe

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.240 
whole new bridge right now and I believe
it<00:01:35.549> says<00:01:35.729> Aquarius<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:37.590> may<00:01:37.740> not<00:01:37.770> be<00:01:37.950> any

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
it says Aquarius but it may not be any

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.070 
it says Aquarius but it may not be any

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
here I've never actually looked at the

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.479 
here I've never actually looked at the
Odyssey<00:03:58.980> because<00:03:59.099> one<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.489> last<00:03:59.849> one<00:04:00.120> on

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
Odyssey because one of the last one on

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.360 
Odyssey because one of the last one on
it<00:04:02.489> was<00:04:02.609> buggy<00:04:03.079> so<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.170> Aquarius<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:04.890> c-store

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
it was buggy so the Aquarius is c-store

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.470 
it was buggy so the Aquarius is c-store
only<00:04:05.730> that<00:04:05.879> means<00:04:06.030> I'm<00:04:06.090> gonna<00:04:06.209> have<00:04:06.299> to<00:04:06.390> go

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
only that means I'm gonna have to go

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.649 
only that means I'm gonna have to go
back<00:04:06.629> and<00:04:06.750> update<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.200> old<00:04:07.489> thing<00:04:08.510> not<00:04:09.510> that

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
back and update that old thing not that

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.890 
back and update that old thing not that
old<00:04:09.840> thing<00:04:10.049> my<00:04:11.040> other<00:04:11.310> video<00:04:11.639> and<00:04:12.000> then<00:04:12.780> this

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
old thing my other video and then this

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.929 
old thing my other video and then this
will<00:04:13.049> be<00:04:13.139> the<00:04:13.260> Odyssey<00:04:13.680> class<00:04:13.889> bridge<00:04:14.219> that's

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:14.939 
will be the Odyssey class bridge that's

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.400 
will be the Odyssey class bridge that's
interesting<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.510> they<00:04:15.780> did<00:04:15.989> that<00:04:16.109> because<00:04:16.229> I

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
interesting that they did that because I

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.279 
interesting that they did that because I
remember<00:04:16.470> that<00:04:16.829> I<00:04:17.070> think<00:04:17.669> they<00:04:17.849> called<00:04:18.630> this

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
remember that I think they called this

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.620 
remember that I think they called this
Odyssey<00:04:19.769> class<00:04:20.190> I<00:04:20.609> think<00:04:21.239> they<00:04:21.329> called<00:04:21.509> the

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
Odyssey class I think they called the

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.680 
Odyssey class I think they called the
Aquarius<00:04:22.079> bridge<00:04:22.320> Odyssey<00:04:22.860> class<00:04:23.070> for<00:04:23.430> a

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
Aquarius bridge Odyssey class for a

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:32.839 
Aquarius bridge Odyssey class for a
short<00:04:24.690> while<00:04:27.860> patching<00:04:28.910> wonderful<00:04:31.729> but<00:04:32.729> I'm

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
short while patching wonderful but I'm

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.150 
short while patching wonderful but I'm
sure<00:04:33.090> just<00:04:33.780> like<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.080> boardís<00:04:34.440> class<00:04:34.740> that

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
sure just like the boardís class that

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.800 
sure just like the boardís class that
the<00:04:35.280> Odyssey<00:04:35.669> class<00:04:35.970> bridge<00:04:36.240> is<00:04:36.389> only<00:04:36.539> for<00:04:36.720> the

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
the Odyssey class bridge is only for the

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.749 
the Odyssey class bridge is only for the
Odyssey<00:04:37.110> class<00:04:37.320> ships<00:04:37.650> and<00:04:37.889> that<00:04:38.550> now<00:04:38.699> the

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
Odyssey class ships and that now the

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.779 
Odyssey class ships and that now the
Aquarius<00:04:39.389> is<00:04:39.570> just<00:04:39.900> for<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.919> c-store<00:04:41.340> bridges

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
Aquarius is just for the c-store bridges

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:46.249 
Aquarius is just for the c-store bridges
which<00:04:42.210> kind<00:04:42.449> of<00:04:42.509> sucks<00:04:42.810> because<00:04:43.050> the<00:04:45.259> Aquarius

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
which kind of sucks because the Aquarius

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:47.750 
which kind of sucks because the Aquarius
was<00:04:46.380> definitely<00:04:46.800> where<00:04:46.889> it's<00:04:47.039> at<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.220> bridges

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
was definitely where it's at and bridges

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.020 
was definitely where it's at and bridges
and<00:04:48.020> this<00:04:49.020> is<00:04:49.320> this<00:04:50.220> is<00:04:50.280> poop<00:04:50.610> this<00:04:50.849> is<00:04:51.000> not
