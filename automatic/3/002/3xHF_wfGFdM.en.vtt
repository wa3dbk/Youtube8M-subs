00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:02.210
 Hello everyone. 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.109
 I am Serizawa, an afterbeat music school guitar instructor. 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.960
 This time, in the question of everyone ... In the question that everyone gave 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.519
 It has become a video of the contents that I would say that I would say that it is bad, 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.010
 This third movie of the three videos is 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.540
 I think I would like to talk about various things about myself. 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.340
 So the first story is, "How long have you been playing guitar?" 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.450
 This is quite well received. 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.320
 I am 12 years old because I am in junior high school soon. 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.820
 It is about April and May of 12 years old. 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.329
 So, from there ... it was an acoustic guitar, 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.050
 Acoustic guitar for about a year. 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.670
 Do it for about a year, so buy an electric guitar, 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.960
 It is such a feeling that we make various copies from there. 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.149
 At first, I have been doing it for about 15 years now because I am 27 years old, 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.500
 I'm in trouble, I'm not getting better yet. 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.820
 So that next. 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.880
 "How long do you play the guitar every day?" 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.150
 What should I say? 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.480
 My working day is four days a week. 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.060
 It is Monday, Thursday, Friday, Sunday. 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:21.170
 Monday, Thursday, Friday, Sunday is mostly open from 11:00 to 10:00. 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.659
 If it is late, it is from 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock to 10 o'clock, but it seems to be about 11 o'clock to 10 o'clock. 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.680
 If I put in my work, I would play for about 10 hours every day. 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.640
 I feel like that. 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:41.310
 But if I leave my job, I think I'm playing on average for about 5 or 6 hours. 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.070
 It is quite different from day to day. 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.200
 There are times when I get up in the morning, and I'm just playing around until I go to bed. 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.939
 But if I get up, I will go out with my bike on the bike, 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.080
 Sometimes I don't touch the guitar at all. 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.150
 However, I think that there is rarely a day when you do not touch even once a day. 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.380
 Somewhat soon, a seat ... I always sit in a seat, 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.670
 It feels like there's a guitar as soon as you reach into a seat and reach out. 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.140
 It seems like I'll play for a while after I have eaten rice. 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.920
 So, I'm a smoker, 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.830
 "Oh, I'm tired. Even a little cigarette ..." 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.070
 It sounds like you're trying to play the guitar quite a lot. 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.310
 So I think I have at least 30 minutes a day, maybe one hour, probably at hand. 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.390
 So that next. 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.370
 "Where did you learn guitar technology and theory?" 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.430
 This is basically a book. 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.060
 Honestly, I did not belong to any classroom, nor did I go to school. 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.900
 It looks like it was all done in a book. 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.820
 The technology is appropriate. 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.599
 It's like I was able to play around in the middle of the day when it was time to say "Wow, it's fun". 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.170
 After that, it's a fun song. 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.410
 Also, there are various instructional books. 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.560
 "What do you think for a guitarist?" 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.959
 "Music theory". 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.050
 It feels like you bought and read a lot of such books. 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.290
 I really bought such a kind of textbook because I really like it. 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.120
 The rest is the Internet. 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.160
 If it's famous, it's probably "Jazz Guitar Style Master". 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.750
 Though it is the homepage that "Joey Natori" is doing, 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.489
 When I was 18 or 19 years old, I often watched the website. 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.239
 I remember remembering that I practiced a lot. 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.870
 I'm sure that website is still available, 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.569
 There are lots of great content, so if you're interested, please take a look. 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:46.140
 It feels like I studied a lot with such books and the Internet. 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.720
 So that next. 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.610
 The story is, "Does the instructional DVD not resell?" 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.819
 My home page. 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.400
 Though there is a homepage called "Takizawa guitar dot com", 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.780
 There is my hand-made instructional DVD there. 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.150
 Beginner, intermediate, advanced, etc. 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.400
 There are a lot of acoustic guitars, though. 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.080
 If you want to apply for it, 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.429
 "You may have already signed up. What does that mean?" 

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:10.900
 I get a lot of questions and emails. 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.629
 However, I am sorry for this, but I feel that I will not do it for a while. 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.959
 Simply speaking, it takes a great deal of time. 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.610
 Packing and shipping in various ways. 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.369
 After that, while checking or seeing the passbook, "Ah, this person is OK. This person is OK!" 

00:04:27.369 --> 00:04:28.679
 What are you doing ... 

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:30.249
 "Wash !!" 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:32.819
 It takes quite some time to do what you are doing, so 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.460
 We have had a rest for now. 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.099
 Also, if you can create a new DVD or put together a variety of DVD 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:45.689
 I think I will accept the application, so please wait. 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:50.969
 I think I will not resume it soon, though. Excuse me. Please wait patiently. 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:51.439
 So that next. 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:56.500
 "There are too many videos of Mr. Takizawa," the story. 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.150
 It's the last question, but it doesn't mean bad 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.279
 "I just started the guitar. So, Takizawa's video is a great reference, so by all means 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:09.729
 I would like to see various things, but there are too many videos and I don't know which one to watch from. 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.029
 This also comes in quite a lot. 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:17.520
 Such people are not "Takizawa guitar dot com", 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:24.379
 If you go to the "Afterbeat Music School" website 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:27.830
 Categorized into maintenance, training, techniques. 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.769
 Also, with three stars. 

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:34.180
 It is level 1 or level 2 or level 3 and so on. 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.680
 As there is such a simple level division and homepage which may be, 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.599
 I think if you can refer to it by all means. 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:49.060
 The really talented, really talented staff at me make a beautiful website, 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.939
 We also manage videos, so 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:55.849
 I hope you can check the videos that you care about by all means. 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:00.159
 With YouTube, videos are too messy to find, but it is difficult to search, 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:04.770
 By all means at the homepage of the guitar department of "Afterbeat Music School" 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.919
 It is a feeling I think if you check it. 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:11.059
 Yes. 

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:14.300
 That's why I tried to chat with you for a long time. 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.759
 There are some questions that can not be answered at all, but 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:24.490
 Anyway, I would like to answer if it is a common question. 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.359
 All three videos were talked with Bella Bella for a long time. 

00:06:28.359 --> 00:06:30.030
 For now, let's end this area. 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.729
 I'm also a little thirsty, and I'm hungry, so I'll eat it. 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:36.879
 See you next time. 

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:37.579
 Goodbye.
