between sizes there's so much
opportunity<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:52.379> us<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.800> find<00:00:52.890> something

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
opportunity for us to find something

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.910 
opportunity for us to find something
that<00:00:53.640> makes<00:00:54.000> women<00:00:54.390> more<00:00:54.660> comfortable<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.410> so

that makes women more comfortable and so

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.880 
that makes women more comfortable and so
we<00:00:56.460> have<00:00:56.610> ten<00:00:56.910> cups<00:00:57.180> instead<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.690> four<00:00:58.199> cups<00:00:58.440> we

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
we have ten cups instead of four cups we

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.860 
we have ten cups instead of four cups we
have<00:00:59.039> fifty<00:00:59.399> five<00:00:59.609> sizes<00:00:59.940> instead<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.600> twelve

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
have fifty five sizes instead of twelve

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.500 
have fifty five sizes instead of twelve
sizes<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:02.039> as<00:01:02.399> close<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.670> custom<00:01:03.239> fit<00:01:03.359> as

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
sizes so it's as close to custom fit as

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.420 
sizes so it's as close to custom fit as
you<00:01:03.600> can<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:03.960> okay<00:01:04.170> now<00:01:04.559> show<00:01:05.010> me<00:01:05.040> how<00:01:05.189> this

think it was gonna fit you the best and

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.640 
think it was gonna fit you the best and
you<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.299> go<00:01:33.390> one<00:01:33.570> up<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.960> one<00:01:34.079> down<00:01:34.140> really

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
you can go one up and one down really

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.380 
you can go one up and one down really
what<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.890> need<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.100> do<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.369> drop<00:01:35.880> your<00:01:36.119> breast

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
tissue into the cup and you want to find

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.999 
tissue into the cup and you want to find
the<00:01:39.060> cup<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.810> I'm<00:01:39.990> actually<00:01:40.409> demonstrated

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the cup that I'm actually demonstrated

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.130 
the cup that I'm actually demonstrated
right<00:01:41.130> here<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.400> our<00:01:41.430> mannequin<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.689> fits

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
right here on our mannequin that fits

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.230 
right here on our mannequin that fits
without<00:01:43.350> any<00:01:43.710> gapping<00:01:44.130> or<00:01:44.520> spillage<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.090> this

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
without any gapping or spillage so this

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.090 
without any gapping or spillage so this
one<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.930> little<00:01:46.200> bit<00:01:46.470> small<00:01:46.770> for<00:01:47.009> your

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
one is a little bit small for your

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.550 
one is a little bit small for your
mannequin<00:01:47.579> here<00:01:47.820> okay<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.450> if<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.229> put<00:01:49.439> this

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
mannequin here okay and if I put this

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.200 
mannequin here okay and if I put this
one<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:50.009> can<00:01:50.159> see<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.700> one<00:01:51.000> would

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
one on you can see that this one would

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.550 
one on you can see that this one would
be<00:01:51.240> too<00:01:51.540> big<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.200> what<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:52.409> consider

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
be too big so this is what we consider

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.410 
be too big so this is what we consider
gapping<00:01:53.250> all<00:01:53.520> right<00:01:53.729> I'm<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.180> were<00:01:54.240> too

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
gapping all right I'm if it were too

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.510 
gapping all right I'm if it were too
small<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.899> be<00:01:55.020> spillage<00:01:55.500> what<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.070> want<00:01:56.310> is

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
small it be spillage what you want is

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.429 
small it be spillage what you want is
something<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.509> perfectly<00:01:57.990> snug

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
something that is just a perfectly snug

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.350 
something that is just a perfectly snug
so<00:01:58.860> once<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.159> get<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.399> cup<00:01:59.579> size<00:01:59.820> which<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.210> get

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
so once you get the cup size which I get

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.910 
so once you get the cup size which I get
is<00:02:00.390> by<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.689> number<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.200> yeah<00:02:01.439> number<00:02:01.770> two

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
is by a number so that yeah number two

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.260 
is by a number so that yeah number two
let's<00:02:02.159> say<00:02:02.189> I'm<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.369> number<00:02:02.610> two<00:02:02.759> then<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.060> do

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
let's say I'm a number two then you do

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.090 
let's say I'm a number two then you do
the<00:02:03.600> traditional<00:02:04.200> find<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> ribcage

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
the traditional find that we a ribcage

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.399 
the traditional find that we a ribcage
size<00:02:05.520> direct<00:02:06.149> under<00:02:06.570> bust<00:02:06.780> measurement<00:02:07.229> and

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
size direct under bust measurement and

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.369 
size direct under bust measurement and
instead<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.310> other<00:02:08.849> bra<00:02:09.330> brands<00:02:09.720> where<00:02:09.929> you

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
instead of in other bra brands where you

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.420 
instead of in other bra brands where you
would<00:02:10.530> add<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> number<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.099> becomes<00:02:11.190> a

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
would add a number it becomes a

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.160 
would add a number it becomes a
mathematical<00:02:11.940> equation<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.390> just<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
mathematical equation it's just the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.790 
mathematical equation it's just the
number<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.500> you

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
number of you

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.590 
number of you
germán<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.220> you're<00:02:14.340> under<00:02:14.700> bus<00:02:14.850> okay<00:02:15.240> now<00:02:15.390> this

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
germán of you're under bus okay now this

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.970 
germán of you're under bus okay now this
is<00:02:15.660> when<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:15.900> show<00:02:16.200> Samantha

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980

is when I show Samantha
yes<00:02:17.070> trying<00:02:17.490> on<00:02:17.790> one<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.960> sheets<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.290> fit

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
wearing a 230 so I could actually

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.350 
wearing a 230 so I could actually
demonstrate<00:02:26.010> if<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.490> don't<00:02:26.640> mind<00:02:26.790> on<00:02:26.970> you

why not Samantha you're already
committed<00:02:29.760> right<00:02:30.110> I'm<00:02:31.110> putting<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.590> cup<00:02:32.130> size

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
committed right I'm putting a cup size

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.490 
committed right I'm putting a cup size
four<00:02:32.730> on<00:02:32.910> her<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.450> when<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.570> put<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.050> on<00:02:34.260> you

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
four on her and when I put this on you

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.160 
four on her and when I put this on you
can<00:02:34.650> see<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.490> she's<00:02:35.730> not<00:02:35.940> filling<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:36.960> up

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
can see that she's not filling this up

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.140 
can see that she's not filling this up
entirely<00:02:37.740> so<00:02:38.130> there's<00:02:38.340> too<00:02:38.640> much<00:02:38.790> space<00:02:39.120> here

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
entirely so there's too much space here

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.890 
entirely so there's too much space here
too<00:02:39.780> much<00:02:39.930> space<00:02:40.140> here<00:02:40.200> what<00:02:41.100> we<00:02:41.220> read<00:02:41.370> and

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
too much space here what we read and

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.260 
too much space here what we read and
this<00:02:42.900> cup<00:02:43.200> here<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:44.100> can<00:02:44.250> see<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.520> obviously

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
this cup here you can see is obviously

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.540 
this cup here you can see is obviously
too<00:02:45.480> small<00:02:45.870> okay<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.590> what<00:02:46.800> what<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.220> really

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
too small okay so what what you really

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.590 
too small okay so what what you really
are<00:02:47.760> looking<00:02:48.000> for<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:49.410> very<00:02:50.100> snug<00:02:50.640> fit<00:02:51.330> and

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
are looking for is a very snug fit and

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.570 
are looking for is a very snug fit and
if<00:02:52.110> she<00:02:52.260> wasn't<00:02:52.560> wearing<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.860> bra<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.190> added

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
if she wasn't wearing the bra that added

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.430 
if she wasn't wearing the bra that added
the<00:02:53.670> perimeter<00:02:54.060> you'd<00:02:54.210> see<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.720> fits<00:02:55.260> her

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
the perimeter you'd see that it fits her

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.350 
the perimeter you'd see that it fits her
perfectly<00:02:56.130> okay<00:02:56.520> so<00:02:56.580> once<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.060> have<00:02:57.210> your

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
perfectly okay so once you have your

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.390 
perfectly okay so once you have your
size<00:02:57.600> then<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.870> can<00:02:58.080> order<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.650> you'll<00:02:59.220> know

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
size then you can order and you'll know

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.100 
size then you can order and you'll know
that<00:02:59.430> from<00:02:59.700> going<00:03:00.060> forward<00:03:00.360> right<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.050> you

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
that from going forward right and you

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.270 
that from going forward right and you
always<00:03:01.320> have<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.530> kid<00:03:01.680> as<00:03:01.800> I<00:03:01.890> understand<00:03:02.190> it's

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
always have the kid as I understand it's
