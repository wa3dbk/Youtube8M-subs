00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.400 

in<00:00:00.359> this<00:00:00.480> video<00:00:00.719> I'll<00:00:00.780> be<00:00:00.810> going<00:00:00.960> over<00:00:01.140> how<00:00:01.350> to

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
in this video I'll be going over how to

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.740 
in this video I'll be going over how to
make<00:00:01.589> clouds<00:00:01.979> so<00:00:02.760> first<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.300> all<00:00:03.389> make<00:00:03.600> sure

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
make clouds so first of all make sure

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.900 
make clouds so first of all make sure
you're<00:00:03.870> under<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.140> net<00:00:04.259> dynamics<00:00:04.910> fluid

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
you're under the net dynamics fluid

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.169 
you're under the net dynamics fluid
effects<00:00:06.299> create<00:00:06.690> 30<00:00:06.839> container<00:00:07.230> options<00:00:08.179> just

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
effects create 30 container options just

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.810 
effects create 30 container options just
reset<00:00:09.540> these<00:00:09.660> settings<00:00:11.840> apply<00:00:13.190> so<00:00:14.190> by<00:00:14.429> default

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
reset these settings apply so by default

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.490 
reset these settings apply so by default
this<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.000> your<00:00:15.179> 3d<00:00:15.420> container<00:00:15.750> what<00:00:16.260> we<00:00:16.350> want

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
this is your 3d container what we want

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.109 
this is your 3d container what we want
to<00:00:16.560> do<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.830> make<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.160> it's<00:00:17.369> big<00:00:17.910> enough<00:00:18.000> to

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
to do is make it so it's big enough to

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.679 
to do is make it so it's big enough to
do<00:00:18.270> containing<00:00:18.720> clouds<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.740> go<00:00:19.949> up<00:00:19.980> here<00:00:20.689> we

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
do containing clouds so go up here we

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.880 
do containing clouds so go up here we
hand<00:00:21.869> with<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.050> resolution<00:00:23.180> it's<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.269> bit<00:00:24.449> more

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
hand with the resolution it's a bit more

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.980 
hand with the resolution it's a bit more
maybe<00:00:25.890> should<00:00:26.340> be<00:00:26.369> sides<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:27.240> basically<00:00:27.750> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
maybe should be sides so basically the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.259 
maybe should be sides so basically the
more<00:00:28.170> they<00:00:28.320> are<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:28.830> then<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:30.119> more

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
more they are here then the more

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.740 
more they are here then the more
detailed<00:00:30.599> your<00:00:30.660> clouds<00:00:30.929> can<00:00:31.109> be<00:00:33.079> still<00:00:34.079> 25<00:00:34.559> 5<00:00:35.750> 5

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
detailed your clouds can be still 25 5 5

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.060 
detailed your clouds can be still 25 5 5
as<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.050> can<00:00:37.140> see<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.440> makes<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.890> thing

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
as you can see it just makes this thing

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.350 
as you can see it just makes this thing
bigger<00:00:38.309> scale<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.000> by<00:00:39.120> hand<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.450> want<00:00:39.629> to

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
bigger scale that by hand of you want to

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.119 
bigger scale that by hand of you want to
sit<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.600> closet<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.960> know<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.590> density<00:00:44.010> has

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
sit in a closet you know the density has

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.760 
sit in a closet you know the density has
to<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.399> off<00:00:44.899> velocity<00:00:45.899> off<00:00:46.050> me<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.530> because

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
to be off velocity off me and because

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.810 
to be off velocity off me and because
we're<00:00:47.100> not<00:00:47.190> gonna<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.640> it

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
we're not gonna have it so it

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.340 
we're not gonna have it so it
dynamically<00:00:48.360> changes<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.960> goes<00:00:49.079> up<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.289> down

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
dynamically changes and goes up and down

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.119 
dynamically changes and goes up and down
or<00:00:50.360> randomly<00:00:51.360> moves<00:00:51.770> we're<00:00:52.770> gonna<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:53.010> it

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
or randomly moves we're gonna have it

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.130 
or randomly moves we're gonna have it
something<00:00:53.309> animate<00:00:53.760> differently<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:55.079> I'm

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
something animate differently so I'm

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.760 
something animate differently so I'm
gonna<00:00:55.230> go<00:00:55.320> down

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
gonna go down

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.680 
gonna go down
most<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.280> things<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.850> change<00:00:57.390> or

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
most of the things that change or

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.840 
most of the things that change or
determine<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.469> way<00:00:58.800> clouds<00:00:59.190> look<00:00:59.370> like<00:00:59.430> is

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
determine the way clouds look like is

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.180 
determine the way clouds look like is
the<00:01:00.000> shading<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:01.109> I'm<00:01:01.260> gonna<00:01:01.410> transparency

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
the shading so I'm gonna transparency

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.280 
the shading so I'm gonna transparency
bring<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.550> down<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> lot<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> lot<00:01:04.199> more

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
bring this down a lot so it's a lot more

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:17.109 
bring this down a lot so it's a lot more
opaque<00:01:04.939> and<00:01:06.260> I'm<00:01:07.260> gonna<00:01:07.380> give<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.560> up<00:01:07.740> higher

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.490 

edges<00:01:18.119> let's<00:01:18.720> just<00:01:18.930> say<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.290> our<00:01:19.380> like

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
edges let's just say this is our like

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.080 
edges let's just say this is our like
perfectly<00:01:20.040> white<00:01:20.340> clouds<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:20.939> change

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
perfectly white clouds you can change

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.060 
perfectly white clouds you can change
the<00:01:21.240> colors<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.659> want<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.080> that's

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
the colors if you want to that's

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.090 
the colors if you want to that's
entirely<00:01:23.310> up<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:24.409> I'm<00:01:25.409> gonna<00:01:25.710> give<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:25.950> a

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
entirely up to you I'm gonna give this a

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.450 
entirely up to you I'm gonna give this a
Y<00:01:26.310> drop-off<00:01:27.500> so<00:01:28.500> Y<00:01:28.650> grading<00:01:29.009> has<00:01:29.070> some<00:01:29.250> sort

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
Y drop-off so Y grading has some sort

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.590 
Y drop-off so Y grading has some sort
let's<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.090> round<00:01:30.270> everything<00:01:30.600> off<00:01:32.600> Nexus

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
let's just round everything off Nexus

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.140 
let's just round everything off Nexus
opacity<00:01:35.780> add<00:01:36.780> another<00:01:36.990> one<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:38.060> I'm<00:01:39.060> gonna

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
opacity add another one here I'm gonna

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.260 
opacity add another one here I'm gonna
set<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.540> constant<00:01:40.049> instead<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:41.670> when

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
set this to constant instead and when

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.969 
set this to constant instead and when
you're<00:01:42.420> dealing<00:01:42.509> with<00:01:42.630> any<00:01:43.020> fluids<00:01:43.829> I

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
you're dealing with any fluids I

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.770 
you're dealing with any fluids I
recommend<00:01:44.460> going<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.790> six<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.420> that's<00:01:45.630> your

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
recommend going to six so that's your

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.450 
recommend going to six so that's your
textured<00:01:46.380> mud<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.829> can<00:01:46.920> kind<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.070> see<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.280> with

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
textured mud you can kind of see it with

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.760 
textured mud you can kind of see it with
one<00:01:47.790> giant<00:01:48.210> cloud<00:01:48.630> right<00:01:48.780> now<00:01:48.810> which<00:01:49.470> isn't

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
one giant cloud right now which isn't

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.069 
one giant cloud right now which isn't
all<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.040> realistic<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.820> changed<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.689> smooth

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
all that realistic I changed to smooth

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.740 
all that realistic I changed to smooth
so<00:01:52.560> smooth<00:01:53.159> over<00:01:53.430> transition<00:01:54.979> don't<00:01:55.979> we<00:01:56.070> Cal

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
so smooth over transition don't we Cal

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.450 
so smooth over transition don't we Cal
set<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:58.369> bias<00:01:59.369> I<00:02:00.740> wanna<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:01.920> thing<00:02:02.159> have

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
set a bias I wanna have this thing have

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.030 
set a bias I wanna have this thing have
texture<00:02:02.850> color<00:02:03.090> texture<00:02:04.020> opacity<00:02:04.560> as<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.920> can

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
texture color texture opacity as you can

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.180 
texture color texture opacity as you can
see<00:02:05.219> as<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.210> using<00:02:06.329> these<00:02:06.860> or<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.979> see<00:02:08.099> the

see as just using these or you see the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.889 
see as just using these or you see the
shape<00:02:08.399> shape<00:02:08.580> if<00:02:08.729> it's<00:02:08.910> pretty<00:02:09.209> interesting

shape shape if it's pretty interesting

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.630 
shape shape if it's pretty interesting
turn<00:02:10.770> off<00:02:11.030> grid<00:02:12.030> now

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
turn off grid now

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.559 
turn off grid now
there's<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.700> little<00:02:14.910> cloud<00:02:15.120> that's<00:02:15.330> kind<00:02:15.510> of

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
there's a little cloud that's kind of

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.309 
there's a little cloud that's kind of
ugly<00:02:16.340> scroll<00:02:17.340> down<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.520> bit<00:02:17.730> more

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
ugly scroll down a bit more

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.390 
ugly scroll down a bit more
so<00:02:19.319> what<00:02:19.410> you'll<00:02:19.530> be<00:02:19.620> blaming<00:02:19.950> playing<00:02:20.280> with

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
so what you'll be blaming playing with

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.150 
so what you'll be blaming playing with
amplitude<00:02:20.790> ratio<00:02:21.540> frequency<00:02:22.050> ratio<00:02:22.500> def<00:02:22.830> max

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.880 
amplitude ratio frequency ratio def max
etc<00:02:24.090> etc<00:02:24.209> etc<00:02:25.610> changing<00:02:26.610> these<00:02:26.700> values<00:02:26.760> will

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
etc etc etc changing these values will

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.080 
etc etc etc changing these values will
essentially<00:02:28.890> drastically<00:02:29.640> change<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.000> way

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
essentially drastically change the way

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.690 
essentially drastically change the way
your<00:02:30.209> clouds<00:02:30.450> look<00:02:30.770> so<00:02:31.770> here<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.430> am

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
your clouds look so here I am

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.750 
your clouds look so here I am
here's<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.180> platoon<00:02:33.510> at<00:02:33.750> one<00:02:34.520> so<00:02:35.520> you<00:02:35.610> can<00:02:35.670> see

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
here's a platoon at one so you can see

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.010 
here's a platoon at one so you can see
what<00:02:35.940> happens<00:02:36.270> when<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.570> move<00:02:36.690> back<00:02:36.750> and

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
what happens when you move back and

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.870 
what happens when you move back and
forth<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.380> can<00:02:37.500> see<00:02:37.709> we<00:02:38.220> see<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.459> fills<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.790> up

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
forth you can see we see it fills it up

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.520 
forth you can see we see it fills it up
a<00:02:38.970> bit<00:02:39.000> more<00:02:39.330> or<00:02:39.800> yeah<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.830> little<00:02:41.070> less<00:02:42.530> pull

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
a bit more or yeah a little less pull

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.460 
a bit more or yeah a little less pull
down<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.709> little<00:02:43.980> bit<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:45.540> ratio<00:02:45.989> you<00:02:46.260> move

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
down a little bit the ratio you move

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.550 
down a little bit the ratio you move
this<00:02:46.590> up<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:46.800> down<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.160> can<00:02:47.190> really<00:02:47.459> see<00:02:48.560> how

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
this up and down you can really see how

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.370 
this up and down you can really see how
it<00:02:49.590> affects<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.430> clown's<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.750> keep<00:02:52.230> this<00:02:52.320> a

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
it affects the clown's and keep this a

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.500 
it affects the clown's and keep this a
lower<00:02:52.650> ratio<00:02:53.480> this<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.570> frequency<00:02:55.080> ratio

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
lower ratio this is frequency ratio

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.580 
lower ratio this is frequency ratio
changing<00:02:57.510> with<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:57.840> shows<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.380> just<00:02:58.410> how

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
changing with this shows you just how

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.070 
changing with this shows you just how
much<00:02:58.830> more<00:02:59.040> noisy<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.610> cloud<00:02:59.820> becomes<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:01.019> if

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
much more noisy the cloud becomes so if

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.570 
much more noisy the cloud becomes so if
you're<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.290> way<00:03:01.380> we<00:03:01.500> want<00:03:01.680> those<00:03:01.860> clods<00:03:02.340> where

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
you're the way we want those clods where

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.130 
you're the way we want those clods where
everything's<00:03:03.060> kind<00:03:03.239> of<00:03:03.269> broken<00:03:03.780> up<00:03:03.870> in<00:03:03.989> tiny

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
everything's kind of broken up in tiny

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.560 
everything's kind of broken up in tiny
pieces<00:03:04.320> you<00:03:04.620> can<00:03:04.739> pull<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:04.980> all<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.070> way<00:03:05.160> up

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
pieces you can pull it all the way up

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.850 
pieces you can pull it all the way up
for<00:03:06.570> my<00:03:06.690> second<00:03:06.989> we<00:03:07.050> can<00:03:07.200> keep<00:03:07.350> it<00:03:07.530> where<00:03:07.709> it's

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
for my second we can keep it where it's

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.030 
for my second we can keep it where it's
at<00:03:07.980> right<00:03:08.250> now<00:03:08.519> there's<00:03:09.360> depth<00:03:09.660> max<00:03:10.019> I<00:03:10.380> think

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
at right now there's depth max I think

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.580 
at right now there's depth max I think
about<00:03:11.160> how<00:03:11.280> thick<00:03:11.610> these<00:03:11.760> things<00:03:12.060> get<00:03:12.590> there

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
about how thick these things get there

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.910 
about how thick these things get there
we<00:03:13.680> go<00:03:13.860> which<00:03:14.040> are<00:03:14.190> not<00:03:14.280> inflection<00:03:14.940> and

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
we go which are not inflection and

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.289 
we go which are not inflection and
they're<00:03:16.920> Yuri<00:03:17.250> have<00:03:17.489> these<00:03:17.760> clouds<00:03:18.060> look

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
they're Yuri have these clouds look

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:25.320 
they're Yuri have these clouds look
pretty<00:03:18.630> cool<00:03:18.989> pretty<00:03:19.650> realistic

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.560 

so<00:03:26.170> these<00:03:26.560> selected<00:03:27.040> I<00:03:27.370> can<00:03:27.700> also<00:03:27.940> go<00:03:28.390> down

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
so these selected I can also go down

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.870 
so these selected I can also go down
here<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.020> then<00:03:29.140> there's<00:03:29.470> texture<00:03:29.860> time<00:03:30.190> and

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
here and then there's texture time and

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.710 
here and then there's texture time and
this<00:03:30.940> is<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.090> one<00:03:31.210> you<00:03:31.330> want<00:03:31.450> to<00:03:31.510> animate

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
this is the one you want to animate

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.120 
this is the one you want to animate
because<00:03:32.080> if<00:03:32.200> I'm<00:03:32.290> moving<00:03:32.470> this<00:03:32.740> you<00:03:32.860> can<00:03:32.980> see

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
because if I'm moving this you can see

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.120 
because if I'm moving this you can see
how<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.340> clouds<00:03:33.700> is<00:03:33.940> kind<00:03:34.150> of<00:03:34.500> formed<00:03:35.500> by

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
how the clouds is kind of formed by

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.050 
how the clouds is kind of formed by
default<00:03:36.640> it<00:03:37.030> kind<00:03:37.330> of<00:03:37.390> stays<00:03:37.570> in<00:03:37.750> place<00:03:39.060> so

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
default it kind of stays in place so

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.580 
default it kind of stays in place so
we'll<00:03:40.180> right-click<00:03:40.450> on<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:40.930> I'm<00:03:41.230> gonna<00:03:41.320> create

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
we'll right-click on it I'm gonna create

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.820 
we'll right-click on it I'm gonna create
a<00:03:41.680> new<00:03:41.800> expression<00:03:43.530> here's<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.590> little

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
a new expression here's a little

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.770 
a new expression here's a little
expression<00:03:45.100> dialog<00:03:45.580> box<00:03:45.850> we<00:03:46.060> take<00:03:46.300> this<00:03:46.420> like

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
expression dialog box we take this like

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.150 
expression dialog box we take this like
this<00:03:46.960> middle<00:03:47.290> mouse<00:03:47.440> to<00:03:47.560> drag<00:03:47.710> it<00:03:47.860> down<00:03:48.010> to

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
this middle mouse to drag it down to

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.820 
this middle mouse to drag it down to
your<00:03:48.250> expression<00:03:48.670> box<00:03:49.410> I'm<00:03:50.410> gonna<00:03:50.620> make<00:03:50.740> it

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
your expression box I'm gonna make it

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.180 
your expression box I'm gonna make it
equal<00:03:51.070> to<00:03:51.100> time<00:03:52.410> let's<00:03:53.410> see<00:03:53.560> what<00:03:53.680> happens<00:03:54.070> I

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
equal to time let's see what happens I

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.150 
equal to time let's see what happens I
might<00:03:54.310> click<00:03:54.550> create<00:03:54.910> and<00:03:55.900> I'm<00:03:56.320> gonna<00:03:56.410> make

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
might click create and I'm gonna make

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.660 
might click create and I'm gonna make
this<00:03:57.340> let's<00:03:57.760> say<00:03:57.850> 500<00:03:58.330> frames<00:03:58.480> or<00:03:58.690> cell<00:03:59.670> it's

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
this let's say 500 frames or cell it's

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.550 
this let's say 500 frames or cell it's
moving<00:04:00.970> pretty<00:04:01.000> fast<00:04:01.540> that's<00:04:02.200> kind<00:04:02.500> of

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
moving pretty fast that's kind of

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.670 
moving pretty fast that's kind of
unrealistic<00:04:03.270> so<00:04:04.270> what<00:04:04.690> I<00:04:04.720> want<00:04:04.870> to<00:04:04.930> do<00:04:05.080> is<00:04:05.380> slow

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
unrealistic so what I want to do is slow

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.860 
unrealistic so what I want to do is slow
that<00:04:05.860> down<00:04:06.240> almost<00:04:07.240> have<00:04:07.330> wet<00:04:07.480> best<00:04:07.690> way<00:04:07.810> to

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
that down almost have wet best way to

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.990 
that down almost have wet best way to
slow<00:04:08.110> things<00:04:08.500> down<00:04:08.680> just<00:04:09.040> divide<00:04:09.610> it<00:04:09.790> I'm

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
slow things down just divide it I'm

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.420 
slow things down just divide it I'm
gonna<00:04:10.150> say<00:04:10.240> divided<00:04:10.720> by<00:04:10.780> 7<00:04:11.170> or<00:04:11.260> something<00:04:11.430> at

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430

that<00:04:12.790> close<00:04:14.250> and<00:04:15.250> there<00:04:15.400> we<00:04:15.520> go<00:04:15.700> a<00:04:15.970> lot<00:04:16.420> more

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
that close and there we go a lot more

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.599 
that close and there we go a lot more
realistic<00:04:17.109> of<00:04:17.530> course<00:04:18.040> you<00:04:18.130> can<00:04:18.250> change<00:04:18.430> it

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
realistic of course you can change it

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.960 
realistic of course you can change it
based<00:04:18.760> on<00:04:19.049> how<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.109> want<00:04:20.560> your<00:04:20.950> clouds<00:04:21.790> to

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
based on how you want your clouds to

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.670 
based on how you want your clouds to
move<00:04:22.150> if<00:04:22.420> you<00:04:22.510> want<00:04:22.600> that<00:04:22.810> really<00:04:22.930> fast<00:04:23.320> time

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
move if you want that really fast time

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.040 
move if you want that really fast time
based<00:04:24.070> stuff<00:04:24.340> that<00:04:24.490> you<00:04:24.580> bring<00:04:25.030> up<00:04:25.180> bring<00:04:25.990> this

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
based stuff that you bring up bring this

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.590 
based stuff that you bring up bring this
up<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:26.380> make<00:04:26.530> it<00:04:26.560> equal<00:04:27.100> to<00:04:27.250> exactly<00:04:27.490> time<00:04:28.000> I

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.580 

can<00:04:31.600> render<00:04:32.470> this<00:04:32.620> out<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:35.050> see<00:04:35.230> how<00:04:35.320> it<00:04:35.410> looks

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
can render this out you see how it looks

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.760 
can render this out you see how it looks
like<00:04:35.940> it's<00:04:36.940> pretty<00:04:37.150> cool<00:04:37.560> another<00:04:38.560> thing<00:04:38.710> I

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
like it's pretty cool another thing I

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.680 
like it's pretty cool another thing I
want<00:04:38.890> to<00:04:38.950> add<00:04:39.070> is<00:04:39.370> self<00:04:39.910> shadowing<00:04:40.360> so<00:04:40.480> I<00:04:40.540> go<00:04:40.630> to

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
want to add is self shadowing so I go to

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.360 
want to add is self shadowing so I go to
lighting<00:04:41.050> self<00:04:41.620> shadow<00:04:41.860> this<00:04:42.040> thing<00:04:42.220> so

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
lighting self shadow this thing so

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.730 
lighting self shadow this thing so
there's<00:04:42.550> a<00:04:42.610> bit<00:04:42.910> more<00:04:42.940> shadow<00:04:43.419> casting<00:04:43.870> listen

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
there's a bit more shadow casting listen

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.580 
there's a bit more shadow casting listen
looks<00:04:45.580> kind<00:04:45.790> of<00:04:45.820> fake<00:04:46.030> that<00:04:46.240> way

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.430 

we<00:04:51.550> go<00:04:51.639> we<00:04:51.760> rendered<00:04:52.030> it<00:04:52.150> again<00:04:52.389> looks<00:04:53.080> a<00:04:53.169> lot

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
we go we rendered it again looks a lot

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.050 
we go we rendered it again looks a lot
more<00:04:53.590> realistic<00:04:54.810> you<00:04:56.250> can<00:04:57.250> also<00:04:57.520> render<00:04:57.880> this

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
more realistic you can also render this

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.850 
more realistic you can also render this
in<00:04:58.360> mental<00:04:58.810> ray<00:04:58.990> it<00:04:59.230> does<00:04:59.350> not<00:04:59.500> have<00:04:59.650> to<00:04:59.740> be

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
in mental ray it does not have to be

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.409 
in mental ray it does not have to be
done<00:05:00.040> in<00:05:00.070> Maya<00:05:00.340> software<00:05:00.760> so<00:05:01.150> you<00:05:01.240> can<00:05:01.330> go

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
done in Maya software so you can go

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:08.960 
done in Maya software so you can go
mental<00:05:01.750> ray<00:05:03.090> quality<00:05:04.090> and<00:05:04.300> new<00:05:04.450> production

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.460 

make<00:05:09.970> this<00:05:10.150> up<00:05:10.360> a<00:05:10.419> little<00:05:10.570> bit<00:05:10.750> higher<00:05:10.960> 1k

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
make this up a little bit higher 1k

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:19.629 
make this up a little bit higher 1k
square

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.249 

and<00:05:20.120> there<00:05:20.300> you<00:05:20.449> go<00:05:20.569> some<00:05:20.870> very<00:05:21.050> basic<00:05:21.590> clouds

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
and there you go some very basic clouds

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.420 
and there you go some very basic clouds
depend<00:05:24.259> on<00:05:24.319> the<00:05:24.409> angle<00:05:24.590> your<00:05:25.069> lighting<00:05:25.370> and

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
depend on the angle your lighting and

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.890 
depend on the angle your lighting and
everything<00:05:25.580> can<00:05:26.000> change<00:05:26.030> how<00:05:26.539> the<00:05:26.599> clouds

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
everything can change how the clouds

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.179 
everything can change how the clouds
react<00:05:27.349> and<00:05:27.590> how<00:05:27.620> will<00:05:27.949> look<00:05:28.159> I<00:05:29.919> press<00:05:30.919> play<00:05:31.069> a

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:31.189 
react and how will look I press play a

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:33.939 
react and how will look I press play a
little<00:05:31.490> bit<00:05:31.930> you'll<00:05:32.930> find<00:05:33.229> exactly<00:05:33.590> when<00:05:33.800> you

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
little bit you'll find exactly when you

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:42.149 
little bit you'll find exactly when you
like<00:05:34.129> it<00:05:34.810> render<00:05:35.810> again<00:05:38.889> there<00:05:39.889> you<00:05:39.979> go<00:05:40.099> clouds

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 
like it render again there you go clouds

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:44.619 
like it render again there you go clouds
you're<00:05:43.159> inside<00:05:43.520> and<00:05:43.729> really<00:05:43.849> play<00:05:44.330> with<00:05:44.479> any

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:44.629 
you're inside and really play with any

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:47.379 
you're inside and really play with any
of<00:05:44.689> these<00:05:44.900> and<00:05:45.259> see<00:05:45.830> what<00:05:45.979> you<00:05:46.340> can<00:05:46.490> get<00:05:46.699> so<00:05:47.330> if

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
of these and see what you can get so if

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:52.029 
of these and see what you can get so if
I<00:05:47.479> break<00:05:47.659> this<00:05:47.840> up<00:05:50.500> you<00:05:51.500> can<00:05:51.590> see<00:05:51.830> how<00:05:51.979> the

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
I break this up you can see how the

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.670 
I break this up you can see how the
clouds<00:05:52.639> start<00:05:53.389> looking<00:05:53.960> a<00:05:54.050> bit<00:05:54.199> more<00:05:54.409> broken

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
clouds start looking a bit more broken

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.700 
clouds start looking a bit more broken
up<00:05:55.330> just<00:05:56.330> be<00:05:56.419> careful<00:05:56.779> maybe<00:05:56.990> put<00:05:57.229> too<00:05:57.349> much<00:05:57.529> it

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
up just be careful maybe put too much it

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.740 
up just be careful maybe put too much it
looks<00:05:57.740> kind<00:05:58.009> of<00:05:58.039> fake<00:05:58.270> so<00:05:59.270> be<00:05:59.360> careful<00:05:59.689> with

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
looks kind of fake so be careful with

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.409 
looks kind of fake so be careful with
your<00:05:59.900> values<00:06:01.060> this<00:06:02.060> is<00:06:02.150> a<00:06:02.210> four<00:06:04.120> you<00:06:05.120> can<00:06:05.240> tell

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
your values this is a four you can tell

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:06.670 
your values this is a four you can tell
the<00:06:05.509> friender<00:06:05.779> times<00:06:05.990> four<00:06:06.229> this<00:06:06.319> is<00:06:06.379> austere

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
the friender times four this is austere

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.929 
the friender times four this is austere
actually<00:06:07.039> pretty<00:06:07.279> good<00:06:07.490> too

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:07.939 
actually pretty good too

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:10.300 
actually pretty good too
not<00:06:08.090> bad<00:06:08.300> at<00:06:08.449> all<00:06:08.539> this<00:06:09.469> looks<00:06:09.680> a<00:06:09.740> lot<00:06:10.039> more

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
not bad at all this looks a lot more

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.339 
not bad at all this looks a lot more
realistic<00:06:13.569> just<00:06:14.569> play<00:06:14.810> with<00:06:14.870> your<00:06:14.960> settings

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:15.349 
realistic just play with your settings

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:17.499 
realistic just play with your settings
you<00:06:15.529> can<00:06:15.620> get<00:06:15.710> something<00:06:16.009> really<00:06:16.340> neat<00:06:16.669> you

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
you can get something really neat you

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:18.790 
you can get something really neat you
can<00:06:17.539> also<00:06:17.689> give<00:06:17.960> these<00:06:18.110> things<00:06:18.289> color<00:06:18.560> if<00:06:18.710> you

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
can also give these things color if you

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.779 
can also give these things color if you
want<00:06:19.009> if<00:06:19.099> you<00:06:19.159> don't<00:06:19.279> like<00:06:19.370> the<00:06:19.460> white<00:06:19.610> clouds

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:19.789 
want if you don't like the white clouds

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:23.409 
want if you don't like the white clouds
you<00:06:20.629> can<00:06:20.750> always<00:06:20.870> go<00:06:21.080> through<00:06:22.120> and<00:06:23.120> play<00:06:23.300> with

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
you can always go through and play with

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:26.650 
you can always go through and play with
every<00:06:23.719> little<00:06:23.930> aspect<00:06:24.050> of<00:06:24.440> this
