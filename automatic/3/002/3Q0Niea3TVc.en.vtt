00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.670
 Hi, I'm Amanda and we'll see how to do 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.599
 a rosette with decorative scissors 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:19.000
 we need different paper strips 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.000
 decorative sizes and scissors 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.280
 let's cut one of the edges of 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.280
 our paper strips 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.950
 ah 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 and 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.629
 and once we have it ready we are going to 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.670
 mark the folds let's mark one 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.559
 every half centimeter 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.850
 I will now use the table 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.850
 folding of martha steward 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.650
 but if you do not have a folding table 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.360
 you just have to mark half 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.270
 centimeter on each side of the strip 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.790
 paper and join with the rule to do the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.560
 folds you can use a folder or 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.310
 if you do not have enough with a knife 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.310
 round tip 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.200
 i 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.689
 once we have all the marks made 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.909
 we started doubling we doubled the first 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.579
 forward the second one back 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.619
 the third one again forward and the 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.579
 fourth backwards and so on until 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.579
 we finish the whole row 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.550
 and we have this accordion now what 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.260
 we have to do is join the two 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.190
 ends of the paper strip with a 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.190
 little bit of glue 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.780
 Now let's join the circle in a 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.460
 central point for the part where you do not 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.159
 we have used decorative scissors 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.159
 we press and we have the rosette 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.640
 we are going to close the flower using a 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.860
 circle like the one I'm going to die 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.990
 now you can make it bigger more 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.340
 small as you like, I'm going to paste it 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.340
 using hot silicone 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.690
 and here we have the first recipe 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.100
 finished now let's do the 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.080
 next and how I want it to be more 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.870
 small I have decided to take away a 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.020
 centimeter thick so in the end it goes 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.520
 to be 20 by 2 centimeters and the process 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.960
 is exactly the same as we have done 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.600
 before 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.170
 to 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.170
 here 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.040
 i 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.720
 Y 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.340
 and you're ready, you have two recipes for 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.840
 use in your projects now 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.830
 let's see how to make a label 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.830
 using one of them 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.459
 as you can see one of the soft ones that 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.980
 it has stayed well stamped so I'm going 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:05.019
 to try to fix it by applying ink and 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.019
 powders only in the central area 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.690
 Y 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.790
 and I have not gotten it very well 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.079
 but you 'll see that it's going to give a little 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.079
 same because in the end you will not see 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.000
 min 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.450
 people 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.520
 and 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.990
 Y 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.830
 and that's how my label has been 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.419
 I hope you liked the tutorial and 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.610

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.930

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.460
