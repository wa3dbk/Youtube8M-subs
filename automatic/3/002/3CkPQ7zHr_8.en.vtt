00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.959
 closed 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.110
 congratulates new vitesse trainer 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.269
 the most important question is first of all 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.380
 how long have you signed for two 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.580
 year 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.490
 and what made you decide to 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.770
 because I have a huge challenge 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.930
 this job see the club that tim it nice 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.610
 on the road in recent years and like me 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.860
 you compare that with honest lesson 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.640
 of course more options also in terms of 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.770
 players to go a little higher 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.579
 play and you go that challenge with I go 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.320
 go 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.100
 you have included in that cruise as 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.500
 assistant 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.789
 is very important for yes and there is 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.170
 important to me because we are already working 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.760
 together for a long time, I know what I'm wearing 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.699
 and i also think he's an added 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.769
 value is on my qualities and ours 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.109
 division of roles with Heracles is out 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.010
 it has been excellent and I am assuming 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.019
 we think the same 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.460
 division of roles here also with vitesse salad 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.960
 you already have with the other staff members 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.879
 spoken this week before the first 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.100
 training today would start yes two days 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.960
 we came together a while ago 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.519
 briefly presented my ideas 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.990
 explained how I am used to working 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.060
 then of course also know how here in it 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.170
 People have worked in the past 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.880
 get to know a little but we will 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.650
 in the first weeks of preparation 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.760
 we will get to know each other better and 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.050
 Ultimately it all well 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.400
 to coordinate each other because one thing knows 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.170
 I'm sure I'll need their hearts 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.730
 of course you have knowledge this morning 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.140
 made with the selection but know you 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.550
 of course some players already from it 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.440
 yes you honor whoever wrote I know you 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.620
 which players are stuck between that 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.150
 is your how you look at it i selection 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.100
 I know most of the players there 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.480
 even the youth players in general 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.490
 well because i am here because my son 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.240
 of course also the football here 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.290
 boys and all have followed in youth 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.390
 to the selection of those complete present 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.950
 five players are coming back 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.320
 a 10 days 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.460
 so in that sense its not yet complete and 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.580
 I am assuming that there is also one 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.510
 number of boys will recover 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.740
 but well you know that completely 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.180
 no problem it's nice to be correct too 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.350
 to see those young boys for a while and 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.940
 to get to know 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.220
 and the boys who will be there 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.870
 continue to be conditional too 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.250
 able to work and that we can meet again 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.750
 what can get to know 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.070
 However , there will be first training on Sunday 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.450
 the first open training on the program 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.530
 where is a practice match on Saturday 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.850
 you already have a field today 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.259
 stood 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.360
 how do you see this preparation direction 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.590
 and August is the Europe 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.450
 league match 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.069
 well like any preparation in it 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.269
 season and you have to learn each other 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.950
 know for sure if a trainer is new 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.360
 this with the qualities of the players 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.530
 get to know if you want quality on one 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.180
 no you have estimated correctly you go 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.470
 way of playing you are going to determine because me 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.580
 find that actually always depends on the 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.440
 players you have at your disposal 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.879
 and then it will have to work very hard 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.260
 Work to that afterwards and before you do it 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.580
 know it is an August and as a state 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.290
 of course the first important 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.120
 contest on the program so we will 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.160
 make good use of this time and around 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.120
 getting to know each other and our way 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.129
 to determine the level of play 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.530
 you are so good player of vitesse odor 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.940
 first you look back on that period 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.170
 yes that is of course one for me 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.250
 very great i say that is against 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.630
 other people it's just like you 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.980
 first girl you never forget 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.260
 more vitesse was my first paid 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.910
 club and I am here in the A youth 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.769
 come to monk houses 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.269
 played as the first yes saartje for a year 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.250
 it may be in play for another year 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.870
 and already went to the team and 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.220
 and and after two and three games of government 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.069
 to go to the a-selection bank for three years 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.480
 played it first so yes like from 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.769
 for most boys it was also my dream 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.060
 to become a professional footballer and if you 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.670
 which then ended at vitesse knows 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.680
 yes then that is mine 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.230
 first girl say we're in 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.250
 your office at this new accommodation 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.840
 for vitens it is not yet over or via 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.359
 of course also group yes you think that 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.799
 so first impression of the building 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:24.230
 Well what appeals to me is that vitesse 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.910
 be at the forefront of development like it 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.590
 is about training accommodation 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.170
 many can watch the entire country and there 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.359
 This type of accommodation is there there 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.340
 it actually so that every major club and 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.930
 own training accommodation often 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.120
 far away from the city where they are 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.590
 play completely isolated 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.239
 Well well fancy here Papendal fish 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.980
 which were accessible to people 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.169
 facilities are great just have on 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.700
 can train on great fields and 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.319
 the building where we are now, of course, 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.970
 also unique in the Netherlands 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.569
 do they have a head start on the 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.569
 competitors
