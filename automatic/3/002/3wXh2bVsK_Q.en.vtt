00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
they tell me about this incredible work

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.870 
they tell me about this incredible work
the<00:03:25.090> idea<00:03:25.120> here<00:03:25.720> is<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.380> study<00:03:26.880> biodiversity

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
the idea here is to a study biodiversity

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.059 
the idea here is to a study biodiversity
I<00:03:28.030> mean<00:03:28.299> all<00:03:28.569> the<00:03:28.780> individuals<00:03:29.470> that<00:03:29.650> live<00:03:29.890> in

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
I mean all the individuals that live in

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.860 
I mean all the individuals that live in
the<00:03:30.160> forest<00:03:30.190> I<00:03:30.609> mean<00:03:30.640> water<00:03:31.060> flies<00:03:31.390> and<00:03:31.660> mouth

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
the forest I mean water flies and mouth

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.979 
the forest I mean water flies and mouth
so<00:03:32.109> the<00:03:32.470> idea<00:03:32.709> is<00:03:32.799> to<00:03:32.829> study<00:03:33.370> Pilar<00:03:34.359> be<00:03:34.540> the

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
so the idea is to study Pilar be the

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.890 
so the idea is to study Pilar be the
eggs<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.590> pupae<00:03:35.980> and<00:03:36.190> also<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.880> adults<00:03:37.180> so

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
eggs the pupae and also the adults so

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.150 
eggs the pupae and also the adults so
why<00:03:38.019> is<00:03:38.079> it<00:03:38.170> so<00:03:38.410> important<00:03:38.739> to<00:03:38.799> study<00:03:38.950> these

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
why is it so important to study these

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.069 
why is it so important to study these
butterflies<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:39.940> moths<00:03:40.120> why<00:03:41.019> is

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
butterflies and moths why is

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.020 
butterflies and moths why is
biodiversity<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:41.950> important<00:03:42.340> in<00:03:42.549> the<00:03:42.880> grand

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
biodiversity so important in the grand

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.180 
biodiversity so important in the grand
scheme<00:03:43.299> of<00:03:43.480> things<00:03:43.630> if<00:03:44.079> one<00:03:44.410> of<00:03:44.530> these<00:03:44.680> moths

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
scheme of things if one of these moths

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.979 
scheme of things if one of these moths
was<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.579> go<00:03:45.670> extinct<00:03:46.180> what<00:03:46.720> does<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:46.900> really

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
was to go extinct what does it really

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:47.370 
was to go extinct what does it really
matter

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
matter

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.009 
matter
well<00:03:48.310> for<00:03:48.519> example<00:03:48.940> we<00:03:49.090> are<00:03:49.120> in<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.450> tropics

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
well for example we are in the tropics

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.259 
well for example we are in the tropics
and<00:03:50.319> your<00:03:50.560> tropics<00:03:50.980> is<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.340> richest<00:03:51.730> place<00:03:52.060> in

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
and your tropics is the richest place in

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.629 
and your tropics is the richest place in
the<00:03:52.359> world<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:53.019> induce<00:03:53.260> to<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.530> insects<00:03:53.950> so<00:03:54.519> in

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
the world to induce to the insects so in

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.550 
the world to induce to the insects so in
this<00:03:54.760> case<00:03:55.000> for<00:03:55.329> for<00:03:55.660> us<00:03:55.780> in<00:03:55.989> Peru<00:03:56.139> is<00:03:56.380> very

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
this case for for us in Peru is very

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.099 
this case for for us in Peru is very
important<00:03:57.220> first<00:03:57.519> to<00:03:58.090> understand<00:03:58.690> which

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
important first to understand which

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.680 
important first to understand which
species<00:03:59.470> occurs<00:04:00.010> in<00:04:00.160> Costa<00:04:00.459> Rica<00:04:00.819> because<00:04:01.359> you

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
species occurs in Costa Rica because you

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.809 
species occurs in Costa Rica because you
can<00:04:01.900> not<00:04:02.200> talk<00:04:02.560> about<00:04:02.769> extinction<00:04:03.340> if<00:04:03.639> you

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
can not talk about extinction if you

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.629 
can not talk about extinction if you
don't<00:04:04.030> really<00:04:04.359> understand<00:04:04.989> what<00:04:05.639> organism

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
don't really understand what organism

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.940 
don't really understand what organism
live<00:04:06.880> in<00:04:07.120> one<00:04:07.359> a<00:04:07.540> specific<00:04:08.019> place<00:04:08.260> so<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.739> idea

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
live in one a specific place so the idea

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.180 
live in one a specific place so the idea
is<00:04:09.040> to<00:04:09.069> first<00:04:09.850> a<00:04:10.150> knows<00:04:10.750> all<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.739> species<00:04:11.980> that

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
is to first a knows all the species that

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.520 
is to first a knows all the species that
occurs<00:04:12.609> in<00:04:12.760> via<00:04:12.910> Lanka<00:04:13.329> then<00:04:13.750> we<00:04:13.989> can<00:04:14.170> start

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
occurs in via Lanka then we can start

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.500 
occurs in via Lanka then we can start
detecting<00:04:15.130> that<00:04:15.579> kind<00:04:15.819> of<00:04:15.910> particularities

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
detecting that kind of particularities

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.610 
detecting that kind of particularities
you're<00:04:17.229> an<00:04:17.320> entomologist<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.070> you

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
you're an entomologist and you

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.379 
you're an entomologist and you
you<00:04:18.680> study<00:04:18.949> here<00:04:19.250> but<00:04:19.609> what's<00:04:19.910> like<00:04:20.090> having<00:04:20.329> a

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
you study here but what's like having a

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.610 
you study here but what's like having a
hotel<00:04:20.780> right<00:04:20.989> here<00:04:21.169> also

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
hotel right here also

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.379 
hotel right here also
well<00:04:21.859> for<00:04:22.100> example<00:04:22.190> for<00:04:22.699> us<00:04:22.850> is<00:04:23.030> a<00:04:23.060> really

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
well for example for us is a really

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.020 
well for example for us is a really
interesting<00:04:23.810> experience<00:04:24.680> because<00:04:25.250> we<00:04:25.760> share

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
interesting experience because we share

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.909 
interesting experience because we share
our<00:04:26.240> information<00:04:26.449> with<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.440> -<00:04:27.590> with<00:04:27.830> the

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
our information with the - with the

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.620 
our information with the - with the
tourists<00:04:28.310> so<00:04:28.610> I<00:04:28.639> think<00:04:28.729> is<00:04:28.970> a<00:04:29.000> really<00:04:29.270> nice

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
tourists so I think is a really nice

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.010 
tourists so I think is a really nice
example<00:04:30.530> of<00:04:30.680> how<00:04:31.330> scientists<00:04:32.330> can<00:04:32.630> share

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
example of how scientists can share

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.320 
example of how scientists can share
information<00:04:33.710> with<00:04:33.830> people<00:04:34.220> so<00:04:35.000> what<00:04:35.150> is<00:04:35.240> all

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
information with people so what is all

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.680 
information with people so what is all
this<00:04:35.449> you<00:04:35.600> got<00:04:35.750> here<00:04:35.930> show<00:04:36.110> me<00:04:36.229> something<00:04:37.690> we

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
this you got here show me something we

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.680 
this you got here show me something we
are<00:04:39.020> going<00:04:39.680> out<00:04:39.860> to<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.580> field<00:04:40.940> and<00:04:41.180> we

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
are going out to the field and we

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.780 
are going out to the field and we
collect<00:04:42.050> all<00:04:42.229> the<00:04:42.410> larvae<00:04:42.830> in<00:04:43.070> this<00:04:43.370> case<00:04:43.610> this

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
collect all the larvae in this case this

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.300 
collect all the larvae in this case this
is<00:04:43.850> a<00:04:43.970> nice<00:04:44.300> out<00:04:44.570> format<00:04:45.020> in<00:04:45.139> small<00:04:45.500> use<00:04:46.160> that

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
is a nice out format in small use that

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.150 
is a nice out format in small use that
is<00:04:46.550> a<00:04:46.610> big<00:04:47.060> I'm<00:04:47.360> larvae<00:04:47.930> so<00:04:48.290> from<00:04:48.770> this<00:04:48.949> stage

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
is a big I'm larvae so from this stage

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.830 
is a big I'm larvae so from this stage
then<00:04:49.400> what<00:04:49.520> happens<00:04:49.820> once<00:04:50.120> it<00:04:50.300> yes<00:04:50.810> for

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
then what happens once it yes for

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.090 
then what happens once it yes for
example<00:04:51.490> we're<00:04:52.490> going<00:04:52.699> to<00:04:52.789> obtain<00:04:53.650> an<00:04:54.650> adult

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
example we're going to obtain an adult

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.330 
example we're going to obtain an adult
like<00:04:55.610> this<00:04:55.940> so<00:04:56.449> this<00:04:56.720> this<00:04:57.440> lower<00:04:57.770> bound<00:04:57.949> Arva

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
like this so this this lower bound Arva

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.060 
like this so this this lower bound Arva
turns<00:04:58.639> into<00:04:58.789> a<00:04:59.060> small<00:04:59.330> yes<00:04:59.840> that's<00:05:00.470> incredible

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
turns into a small yes that's incredible

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.820 
turns into a small yes that's incredible
it's<00:05:01.250> so<00:05:01.490> furry<00:05:01.900> in<00:05:02.900> this<00:05:03.050> case<00:05:03.260> we<00:05:03.440> are<00:05:03.470> really

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
it's so furry in this case we are really

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.640 
it's so furry in this case we are really
interesting<00:05:04.430> in<00:05:04.780> generating<00:05:05.780> information

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
interesting in generating information

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.000 
interesting in generating information
about<00:05:07.160> all<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:07.729> relations<00:05:08.300> that<00:05:09.010> butterflies

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
about all the relations that butterflies

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.460 
about all the relations that butterflies
and<00:05:10.160> moths<00:05:10.340> have<00:05:10.789> has<00:05:11.240> with<00:05:11.539> order<00:05:11.870> organisms

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
and moths have has with order organisms

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.409 
and moths have has with order organisms
in<00:05:12.650> this<00:05:13.039> case<00:05:13.310> for<00:05:13.550> example<00:05:13.910> if<00:05:14.030> we<00:05:14.180> stood

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
in this case for example if we stood

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.150 
in this case for example if we stood
this<00:05:14.720> large<00:05:15.020> we're<00:05:15.560> going<00:05:15.800> to<00:05:15.919> obtain

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
this large we're going to obtain

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.790 
this large we're going to obtain
information<00:05:16.400> about<00:05:16.940> the<00:05:17.690> host<00:05:17.930> plant<00:05:18.260> the

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
information about the host plant the

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.500 
information about the host plant the
plot<00:05:19.070> in<00:05:19.250> which<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.580> larvae<00:05:19.880> used<00:05:20.090> to<00:05:20.210> feed<00:05:20.360> on

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
plot in which the larvae used to feed on

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.300 
plot in which the larvae used to feed on
then<00:05:21.080> we<00:05:21.229> clean<00:05:21.440> up<00:05:21.590> we<00:05:21.830> can<00:05:21.979> obtain

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
then we clean up we can obtain

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.170 
then we clean up we can obtain
parasitoids

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
parasitoids

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.320 
parasitoids
flies<00:05:23.570> and<00:05:23.990> wasps<00:05:24.830> that<00:05:25.130> used<00:05:25.310> to<00:05:25.460> fit<00:05:25.729> on<00:05:26.000> the

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
flies and wasps that used to fit on the

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.570 
flies and wasps that used to fit on the
color<00:05:26.510> dealer<00:05:26.810> so<00:05:27.410> for<00:05:27.560> example<00:05:27.979> if<00:05:28.280> you<00:05:28.400> have

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
color dealer so for example if you have

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.210 
color dealer so for example if you have
a<00:05:28.610> crop<00:05:29.240> puts<00:05:29.750> on<00:05:29.930> plant<00:05:30.200> you<00:05:30.620> can<00:05:30.770> use<00:05:30.979> that

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
a crop puts on plant you can use that

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.330 
a crop puts on plant you can use that
wraps<00:05:31.910> or<00:05:32.240> flies<00:05:32.780> to<00:05:33.080> do<00:05:33.229> biological<00:05:33.889> control

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
wraps or flies to do biological control

want to be protected so they looks like

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.740 
want to be protected so they looks like
a<00:06:12.470> pig<00:06:12.800> organism<00:06:13.490> and<00:06:13.699> at<00:06:13.789> the<00:06:13.910> same<00:06:14.120> time<00:06:14.360> they

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
a pig organism and at the same time they

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.450 
a pig organism and at the same time they
do<00:06:14.810> it<00:06:15.020> for<00:06:15.169> thermal<00:06:15.500> regulation<00:06:15.860> to<00:06:16.280> keep

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
do it for thermal regulation to keep

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.960 
do it for thermal regulation to keep
warmer<00:06:16.849> together<00:06:17.360> how<00:06:17.750> hairy<00:06:18.080> there

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
warmer together how hairy there

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.230 
warmer together how hairy there
those<00:06:19.690> are<00:06:19.900> some<00:06:20.020> hairy<00:06:20.200> mas<00:06:21.000> let<00:06:22.000> there<00:06:22.210> be

wow this is the trap yes this is idea is
attract<00:06:26.800> the<00:06:26.950> mob<00:06:27.160> to<00:06:27.430> the<00:06:27.580> light<00:06:27.790> and<00:06:28.030> they

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
attract the mob to the light and they

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.080 
attract the mob to the light and they
rest<00:06:29.050> on<00:06:29.470> the<00:06:29.950> on<00:06:30.220> the<00:06:30.340> plateau<00:06:30.550> fern<00:06:30.850> and

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090 
rest on the on the plateau fern and

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.690 
rest on the on the plateau fern and
that's<00:06:31.420> it<00:06:31.600> and<00:06:31.780> then<00:06:32.110> we<00:06:32.320> can<00:06:32.530> see<00:06:33.010> it<00:06:33.190> we<00:06:33.490> can

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 
that's it and then we can see it we can

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.240 
that's it and then we can see it we can
collect<00:06:34.060> it<00:06:34.270> and<00:06:34.450> we<00:06:34.630> can<00:06:34.780> Institute<00:06:35.020> it<00:06:35.250> okay

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
collect it and we can Institute it okay

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.640 
collect it and we can Institute it okay
