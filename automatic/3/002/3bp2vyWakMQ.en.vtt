00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
one really 69 million every hour every

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.710 
one really 69 million every hour every
time<00:02:50.520> I<00:02:50.550> go<00:02:50.730> on<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.910> though<00:02:51.060> which<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.480> can<00:02:51.600> keep

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
time I go on it though which I can keep

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.260 
time I go on it though which I can keep
going<00:02:51.780> on<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.230> off<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:52.350> I'm<00:02:52.680> off<00:02:53.060> get<00:02:54.060> loads

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
going on and off and I'm off get loads

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.190 
going on and off and I'm off get loads
and<00:02:54.420> loads<00:02:54.480> which<00:02:55.050> I've<00:02:55.170> done<00:02:55.380> quite<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:56.310> bit

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
and loads which I've done quite a bit

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.340 
and loads which I've done quite a bit
should<00:02:58.200> why<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.380> got<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:58.680> much<00:02:59.630> and<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:00.870> quickly

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
should why I got so much and so quickly

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.930 
should why I got so much and so quickly
and<00:03:01.500> it's<00:03:01.650> not<00:03:01.830> been<00:03:02.070> that<00:03:02.100> long<00:03:02.400> since<00:03:02.459> mass

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
and it's not been that long since mass

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.220 
and it's not been that long since mass
one<00:03:04.280> so<00:03:05.360> yeah<00:03:08.540> I'll<00:03:09.540> probably<00:03:09.750> make<00:03:10.080> another
