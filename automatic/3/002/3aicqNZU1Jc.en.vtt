00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
the rapper I like the first one and the

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.580 
the rapper I like the first one and the
second<00:03:36.299> one<00:03:36.329> a<00:03:36.449> lot<00:03:36.659> of<00:03:36.780> people<00:03:37.049> did<00:03:37.230> not<00:03:37.409> like

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
second one a lot of people did not like

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.830 
second one a lot of people did not like
the<00:03:37.739> second<00:03:38.129> one<00:03:38.219> for<00:03:38.370> some<00:03:38.669> reason<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.239> can

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
the second one for some reason I can

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.300 
the second one for some reason I can
agree<00:03:40.049> the<00:03:40.230> music<00:03:40.500> was<00:03:40.650> not<00:03:40.680> as<00:03:41.010> good<00:03:41.129> in

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
agree the music was not as good in

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.569 
agree the music was not as good in
proper<00:03:41.549> -<00:03:41.849> but<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.599> game<00:03:43.169> engine<00:03:43.650> was<00:03:43.889> so<00:03:44.310> much

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
proper - but the game engine was so much

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.220 
proper - but the game engine was so much
better<00:03:44.909> and<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.239> think<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.689> way<00:03:45.780> they<00:03:45.930> sent<00:03:46.169> a

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
better and I think the way they sent a

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.589 
better and I think the way they sent a
prepa<00:03:46.500> -<00:03:46.739> is<00:03:46.859> just<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.609> was<00:03:47.790> such<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.180> good<00:03:48.389> game

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
prepa - is just it was such a good game

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.080 
prepa - is just it was such a good game
I<00:03:48.629> don't<00:03:48.810> know<00:03:48.989> why<00:03:49.139> people<00:03:49.819> think<00:03:50.819> that<00:03:50.939> that

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
I don't know why people think that that

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.990 
I don't know why people think that that
one<00:03:51.299> was<00:03:51.480> like<00:03:51.709> so<00:03:52.709> terrible<00:03:53.400> but<00:03:53.669> I<00:03:53.730> mean<00:03:53.969> I

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
one was like so terrible but I mean I

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.399 
one was like so terrible but I mean I
guess<00:03:54.180> compared<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:54.689> first<00:03:54.900> one<00:03:55.079> as<00:03:55.229> far

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
guess compared to the first one as far

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.309 
guess compared to the first one as far
