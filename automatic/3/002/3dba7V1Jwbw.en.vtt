00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
another video for models controllers as

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.600 
another video for models controllers as
well<00:02:46.620> that's<00:02:47.620> if<00:02:47.769> they<00:02:47.920> can<00:02:48.100> get<00:02:48.400> like<00:02:48.580> a

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
well that's if they can get like a

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.120 
well that's if they can get like a
mapping<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.239> hard<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:50.410> once<00:02:50.620> i<00:02:50.769> click<00:02:50.830> this

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
mapping it hard so once i click this

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.100 
mapping it hard so once i click this
button<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:53.200> will<00:02:53.320> do<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.470> 360<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.989> that's<00:02:55.989> how

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
button it will do a 360 and that's how

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.470 
button it will do a 360 and that's how
you<00:02:56.170> get<00:02:56.320> 360<00:02:56.950> i<00:02:57.190> have<00:02:57.340> optimized<00:02:57.819> this<00:02:58.000> for<00:02:58.209> 60

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
you get 360 i have optimized this for 60

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.559 
you get 360 i have optimized this for 60
FPS<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.110> 30<00:02:59.560> FPS<00:03:00.040> so<00:03:00.519> if<00:03:00.850> you're<00:03:01.030> still<00:03:01.239> on<00:03:01.300> for

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
FPS and 30 FPS so if you're still on for

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.020 
FPS and 30 FPS so if you're still on for
the<00:03:01.780> FPS<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:02.560> haven't<00:03:02.860> upgraded<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.640> 60

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
the FPS and you haven't upgraded to 60

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.930 
the FPS and you haven't upgraded to 60
FPS<00:03:04.390> for<00:03:05.110> routing<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:06.130> have<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.459> route<00:03:06.670> to

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
FPS for routing you have to route to

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.150 
FPS for routing you have to route to
upgrade<00:03:07.269> to<00:03:07.300> 60fps<00:03:10.050> this<00:03:11.050> one<00:03:11.350> does<00:03:11.590> both<00:03:11.800> so

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
upgrade to 60fps this one does both so

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.080
