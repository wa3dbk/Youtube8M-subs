why<00:02:29.439> these<00:02:29.500> diodes<00:02:29.950> are<00:02:30.220> very<00:02:30.400> necessary<00:02:30.580> and

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
why these diodes are very necessary and

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.350 
why these diodes are very necessary and
they<00:02:31.300> need<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.630> be<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:32.110> your<00:02:32.260> search

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
they need to be in your search

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.500 
they need to be in your search
in<00:02:34.360> operation<00:02:35.310> we<00:02:36.310> will<00:02:36.490> look<00:02:36.640> at<00:02:36.760> j1<00:02:37.240> for

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
in operation we will look at j1 for

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.190 
in operation we will look at j1 for
example<00:02:38.050> so<00:02:38.410> when<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.650> switch<00:02:38.920> j1<00:02:39.540> j1<00:02:40.540> connects

the motor will spin in the opposite

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
is never a situation where you can

switch on J 1 and J 2 at the same time

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.250 
switch on J 1 and J 2 at the same time
because<00:03:48.850> if<00:03:49.000> you<00:03:49.090> do<00:03:49.300> that<00:03:49.480> you'll<00:03:49.840> get<00:03:50.080> a

because if you do that you'll get a

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.190 
because if you do that you'll get a

tried to color code everything so it's a

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.560

spied<00:05:07.699> on<00:05:07.819> a<00:05:07.880> breadboard<00:05:08.150> plan<00:05:09.310> powered<00:05:10.310> from

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
spied on a breadboard plan powered from

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.100 
spied on a breadboard plan powered from
a<00:05:10.639> nine<00:05:10.789> volt<00:05:10.819> supply<00:05:11.360> here<00:05:12.490> here<00:05:13.490> is<00:05:13.669> the<00:05:13.819> fan

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
a nine volt supply here here is the fan

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.589 
a nine volt supply here here is the fan
so<00:05:15.110> when<00:05:15.319> I<00:05:15.349> switch<00:05:15.710> the<00:05:16.669> plane<00:05:17.090> goes<00:05:17.300> in<00:05:17.449> one

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
so when I switch the plane goes in one

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:20.290 
so when I switch the plane goes in one
directory<00:05:18.460> and<00:05:19.460> when<00:05:19.699> I<00:05:19.729> switch<00:05:20.030> the<00:05:20.180> other

directory and when I switch the other
switch<00:05:21.340> and<00:05:22.340> goes<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:22.699> other<00:05:22.970> direction<00:05:23.650> we

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
switch and goes the other direction we

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.700 
switch and goes the other direction we
notice<00:05:25.039> that<00:05:25.190> the<00:05:25.400> the<00:05:25.729> motor<00:05:25.970> is<00:05:26.270> connected

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
notice that the the motor is connected

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.409 
notice that the the motor is connected
here<00:05:27.710> in<00:05:27.889> here<00:05:28.159> so<00:05:28.460> you're<00:05:28.970> going<00:05:29.120> to<00:05:29.210> collect

the motor one one on one side one on the

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.580 
the motor one one on one side one on the
other<00:05:31.699> side<00:05:31.819> that's<00:05:32.690> pretty<00:05:33.050> much<00:05:33.199> all<00:05:33.440> there
