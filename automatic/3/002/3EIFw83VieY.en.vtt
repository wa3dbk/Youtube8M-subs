00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.640
 a nature photographer 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.800
 is someone unhappy with Dr 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.200
 when he can not go out in nature and take pictures 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.050
 a quote from FÃ¼rth King 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.820
 develop an ulcer that affects the 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.830
 To let in nature 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.220
 that is a prerequisite for a 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.220
 good nature photo 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.050
 However, you do not have to travel far to find interesting motives in Rome 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.180
 it is usually sufficient to go out the front door 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.230
 and look out for 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.610
 even being a guest in your home country 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.410
 that's how it came from 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.770
 many shots 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.240
 because nature 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.240
 Dr is as one at first sight market 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.490
 with this little movie and his photographs 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.789
 I would like to encourage you to offer your environment 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.460
 to perceive more consciously 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.460
 give useful tips 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.420
 Whoever does not get off the track will be left behind 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.699
 Reinhard Sprenger already knew that 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.699
 This track is pretty appropriate for nature photography 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.209
 only because of the remains 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.199
 and not at once 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:34.819
 cross country clock 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.549
 it will never, or at least not too fast 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.889
 to get good results 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:43.079
 especially when you are at home in the familiar surroundings 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:46.619
 Would like to take nature photographs 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:47.859
 is this saying 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.399
 very important 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:52.179
 because over the years you have a certain cradle 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:56.639
 once you leave Seckbach you get used to it 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.509
 new 

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:02.079
 if one means in a certain area or on a certain way 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.079
 to have seen everything 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:30.489
 Girardet digital photography offers them the opportunity 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.059
 Dulig immediate control still locally to enhance their pictures 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:41.779
 In addition, it often turns out to be useful to work with a tripod 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:46.029
 because you are automatically aware of the composition 8 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.930
 You should have patience as a wildlife photographer anyway 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:18.039
 use the camera 1 way to see the environment red other eyes 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.529
 if they get involved 

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:26.379
 and give yourself enough time you will be able to take beautiful pictures with you 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:27.620
 whom they turn 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.620
 to give pleasure to other people 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.849
 I hope you liked short film 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:56.819
 and I could make you want to experience nature 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.810
 and maybe we'll be back soon
