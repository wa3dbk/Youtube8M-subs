will sit up my camera and we'll get the
rest<00:01:41.270> of<00:01:41.420> these<00:01:41.510> copper<00:01:41.780> wire<00:01:41.990> hopefully<00:01:42.409> I

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
rest of these copper wire hopefully I

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:58.170 
rest of these copper wire hopefully I
