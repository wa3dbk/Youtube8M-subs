00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
basically it came down to it and it was

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.479 
basically it came down to it and it was
like<00:04:00.110> it<00:04:01.110> was<00:04:01.230> kind<00:04:01.409> of<00:04:01.470> up<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.650> both<00:04:01.980> parties

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489
