00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
and crystals these don't come with the

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.099 
and crystals these don't come with the
game<00:02:23.219> these<00:02:23.879> are<00:02:24.000> like<00:02:24.090> little<00:02:24.209> aquarium<00:02:24.599> tank

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:25.109 
game these are like little aquarium tank

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.949 
game these are like little aquarium tank
crystals<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.189> I<00:02:26.849> can<00:02:27.030> use<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.239> track<00:02:27.629> the

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
crystals that I can use to track the

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.860 
crystals that I can use to track the
health<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.829> the<00:02:29.280> encounter<00:02:29.969> that<00:02:30.510> I'm<00:02:30.659> going

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
health of the encounter that I'm going

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.020 
health of the encounter that I'm going
to<00:02:30.989> be<00:02:31.170> playing<00:02:31.769> against<00:02:32.280> in<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.640> solo

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
to be playing against in the solo

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.229 
to be playing against in the solo
variant<00:02:33.769> I've<00:02:34.769> already<00:02:35.010> constructed<00:02:35.400> my

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
variant I've already constructed my

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.500 
variant I've already constructed my
spell<00:02:37.200> book<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.769> this<00:02:38.069> is<00:02:38.129> called<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.700> codex

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
spell book and this is called a codex

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.530 
spell book and this is called a codex
and<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.560> we<00:02:40.829> get<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.129> codices<00:02:41.640> with<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.329> game

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
and so we get to codices with the game

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.670 
and so we get to codices with the game
I'm<00:02:42.720> going<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.870> be<00:02:42.959> using<00:02:43.079> the<00:02:43.560> brown<00:02:44.459> one

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
I'm going to be using the brown one

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.379 
I'm going to be using the brown one
there's<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.739> whole<00:02:46.859> bunch<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.159> cool<00:02:47.370> cards<00:02:48.209> that

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
there's a whole bunch of cool cards that

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.860 
there's a whole bunch of cool cards that
come<00:02:48.510> with<00:02:48.689> the<00:02:48.780> game<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.349> I'll<00:02:50.239> briefly<00:02:51.239> show

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
come with the game and I'll briefly show

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
you through how to construct construct

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.080 
you through how to construct construct
your<00:02:54.989> codex<00:02:55.859> but<00:02:56.459> we'll<00:02:56.579> put<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:56.819> one<00:02:57.000> aside

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
your codex but we'll put this one aside

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.819 
your codex but we'll put this one aside
for<00:02:57.329> now<00:02:57.569> essentially<00:02:58.260> something<00:02:58.650> I'm<00:02:58.709> gonna

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
for now essentially something I'm gonna

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.330 
for now essentially something I'm gonna
scrub<00:02:59.220> from<00:02:59.400> here<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.939> that's<00:03:00.169> this<00:03:01.169> page<00:03:01.980> I

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
scrub from here and that's this page I

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.849 
scrub from here and that's this page I
pulled<00:03:02.639> out<00:03:02.819> of<00:03:03.139> the<00:03:04.139> ring<00:03:04.379> binder<00:03:04.889> okay

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
pulled out of the ring binder okay

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.309 
pulled out of the ring binder okay
because<00:03:07.859> that's<00:03:08.400> going<00:03:08.639> to<00:03:08.730> be<00:03:08.849> useful<00:03:09.599> for<00:03:09.810> me

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
because that's going to be useful for me

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.890

in tracking some of the stats on the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.379 
in tracking some of the stats on the
encounter<00:03:13.889> put<00:03:14.519> this<00:03:14.609> one's<00:03:14.819> aside<00:03:15.120> for<00:03:15.359> now

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
encounter put this one's aside for now
