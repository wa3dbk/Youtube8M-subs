00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.520
 the paris games week 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.410

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.090

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.980
 no why the girl shambles why 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.370
 still at japan expo i want good but 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.380
 not you 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.990
 but at first it was nice the idea what 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.670
 a kind of three big games room 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.070
 video in France we could share 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.439
 our passion and our love for the game 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.269
 video and all that it would be only one 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.470
 would be so beautiful but hey he 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.789
 should already be able to enter the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.109
 living room you do not believe because the five 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.789
 hours of tails it hurts the ass when 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.800
 same and more without any action deals with 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.480
 large mastiff species only serve to 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.969
 bodyguard and that puts five years before 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.649
 to beeing your damn tickets at 30 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.980
 but you really have to be arms 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.750
 broken 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.170
 it's really not possible because if it's 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.489
 impossible I'm exaggerating I'm a little 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.320
 little Marseille on the edges but hey 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.629
 after queuing outside you do 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.399
 the tail inside and it can be 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.989
 as long or even a little more majine 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.370

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.590

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.190
