pressure in hecto Pascal's or in meters

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.570 
pressure in hecto Pascal's or in meters
as<00:00:24.609> well<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:25.179> the<00:00:25.509> height<00:00:25.750> in<00:00:26.050> meters<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:27.550> you

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
as well the the height in meters so you

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.880 
as well the the height in meters so you
have<00:00:28.269> the<00:00:28.419> pressure<00:00:28.630> at<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:28.990> top<00:00:29.199> and<00:00:29.470> then

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
have the pressure at the top and then

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.439 
have the pressure at the top and then
you<00:00:29.919> have<00:00:30.160> the<00:00:30.339> meters<00:00:30.730> at<00:00:30.910> the<00:00:30.939> bottom<00:00:31.300> you

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
you have the meters at the bottom you

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.860 
you have the meters at the bottom you
can<00:00:31.480> reset<00:00:32.110> the<00:00:33.000> statistics<00:00:34.000> basically<00:00:34.570> tear

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
can reset the statistics basically tear

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.840 
can reset the statistics basically tear
it<00:00:35.050> so<00:00:35.710> I'm<00:00:35.770> going<00:00:35.920> to<00:00:35.950> sit<00:00:36.129> it<00:00:36.219> down<00:00:36.460> on<00:00:36.730> the

can<00:00:41.829> see<00:00:42.100> I<00:00:42.340> reset<00:00:42.879> it<00:00:42.910> and<00:00:43.149> it<00:00:43.239> goes<00:00:43.420> to<00:00:43.570> 0

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
can see I reset it and it goes to 0

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.770 
can see I reset it and it goes to 0
meters<00:00:44.340> all<00:00:45.340> right<00:00:45.579> and<00:00:45.820> now<00:00:46.329> what<00:00:46.629> I'm<00:00:46.719> going

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
meters all right and now what I'm going

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.650 
meters all right and now what I'm going
to<00:00:46.930> do<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:48.340> I'm<00:00:48.550> going<00:00:48.730> to<00:00:48.789> lift<00:00:49.090> it<00:00:49.270> up<00:00:49.390> and

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
to do is I'm going to lift it up and

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.750 
to do is I'm going to lift it up and
you're<00:00:50.020> going<00:00:50.140> to<00:00:50.230> see<00:00:50.440> the<00:00:50.980> meter<00:00:51.280> reading

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
you're going to see the meter reading

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.360 
you're going to see the meter reading
adjust<00:00:52.629> according<00:00:53.440> to<00:00:53.530> how<00:00:53.680> far<00:00:53.980> I<00:00:54.010> lift<00:00:54.280> it

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
adjust according to how far I lift it

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.020 
adjust according to how far I lift it
off<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:54.640> ground

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
off the ground

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.900 
off the ground
so<00:00:55.600> I<00:00:55.629> have<00:00:55.930> it<00:00:56.079> in<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.260> air<00:00:56.410> and<00:00:56.769> it's<00:00:57.430> reading

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
so I have it in the air and it's reading

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.750 
so I have it in the air and it's reading
1.1<00:00:58.809> meters<00:00:59.199> now<00:00:59.469> this<00:00:59.710> is<00:00:59.859> not<00:01:00.039> exactly

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
1.1 meters now this is not exactly

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.109 
1.1 meters now this is not exactly
accurate<00:01:01.030> I<00:01:01.600> actually<00:01:02.350> you<00:01:03.160> know<00:01:03.219> measured<00:01:03.969> it

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
accurate I actually you know measured it

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.499 
accurate I actually you know measured it
with<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:04.570> tape<00:01:04.960> measure<00:01:05.430> an<00:01:06.430> exact<00:01:07.330> location

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
with the tape measure an exact location

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.350 
with the tape measure an exact location
it<00:01:08.350> was<00:01:08.560> close<00:01:08.830> but<00:01:09.040> it<00:01:09.159> wasn't<00:01:09.520> spot-on<00:01:09.850> but

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
it was close but it wasn't spot-on but

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.210 
it was close but it wasn't spot-on but
it's<00:01:10.600> pretty<00:01:10.990> close<00:01:11.350> it's<00:01:11.619> pretty<00:01:11.890> impressive

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
it's pretty close it's pretty impressive

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.060 
it's pretty close it's pretty impressive
see<00:01:13.150> I'm<00:01:13.240> lifting<00:01:13.600> it<00:01:13.689> up<00:01:13.810> higher<00:01:14.170> you<00:01:14.500> can<00:01:14.830> see

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
see I'm lifting it up higher you can see

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.819 
see I'm lifting it up higher you can see
it<00:01:15.189> rises<00:01:15.759> as<00:01:15.970> I<00:01:16.180> lift<00:01:16.390> it<00:01:16.509> up<00:01:16.630> higher<00:01:16.810> I<00:01:17.140> lower

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
it rises as I lift it up higher I lower

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:19.499 
it rises as I lift it up higher I lower
it<00:01:18.040> a<00:01:18.070> little<00:01:18.220> bit<00:01:18.579> and<00:01:18.729> you<00:01:18.790> can<00:01:18.820> see<00:01:18.970> the

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
it a little bit and you can see the

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.210 
it a little bit and you can see the
meter<00:01:19.990> reading<00:01:20.409> drops<00:01:21.119> correspondingly<00:01:22.119> and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
meter reading drops correspondingly and

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.310 
meter reading drops correspondingly and
yeah<00:01:24.220> sit<00:01:24.610> it<00:01:24.700> back<00:01:24.729> down<00:01:25.180> here<00:01:25.210> and<00:01:25.869> drop<00:01:26.140> it<00:01:26.259> a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
yeah sit it back down here and drop it a

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.740 
yeah sit it back down here and drop it a
little<00:01:26.500> lower<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:28.030> can<00:01:28.150> see<00:01:28.299> it<00:01:28.390> drops<00:01:28.630> a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
little lower you can see it drops a

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.940 
little lower you can see it drops a
little<00:01:28.840> lower<00:01:29.079> and<00:01:29.259> I'll<00:01:29.350> put<00:01:29.590> it<00:01:29.649> back<00:01:29.770> down

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
little lower and I'll put it back down

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.520 
little lower and I'll put it back down
on<00:01:30.159> the<00:01:30.250> ground<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:30.700> watch<00:01:31.329> what<00:01:31.570> happens<00:01:31.689> it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
on the ground and watch what happens it

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.929 
on the ground and watch what happens it
goes<00:01:32.829> back<00:01:33.189> to<00:01:33.460> zero<00:01:34.409> yes<00:01:35.409> indeed<00:01:35.860> so<00:01:36.310> pretty

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
goes back to zero yes indeed so pretty

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.780 
goes back to zero yes indeed so pretty
