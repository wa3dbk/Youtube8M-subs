 my voice starts to be more 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.930
 known than it should and 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.700
 welcome to this fantastic video of 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.620
 gianpi tech as I call it by now 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.210
 a gianpi life because we are friends of 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.840
 old date we met if not 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.329
 wrong in 2008 2009 in short a lot 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.620
 a long time ago slut bitch and I am 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.329
 here then to comment on his 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.160
 fantastic gameplay I want 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.320
 share with all the audience that 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.600
 gianpi follows in this fantastic 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.549
 wonderful youtube channel 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.820
 ok then let's see what's going on 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.680
 happening we find ourselves in a game in 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.650
 which the high gianpi is using a 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.560
 ak47 now gianpi is well known 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.509
 at least before it became youtuber of 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.369
 fame was also known for the film 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.409
 that I did where he where he 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.330
 he is a clown who breaks everything 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.920
 in mysteries from area 51 devastates 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.450
 completely everything with his mini 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.020
 ranges you can see that you were going to 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.909
 suicide 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.009
 because it was just too powerful for 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.869
 living in this world devastated everything 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.430
 how much and coleman icahn shot right 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.200
 and to the left he could do nothing but 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.150
 he shot and killed everyone 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.049
 absolutely devastated everything 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.970
 it happened within range 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.619
 so if you want to see the devastation 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.110
 supreme of the jaws look at the mysteries 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.729
 from area 51 but here we are talking about 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.369
 a fantastic call of duty game 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.439
 black ops in which with the k 47 stands 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.850
 completely devastating all that 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.840
 that appears before him 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.880
 I hope he doesn't catch up to him 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.130
 some animals otherwise otherwise i 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.020
 vvf makes us pay we get into trouble 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.009
 here we see how nothing is understood 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.110
 of what is happening 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.000
 probably a photographer did it to him 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.710
 a photo the flash stunned him here 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.360
 shoot something fires something 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.810
 will say I do not know who the hell on that one 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.230
 weapon cabbage looks like a 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.370
 and motion emotion how the fuck you call it 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.170
 msn 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.760
 I don't know where he is admiring it is yes 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.830
 understands nothing in this game though 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.349
 I know for sure that this game 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.420
 represents the foundation in its most 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.459
 pure form because we are talking about 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.140
 gianpi we are not talking 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.030
 my god what a shit weapon he took 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.550
 in fact, Latin was immediately washed away because his 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.230
 supreme power absolutely can not a 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.819
 put one of those junk here like 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.860
 see he tried to punch a 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.530
 that boy who then made a miserable one 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.269
 end to steal the weapon and we have 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.459
 a weapon certainly worthy of the name 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.080
 with silent taint because you know that 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.790
 the great gianpi can do nothing but 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.830
 destroy everything that is done also 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.330
 hear why he admits it though when 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.310
 no need to take a silencer 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.860
 it is absolutely the only thing to do 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.630
 well i am also famous for one thing 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.310
 or the famous commentary I have 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.140
 done on the baby network but I did 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.319
 also in other places 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.599
 now I will try to do it but not yet 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.989
 I'll do it when Gianpi will start at 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.280
 break your ass even more 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.380
 powerful already is doing so in a manner 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.060
 atopic because I don't even know if 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.100
 the term is devastating everything 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.390
 how much but I show you that he has 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.970
 destroyed tour and the wood of the window 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.880
 but he is absolutely dead 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.680
 normal or its population had to 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.640
 reach an end otherwise he would 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.829
 made the game grow and here you see that 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.900
 gets the bonus fineness because it is so 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.250
 powerful smashes so many things but it 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.319
 so polite enough 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.389
 fine as people sense good morning 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.319
 mister and can kill you but thanks 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:44.350
 returned from the amat 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.060
 here you see that he is ok ok I would say he is 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.470
 the time has come to see those 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.389
 rex commissioner who is going to 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.680
 take some criminal look at how 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.760
 it has also changed its course because 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.380
 gianpi after another 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.549
 let's start with the commentary and behold 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.019
 gianpi that kill that is going to be 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.160
 killed by the dog continues to talk with 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.420
 the other hand understands nothing here 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.680
 gets the avenger bonus while 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.299
 keep going down the map 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.829
 down the stairs there is a dog that love 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.420
 nothing was understood in charging the weapon 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.889
 idea keeps on going if it goes away 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.420
 under the breeze he decides to go to 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.310
 left where bullets arrive 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.109
 who knows what bullets were here 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.639
 continuous reloading also goes down from below 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.590
 I keep going in this cabbage of 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.329
 corridor sees a claymore matt mace 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.979
 video8 looked like a great smurf who was 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.599
 trying to catch gargamel or 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.859
 will lead to the opposite, I got confused but 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.190
 I absolutely can't reason 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.770
 adjustment to this beauty 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.880
 exactly at this speed of 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.170
 parliament is not called parliament 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.460
 in fact, I 'm not fucking there for a fuck 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.530
 here he enters a Chinese store 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.000
 someone lights a bonfire on the right 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.320
 it almost seemed to burn 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.760
 willy the coyote once when for 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.420
 try to take beep beep you are done 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.890
 jump in the air 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.390
 obviously fell into the ravine with 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.320
 full to go to broom what 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.430
 there was on the balcony 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.930
 keep going left and right 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.460
 here it takes a strange contraption that 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.780
 I do not know what it was but he 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.010
 can do everything in games as well 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.720
 will take incomprehensible gigi 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.400
 probably the gadget inspector at all 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.110
 opa shit fish has succeeded 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.400
 also the v that continues to go to 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.900
 from there there are sand bags that 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.430
 they will certainly roux 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.990
 will certainly protect you from attacks 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.190
 malicious other people even if he is a 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.420
 a professional actor can 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.620
 kill everyone in the same 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.150
 moment takes another object 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.010
 incomprehensible is no longer being understood 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.870
 shit there are two texts there is another 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.340
 and here it dies that 100 points yes 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.450
 repair the gate probably 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.400
 he wanted to play a trick on the intercom 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.690
 continues to climb up the stairs takes 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.460
 the gun probably wants to kill 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.780
 someone makes you shoot is the last 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.360
 kill with the gentlemen's gun too 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.280
 never seen such mastery I remain 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.930
 really speechless for two reasons 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.020
 not just for mastery but because I have 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.890
 spoken continuously for 400,000 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.240
 years and now if you don't mind 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.250
 I go to the hospital to the emergency room 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.680
 thanks for watching this video 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.270

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.930
