what's new on Android 4.4 for the

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.270 
what's new on Android 4.4 for the
Samsung<00:00:05.879> Galaxy<00:00:06.540> Note<00:00:06.600> 2<00:00:06.930> today<00:00:07.890> let's<00:00:08.130> look

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
Samsung Galaxy Note 2 today let's look

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.310 
Samsung Galaxy Note 2 today let's look
at<00:00:08.490> what<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.790> NFC<00:00:09.210> card<00:00:09.480> mode<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.840> all<00:00:10.019> about

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
at what the NFC card mode is all about

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.290 
at what the NFC card mode is all about
and<00:00:10.590> how<00:00:10.740> that<00:00:10.950> works<00:00:11.190> differently<00:00:11.849> compared

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
and how that works differently compared

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.240 
and how that works differently compared
to<00:00:12.420> Google<00:00:12.599> Wallet<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.320> tap<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.769> pay<00:00:13.950> so

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
to Google Wallet and tap and pay so

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:23.060 
to Google Wallet and tap and pay so
let's<00:00:14.460> get<00:00:14.639> started

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.950 

so<00:00:24.070> let's<00:00:24.339> look<00:00:24.490> at<00:00:24.699> NFC<00:00:25.119> card<00:00:25.390> mode<00:00:25.480> when<00:00:25.929> I

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
so let's look at NFC card mode when I

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.659 
so let's look at NFC card mode when I
enable<00:00:26.410> it<00:00:26.529> from<00:00:26.739> the<00:00:26.859> notification<00:00:27.489> panel

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
enable it from the notification panel

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.909 
enable it from the notification panel
you'll<00:00:28.060> notice<00:00:28.390> that<00:00:28.539> the<00:00:28.689> NFC<00:00:29.199> chip<00:00:29.470> behaves

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
you'll notice that the NFC chip behaves

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.950 
you'll notice that the NFC chip behaves
a<00:00:30.070> little<00:00:30.220> differently<00:00:30.399> than<00:00:31.119> it<00:00:31.329> did<00:00:31.480> before

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
a little differently than it did before

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.560 
a little differently than it did before
you<00:00:32.949> will<00:00:33.129> see<00:00:33.309> when<00:00:33.489> the<00:00:33.579> NFC<00:00:33.969> card<00:00:34.210> mode<00:00:34.269> is

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
you will see when the NFC card mode is

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.900 
you will see when the NFC card mode is
on<00:00:34.750> I<00:00:34.930> can<00:00:35.170> scan<00:00:35.469> it<00:00:35.649> and<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:36.190> scan<00:00:36.460> is<00:00:36.489> more

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
on I can scan it and the scan is more

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.689 
on I can scan it and the scan is more
similar<00:00:37.269> to<00:00:37.780> a<00:00:37.809> smart<00:00:38.440> card<00:00:38.769> than<00:00:39.010> an<00:00:39.129> NFC<00:00:39.670> tag

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:39.699 
similar to a smart card than an NFC tag

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.030 
similar to a smart card than an NFC tag
