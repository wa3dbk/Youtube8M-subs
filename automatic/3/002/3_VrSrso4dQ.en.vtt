00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.240
 the world of bees is very big and 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.400
 diverse the European bee also 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.189
 known as domestic bee and 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.779
 scientific name apis mellifera is the 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.419
 species with greater distribution in the 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.520
 world this has geographical varieties 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:32.379
 or subspecies that currently 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.379
 exceed 30 races 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.309
 currently in the usa there is a 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.890
 mysterious disappearance of millions of 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.680
 bees having beekeepers to 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.860
 edge of a nervous breakdown 'the subject 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.440
 and he came to Congress as 25 percent 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.930
 of the swarms of the country have lost 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.750
 half a million colonies with one 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.750
 population of around 50 thousand bees 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.950
 at this moment there is a great 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.350
 the great concern of part not 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.860
 only 19 scientists in general 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.290
 that are not explained because they disappear 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.540
 and if we achieve a little all the theories 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.140
 about 10 theories because they are 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.140
 disappearing 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.810
 one of the first versions speak of 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.540
 a mite that infects bees and 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.930
 weakens until finishing with the hive the 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:33.440
 another version attributed to a micro fungus 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.840
 called nosema ceranae that only affects 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.250
 to the Asian guy but who could infect 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.250
 to the honey bee 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.000
 the mystery of this kind of disappearance 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.520
 increases since no remains are found 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.770
 mortals and according to researchers when 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.790
 something affects a swarm always 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:04.180
 there are dead insects added this to the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.100
 behavior of worker bees that 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.430
 they run away leaving the queen 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.430
 behind 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.670
 to follow this situation will be fulfilled what 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.160
 that Albert Einstein predicted he assured 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.680
 that if the bee disappeared from the 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.120
 land to man would only be left 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.190
 four years of life without bees there is no 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.430
 pollination neither grass nor animals 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.700
 or phrase that should not be overlooked 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.209
 and less in a controversial year of theories 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.209
 apocalyptic 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.710
 so if we keep trying 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.100
 to modify 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.310
 the conditions under which a plant 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.740
 live to have more production those that 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.090
 they will see 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.489
 really hurt or they know it 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:00.630
 there are many people who still do not know that 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:04.020
 the bees are the flour 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:08.600
 however, it is up to us to take care of them 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.600
 and value them for what they do 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.319
 no no
