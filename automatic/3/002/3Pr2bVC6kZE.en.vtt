00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.120 
and what the spoiler goes over the head
and<00:02:16.380> there<00:02:17.310> we<00:02:17.490> have<00:02:17.880> it

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
and there we have it

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.550 
and there we have it
this<00:02:20.130> combination<00:02:20.459> of<00:02:20.880> gaim<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.569> drive<00:02:22.020> arms

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
this combination of gaim and drive arms

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.280 
this combination of gaim and drive arms
looks<00:02:22.860> pretty<00:02:23.340> good<00:02:23.790> if<00:02:24.180> not<00:02:24.239> a<00:02:24.780> little<00:02:25.050> bit

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
looks pretty good if not a little bit

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.280 
looks pretty good if not a little bit
too<00:02:25.530> bulky<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.069> busy<00:02:26.610> there<00:02:27.209> are<00:02:27.510> issues<00:02:28.110> with

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
too bulky and busy there are issues with

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.839 
too bulky and busy there are issues with
the<00:02:28.319> figure<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.010> fact<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.370> there's

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
the figure and the fact that there's

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.720 
the figure and the fact that there's
just<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.510> much<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.290> drives<00:02:31.620> helmet<00:02:32.220> just

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
just so much of the drives helmet just

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.300 
just so much of the drives helmet just
hanging<00:02:33.660> off<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.080> figure<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.830> makes<00:02:35.100> it

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
hanging off the figure it makes it

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.670 
hanging off the figure it makes it
top-heavy<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.300> really<00:02:36.750> really<00:02:37.440> does

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
top-heavy and it really really does

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.900 
top-heavy and it really really does
hinder<00:02:38.010> its<00:02:38.160> poseability

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
hinder its poseability

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.780 
hinder its poseability
I<00:02:39.060> mean<00:02:39.569> badly<00:02:40.050> those<00:02:40.739> side<00:02:41.040> panels<00:02:41.550> for

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
I mean badly those side panels for

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.150 
I mean badly those side panels for
drives<00:02:42.060> helmet<00:02:42.569> are<00:02:42.720> ginormous<00:02:43.050> compared<00:02:44.040> to

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.620 
sets it's not bad looking set at all I
want<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.920> say<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.220> right<00:02:50.519> now<00:02:50.550> I<00:02:50.910> do<00:02:50.970> like<00:02:51.150> the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
set but you are sacrificing poseability

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.860 
set but you are sacrificing poseability
for<00:02:55.230> looks<00:02:55.850> which<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.030> unfortunate<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.780> we

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
for looks which is unfortunate and we

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.360 
for looks which is unfortunate and we
have<00:02:58.080> seen<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.590> with<00:02:58.799> some<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.220> other

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
have seen that with some of the other

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.699 
have seen that with some of the other
arms<00:02:59.760> figures<00:03:00.150> still<00:03:00.569> I<00:03:00.840> think<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.680> a

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
arms figures still I think this is a

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.620 
arms figures still I think this is a
solid<00:03:02.340> set<00:03:02.610> this<00:03:02.970> set<00:03:03.269> and<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.780> drive<00:03:04.560> TK

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
solid set this set and the drive TK

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.620 
solid set this set and the drive TK
Orange<00:03:06.630> set<00:03:06.989> are<00:03:07.230> both<00:03:07.739> fantastic<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:09.299> like<00:03:09.480> the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
Orange set are both fantastic I like the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.809 
Orange set are both fantastic I like the
orange<00:03:09.930> set<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.440> little<00:03:11.010> bit<00:03:11.220> more<00:03:11.489> just

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
orange set a little bit more just

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.300 
orange set a little bit more just
because<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.209> think<00:03:12.269> it's<00:03:12.600> way<00:03:13.290> more<00:03:13.319> Japanese

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
because I think it's way more Japanese

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.699 
because I think it's way more Japanese
cool<00:03:14.790> than<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.750> one<00:03:16.019> this<00:03:16.200> one's<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.560> little

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.819 
cool than this one this one's a little
bit<00:03:17.239> it's<00:03:18.239> not<00:03:18.420> bad<00:03:18.600> I'm<00:03:18.870> just<00:03:19.079> I<00:03:19.530> don't<00:03:19.680> want

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299

video review of a CSP gaim Drive type
arms<00:03:29.880> I<00:03:30.230> really<00:03:31.230> think<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.470> should<00:03:31.500> get<00:03:31.769> a

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
arms I really think you should get a

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.620 
arms I really think you should get a
hold<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.070> it<00:03:32.190> but<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.549> think<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.450> should

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
hold of it but I think you should

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.819 
hold of it but I think you should
probably<00:03:33.930> pick<00:03:34.650> up<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.190> TK<00:03:36.109> orange<00:03:37.109> set<00:03:37.410> first

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
probably pick up the TK orange set first

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.160 
probably pick up the TK orange set first
