to<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:40.379> exact<00:00:40.739> now<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.250> we're<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.520> still

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
to be exact now that is we're just still

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.670 
to be exact now that is we're just still
titan<00:00:42.329> i<00:00:42.450> did<00:00:42.629> use<00:00:42.780> my<00:00:42.899> still<00:00:43.140> taking<00:00:43.379> quite<00:00:43.620> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
titan i did use my still taking quite a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.500 
titan i did use my still taking quite a
bit<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.190> task<00:00:44.430> which<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.730> kind<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
bit on this task which is kind of the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.060 
bit on this task which is kind of the
annoying<00:00:45.809> part<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:46.980> not

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
annoying part of it is that it's not

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.220 
annoying part of it is that it's not
really<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> FK<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:47.940> all<00:00:48.059> but<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.050> definitely

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
really a FK at all but it's definitely

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.690 
really a FK at all but it's definitely
worth<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> experience<00:00:49.829> per<00:00:50.129> hour<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.489> Mellie

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
worth the experience per hour for Mellie

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.729 
worth the experience per hour for Mellie
so<00:00:51.390> what<00:00:51.539> these<00:00:51.660> experience<00:00:52.230> equals<00:00:52.559> just

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
so what these experience equals just

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.610 
so what these experience equals just
around<00:00:52.890> 270<00:00:53.850> k<00:00:54.030> 2<00:00:54.090> 300<00:00:54.600> case<00:00:54.780> attack

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
around 270 k 2 300 case attack

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.380 
around 270 k 2 300 case attack
experience<00:00:56.070> per<00:00:56.219> hour<00:00:56.340> or<00:00:56.730> strength<00:00:57.239> or

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
experience per hour or strength or

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.029 
experience per hour or strength or
defense<00:00:57.780> or<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.050> guess<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.469> retraining<00:00:58.800> all

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
defense or I guess in retraining all

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.799 
defense or I guess in retraining all
three<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.309> them<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.090> hundred<00:01:00.359> K<00:01:00.510> attack

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
three of them it's a hundred K attack

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.080 
three of them it's a hundred K attack
strength<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.350> defense<00:01:01.530> per<00:01:01.890> hour<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.340> that's

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
strength and defense per hour so that's

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.210 
strength and defense per hour so that's
kind<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.390> interesting<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:04.110> anyways<00:01:04.350> besides

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
kind of interesting but anyways besides

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.100 
kind of interesting but anyways besides
that<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.970> did<00:01:06.150> use<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.330> rape<00:01:06.630> years<00:01:06.900> they<00:01:07.080> are

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
that I did use the rape years they are

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.990 
that I did use the rape years they are
weak<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.530> stab<00:01:07.770> attack<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.340> dual<00:01:08.520> rapers

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
weak to stab attack so dual rapers

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.980 
weak to stab attack so dual rapers

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
there's a bunch of seeds there you can

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.380 
there's a bunch of seeds there you can
get<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.460> you<00:02:18.550> will<00:02:18.670> want<00:02:18.880> these<00:02:19.000> whenever<00:02:19.300> you

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300

would definitely get Twitter mild
offense<00:03:04.390> before<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:04.930> do<00:03:05.020> against<00:03:05.260> layer<00:03:05.530> so

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
offense before I do against layer so

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.500 
offense before I do against layer so
that's<00:03:06.010> kind<00:03:06.220> of<00:03:06.250> interesting<00:03:06.459> too<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.120> I

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
that's kind of interesting too and I

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.810 
that's kind of interesting too and I
guess<00:03:07.630> range<00:03:07.959> is<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.170> next<00:03:08.470> type<00:03:08.740> of<00:03:08.770> a<00:03:09.040> little

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
guess range is the next type of a little

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.880 
guess range is the next type of a little
bit<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:10.090> war<00:03:10.330> ii<00:03:10.360> m<00:03:10.510> 60<00:03:10.930> mil<00:03:11.110> till<00:03:11.350> two

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
bit of a war ii m 60 mil till two

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.180 
bit of a war ii m 60 mil till two
internal<00:03:12.160> range<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.850> i<00:03:13.090> am<00:03:13.300> 80<00:03:13.810> or<00:03:14.290> 75<00:03:14.830> millets

with<00:03:15.310> twitter<00:03:15.550> and<00:03:15.670> wats<00:03:15.790> layer<00:03:15.970> so<00:03:16.239> it<00:03:16.690> feels

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
with twitter and wats layer so it feels

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.810 
with twitter and wats layer so it feels
like<00:03:17.140> almost<00:03:17.769> all<00:03:17.950> those<00:03:18.100> skills<00:03:18.370> will<00:03:18.519> fit<00:03:18.700> in

it's<00:03:53.440> a<00:03:53.500> glitch<00:03:53.830> i'm<00:03:53.980> not<00:03:54.100> sure<00:03:54.280> if<00:03:54.370> it<00:03:54.459> is<00:03:54.489> or

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
it's a glitch i'm not sure if it is or

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.280 
it's a glitch i'm not sure if it is or
not<00:03:54.760> but<00:03:55.330> i'm<00:03:55.420> pretty<00:03:55.600> sure<00:03:55.780> it's<00:03:55.900> not<00:03:55.930> AFK

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290

probably<00:04:18.970> on<00:04:19.090> a<00:04:19.120> patch<00:04:19.330> on<00:04:19.510> guessing<00:04:20.020> but<00:04:20.200> I

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
probably on a patch on guessing but I

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.200 
probably on a patch on guessing but I
guess<00:04:21.070> that<00:04:21.190> is<00:04:21.250> theater<00:04:21.580> cakes<00:04:21.849> prints<00:04:22.060> per

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
guess that is theater cakes prints per

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.940 
guess that is theater cakes prints per
hour<00:04:22.300> as<00:04:22.479> well<00:04:22.690> but<00:04:23.110> this<00:04:23.289> is<00:04:23.410> just<00:04:23.440> a<00:04:23.590> lot<00:04:23.710> more

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
hour as well but this is just a lot more

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.710 
hour as well but this is just a lot more
simple<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.340> me<00:04:24.490> than<00:04:24.700> having<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:25.060> do<00:04:25.210> like<00:04:25.240> crap

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
simple to me than having to do like crap

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.030 
simple to me than having to do like crap
and<00:04:25.870> i'm<00:04:25.990> pretty<00:04:26.200> sure<00:04:26.380> you<00:04:26.410> do<00:04:26.620> have<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:26.890> use

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
and i'm pretty sure you do have to use

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.320 
and i'm pretty sure you do have to use
abilities<00:04:27.280> while<00:04:27.670> you're<00:04:27.850> doing<00:04:27.970> i<00:04:28.180> don't

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
abilities while you're doing i don't

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.180
