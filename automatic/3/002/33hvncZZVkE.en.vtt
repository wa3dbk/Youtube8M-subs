light technology you know we're adding

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.889 
light technology you know we're adding
this<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.739> laser<00:00:59.100> light<00:00:59.539> anytime<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.719> bait

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
this this laser light anytime that bait

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.860 
this this laser light anytime that bait
gets<00:01:01.140> wet<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:03.059> laser<00:01:03.239> lights<00:01:03.539> going<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.809> come

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
gets wet so laser lights going to come

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.369 
gets wet so laser lights going to come
on

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
on

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.770 
on
and<00:01:04.559> what<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.580> laser<00:01:05.880> lights<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.630> do

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
and what that laser lights going to do

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.219 
and what that laser lights going to do
is<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.830> another<00:01:08.270> triggering<00:01:09.270> aid<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:10.020> make

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
is it's another triggering aid to make

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.500 
is it's another triggering aid to make
those<00:01:10.439> fish<00:01:10.710> strike<00:01:11.010> right<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.270> comes

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
those fish strike right so here comes

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.880 
those fish strike right so here comes
