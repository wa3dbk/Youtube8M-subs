00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:11.030
 Hello, I want to talk about hunting 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:14.030
 Knife known Russian firm press 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.030
 a loop 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:21.029
 Kizlyar 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.619
 model swift but before moving on to 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.170
 the knife 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:30.590
 a little talk about the necessary means necessary 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.590
 made of leather is quite thick 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:42.530
 has such a buckle more precisely even 2 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:47.870
 buckle she on the most difficult 1 dangles 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:49.850
 the knife in the sheath is fixed like this 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.809
 to fall 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.820
 principle should be one of the power that well 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:02.969
 for sure for this did for such 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:06.510
 fortifications I need very much 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.020
 liked we will come relatively most 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.020
 at the knife 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:25.320
 knife length from 256 millimeters length 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.740
 blade 131 and the length of the cutting edge hundred 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:34.890
 twenty nine millimeters thickness across 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:41.810
 butt 3 millimeter blade is made of 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:46.590
 steel 65 x 13 principle is an analogue of the CIS to 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:50.250
 14 27 I do not know how he will manifest himself in 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:57.440
 work on the hunt let's hope that 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:02:04.619
 well here is such a beautiful handle 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:09.420
 made of walnut and we are dark 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:13.049
 the hole in the hand is good but 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:18.359
 the only thing I added further 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:20.850
 Such a card is rougher than necessary for some 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.670
 in the works of the finger can jump off and straight 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.660
 newest edge 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:30.420
 there is such a notch here tenaciously 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.329
 but when you hold a knife in your hand and 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:43.350
 you put it in the face 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:48.720
 okay downhill somewhere 6 eighths downhill 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.230
 concave sharpening factory wishes 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.609
 the best 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:58.680
 go yet what I noticed think will be seen 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:03:02.120
 here here is a little crooked done in 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.120
 principle, however, it does not matter 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:16.040
 in the hand lies like a poured tip 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:22.510
 I have a very thin external knife 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:26.840
 like a lot chained me 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:30.230
 design your own and pen also swifts there 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:37.150
 with plastic with rubber handle me 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.150
 more like it with wood and 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:49.460
 Now there will be a certain announcement I was told that 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:52.760
 will bring kizlyar one more on 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.850
 restoring the cutting edge is simple 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.770
 drunk uncles decided to compare Kizlyar with 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:03.730
 bulat but they did not work on them 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:06.500
 they say a little bit 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.360
 on the cutting edge say somewhere around 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:14.330
 millimeter 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:19.900
 chipped well, by the way I will bring of course 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:24.410
 I will finish the video about the restoration and 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:29.080
 I will most likely review because 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.080
 Now kizlyar flour began to like 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.910
 give a look at this one 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:42.820
 great knife here 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.820
 polished mirror blade 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.810
