00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
forward because we're don't got the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.410

power<00:02:09.930> but<00:02:10.490> cars<00:02:11.490> handling<00:02:11.790> decent<00:02:12.150> we're

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
power but cars handling decent we're

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.480 
power but cars handling decent we're
just<00:02:12.600> going<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.750> compensate<00:02:13.050> for<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.920> car<00:02:14.130> and

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
just going to compensate for the car and

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.370 
just going to compensate for the car and
motor<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:14.940> everything<00:02:15.030> mehal<00:02:15.480> screwed<00:02:16.230> up

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
motor and everything mehal screwed up

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.660 
motor and everything mehal screwed up
and<00:02:16.620> trying<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.890> get<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.070> so<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.220> drives<00:02:17.430> off

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
and trying to get it so it drives off

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.700 
and trying to get it so it drives off
hopefully<00:02:18.180> stay<00:02:18.690> mid-pack<00:02:19.290> something<00:02:19.620> like

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
hopefully stay mid-pack something like

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.010 
hopefully stay mid-pack something like
that<00:02:20.090> it's<00:02:21.090> just<00:02:21.240> tough<00:02:21.390> right<00:02:21.630> now<00:02:21.660> because

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
that it's just tough right now because

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
that it's just tough right now because
when<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.260> don't<00:02:22.410> have<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.560> power<00:02:22.620> get<00:02:22.950> off

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
when you don't have the power get off

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.240 
when you don't have the power get off
corners<00:02:23.430> really<00:02:23.970> hurt<00:02:24.650> basically<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.830> said

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
corners really hurt basically I said

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.100 
corners really hurt basically I said
maybe<00:02:26.520> we<00:02:26.640> should<00:02:26.850> park<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.300> but<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.930> car

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
maybe we should park it but the car

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.630 
maybe we should park it but the car

the<00:03:44.470> car<00:03:44.650> was<00:03:44.769> working<00:03:45.069> before<00:03:45.190> so<00:03:46.739> without

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
the car was working before so without

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.229 
the car was working before so without
the<00:03:47.890> motor<00:03:48.069> issues<00:03:48.250> I<00:03:48.549> think<00:03:48.579> we'd<00:03:48.849> be<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.030> real

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
the motor issues I think we'd be a real

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.180 
the motor issues I think we'd be a real
good<00:03:49.269> sheep<00:03:49.599> but<00:03:49.810> words<00:03:50.260> they<00:03:50.409> fit<00:03:50.799> us<00:03:50.920> again

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
good sheep but words they fit us again

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.490 
good sheep but words they fit us again
one<00:03:51.549> last<00:03:51.579> time<00:03:52.030> they<00:03:52.959> were<00:03:53.079> pretty<00:03:53.260> good<00:03:53.470> I

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
one last time they were pretty good I

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.599 
one last time they were pretty good I
think<00:03:53.680> it's<00:03:53.860> gonna<00:03:53.950> be<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.099> little<00:03:54.190> more<00:03:54.370> rough

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
think it's gonna be a little more rough

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.729 
think it's gonna be a little more rough
than<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.940> last<00:03:55.120> one<00:03:55.359> going<00:03:55.510> green<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:56.590> don't

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
than the last one going green you don't

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.589 
than the last one going green you don't
ring<00:03:56.859> the<00:03:56.980> checkered<00:03:57.340> in<00:03:57.430> the<00:03:57.489> first<00:03:57.700> one<00:03:57.910> so<00:03:58.569> i

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
ring the checkered in the first one so i

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.030 
ring the checkered in the first one so i
think<00:03:59.019> it's<00:03:59.260> going<00:03:59.349> a<00:03:59.410> little<00:03:59.530> get<00:03:59.980> a<00:04:00.010> little

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
think it's going a little get a little

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.920 
think it's going a little get a little
more<00:04:00.250> hairy<00:04:00.519> i<00:04:00.910> start<00:04:01.390> kind<00:04:01.569> of<00:04:01.660> so<00:04:01.780> i'm<00:04:01.840> gonna

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
knew you'd both making the moves getting

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.860 
knew you'd both making the moves getting
up<00:05:41.340> past<00:05:41.670> guys<00:05:41.910> and<00:05:42.270> when<00:05:42.420> he<00:05:42.510> moved<00:05:42.720> into

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
up past guys and when he moved into

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.080

second<00:05:43.410> you<00:05:43.890> know<00:05:43.980> I<00:05:44.130> was<00:05:44.220> really<00:05:44.760> starting<00:05:44.850> to

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
second you know I was really starting to

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.400 
second you know I was really starting to
think<00:05:45.240> that<00:05:45.300> we<00:05:45.480> had<00:05:45.630> a<00:05:45.660> shot<00:05:45.900> of<00:05:46.050> this<00:05:46.170> thing

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
think that we had a shot of this thing

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.050 
think that we had a shot of this thing
we<00:05:46.560> may<00:05:46.770> actually<00:05:47.040> be<00:05:47.520> able<00:05:47.610> to<00:05:47.700> pull<00:05:47.910> off<00:05:47.940> a

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
we may actually be able to pull off a

00:05:48.060 --> 00:06:14.950 
we may actually be able to pull off a
big<00:05:48.390> win

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.510
