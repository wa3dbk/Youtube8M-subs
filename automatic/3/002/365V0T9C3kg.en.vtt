00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.760 
yes good morning today we are talking
about<00:00:02.280> shocks<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.300> struts<00:00:03.899> you<00:00:04.319> got<00:00:04.500> it<00:00:04.650> and

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
about shocks and struts you got it and

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.099 
about shocks and struts you got it and
Brian<00:00:05.100> bowersock<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.700> here<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:05.940> explain<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.930> me

know what that is what does that mean
okay<00:00:10.650> we're<00:00:10.800> talking<00:00:11.010> about<00:00:11.190> shocks<00:00:11.519> and

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
okay we're talking about shocks and

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.950 
okay we're talking about shocks and
struts<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:12.090> morning<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.540> there's<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.780> couple

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
struts this morning and there's a couple

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.480 
struts this morning and there's a couple
functions<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:13.650> are<00:00:13.799> very<00:00:13.920> important<00:00:14.370> on<00:00:14.460> a

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
functions that are very important on a

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.680 
functions that are very important on a
car<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.759> have<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.089> do<00:00:15.150> with<00:00:15.299> shocks<00:00:15.509> and

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
car that have to do with shocks and

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.390 
car that have to do with shocks and
struts<00:00:15.839> number<00:00:16.500> one<00:00:16.650> one<00:00:16.980> thing<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.279> you

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
struts number one one thing that you

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.680 
struts number one one thing that you
would<00:00:17.490> probably<00:00:17.880> notice<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.240> most<00:00:18.449> and

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
would probably notice the most and

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.900 
would probably notice the most and
driving<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.109> vehicle<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.590> your<00:00:19.800> ride<00:00:20.039> as<00:00:20.640> far

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
driving the vehicle is your ride as far

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.000 
driving the vehicle is your ride as far
as<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.119> car<00:00:21.330> makes<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.140> smooth<00:00:22.470> when<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.890> go

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
as the car makes the smooth when you go

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.009 
as the car makes the smooth when you go
over<00:00:23.100> potholes<00:00:23.430> or<00:00:24.029> bumps<00:00:24.539> or<00:00:24.720> things<00:00:24.930> like

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
over potholes or bumps or things like

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.589 
over potholes or bumps or things like
that<00:00:25.580> makes<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.760> car<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.449> doesn't

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
that makes the car so that it doesn't

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.390 
that makes the car so that it doesn't
continue<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.140> bounce<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.769> feel<00:00:28.949> kind<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.250> like

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
continue to bounce and feel kind of like

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.099 
continue to bounce and feel kind of like
a<00:00:29.429> boat<00:00:29.760> floating<00:00:30.269> down<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.420> road<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.990> this

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
a boat floating down the road and this

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.120 
a boat floating down the road and this
doesn't<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.529> anything<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.830> do<00:00:31.949> with<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
doesn't have anything to do with the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.389 
doesn't have anything to do with the
cars<00:00:32.340> alignment<00:00:32.820> well<00:00:33.600> um<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.620> doesn't<00:00:34.980> really

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
cars alignment well um it doesn't really

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.799 
cars alignment well um it doesn't really
have<00:00:35.700> anything<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.059> do<00:00:36.120> with<00:00:36.239> alignment<00:00:36.510> as

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
have anything to do with alignment as

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.510 
have anything to do with alignment as
long<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.170> all<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> bushings<00:00:37.620> are<00:00:38.040> fine<00:00:38.250> and

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
long as all the bushings are fine and

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
long as all the bushings are fine and
everything<00:00:38.850> with<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.059> shocks<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.420> struts

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
everything with the shocks and struts

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.940 
everything with the shocks and struts
there's<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.840> lot<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:39.989> integral<00:00:40.469> parts<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.920> go

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
there's a lot of integral parts that go

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.819 
there's a lot of integral parts that go
with<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.309> suspension<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.120> steering<00:00:42.239> and

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
with the suspension and steering and

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.740 
with the suspension and steering and
alignment<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:43.920> stuff<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:45.390> is

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
alignment and stuff like that so it is

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.690 
alignment and stuff like that so it is
part<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.350> system<00:00:46.620> when<00:00:47.010> structural

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
part of that system when structural

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.369 
part of that system when structural
replace<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.210> do<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.629> realign<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> car

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
replace you do have to realign a car

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.889 
replace you do have to realign a car
without<00:00:49.590> question<00:00:50.239> but<00:00:51.239> mainly<00:00:51.510> what<00:00:51.780> we're

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
without question but mainly what we're

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.720 
without question but mainly what we're
talking<00:00:52.170> about<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.469> one<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> big<00:00:53.430> safety

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
talking about is one of the big safety

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.040 
talking about is one of the big safety
things<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.480> do<00:00:54.570> with<00:00:54.719> worn-out

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
things that have to do with worn-out

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.290 
things that have to do with worn-out
shocks<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.590> struts<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.010> stability<00:00:56.820> and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
shocks and struts is stability and

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.389 
shocks and struts is stability and
safety<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.199> vehicle<00:00:58.649> because<00:00:59.160> what

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
safety of the vehicle because what

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.400 
safety of the vehicle because what
shocks<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.940> struts<00:01:00.120> do<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.750> they<00:01:00.960> keep<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
shocks and struts do is they keep the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.590 
shocks and struts do is they keep the
tires<00:01:01.620> flat<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> ground<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.359> driver

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
tires flat on the ground so the driver

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.060 
tires flat on the ground so the driver
keeps<00:01:03.840> really<00:01:04.170> good<00:01:04.320> control<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.920> vehicle

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
keeps really good control of the vehicle

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.760 
keeps really good control of the vehicle
so<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.700> adverse<00:01:06.030> weather<00:01:06.299> conditions<00:01:06.479> or<00:01:07.320> even

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
so in adverse weather conditions or even

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.530 
so in adverse weather conditions or even
on<00:01:07.860> dry<00:01:08.100> pavement<00:01:08.130> if<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.180> get<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> vehicle

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
on dry pavement if you get a vehicle

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.359 
on dry pavement if you get a vehicle
that<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> tires<00:01:10.710> were<00:01:10.920> bouncing<00:01:11.250> off<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
that the tires were bouncing off the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.560 
that the tires were bouncing off the
ground<00:01:11.670> all<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> time<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.299> harder<00:01:12.540> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
ground all the time it's harder to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.359 
ground all the time it's harder to
control<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.110> vehicle<00:01:13.260> how<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.040> tell<00:01:14.310> if

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
control the vehicle how can you tell if

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.980 
control the vehicle how can you tell if
it's<00:01:14.820> your<00:01:14.939> shocks<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.360> struts<00:01:15.509> that's<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
it's your shocks and struts that's the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.240 
it's your shocks and struts that's the
problem<00:01:16.170> well<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.799> should<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.009> them

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
problem well you should have them

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.469 
problem well you should have them
checked<00:01:17.490> regularly<00:01:17.670> when<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> vehicle<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.390> in

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
checked regularly when the vehicle is in

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.910 
checked regularly when the vehicle is in
for<00:01:18.720> service<00:01:19.049> whoever<00:01:19.290> serviced<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.770> your

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
for service whoever serviced in your

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.109 
for service whoever serviced in your
vehicle<00:01:20.250> should<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.549> checking<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.939> shocks

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
vehicle should be checking the shocks

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.880 
vehicle should be checking the shocks
and<00:01:21.330> struts<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.689> easy<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.049> check<00:01:22.290> we<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:22.860> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
and struts it's easy to check we do a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.590 
and struts it's easy to check we do a
balance<00:01:23.220> test<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.700> them<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.150> then<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.450> also

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
balance test on them and then we also

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.030 
balance test on them and then we also
check<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.080> make<00:01:25.200> sure<00:01:25.259> they're<00:01:25.530> not<00:01:25.650> leaking

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
check to make sure they're not leaking

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.770 
check to make sure they're not leaking
such<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.700> they<00:01:26.820> will<00:01:26.970> leak<00:01:27.090> out<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> seals

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
such as they will leak out of the seals

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.020 
such as they will leak out of the seals
and<00:01:28.470> shocks<00:01:28.799> or<00:01:29.009> struts<00:01:29.040> see<00:01:29.610> what<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:29.880> have

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
and shocks or struts see what we have

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.450 
and shocks or struts see what we have
here<00:01:30.420> these<00:01:30.630> are<00:01:30.840> brand<00:01:31.049> new<00:01:31.189> struts<00:01:32.189> but

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
here these are brand new struts but

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.679 
here these are brand new struts but
basically<00:01:32.850> there<00:01:33.060> are<00:01:33.090> two<00:01:33.150> different<00:01:33.570> kinds

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
basically there are two different kinds

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.780 
basically there are two different kinds
of<00:01:33.869> struts<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> cartridge<00:01:34.770> style<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
of struts is a cartridge style and the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.880 
of struts is a cartridge style and the
stylist<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.329> holds<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.869> spring<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.470> then

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
stylist that holds the spring and then

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.800 
stylist that holds the spring and then
we<00:01:38.040> actually<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.579> shocks<00:01:39.180> which<00:01:39.540> are<00:01:39.720> an

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
we actually have shocks which are an

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.899 
we actually have shocks which are an
older<00:01:40.110> style<00:01:40.350> are<00:01:40.650> used<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.040> most<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.520> pickup

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
older style are used on most like pickup

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.940 
older style are used on most like pickup
trucks<00:01:42.180> things<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.810> okay<00:01:43.380> here<00:01:43.829> you

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
trucks things like that okay here you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.380 
trucks things like that okay here you
have<00:01:44.070> somewhat<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.549> demo<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.119> want<00:01:45.270> yeah

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
have somewhat of a demo if you want yeah

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.330 
have somewhat of a demo if you want yeah
this<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> little<00:01:45.750> bit<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.020> demo<00:01:46.200> by<00:01:46.470> Monroe<00:01:46.829> m1

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
this a little bit of demo by Monroe m1

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.330 
this a little bit of demo by Monroe m1
is<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.670> bad<00:01:48.060> bad<00:01:48.540> shock<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:50.159> see

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
is a bad bad shock that you can see

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.910 
is a bad bad shock that you can see
there's<00:01:50.610> no<00:01:50.820> push<00:01:51.479> back<00:01:51.720> right<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.649> job<00:01:52.860> of

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
there's no push back right so the job of

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.580 
there's no push back right so the job of
a<00:01:53.220> shock<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.060> really<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.720> when<00:01:55.350> there's<00:01:55.530> a

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
a shock is really to when there's a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.800 
a shock is really to when there's a
bounce<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.159> puts<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.640> wheel<00:01:56.880> back<00:01:57.210> right<00:01:57.600> back

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
bounce it puts the wheel back right back

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.050 
bounce it puts the wheel back right back
to<00:01:57.990> where<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.259> should<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.649> ok<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.100> then<00:01:59.820> on<00:01:59.939> the

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
to where it should be ok so then on the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.990 
to where it should be ok so then on the
other<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.380> one's<00:02:01.560> hard<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.920> push<00:02:02.130> you'd

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
other is that one's hard to push you'd

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.609 
other is that one's hard to push you'd
see<00:02:03.240> how<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.450> close<00:02:03.719> right<00:02:04.020> back<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.409> where<00:02:04.560> it

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
see how to close right back to where it

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.160 
see how to close right back to where it
is<00:02:04.799> exactly<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.759> just<00:02:05.790> quick<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.810> can<00:02:06.840> get

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
is exactly so just quick you can get

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.320 
is exactly so just quick you can get
excessive<00:02:07.710> tire<00:02:07.979> wear<00:02:08.280> from<00:02:08.489> bad<00:02:08.670> shocks<00:02:09.030> and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
excessive tire wear from bad shocks and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.570 
excessive tire wear from bad shocks and
struts<00:02:09.569> excessive<00:02:10.530> suspension<00:02:11.099> component

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
struts excessive suspension component

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.949 
struts excessive suspension component
where<00:02:11.700> which<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.209> wear<00:02:12.360> things<00:02:12.540> out<00:02:12.690> over

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
where which can wear things out over

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.520 
where which can wear things out over
time

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
time

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.320 
time
so<00:02:13.860> that's<00:02:14.130> why<00:02:14.280> it's<00:02:14.459> very<00:02:14.490> important<00:02:15.270> to

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
so that's why it's very important to

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.059 
so that's why it's very important to
keep<00:02:15.660> an<00:02:15.810> eye<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:15.959> them<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.709> know<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:16.860> can

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
keep an eye on them you know you can

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.440 
keep an eye on them you know you can
save<00:02:17.250> yourself<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.610> lot<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.790> money<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.270> long

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
save yourself a lot of money in the long

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.820 
save yourself a lot of money in the long
run<00:02:18.480> how<00:02:18.959> often<00:02:19.230> do<00:02:19.440> they<00:02:19.530> need<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.680> be

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
run how often do they need to be

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.040 
run how often do they need to be
replaced<00:02:20.040> most<00:02:20.700> shocks<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.390> struts<00:02:21.630> will

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
replaced most shocks and struts will

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.660 
replaced most shocks and struts will
make<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.470> anywhere<00:02:22.830> from<00:02:23.010> 80<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.610> hundred

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
make it anywhere from 80 to a hundred

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.000 
make it anywhere from 80 to a hundred
thousand<00:02:24.300> miles<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:24.720> they<00:02:24.810> go<00:02:24.959> quite<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> Disney

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
thousand miles so they go quite a Disney

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.490 
thousand miles so they go quite a Disney
fiery<00:02:26.250> wreck<00:02:26.640> correct<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:28.200> know<00:02:28.290> unless

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
fiery wreck correct you know unless

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.140 
fiery wreck correct you know unless
there's<00:02:29.010> something<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.430> hits<00:02:29.730> one<00:02:30.030> and

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
there's something that hits one and

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.580 
there's something that hits one and
causes<00:02:30.480> damage<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.170> or<00:02:31.290> something<00:02:31.530> like

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
causes damage to it or something like

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.930 
causes damage to it or something like
that<00:02:31.650> then<00:02:31.920> obviously<00:02:32.100> that's<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:32.610> strange

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
that then obviously that's a strange

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.970 
that then obviously that's a strange
situation<00:02:33.239> but<00:02:34.020> for<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.350> most<00:02:34.500> part<00:02:34.650> they

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
situation but for the most part they

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.470 
situation but for the most part they
will<00:02:35.190> last<00:02:35.370> eighty<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:35.880> hundred<00:02:35.940> thousand

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
will last eighty to a hundred thousand

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.150 
will last eighty to a hundred thousand
miles<00:02:36.630> okay<00:02:37.020> and<00:02:37.230> if<00:02:37.530> there's<00:02:37.860> something

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
miles okay and if there's something

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.130 
miles okay and if there's something
wrong<00:02:38.310> with<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.550> shocks<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.060> struts<00:02:39.270> does<00:02:40.020> it

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
wrong with the shocks and struts does it

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.720 
wrong with the shocks and struts does it
damage<00:02:40.290> other<00:02:40.620> parts<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.040> vehicle<00:02:41.430> well

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
damage other parts of the vehicle well

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.370 
damage other parts of the vehicle well
it<00:02:41.880> can't<00:02:41.910> like<00:02:42.209> said<00:02:42.420> tire<00:02:42.690> wears<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:43.050> big
