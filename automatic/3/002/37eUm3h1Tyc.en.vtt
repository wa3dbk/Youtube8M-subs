was to move his skull back into place
very<00:01:04.260> gently<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.460> we<00:01:05.820> had<00:01:05.970> three<00:01:06.240> people<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.840> a

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.330 
the body so when visitors visit you'll
see<00:01:17.970> first<00:01:18.210> Hatcher<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.200> Triceratops<00:01:19.920> that

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
see first Hatcher the Triceratops that

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.130 
see first Hatcher the Triceratops that
greets<00:01:20.610> someone<00:01:20.970> they<00:01:21.090> enter<00:01:21.420> they'll<00:01:21.930> also

greets someone they enter they'll also

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.880 
greets someone they enter they'll also
see<00:01:22.439> Stan<00:01:22.830> -<00:01:23.430> Tyrannosaurus<00:01:23.729> Rex<00:01:24.479> poised<00:01:25.439> as

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
see Stan - Tyrannosaurus Rex poised as

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.880 
see Stan - Tyrannosaurus Rex poised as
if<00:01:26.070> he's<00:01:26.369> possibly<00:01:27.180> stalking<00:01:28.140> Hatcher

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
if he's possibly stalking Hatcher

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.130 
if he's possibly stalking Hatcher
so<00:01:29.369> Hatcher<00:01:29.579> better<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:30.060> careful<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.990> also

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
so Hatcher better be careful we also

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.810 
so Hatcher better be careful we also
have<00:01:31.439> an<00:01:31.590> Edmontosaurus<00:01:32.460> which<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
have an Edmontosaurus which is a

duck-billed dinosaur and visitors can
step<00:01:34.979> up<00:01:35.100> close<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.729> take<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.970> look<00:01:36.210> at<00:01:36.390> it's

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
step up close and take a look at it's

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.569 
step up close and take a look at it's
very<00:01:36.689> interesting<00:01:37.079> teeth<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.829> learn<00:01:38.310> more

very interesting teeth and learn more

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.789 
very interesting teeth and learn more
about<00:01:38.759> how<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.210> know<00:01:39.659> what<00:01:39.900> an<00:01:40.020> organism<00:01:40.560> eats

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799

by just looking closely at their teeth

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.289 
by just looking closely at their teeth
you'll<00:01:43.590> also<00:01:43.770> see<00:01:44.070> representations<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.149> what

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
you'll also see representations of what

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.969 
you'll also see representations of what

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the Late Cretaceous environment might

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.760 
the Late Cretaceous environment might
have<00:01:47.100> looked<00:01:47.369> like<00:01:47.430> they'll<00:01:48.060> see<00:01:48.770> volunteers

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
have looked like they'll see volunteers

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.410 
and then those fest same specimens will
go<00:02:01.110> into<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> display<00:02:02.070> case<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.850> outside<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
go into a display case just outside the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.030 
go into a display case just outside the
fossil<00:02:03.780> lab<00:02:03.810> you'll<00:02:04.409> also<00:02:04.590> get<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.009> learn

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
fossil lab you'll also get to learn

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.520 
fossil lab you'll also get to learn
about<00:02:05.360> how

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
about how

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.469 
about how
these<00:02:06.680> become<00:02:07.130> fossils<00:02:07.729> we<00:02:08.119> call<00:02:08.330> that

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
these become fossils we call that

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.290 
these become fossils we call that
taphonomy<00:02:08.959> so<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.950> study<00:02:10.220> of<00:02:10.310> what<00:02:10.700> fossils

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
taphonomy so the study of what fossils

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.970 
taphonomy so the study of what fossils
are<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:11.690> how<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:11.930> can<00:02:12.080> tell<00:02:12.410> how<00:02:12.590> old<00:02:12.620> they

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
are and how you can tell how old they

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.710 
are and how you can tell how old they
are<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.340> how<00:02:13.850> you<00:02:13.910> can<00:02:14.209> tell<00:02:14.390> how<00:02:14.660> the

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
are and how you can tell how the

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.900 
are and how you can tell how the
organism<00:02:15.319> died<00:02:15.560> and<00:02:16.010> what<00:02:16.400> happened<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.880> it

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
organism died and what happened to it

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.730 
organism died and what happened to it
after<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.450> fossil<00:02:17.840> was<00:02:17.930> deposited<00:02:18.560> on<00:02:18.680> the

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
after the fossil was deposited on the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.949 
after the fossil was deposited on the
ground<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.610> we<00:02:19.700> have<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:19.910> really<00:02:20.270> neat<00:02:20.660> an

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
ground and we have a really neat an

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.440 
ground and we have a really neat an
interactive<00:02:21.680> game<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.430> let<00:02:22.610> visitors<00:02:22.910> explore

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
interactive game to let visitors explore

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.170 
interactive game to let visitors explore
that<00:02:24.050> concept<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.640> last<00:02:25.880> American

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
that concept so the last American

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.110 
that concept so the last American
dinosaurs<00:02:26.900> exhibit<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:27.709> just<00:02:28.069> one<00:02:28.370> step<00:02:28.760> in

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
dinosaurs exhibit is just one step in

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.690 
dinosaurs exhibit is just one step in
one<00:02:29.300> small<00:02:29.840> part<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.319> a<00:02:30.770> much<00:02:30.800> bigger<00:02:31.310> project

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
one small part of a much bigger project

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.750 
one small part of a much bigger project
that<00:02:32.330> we<00:02:32.480> currently<00:02:32.810> call<00:02:33.200> deep<00:02:33.830> time<00:02:34.160> the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
that we currently call deep time the

that we currently call deep time the
deep<00:02:34.940> time<00:02:35.239> initiative<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.410> involves

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
deep time initiative and it involves

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.540 
deep time initiative and it involves
closing<00:02:37.550> our<00:02:38.030> current<00:02:38.420> fossil<00:02:38.810> halls
