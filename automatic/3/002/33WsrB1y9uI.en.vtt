00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
what is it Jenny cross-reference the DNA

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.940 
what is it Jenny cross-reference the DNA
against<00:05:12.760> one<00:05:12.970> more<00:05:13.240> planet<00:05:13.800> there's<00:05:14.800> no

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
against one more planet there's no

dragonflies bad days on earth oh yeah if
there<00:05:18.130> were<00:05:18.400> just<00:05:19.000> do<00:05:19.180> it<00:05:21.960> it's<00:05:22.960> a<00:05:23.140> match<00:05:23.460> this

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
there were just do it it's a match this

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.030 
there were just do it it's a match this
is<00:05:24.610> no<00:05:24.760> alien<00:05:24.940> dragonfly<00:05:25.690> it's<00:05:26.500> romantic
