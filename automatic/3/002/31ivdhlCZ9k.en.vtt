00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:08.040
 tv families donated part with our 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.860
 usual years sector devoted to 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.139
 controversy of the grand prix my dear live 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.859
 so this time we chose the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.560
 cardboard the first round with with the 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.449
 kobayashi strike with traffic jam 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.480
 who had and who has unfortunately 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.050
 eliminated and johnson button and nico 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.660
 rosberg 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.880
 so how are you analyzed 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.099
 this incident is listening 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.050
 good it's a thank you in this short if there is 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.300
 a departure they are four in front all 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.649
 the world is fighting for positions a 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.350
 some time there is one that you have 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.750
 the other one and in that case kobayashi gets 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.160
 felt threatened and unfortunately they 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.719
 all jason button and it's very 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.600
 unfortunate 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.480
 listen to me I still see that 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.860
 kobayashi there are km 200 straight lines and 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.690
 we saw that it's true 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.640
 is this first corner that comes pretty 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.500
 close to the starting line and that's 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.120
 rather at turn 3 at the very end 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.879
 of this long of a law that does when 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.799
 even 1 km 210 snow that's going on and 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.240
 we see that it happens with three or 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.159
 four front cars including 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.840
 in front of that of ideas we see that 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.250
 the first five anyway it's 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.700
 solid this experience because it 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.960
 pass anyway end but it goes 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.009
 roman grosjean him in the middle inevitably 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.750
 he has the leaf is tight and he is careful 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.100
 leaving rather finally even if he has 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.810
 got off to a good start he went away 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.580
 well out but does everything to avoid 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.400
 clash he almost got himself to the beasts 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.640
 it's not his fault he had to take 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.680
 the outside but can yes frankly him 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.200
 claims he may have been touched at 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.610
 the back then touched by whom I 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.640
 think it must be because by perez 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.409
 that he was actually there 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.720
 arrive a little fast anyway arrive 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.490
 all a little fast 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.530
 johnson himself brakes late and suddenly 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.290
 here is this unfortunate contact 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.329
 actually but leaving two 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.979
 on the floor but hey it's very 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.140
 unhappy but we tend to accuse 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.870
 kobayashi to have done 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.729
 mid May hamlets and all because 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.149
 jason button world champion he is 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.690
 the idiot trait in the fire of 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.610
 the action 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.020
 that said because yes same thing tomorrow I 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.780
 also look a little bit of a mess 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.060
 in the sense that they still have a 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.590
 good self we saw the sukkah it does 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.250
 a great race at suzuka and 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.440
 on the podium 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.870
 he's still on an ejection seat 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.190
 at least very uncomfortable at the top 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.459
 and there he takes a risk 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.989
 frankly that is useless now 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.050
 I think it's also perez who 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.340
 pushes him into this situation when we 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.320
 analyzes what's going on in the 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.720
 straight line and close braking 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.220
 if there was contact and that kobayashi 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.739
 was a little unbalanced what he 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.750
 pretends it's probably his 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.610
 own ethic and that we have lost 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.100
 do not like it always very much 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.530
 true that this limit limits between being 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.360
 a hero or be 1 0 we see one because 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.120
 that peruse it is not blue white there 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.790
 in this story and he escaped a 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.320
 big stress itself he gets hit 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.130
 left right while he was in 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.220
 true only in the village and in the background 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:12.019
 perez makes a run a little bit a little 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.570
 beauf finishes 11th so so so 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.810
 kobayashi which we treat of all 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.030
 names 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.620
 perret I think it's not all about 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.180
 made innocent in this story is 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.160
 finally wait for it while waiting for this 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.110
 pair is what at mclaren and 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.700
 kobayashi keita foot what's that so it's not 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.100
 not for reasons 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.470
 economic as we try to the 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.579
 often imply I believe that the 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.150
 teams also here is the side eupen gives of 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.340
 kobayashi 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.769
 it does not please big teams and even 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.870
 sum of the rapts be sacrificed on 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.670
 the altar of Mexican puzzles maybe 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.260
 but not those of perez in this case 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.370
 you are then actually good then 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.810
 we have a short memory 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.840
 because a week ago it was the 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.500
 hero he finishes third of the grand prize 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.290
 from japan in a way 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.970
 beautiful keeping johnson whose lady 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.170
 of years any damage night but it is him 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.450
 who is hara-kiri this time 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.370
 frankly for me it is 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.870
 unforgivable or in any case they are 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.400
 unforgivable in this case all 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.460
 two like bayard chile ap rÃ¨s because 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.070
 if actually peruse kobayashi touch 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.410
 but that's first of all been because of 10 that 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.940
 he's doing a little bit anonymous race in 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.040
 the meaning of how good it was you were maybe 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.650
 not very well adjusted because it affects 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.910
 anyway and I think that even in 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.400
 previous draws there has already been a 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.040
 contact with an india force not good them 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:31.230
 summary boys I find them sometimes a 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:34.410
 a little bit wild is good kobayashi there 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.390
 has a very very popular side because 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.910
 we like his style on his side 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.860
 spectacular banzai legrand of 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.970
 smugglers but in the meantime I think 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.110
 it's time it's been three years 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.970
 now it's welcome time and 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.720
 maturity and to show that he can 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.430
 pass 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.410
 steve plus there is one who is very 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.750
 popular priests is fashionable and 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.260
 for cause he signed at mclaren it's 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.360
 perez 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.400
 so we can ask ourselves with his 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.710
 performance sawtooth do 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.010
 it was a good choice from max 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.660
 Nagl 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.090
 because actually he did 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.060
 three podiums but for the rest of the 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.740
 times I find it lacks a little bit of 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:13.200
 few facts he signed at mclaren 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.419
 among others it's true and so I 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.800
 asks if maybe a hulkenberg or 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.220
 indirect had not been a better 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.110
 choice 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.970
 what do you think we've been 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.930
 actually surprised the choice of match 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.340
 the French No. 2 which I do not have a 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.750
 opinion sliced on it even though my 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.060
 I like this choice because I like 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.840
 well risk taking mclaren did 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.930
 to go and get a guy of 22 years 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:39.180
 even though here it has not exploded all the 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.400
 world in gp2 is itself rather dominated 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.680
 by maldonado the avenue where he does 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.580
 second championship and operates in 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.600
 so it's true he does three 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.169
 podiums know who is shopping 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.229
 great 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.520
 he is 22 years old so we must say that 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.650
 here I am I like the choice of 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.630
 mclaren and somewhere that amuses me too 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.960
 because ferrari did not dare to do this 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.920
 choice 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.530
 well we'll see next year if 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.970
 if it's not right or not it's true 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.280
 that it was the logic that ferrari the 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.110
 not take what they were in the 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.940
 the ferrari academy he was at his 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.580
 butter with a ferrari engine so in 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.080
 are waiting for a steering wheel at ferrari 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.450
 it was the right moment since massa 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.130
 had terrible performance against 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.570
 and then they do not take they do not 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.050
 find not good enough we wonder 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.660
 Why 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.310
 and then obviously mclaren puts the 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.020
 grapple on it and it's true that it has 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.310
 potential at twenty two years it is very 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.290
 well supported also so there are some 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.720
 synergies at the economic level who who 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.870
 can be done between telmex and 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.430
 vodafone so it makes sense here 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.140
 even though I know you have that at the end of 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.610
 weekend she and you favorite some 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.720
 weeks altogether I stop or di 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.110
 stayed because he's protected from 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.510
 mercedes 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.120
 well I say bravo to have mclaren 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.350
 dare to peruse and as for kobayashi I have not 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.480
 want her too bad for him because 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.830
 it was a bit hard but now it's 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.690
 he who has his destiny in the hands he 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.270
 must prove to first operates and 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.650
 maybe another employer and well 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.290
 that he can move on 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.370
 superior in f1 and not only 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.630
 succeed from time to time a blow 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.920
 as bright as suzuka 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.600
 even if it was a nice shot 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.400
 still you'll add that hey he has 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.300
 more to prove that we are going 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.370
 let go everyone knows his 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.060
 qualities and its faults it is known that 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.580
 he is an attacker 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:13.070
 what is sad is that it is that
