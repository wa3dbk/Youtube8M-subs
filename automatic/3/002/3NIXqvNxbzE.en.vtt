00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.510
 also this year we had the honor 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.869
 to try the highly anticipated vendutissimo 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.480
 extremely versatile it is brand new 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.740
 we talk about advanced warfare of which 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.500
 we tested the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.150
 multiplayer at the cologne gamescom 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.900
 unfortunately my gameplay went to work 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.759
 to fry 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.050
 so thank you frax for giving me the 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:36.149
 his and gabbo for sending it to me have 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.980
 2054 a group of terrorists called kv 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.540
 a decides to attack the lives of the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.130
 most developed populations in the world 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.440
 hitting by destroying the principals 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.960
 globe nuclear reactors included 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.400
 that of the united states a country at random 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.470
 within which the game will be 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.540
 set but today we are not here for 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.950
 talk about the story that will eventually be 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.800
 the classic america under attack 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.770
 america reacts america wins but of 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.180
 pure gameplay that of multi player 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.250
 we had about 50 minutes for 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.570
 try it practically seeing almost 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.040
 all the maps and most of them 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.409
 of equipment and weapons that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.119
 we will be able to use since the budget 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.390
 of the game and was probably split 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.380
 between colossal advertisements and spacey kevins 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.009
 thus saving on the licenses of the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.479
 weapons 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.159
 we will finally have the pleasure of putting 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.499
 hand on a nice stocked arsenal 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.409
 futuristic including both weapons from 

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:24.929
 classic fire the laser uses pp 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.090
 zep have been going a lot in recent years 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.369
 first and perhaps the only big news that 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.649
 we will meet in titan in advanced 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.509
 warfare and the double jump with 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.579
 possibility to change direction one 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.619
 time for air and then we will see a 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.689
 re map design and a thread also to 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.340
 classic gameplay of cod 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.869
 if we had a map situation before 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.549
 flat with a few steps for 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.350
 achieve favorable to useful places 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.469
 camping now a little improvement 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.539
 indeed the development of the 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.880
 more horizontal maps will be 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.829
 vertical in this case will be more 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.170
 difficult to be able to lurk for now 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.759
 at the same point and above all they will be 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.340
 more varied the directions of attack e 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.119
 group strategies 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.369
 despite the gameplay is always 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.049
 quite slow and far from that 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.819
 some arenas were however 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.310
 reintroduced by frenetic game modes 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.200
 tactical such as the capture the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.870
 flag the classic steals flag that 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.810
 it was fashionable on those loved ones alone 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.790
 although it is an evergreen mode not 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.920
 it is easy to be able to support it a lot with 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.930
 game speeds call of duty 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.250
 the maps are very varied and provide 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.560
 environments with different styles of play 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.270
 both the narrow ones are usable 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.360
 from where you can play the attack 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.099
 of giants among palaces and towers and those 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.450
 more extensive and with heights that 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.310
 will allow a game more or less 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.260
 classic with the difference that you will be 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.690
 skilled in knowing how to make good use of yours 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.850
 jumping ability or you will play shooting 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.400
 clay pigeon making the clay pigeon 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.470
 as for the weapons to be 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.330
 sincere removed some features of 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.970
 a couple of laser weapons and some why 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.110
 new classic, in fact, adapted 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.140
 futuristic we will have drones spy drones 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.370
 practically wally and laser one 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.380
 one of several substitutes for 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.330
 helicopters 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.290
 in short, believe me, I really don't know that 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.420
 else to say 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.819
 the multiplayer of cod and the multiplayer 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.290
 decode as you can see all that 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.810
 I found it again or otherwise 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.910
 fixed veil quoted earlier 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.410
 as in all our reviews this is 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.630
 all I have seen and felt the 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.700
 new call of duty advanced warfare a 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.190
 who followed the video the arduous sentence 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.680
 according to you although the engine change 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.299
 graph which to be honest if you do not 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.320
 they pointed out I wouldn't miss it 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.640
 shrewd 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.650
 this new chapter gives you 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.880
 the impression of a really new game and 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.579
 considerably differentiated 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.299
 from the rest of the saga after the previous one 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.370
 cod 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.709
 whose phantom title was given to 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.660
 indicate its advanced consistency 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.359
 warfare will really be a super giant 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.370
 modern or a robot vacuum cleaner for 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.209
 today the sentence we all meet again at 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.209
 next video
