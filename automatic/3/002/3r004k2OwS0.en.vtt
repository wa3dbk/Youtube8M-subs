really<00:00:53.879> easily<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:54.480> you're<00:00:54.719> really

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
really easily if you're really

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.840 
really easily if you're really
nonchalant<00:00:55.739> about<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.160> way<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.340> take<00:00:56.610> care

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850

then go to sleep but I would not

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.840 
then go to sleep but I would not
recommend<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:21.390> laying<00:01:21.720> down<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.670> as<00:01:23.670> you

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
can see I don't know if you can see that

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.370

I<00:01:25.680> dyed<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.340> ends<00:01:26.790> myself<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:28.080> plan<00:01:28.350> on

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
I dyed the ends myself and I plan on

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.460 
I dyed the ends myself and I plan on
dying<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.700> very<00:01:30.329> tips<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.930> bleach<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.380> that

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
dying the very tips of it bleach so that

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.200 
dying the very tips of it bleach so that
it's<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> nice<00:01:31.920> transition<00:01:32.130> from<00:01:32.670> bleach<00:01:32.970> to

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
it's a nice transition from bleach to

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.149 
it's a nice transition from bleach to
brown<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.689> black<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.500> didn't<00:01:34.829> want<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.040> do

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
brown to black but I didn't want to do

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.039 
brown to black but I didn't want to do
all<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.400> those<00:01:35.670> harsh<00:01:35.939> chemicals<00:01:36.119> at<00:01:36.630> one<00:01:36.840> time

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
all of those harsh chemicals at one time

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.149 
all of those harsh chemicals at one time
so<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.770> color<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.310> did

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
so this is the color that I did

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
some oil and shine and then I noticed

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.670 
some oil and shine and then I noticed
that<00:02:52.819> when<00:02:53.000> weave<00:02:53.389> is<00:02:53.599> wet<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:54.079> really<00:02:54.319> smells

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
that when weave is wet it really smells

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.800 
that when weave is wet it really smells
kind<00:02:54.920> of<00:02:54.950> terrible<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:55.940> for<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.209> I<00:02:56.269> used<00:02:56.660> the

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
kind of terrible so for that I used the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.740 
kind of terrible so for that I used the
Moroccan<00:02:57.290> perfection<00:02:58.190> by<00:02:58.370> organics<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.239> I

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
Moroccan perfection by organics and I

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.509 
Moroccan perfection by organics and I
mean<00:03:00.200> this<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.650> blowout<00:03:00.859> cream<00:03:01.280> but<00:03:01.489> I

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
mean this is the blowout cream but I

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.039 
mean this is the blowout cream but I
only<00:03:01.819> use<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.209> because<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.569> smells<00:03:02.690> really

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
only use it because it smells really

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.599 
only use it because it smells really
good<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:03.349> it's<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.739> lotion<00:03:04.099> so<00:03:04.220> I<00:03:04.280> guess<00:03:04.430> it's

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
good and it's a lotion so I guess it's

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.780 
good and it's a lotion so I guess it's
moisturizing<00:03:05.180> to<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.359> curls<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:06.349> then

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
moisturizing to the curls and then

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.670 
moisturizing to the curls and then
sometimes<00:03:07.790> not<00:03:08.120> often<00:03:08.630> I<00:03:08.810> used<00:03:09.109> the<00:03:09.349> Garnier

sometimes not often I used the Garnier

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.770 
sometimes not often I used the Garnier

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
not too long

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.020 
not too long
and<00:03:45.470> yeah<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:46.710> left<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.220> little<00:03:47.400> bit<00:03:47.550> of<00:03:47.610> my<00:03:47.790> hair

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
and yeah I left a little bit of my hair

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.260 
and yeah I left a little bit of my hair
out<00:03:48.090> but<00:03:48.480> it<00:03:48.600> blends<00:03:48.870> nicely<00:03:49.370> um<00:03:50.370> I<00:03:50.880> don't<00:03:51.060> have

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
out but it blends nicely um I don't have

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.450 
out but it blends nicely um I don't have
to<00:03:51.570> put<00:03:51.840> heat<00:03:52.020> on<00:03:52.050> it<00:03:52.350> even<00:03:52.770> if<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.100> just<00:03:53.280> come

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
to put heat on it even if I just come

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.280 
to put heat on it even if I just come
out<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.700> shower<00:03:53.730> because<00:03:54.090> this<00:03:54.930> is<00:03:55.050> a<00:03:55.110> more

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
out the shower because this is a more

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.990 
out the shower because this is a more
natural<00:03:55.740> look<00:03:55.920> so<00:03:55.950> it<00:03:56.460> doesn't<00:03:56.700> have<00:03:56.790> to<00:03:56.910> be

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
natural look so it doesn't have to be

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.850 
natural look so it doesn't have to be
super<00:03:57.150> straight<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:57.990> I<00:03:58.140> think<00:03:58.380> that<00:03:58.530> when<00:03:58.710> my

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
super straight and I think that when my

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.590 
super straight and I think that when my
hair<00:03:59.130> is<00:03:59.160> actually<00:03:59.400> frizzy<00:04:00.000> if<00:04:00.090> one's<00:04:00.360> and

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
hair is actually frizzy if one's and

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.340 
hair is actually frizzy if one's and
better<00:04:00.900> with<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.650> texture<00:04:02.190> so<00:04:02.450> I<00:04:03.450> really<00:04:04.080> love

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
better with the texture so I really love
