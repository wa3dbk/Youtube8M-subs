00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 I do not know if it is still very little use of the mobile phone that 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.170
 is a point of view 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.070
 Whatever appeared in a report in 1908 it is based on something 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.830
 but yes at the time it was not based on scientific knowledge 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.820
 indications only on suspicions and that is still a lot because since 13 are 39 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.310
 no new data added clean no research done 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.849
 Specifically focused on the sensitivity of children every municipality would be there at least 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.169
 half an hour like you can do 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.759
 we would also be interested 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.749
 and there are two reasons for the first reason is that 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:35.230
 still know very little about who the cell phones and what in general 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.850
 say, for example, drugs on a genetically modified organism 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.499
 beware, things are well out in advance 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:43.570
 before you apply it in general and that does not happen again 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.920
 and I think if you would then give a medical x commission says an angry one 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.820
 experiments or that evil could exist saying no to that 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.570
 the second reason is that we now know more about this mobile 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.540
 Phones 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.420
 And he first of all knows something about what happened when you got one 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.269
 tries to establish the find rating z would also become a significant one 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.120
 first on 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.590
 what do you think the health council should advise 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.880
 to the minister 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.170
 maric i would say the recession put a sticker on this kind of 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.650
 Phones 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.520
 health as on a pack of cigarettes 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.759
 the home basic the white canvas a lot steeper 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.170
 that there goes birthday singer and the courage to set up skater health 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.149
 I would say this case 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.020
 that uncertainty on the one hand 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.760
 because there is still not much better than the side that we know is in part 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.430
 entrusted 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.100
 So cookies from Contador said that a decision can at least be the sight 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.200
 but not to call more often 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.340
 but whatever and what happens in eersel 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.340
 with one that I don't understand anymore what I didn't do it at all 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.520
 exactly what we know is if you have the bronze to set 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.840
 five types of cells have been tested then you can always see that they are nothing 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.310
 changed and in particular that the material has changed hereditary material 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.880
 in the cell changed by cell phone 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.540
 yes in those crooks that have done its level a bit the site is more likely 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.869
 a single piece of buck or double-stranded beech lane and very technical 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.659
 means that if your ankles happen that you can go to cultivation that say that 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.729
 it a nice thing he probably does not function well so that if you have children 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.540
 his that he may possibly be looking for handicaps or call that we 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.119
 now know about citizen exposure to this kind of field 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:19.409
 That is done with people who have been using things for a long time 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.219
 Always research or done what are you seeing is that if you have more than ten years 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.439
 I called the cell phone that is here an increased chance of one 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.729
 acoustic euro order 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:30.299
 and that is what else is tumors ajar for adversely affected and as you see 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.979
 that that now around so I have been sitting on the side more often we have called well me 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:37.279
 I'm not sure if it's the rebels, but it's kind of like that 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:41.449
 to their car that shine right through except a child of 4 and 7 million 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:42.829
 must warn 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.469
 well on saying are all those studies that have been done so far 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.109
 if none none and there would be clear indications that something was going on 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.959
 May be those that are there after you changed in the same years that it 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.010
 He also researches a lot of their question marks and one of the 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.749
 for example, the case is that 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:04.219
 in some of the cases we are also found to be in a certain one 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:06.929
 radiation level and indeed damage occurs but at a high 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:08.849
 radiation level again not in that expected 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.080
 if that is indeed the case and a causal link is that with more radiation too 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.700
 more damage device is no further investigation made clear in one of 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.760
 The species will see that there are certain cell types not the one to cook 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.480
 think to turn the horse 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.080
 so the peak of the relationship is going to put the bus that is a hassle up the cell 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.640
 extra is rehearsed if more exposure is that there is some 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.639
 cases found 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.999
 this does not mean that we are also wrong, the only thing we can say is 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:34.070
 unfortunately it was not sorted out well in advance 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.159
 and what we know now 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:39.269
 is nevertheless a certain amount of a burden and behavioral change brand in europe afraid 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:43.869
 but there is a sandwich story it was that the transition to england 

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:46.809
 that can be seen is that peter takes a long time to call but then you talk about more than 5 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:47.669
 liters per day 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:52.809
 how do you know then there is more chances at 1,500 is one of the players under 17 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:55.809
 year is allowed to leave at fc utrecht 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:01.129
 This part of the members has a three-year-old toddler being given 11,000 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.419
 well that is what can be found or that the cockpit 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.169
 cosa connected this in it's tricky then you need to do more research for this 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.869
 In case my socks don't work it says that we don't have them all 

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:13.429
 longer and illegal it is about michal svec x a day so not if you have the 

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:16.680
 fifteen seconds per day as in the video 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.840
 The internet is also researching a heavy car and looked at it 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.160
 just as people are exposed to radiation as they come from a v6 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.590
 escapes that these types of complaints can develop 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.949
 yes there has never been found a causal connection no but well there has never been 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.669
 so long why not just anyway 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.279
 such a sticker on such a thing why don't you tell the minister that 

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.900
 that does 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.970
 for, among other things, giving the proximity that they don't look at me there anymore 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.919
 but generally and on the basis of scientific information 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.469
 Reynisson also visited his or below 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:49.479
 that leaves it to me to merge is simply not conclusive evidence in the meantime 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.370
 so I do 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.210
 for connection proof is no longer necessary by definition because it is not on 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.819
 to recommend the evidence that there is now unfortunately there is something 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:00.960
 users, we do not need a cent 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.029
 so neither 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:05.009
 but we do need some good retailers what you can do with such 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.009
 four years younger girls they will be a Nokia cell phone for now 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.320
 participation is not a matter of sustainability for the city 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.630
 find it out of dokkum 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:13.490
 control costs
