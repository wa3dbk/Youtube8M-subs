I<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.360> made<00:00:30.540> this<00:00:30.750> little<00:00:30.810> painting<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.770> I

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
I just made this little painting and I

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.160 
I just made this little painting and I
made<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.610> by<00:00:32.759> using<00:00:33.060> a<00:00:33.300> stencil<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.930> made

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
made it by using a stencil that I made

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.950 
made it by using a stencil that I made
now<00:00:34.860> once<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.790> made<00:00:35.970> the<00:00:36.000> pants<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.510> liked<00:00:36.930> that

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
now once I made the pants I liked that

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.380 
now once I made the pants I liked that
I'm<00:00:37.170> gonna<00:00:37.290> make<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.770> into<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> big<00:00:38.310> painting<00:00:38.579> so

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
I'm gonna make it into a big painting so

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.700 
I'm gonna make it into a big painting so
I<00:00:39.780> projected<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:41.430> stencil<00:00:42.030> onto<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:43.410> large

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
I projected the stencil onto a large

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.800 
I projected the stencil onto a large
piece<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.070> paper<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.820> then<00:00:45.270> cut<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.570> out<00:00:45.780> and

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
piece of paper and then cut it out and

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.710 
piece of paper and then cut it out and
so<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.200> can<00:00:46.350> see<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.530> now<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.830> a<00:00:47.370> big<00:00:48.030> stencil

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
so you can see I now have a big stencil

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.540 
so you can see I now have a big stencil
I<00:00:48.900> think<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:49.560> of<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> most<00:00:49.950> important<00:00:50.400> things

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
I think one of the most important things

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.880 
I think one of the most important things
you<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.180> do<00:00:51.450> to<00:00:51.570> become<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> better<00:00:52.140> artist<00:00:52.500> is

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
you can do to become a better artist is

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.160 
you can do to become a better artist is
to<00:00:53.550> look<00:00:53.790> at<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> lot<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.420> art<00:00:54.690> whether<00:00:54.930> that's

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
to look at a lot of art whether that's

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.800 
to look at a lot of art whether that's
painting<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.800> sculpture<00:00:56.100> or<00:00:56.580> furniture<00:00:57.390> design

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
painting a sculpture or furniture design

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.630 
painting a sculpture or furniture design
what<00:00:58.470> you're<00:00:58.650> doing<00:00:58.950> is<00:00:59.130> you're<00:00:59.400> increasing

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
what you're doing is you're increasing

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.930 
what you're doing is you're increasing
your<00:01:00.300> visual<00:01:00.930> vocabulary<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.670> gives<00:01:02.850> you

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
your visual vocabulary and it gives you

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.369 
your visual vocabulary and it gives you
something<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.300> draw<00:01:03.600> from<00:01:03.900> when<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.170> go<00:01:04.320> to

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
something to draw from when you go to

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.370 
something to draw from when you go to
create<00:01:04.769> something<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.280> your<00:01:05.460> own<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.380> it's

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
create something of your own and it's

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.069 
create something of your own and it's
not<00:01:07.610> copying<00:01:08.610> what<00:01:08.909> you're<00:01:09.060> doing<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.570> you're

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
not copying what you're doing is you're

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:12.530 
not copying what you're doing is you're
borrowing<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:11.009> a<00:01:11.430> continuation<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.299> if<00:01:12.450> you

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
borrowing it's a continuation and if you

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.380 
borrowing it's a continuation and if you
think<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.869> art<00:01:13.079> art<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.159> continuum<00:01:15.149> and<00:01:15.299> if

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
think of art art is a continuum and if

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.419 
think of art art is a continuum and if
you<00:01:15.569> look<00:01:15.689> at<00:01:15.810> music

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429 
you look at music

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:19.279 
you look at music
like<00:01:17.429> for<00:01:17.700> instance<00:01:17.729> Led<00:01:18.450> Zeppelin<00:01:18.899> you

remnants of Robert Johnson and a really

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.340 
remnants of Robert Johnson and a really
good<00:01:25.170> quote<00:01:25.499> from<00:01:26.189> frank<00:01:26.490> stella<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:27.350> artists

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
good quote from frank stella is artists

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.249 
good quote from frank stella is artists
paint<00:01:28.859> other<00:01:29.429> people's<00:01:30.090> paintings<00:01:30.420> until

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
paint other people's paintings until

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.450 
paint other people's paintings until
they<00:01:31.350> get<00:01:31.469> bored<00:01:31.770> with<00:01:31.889> it<00:01:32.039> and<00:01:32.219> then<00:01:32.340> they

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
they get bored with it and then they

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.039 
they get bored with it and then they
paint<00:01:32.700> their<00:01:32.880> own<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.689> think<00:01:33.869> there's<00:01:33.990> a

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
paint their own and I think there's a

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.050 
paint their own and I think there's a
lot<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.289> truth<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.850> before<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:35.939> go

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
lot of truth to that before we go

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.149 
lot of truth to that before we go
downstairs<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.810> start<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.229> work<00:01:37.469> on<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.979> big

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
downstairs and start to work on that big

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.859 
downstairs and start to work on that big
painting<00:01:38.609> I<00:01:38.789> wanted<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.509> show<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.719> these

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
painting I wanted to show you these

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.870 
painting I wanted to show you these
three<00:01:40.170> drawings<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.829> famous<00:01:41.280> artists<00:01:41.729> work

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
now in made drawings of their work

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.590 
now in made drawings of their work
because<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.729> don't<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:44.939> what<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.090> copyright

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
because I don't know what the copyright

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.569 
because I don't know what the copyright
laws<00:01:45.780> are<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.319> I<00:01:46.350> figure<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.009> don't<00:01:47.490> have

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579

laws are so I figure I don't have
anything<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.090> worry<00:01:48.359> about<00:01:48.420> because<00:01:48.719> I<00:01:48.899> drew

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
anything to worry about because I drew

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.669 
anything to worry about because I drew
them<00:01:49.499> so<00:01:50.249> anyway<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.630> drawing<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.319> a

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
water before I start spraying I thought

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.220 
water before I start spraying I thought
I'd<00:04:52.580> show<00:04:52.790> you<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:53.060> turbine<00:04:53.510> sprayer<00:04:53.930> that<00:04:54.020> I
