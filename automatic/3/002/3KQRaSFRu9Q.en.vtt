00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
I've I think I think it'd be a big they

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.280 
I've I think I think it'd be a big they
might<00:03:21.060> even<00:03:21.209> get<00:03:21.359> big<00:03:21.540> Erick<00:03:21.630> celebrating<00:03:22.230> if

might even get big Erick celebrating if

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.170 
might even get big Erick celebrating if
the<00:03:22.410> real<00:03:22.620> heavy<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.400> has<00:03:23.489> come<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:23.820> for<00:03:23.970> him<00:03:24.090> in

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
the real heavy it has come in for him in

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.180 
the real heavy it has come in for him in
that<00:03:24.209> Excel<00:03:24.570> abrasion<00:03:24.930> goes<00:03:25.109> out<00:03:25.380> well<00:03:26.100> it's

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
that Excel abrasion goes out well it's

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.830 
that Excel abrasion goes out well it's
going<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.370> be<00:03:26.430> interesting<00:03:26.579> on<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:27.570> you

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
going to be interesting on that and you

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.120 
going to be interesting on that and you
know<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:27.989> don't<00:03:28.140> think<00:03:28.290> it's<00:03:28.530> particularly<00:03:28.980> a

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
know I don't think it's particularly a

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.699 
know I don't think it's particularly a
rest<00:03:29.310> of<00:03:29.459> abating<00:03:29.700> but<00:03:30.049> let's<00:03:31.049> hope<00:03:31.230> Frankel

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
rest of abating but let's hope Frankel

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.080 
rest of abating but let's hope Frankel
succeeds<00:03:32.160> unless<00:03:32.400> you've<00:03:32.640> backed<00:03:32.880> a

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
succeeds unless you've backed a

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.170 
succeeds unless you've backed a
celebration<00:03:33.720> of<00:03:33.900> course
