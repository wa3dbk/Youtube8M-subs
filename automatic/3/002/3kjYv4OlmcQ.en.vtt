00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
can go into any old beyblade take it off

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:45.640 
can go into any old beyblade take it off
of<00:03:38.600> here<00:03:42.910> if<00:03:43.910> it<00:03:44.090> does<00:03:44.300> that<00:03:44.570> oh<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:45.320> don't<00:03:45.470> think

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
of here if it does that oh I don't think

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.240 
of here if it does that oh I don't think
it's<00:03:45.980> too<00:03:46.160> small<00:03:46.430> it's<00:03:46.820> a<00:03:47.620> twister<00:03:48.620> ok<00:03:48.980> yeah

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
it's too small it's a twister ok yeah

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:58.030 
it's too small it's a twister ok yeah
well<00:03:49.490> I<00:03:49.640> figured<00:03:49.760> I<00:03:50.120> try<00:03:54.280> alright<00:03:55.280> so<00:03:56.890> so<00:03:57.890> we've

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
well I figured I try alright so so we've

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:06.570 
well I figured I try alright so so we've
got<00:04:03.400> have<00:04:04.400> no<00:04:04.730> idea<00:04:04.940> what<00:04:05.030> these<00:04:05.150> are<00:04:05.330> called

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
got have no idea what these are called

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.790 
got have no idea what these are called
let's<00:04:07.580> see<00:04:07.910> this<00:04:08.320> I'm<00:04:09.320> going<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.560> call<00:04:09.680> the

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
let's see this I'm going to call the

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.340 
let's see this I'm going to call the
face<00:04:10.010> bold<00:04:10.370> but<00:04:13.060> this<00:04:14.060> is<00:04:14.180> the<00:04:14.300> spirit<00:04:14.840> axle

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
face bold but this is the spirit axle

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.539 
face bold but this is the spirit axle
and<00:04:15.620> this<00:04:15.950> is<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:16.250> spirit<00:04:16.609> shield<00:04:18.340> goes<00:04:19.340> in

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
and this is the spirit shield goes in

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.000 
and this is the spirit shield goes in
here<00:04:20.090> not<00:04:20.630> sure<00:04:20.660> how<00:04:20.900> this<00:04:21.019> works<00:04:21.290> on<00:04:21.560> going

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
here not sure how this works on going

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.090 
here not sure how this works on going
through<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.250> instructions<00:04:23.530> very<00:04:24.530> noobish

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
through the instructions very noobish

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.450 
through the instructions very noobish
but<00:04:25.490> oh<00:04:25.700> wait<00:04:26.600> now<00:04:26.780> this<00:04:27.230> is<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.410> shield<00:04:28.300> yeah

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
but oh wait now this is the shield yeah

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.210 
but oh wait now this is the shield yeah
all<00:04:31.460> right<00:04:31.820> and<00:04:32.120> then<00:04:32.450> this<00:04:32.750> is<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.220> energy

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
all right and then this is the energy

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.490 
all right and then this is the energy
core<00:04:34.669> this<00:04:35.180> goes<00:04:35.419> into<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.720> energy<00:04:36.050> core<00:04:37.390> then

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
core this goes into the energy core then

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.770 
core this goes into the energy core then
this<00:04:39.500> is<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:39.710> attack<00:04:40.610> gear<00:04:41.770> let<00:04:42.770> me<00:04:43.600> put<00:04:44.600> that

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
this is the attack gear let me put that

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.000 
this is the attack gear let me put that
in<00:04:47.830> try

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
in try

00:04:50.010 --> 00:05:02.080 
in try
huh<00:04:51.690> well<00:04:52.690> this<00:04:52.930> is<00:04:53.140> very<00:04:55.320> tough

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:13.060 

I<00:05:02.290> wonder<00:05:03.290> if<00:05:05.290> hmm<00:05:08.320> let's<00:05:09.320> see<00:05:11.199> let's<00:05:12.199> try<00:05:12.830> me

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
I wonder if hmm let's see let's try me

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.330 
I wonder if hmm let's see let's try me
the<00:05:13.220> instructions<00:05:13.490> instead<00:05:14.979> all<00:05:15.979> right<00:05:16.100> so

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
the instructions instead all right so

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.450 
the instructions instead all right so
you<00:05:16.400> take<00:05:16.669> place<00:05:17.419> spirit<00:05:18.139> shield<00:05:18.470> on<00:05:18.770> spirit

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
you take place spirit shield on spirit

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.040 
you take place spirit shield on spirit
axle<00:05:21.190> like<00:05:22.190> that<00:05:22.430> all<00:05:22.850> right<00:05:23.120> make<00:05:24.020> sure

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
axle like that all right make sure

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.490 
axle like that all right make sure
spirit<00:05:24.710> shield<00:05:24.949> sets<00:05:25.520> flushing<00:05:26.300> axel<00:05:26.810> axel

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
spirit shield sets flushing axel axel
