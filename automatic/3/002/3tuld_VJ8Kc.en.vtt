the RAM is great the space of course is

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.230 
the RAM is great the space of course is
a<00:01:08.159> headache<00:01:08.430> because<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.790> still<00:01:08.970> doesn't<00:01:09.150> have

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
a headache because it still doesn't have

routing<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.180> little<00:02:33.510> bit<00:02:33.600> harder<00:02:33.930> than<00:02:33.960> it

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
routing is a little bit harder than it

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.890

was<00:02:34.530> with<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.770> blue<00:02:34.950> studio<00:02:35.600> that<00:02:36.600> was<00:02:36.720> easy

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
was with the blue studio that was easy

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.140

the<00:02:37.290> blue<00:02:37.470> studio<00:02:37.800> 5.3<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.520> was<00:02:38.610> able<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.850> rooted

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
the blue studio 5.3 I was able to rooted

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.240 
the blue studio 5.3 I was able to rooted
in<00:02:39.330> like<00:02:39.480> five<00:02:39.720> minutes<00:02:39.960> this<00:02:40.920> one<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.190> think

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
in like five minutes this one I think

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.050 
in like five minutes this one I think
they<00:02:41.520> got<00:02:41.610> smarter<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.350> can't<00:02:43.350> really<00:02:43.470> ruin<00:02:43.830> it

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
they got smarter I can't really ruin it

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.660 
they got smarter I can't really ruin it
let's<00:02:45.060> check<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.360> hardware<00:02:46.340> we're<00:02:47.340> using<00:02:47.490> the
