 video today I bring you a small video on 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.619
 where we will see a sit that seems very 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.419
 interesting where we will find a 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.189
 village in the middle of the snow for it 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.630
 we're just going to put the number of the 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.279
 cip which I'm going to leave in the 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.750
 description of the video also the truth 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:37.000
 which 148 80 38 13 we are going to create the 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.910
 world and we will find the village in the middle 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.150
 of snow the world is charging and 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.300
 well we are here where we have the 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.300
 side 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.130
 where next we have a mountain 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.380
 Well, let's just go to 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.580
 let's go around the mountain and 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.580
 we will find the village 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.940
 the biome that we have here is the biome 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.580
 it is the mountain language 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.530
 and next we have the snow biome a 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.740
 very interesting and very beautiful biome that 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.650
 I liked it a lot and here we have 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.830
 is this 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.480
 well it's the first time I see a 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.910
 village in the middle of the snow here we have 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.530
 the farms and something very interesting that 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.750
 It seems to me that the water was 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.430
 turned into ice 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.650
 here we have one of the villagers who 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.890
 he has worried because they are worried 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.890
 and not 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.020
 we have the frozen water we are in 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.679
 means environment 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.950
 the potato farms on these sides 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:43.119
 we have 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.119
 carrot and if I'm not wrong 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.719
 carrot carrot the potato farm 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.230
 the wheat and we have the village in the middle of 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:55.990
 the snow to travel a little water 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.460
 we are more to find the 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.040
 chest 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.680
 the chest and another thing that I thought was very 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.000
 interesting is that where is the 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.170
 cocktail 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.170
 let's go from that place 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.540
 this house as you listen listen 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.880
 it's catching fire is something that 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.600
 it seemed extremely strange is it 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.600
 burning 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.260
 let's light 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.840
 we have the chest where we are going to 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.300
 find 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.180
 iron ingots that I already picked it up and something 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.380
 that I thought was very strange is 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.570
 we will find a saddle to ride 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.200
 what I'm not sure is that if 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.780
 we can ride in minecraft and 0.10 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.910
 point 4 and good another thing that I thought 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.400
 very interesting about this language and 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.160
 of these and are the ice floes that 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.560
 we found something that I thought was very 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.420
 but very, very good these icebergs 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.700
 of ice that are practically in the 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.430
 most of the map and it's something that 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.020
 it looked very nice very interesting and 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.000
