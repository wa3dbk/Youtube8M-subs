00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.150 
Park over breakfast I was checking the
weather<00:00:18.480> forecast<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.230> Orange<00:00:19.650> County<00:00:19.949> had<00:00:20.130> a

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
weather forecast and Orange County had a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.130

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
unusual for August so I thought that

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.420 
unusual for August so I thought that

desert<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.820> sure<00:00:27.660> enough<00:00:27.689> when<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.140> check<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
desert and sure enough when I check the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.470 
desert and sure enough when I check the
forecast<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.519> said<00:00:29.730> there<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:29.970> likely<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.390> be

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480

develop them a little bit longer that's

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.309 
develop them a little bit longer that's
going<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.310> add<00:02:11.430> some<00:02:11.610> contrast<00:02:12.200> some<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.260> you

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
going to add some contrast some of you

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.690 
going to add some contrast some of you
film<00:02:13.500> shooters<00:02:13.830> out<00:02:13.950> there<00:02:14.130> may<00:02:14.280> know<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.549> is

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
film shooters out there may know that is

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.059 
film shooters out there may know that is
push<00:02:14.910> processing<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:16.410> pretty<00:02:16.590> similar<00:02:16.799> it's

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
push processing it's pretty similar it's

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.620 
push processing it's pretty similar it's
not<00:02:17.160> exactly<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.670> same<00:02:17.880> but<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.180> pretty

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
not exactly the same but a pretty

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.110 
not exactly the same but a pretty
similar<00:02:18.810> process<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.470> I'm<00:02:20.430> using<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.790> yellow

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
similar process and I'm using the yellow

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.690 
similar process and I'm using the yellow
number<00:02:21.450> 15<00:02:21.810> filter<00:02:22.170> dark<00:02:22.500> yellow<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.950> that's

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
number 15 filter dark yellow and that's

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.059 
number 15 filter dark yellow and that's
giving<00:02:23.910> me<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.000> little<00:02:24.180> bit<00:02:24.269> more<00:02:24.480> contrast

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
giving me a little bit more contrast

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.990 
giving me a little bit more contrast
because<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.250> dirt<00:02:26.430> here<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.730> kind<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:26.940> a

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
because the dirt here is kind of a

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.699 
because the dirt here is kind of a
yellowish<00:02:27.239> tone<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.019> fog<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.410> kind<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.650> a

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
yellowish tone and the fog is kind of a

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.229 
yellowish tone and the fog is kind of a
bluish<00:02:28.920> tone<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.519> think<00:02:29.819> it's<00:02:30.060> going<00:02:30.209> to

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
bluish tone so I think it's going to

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.670 
bluish tone so I think it's going to
make<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.600> dirt<00:02:30.959> stand<00:02:31.260> out<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.440> little<00:02:31.530> more

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
make the dirt stand out a little more

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.550 
make the dirt stand out a little more
and<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.340> fog<00:02:32.549> go<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.790> little<00:02:32.940> bit<00:02:33.120> darker

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
and the fog go a little bit darker

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.319 
and the fog go a little bit darker
hopefully<00:02:34.560> it'll<00:02:34.650> work<00:02:34.769> out<00:02:34.950> but<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:36.150> kind

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
hopefully it'll work out but it's kind

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:37.670 
hopefully it'll work out but it's kind
of<00:02:36.359> a<00:02:36.420> tricky<00:02:36.630> situation<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:37.230> pretty<00:02:37.350> flat

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
of a tricky situation is pretty flat

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.199 
of a tricky situation is pretty flat
lighting<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.340> I'm<00:02:38.459> just<00:02:38.640> having<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.060> work

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
lighting so I'm just having to work

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:47.229 
lighting so I'm just having to work
pretty<00:02:39.420> hard<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.690> bring<00:02:40.109> in<00:02:40.200> some<00:02:40.380> contrast

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.789 

I'm<00:02:48.239> really<00:02:48.720> pleased<00:02:49.019> with<00:02:49.200> how<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.410> overall

I'm really pleased with how the overall
vibe<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.459> these<00:02:50.640> photos<00:02:51.000> turned<00:02:51.239> out<00:02:51.450> I'd<00:02:52.200> say

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.050 
vibe of these photos turned out I'd say
my<00:02:52.560> only<00:02:52.859> regret<00:02:53.160> for<00:02:53.280> these<00:02:53.370> photos<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:53.850> that

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
I didn't take more Joshua trees in fog

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.259 
I didn't take more Joshua trees in fog

was<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:10.409> same<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:11.459> was<00:04:11.609> a<00:04:11.639> tree<00:04:12.150> smack-dab<00:04:12.599> in

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
was the same it was a tree smack-dab in

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.490 
was the same it was a tree smack-dab in
the<00:04:12.930> center<00:04:13.019> wide<00:04:13.950> open<00:04:14.250> aperture<00:04:14.750> fog<00:04:15.750> fading

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
the center wide open aperture fog fading

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.249 
the center wide open aperture fog fading
out<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.769> background<00:04:16.979> into<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.609> distance<00:04:18.000> so

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:18.259 
out the background into the distance so

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.479 
out the background into the distance so
going<00:04:19.259> for<00:04:19.410> all<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.590> same<00:04:19.799> so<00:04:19.979> I<00:04:20.039> can<00:04:20.190> see<00:04:20.340> how

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
going for all the same so I can see how

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.700 
going for all the same so I can see how
different<00:04:20.729> trees<00:04:21.479> look<00:04:21.840> in<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.380> composition

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
different trees look in that composition

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.339 
different trees look in that composition
and<00:04:23.159> like<00:04:23.849> I<00:04:23.880> said<00:04:24.180> earlier<00:04:24.479> think<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.139> might

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
and like I said earlier think it might

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.310 
and like I said earlier think it might
be<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.500> good<00:04:25.650> triptych<00:04:26.150> but<00:04:27.150> I'm<00:04:27.389> starting<00:04:28.289> to

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
be a good triptych but I'm starting to

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.649 
be a good triptych but I'm starting to
rain<00:04:28.470> on<00:04:28.500> me<00:04:28.740> I<00:04:28.919> need<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:29.340> get<00:04:29.460> some<00:04:29.639> lunch<00:04:29.820> but

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:30.659 
rain on me I need to get some lunch but

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.810 
rain on me I need to get some lunch but
that's<00:04:30.840> one<00:04:30.990> roll<00:04:31.169> down<00:04:31.349> who<00:04:32.250> knows<00:04:32.430> how<00:04:32.610> many

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
that's one roll down who knows how many

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.430 
that's one roll down who knows how many
to<00:04:32.940> go<00:04:32.970> I<00:04:33.120> still<00:04:33.389> got<00:04:33.570> a<00:04:33.599> whole<00:04:33.750> day<00:04:33.930> left<00:04:34.139> so

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
to go I still got a whole day left so

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.920 
to go I still got a whole day left so
see<00:04:34.949> what<00:04:35.070> else<00:04:35.220> we<00:04:35.340> can<00:04:35.370> get<00:04:38.630> up<00:04:39.630> in<00:04:39.840> the

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
see what else we can get up in the

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.719 
see what else we can get up in the
higher<00:04:40.110> elevations<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:40.860> park<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.370> storm

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
higher elevations of the park the storm

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.000 
higher elevations of the park the storm
was<00:04:41.880> breaking<00:04:42.300> up<00:04:42.419> which<00:04:43.080> resulted<00:04:43.560> in<00:04:43.710> some

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
was breaking up which resulted in some

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.430 
was breaking up which resulted in some
amazing<00:04:44.970> cloud<00:04:45.180> formations<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:45.900> some<00:04:46.080> really

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
amazing cloud formations and some really

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.909 
amazing cloud formations and some really
dramatic<00:04:46.560> light<00:04:47.039> I<00:04:47.419> ended<00:04:48.419> up<00:04:48.510> making<00:04:48.659> two<00:04:49.169> six

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
dramatic light I ended up making two six

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.170 
dramatic light I ended up making two six
by<00:04:50.039> seventeen<00:04:50.520> black-and-white

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
by seventeen black-and-white

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.600 
by seventeen black-and-white
compositions<00:04:51.960> that<00:04:52.229> I'm<00:04:52.550> just<00:04:53.550> really

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610

pleased<00:04:54.419> with<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:55.770> textures<00:04:56.280> were<00:04:56.430> so<00:04:56.699> rich

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000
