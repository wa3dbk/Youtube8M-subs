00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
- How would you describe a salmon strike for someone who still haven't had one?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Oh what is that for a question just after.. well, I don't know how to describe it.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.800
- All right let me rephrase it. How would you desribe the feeling now just after you have landed a 10 kilo salmon?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Euhm, well I'm sort of feeling a little exhausted. 
It's like a serious challenge both physically and mentally.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Euhm, and everything was like it was supposed to be like. 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.000
At first, it felt awesome!

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.700
- Ted Logart! What's  up?
- What's going on?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Well its early june in Sweden.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Well, it looks like shining silver eh?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.500
... and then you feel miserable, 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.000
... the fish take the advantage,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
... there are evil rapis everywhere.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.500
... and you don't have a clue of how in the mother of earth you are going to land the bastard.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.010
That must have been a sight?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
... and then all of a sudden, you sit there with the fish in your arms and well,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I must say the feeling is pretty awesome...

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
- Hey hey Ted, what have you got there?

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.000
Well I don't know, what is it?

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.000
- Well show it to us then!

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.050
I think it's a 96 centimeter shining salmon.
An insanely healthy fish!

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.500
- It left eh?
Yes and it draged me along as well.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
- How was it like?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
It was crazy and insanely cool!

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Crazy, cool and epic at the same time!

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Yes it was cool.
- Oh yes!

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And the coolest thing about it is that you can't process what's happening in the moment. Its like a blur.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.000
It might take years...

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.000
Many years most likely before.. well I will experience a salmon strike again.
