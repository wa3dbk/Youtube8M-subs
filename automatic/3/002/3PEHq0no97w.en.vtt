00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
smaller and and you start it down by the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.889 
smaller and and you start it down by the
base<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.630> hook<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.799> just<00:02:02.840> start<00:02:03.840> by

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
base of the hook and you just start by

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:11.600 
base of the hook and you just start by
wrapping<00:02:05.930> this<00:02:06.930> around<00:02:07.910> and<00:02:10.400> continue<00:02:11.400> to

wrap it around

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.680 
wrap it around
and<00:02:14.450> every<00:02:15.410> so<00:02:15.680> often<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.220> can<00:02:16.700> kind<00:02:17.600> of

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
and every so often you can kind of

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.200 
and every so often you can kind of
squeeze<00:02:17.990> it<00:02:18.410> together<00:02:18.940> but<00:02:19.940> if<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.720> just<00:02:21.590> keep

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
squeeze it together but if you just keep

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.570 
squeeze it together but if you just keep
wrapping<00:02:23.210> that<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.410> have<00:02:24.740> just<00:02:25.070> a<00:02:25.280> little

wrapping that and I have just a little
bit<00:02:25.850> of<00:02:26.180> trouble<00:02:26.660> here<00:02:26.960> with<00:02:27.670> shaky<00:02:28.670> hands<00:02:29.450> but

and<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:50.110> then<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:51.950> can<00:02:52.280> clip<00:02:52.760> this<00:02:53.090> off<00:02:53.330> and

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
and and then you can clip this off and

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.920 
and and then you can clip this off and
you'll<00:02:54.770> have<00:02:55.070> a<00:02:55.100> look<00:02:55.790> that's<00:02:56.090> just<00:02:56.300> covered

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
you'll have a look that's just covered

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.720 
you'll have a look that's just covered
now<00:02:57.590> I've<00:02:57.800> made<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.190> couple<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.209> mistakes<00:02:59.440> here

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
now I've made a couple of mistakes here

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.360 
now I've made a couple of mistakes here
if<00:03:01.730> if<00:03:02.180> my<00:03:02.300> hands<00:03:03.080> weren't<00:03:03.320> shaky<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.220> my

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
if if my hands weren't shaky and my

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.050 
if if my hands weren't shaky and my
younger<00:03:04.910> days<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.570> could<00:03:05.810> wrap<00:03:06.140> that<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:07.060> have

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
younger days I could wrap that and have

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.170 
younger days I could wrap that and have
it<00:03:08.090> really<00:03:08.600> smooth<00:03:08.990> now<00:03:09.680> what<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.220> do<00:03:10.550> is<00:03:10.910> you

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
it really smooth now what you do is you

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.870 
it really smooth now what you do is you
just<00:03:12.220> clip<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.250> off<00:03:13.580> right<00:03:13.940> here<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:15.670> what<00:03:16.670> you

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
just clip it off right here and what you

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.720 
just clip it off right here and what you
might<00:03:17.060> do<00:03:17.390> is<00:03:17.600> is<00:03:17.959> put<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.470> little<00:03:18.920> bit<00:03:19.070> of<00:03:19.430> wire

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
might do is is put a little bit of wire

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.620 
might do is is put a little bit of wire
down<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:21.290> wrap<00:03:21.560> a<00:03:21.590> couple<00:03:22.430> more<00:03:22.820> times<00:03:23.120> going

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
down and wrap a couple more times going

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.310 
down and wrap a couple more times going
back<00:03:23.959> down<00:03:24.820> so<00:03:25.820> that<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.209> wire<00:03:26.420> doesn't<00:03:27.050> come

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
back down so that the wire doesn't come

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:35.140 
back down so that the wire doesn't come
loose

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.880 

what<00:03:35.930> what's<00:03:36.560> interesting<00:03:37.250> is<00:03:37.940> you<00:03:38.300> just<00:03:38.890> use

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
what what's interesting is you just use

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.170 
what what's interesting is you just use
a<00:03:40.160> bobber<00:03:40.610> like<00:03:41.270> this<00:03:41.800> tie<00:03:42.800> it<00:03:42.860> so<00:03:43.550> it's<00:03:43.760> about

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
a bobber like this tie it so it's about

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.580 
a bobber like this tie it so it's about
two<00:03:45.010> two<00:03:46.010> and<00:03:46.160> a<00:03:46.280> half<00:03:46.520> feet<00:03:46.880> from<00:03:47.240> this<00:03:48.140> lure

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
two two and a half feet from this lure

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.900 
two two and a half feet from this lure
you<00:03:49.340> don't<00:03:49.640> need<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:50.030> put<00:03:50.270> any<00:03:50.570> bait<00:03:50.900> on<00:03:51.260> it

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
you don't need to put any bait on it

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.680 
you don't need to put any bait on it
just<00:03:52.910> use<00:03:53.180> monofilament<00:03:53.750> line<00:03:54.820> and<00:03:55.820> throw

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
just use monofilament line and throw

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.230 
just use monofilament line and throw
that<00:03:56.990> out<00:03:57.050> and<00:03:57.710> you<00:03:58.130> don't<00:03:58.400> even<00:03:58.610> have<00:03:58.970> to

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
that out and you don't even have to

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.080 
that out and you don't even have to
throw<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.750> a<00:03:59.960> long<00:04:00.260> ways<00:04:00.560> from<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.160> shore<00:04:01.490> we

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
throw it a long ways from the shore we

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.780 
throw it a long ways from the shore we
used<00:04:02.360> to<00:04:02.570> fish<00:04:02.870> at<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.230> lake<00:04:03.590> called<00:04:03.920> McGregor

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
thing these are easy to make probably

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.690 
thing these are easy to make probably
two<00:04:55.100> of<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.310> colors<00:04:56.030> that<00:04:56.060> I<00:04:57.280> use<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.670> most

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
two of the colors that I use the most

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:06.820 
two of the colors that I use the most
were<00:04:59.660> the<00:04:59.800> copper<00:05:00.910> and<00:05:01.910> a<00:05:02.480> green<00:05:03.110> color<00:05:05.830> and

were the copper and a green color and
like<00:05:07.370> I've<00:05:07.700> done<00:05:07.970> here<00:05:08.330> you<00:05:08.630> can<00:05:08.900> make<00:05:09.650> it<00:05:09.890> just

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
like I've done here you can make it just

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.740 
like I've done here you can make it just
a<00:05:10.250> little<00:05:10.700> bit<00:05:10.940> thicker<00:05:11.810> by<00:05:12.290> going<00:05:12.800> back<00:05:13.070> down

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
a little bit thicker by going back down

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.950 
a little bit thicker by going back down
and<00:05:14.750> we<00:05:15.500> we<00:05:16.040> I<00:05:16.070> have<00:05:16.490> never<00:05:16.940> figured<00:05:17.360> out<00:05:17.660> what

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
and we we I have never figured out what

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.740 
and we we I have never figured out what
this<00:05:18.230> resembles<00:05:19.010> but<00:05:19.730> they'll<00:05:20.150> buy<00:05:20.450> it<00:05:20.510> on

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
this resembles but they'll buy it on

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.640 
this resembles but they'll buy it on
this<00:05:21.020> bare<00:05:21.320> hook<00:05:21.680> and<00:05:22.100> they'll<00:05:22.490> bite<00:05:22.820> that

very viciously aggressively you'll have

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.600 
very viciously aggressively you'll have
no<00:05:29.030> trouble<00:05:29.090> at<00:05:29.780> catching<00:05:30.080> ten<00:05:30.680> or<00:05:30.860> fifteen<00:05:31.400> of

them if there's white fish in the lake
you<00:05:34.100> can<00:05:34.610> also<00:05:34.790> use<00:05:35.330> this<00:05:35.660> orange<00:05:36.170> color<00:05:37.120> but<00:05:38.120> I

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
you can also use this orange color but I

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.450 
you can also use this orange color but I
would<00:05:38.630> say<00:05:38.990> that<00:05:39.350> probably<00:05:40.330> copper<00:05:41.330> and<00:05:41.630> green

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
would say that probably copper and green

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.810 
would say that probably copper and green
were<00:05:43.460> probably<00:05:44.260> the<00:05:45.260> two<00:05:45.290> best<00:05:45.710> colors<00:05:46.310> red

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
were probably the two best colors red

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:47.590 
were probably the two best colors red
was

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
was

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.730 
was
also<00:05:48.110> a<00:05:48.140> good<00:05:48.560> color<00:05:48.890> and<00:05:49.630> we<00:05:50.630> use<00:05:50.990> this<00:05:51.350> not

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
also a good color and we use this not

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.670 
also a good color and we use this not
only<00:05:52.040> in<00:05:52.430> open<00:05:52.970> water<00:05:53.270> but<00:05:53.750> we<00:05:53.930> used<00:05:54.200> it

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
only in open water but we used it

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.290 
only in open water but we used it
ice<00:05:55.070> fishing<00:05:56.320> you<00:05:57.320> put<00:05:57.920> it<00:05:58.040> down<00:05:58.280> like<00:05:58.820> the

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
ice fishing you put it down like the

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.040 
ice fishing you put it down like the
same<00:05:59.600> way<00:05:59.870> about<00:06:00.140> two<00:06:00.740> and<00:06:00.890> a<00:06:01.010> half<00:06:01.220> feet<00:06:01.580> and

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
same way about two and a half feet and

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.230 
same way about two and a half feet and
just<00:06:03.050> jig<00:06:03.500> up<00:06:03.710> a<00:06:03.800> little<00:06:04.070> bit<00:06:04.340> and<00:06:04.700> they<00:06:04.970> would

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
just jig up a little bit and they would

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.200 
just jig up a little bit and they would
they<00:06:05.900> would<00:06:06.080> take<00:06:06.410> it<00:06:06.650> under<00:06:06.920> the<00:06:07.250> ice<00:06:07.460> and<00:06:07.850> you

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
they would take it under the ice and you

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.440 
they would take it under the ice and you
can<00:06:08.510> actually<00:06:08.750> catch<00:06:09.470> them<00:06:09.710> quite<00:06:10.070> easily

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
can actually catch them quite easily

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.740 
can actually catch them quite easily
this<00:06:11.450> way<00:06:11.750> we<00:06:12.590> figured<00:06:13.070> this<00:06:13.640> imitates<00:06:14.330> some

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
this way we figured this imitates some

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.320 
this way we figured this imitates some
kind<00:06:15.080> of<00:06:15.200> a<00:06:15.290> little<00:06:15.560> worm<00:06:15.920> that<00:06:15.950> they<00:06:16.610> eat<00:06:16.940> I'm

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
kind of a little worm that they eat I'm

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.970 
kind of a little worm that they eat I'm
not<00:06:17.630> sure<00:06:18.020> about<00:06:18.200> that

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:18.980 
not sure about that

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.680 
not sure about that
I<00:06:19.240> am<00:06:20.530> only<00:06:21.530> sure<00:06:21.860> that<00:06:22.250> it<00:06:22.400> works<00:06:22.670> and<00:06:23.150> has<00:06:23.420> put

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
I am only sure that it works and has put

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:30.660 
I am only sure that it works and has put
many<00:06:24.440> many<00:06:24.770> fish<00:06:25.780> in<00:06:26.780> my<00:06:27.610> skillet<00:06:29.020> which

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:30.670 
many many fish in my skillet which

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.420 
many many fish in my skillet which
thankfully<00:06:31.670> they're<00:06:31.940> great
