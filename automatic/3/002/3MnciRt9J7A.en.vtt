00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
punched it out of some pink basil

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.020 
punched it out of some pink basil
sparkly<00:01:18.869> cardstock<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.890> when<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.850> laid<00:01:21.000> it

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
sparkly cardstock and when I laid it

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.160 
sparkly cardstock and when I laid it
down<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:21.509> couldn't<00:01:21.869> see<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
down you really couldn't see the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.100 
down you really couldn't see the
snowflakes<00:01:22.439> too<00:01:22.950> well<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.700> backed

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
snowflakes too well so I just backed

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.109 
snowflakes too well so I just backed
some<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.290> blue<00:01:25.530> basile<00:01:26.250> cardstock<00:01:26.729> behind

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.640 
some of the blue basile cardstock behind
it<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.750> snowflakes<00:01:28.229> would<00:01:28.380> stand

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
it so that the snowflakes would stand

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.069

out<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.130> I'm<00:01:29.909> going<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.240> stick<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.840> down
