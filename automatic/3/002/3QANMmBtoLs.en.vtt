00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.320
 how rich it is to dance to someone who knows how to live 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:19.230
 we have enjoyed salsa flamenco 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.230
 casino and now it's up to jazz look is 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:27.250
 good jazz is a dance movement 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.530
 who was born in the mid 50's there 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.930
 merges what is African dance 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.360
 all the African priorities of the 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.590
 Negroid culture with genres 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.130
 tropical 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.380
 and it has a lot to do with ballet and 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.950
 with contemporary dance obviously the 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.480
 of mother dance in terms of jazz with 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.210
 other disciplines all disciplines 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.130
 that was physical activity blended 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.860
 with each other helps a lot 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.110
 coordination if one has your ear 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.420
 rhythmic interior 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.700
 you have not evolved when you're going to be 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.710
 a karate figure helps because the 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.230
 fluidity and constancy in movement 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.870
 in the figure are very important 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.570
 time to evaluate the dance in general 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.580
 it's an activity that involves you all 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.490
 the body from the feet to the head 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.229
 then the physical formation is super 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.410
 important and very good for others 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.410
 activities 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.800
 of self - esteem of the child who makes jazz 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.500
 It improves a lot because you're seeing how 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.490
 your body is getting better every day 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.210
 jazz is a constant activity 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.280
 evolution and every day is different when 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.670
 a child looks at an icon makes a 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.560
 week and you can already take a winner 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.710
 of choreography or his leg and lift 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.220
 a little over 90 degrees in children 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.430
 emotions in addition to the ways that 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.260
 communicate the chamos of the talks to 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.270
 moment they are dancing or when 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.119
 a new group starts 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.189
 and they greet each other because they know each other and when 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.590
 end of the school year we 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.659
 we call this from September to July that 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.599
 let's make our show are 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:14.459
 friends without diamonds that I for you or 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:16.650
 the psychological part of every child improves 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.810
 as interactivity with the dance that 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.420
 we see the things that have to do with 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.500
 a person with each person that the 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.880
 people say 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.960
 prayer for all the people who 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.600
 want your children fulfilled 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.760
 activity come and do the jazz so that 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.090
 help them improve psychological physics and 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.090
 mentally 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.960
 the tired of jazz has varied as 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.910
 over time there are principles 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.190
 they used shoes specifically 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.890
 for this discipline is currently used 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.520
 up a shoe because you already know what 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.520
 important
