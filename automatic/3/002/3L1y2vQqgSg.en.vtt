00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.650
 and an actor youtube friends and good 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.290
 Well, the new one is welcome here 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.200
 tutorial and well I will teach you how to create 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.670
 a theme for your xbox 360 interface and 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.950
 that in the strings they asked me 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.410
 how do I have the theme that I have 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.360
 currently not to start good anymore 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.170
 we have here four images that I chose 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.260
 I almost randomly and good one of 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.500
 these images is this is this and is 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.170
 well what is the point here not 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.540
 to begin with we are going to occupy only one 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.179
 program and our usb memory and already 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.000
 configured and for storage 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:54.920
 xbox not then good what is the point 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.239
 main here not for example we can 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.219
 I'm going to take this picture as 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.129
 main and good you have to have in 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.960
 count the box that has xbox and 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.730
 let's say that in the parts here part 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.860
 we're going to see it a bit in the program 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.990
 to see how the 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.240
 images not since you have to have a 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.159
 little of let's say that of being well-off 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.840
 so you can see them then 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.670
 let's start the program here 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.400
 I'm going to leave the link in the 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.160
 video description 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.860
 and how to download this program this is 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.690
 the program that we are going to use this 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.120
 has the two tools both the 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.760
 tool from the creator of the theme and 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.370
 because the mode does not have it that much anymore 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.740
 as the fact of being able to pass the subject to 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.380
 our unit then not good then 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.690
 let's go here to the tools tab let's go 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.180
 to move over here and give up 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.670
 kreator and we open this little window of 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.620
 here now we have here a window that 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.840
 it is called show template unfortunately 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.690
 this window is not well placed 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.940
 what is this theme creator is not 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.380
 updated to the latest interface the 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.869
 well let's load our images 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.150
 more or less to have a then now yes 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.830
 that a perspective not here as they can 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.150
 see they are with the previous interface that 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.520
 that of the white squares 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.670
 and well we have to take into account 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.800
 example the second image and the second 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.170
 image will always show us 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.030
 when we are in the recent tab 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.640
 in our interface in what is the 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.450
 social tab games tv movies and 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.540
 music and applications this 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.640
 that is the most this is the most used 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.800
 then this one kilo of media library 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.890
 it is only shown as long as 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.140
 you enter the games tab of 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.770
 movies and music but that you give in 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.110
 your games if we do not get the first 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.360
 image of main and I get in the image 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.090
 main interface and apart in the 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.760
 browser from d lc or for 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.010
 download let's say that some some 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.260
 downloadable content will appear 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.150
 that image forever and always 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.430
 We are looking for when we give in 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.770
 browse games that image is what we 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.080
 will appear no and well let's load 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.510
 our third image that is going to be this 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.459
 from here and good that of system settings 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.650
 It has always been the same 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.140
 then the joke of this image is 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.400
 like having something 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.440
 around that white box so that 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.200
 can be appreciated in a way 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.180
 that to some extent correct then 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.360
 Well, it's simply the fact 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.819
 upload your four favorite images 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.549
 here the gradient as I tell you is no longer 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.739
 the same does not apply the position that the 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.500
 interface changed from having that style of 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:38.459
 Well, now, as in the background, 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.620
 no longer does not exist then then it gives 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.120
 same really the color that you put 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.709
 it's not going to change in absolutely what 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.650
 let's leave it in default that I think 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.810
 it's like blanquito more or less and good 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.500
 we can put a name to the subject in this 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.260
 case then I'm going to put you I do not know in this one 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.150
 cheer up obviously you can load 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.390
 the images that you want preferably 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.250
 in resolution 1280 x 720 so that it 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.380
 see the images well obviously in my 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:11.100
 images for example from 1500 per thousand 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:12.990
 55 thousand 500 for 844 2800 for 2040 and 1500 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.810
 by a thousand 28 are images a little more 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.390
 great so if you have steele 1080 not 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.400
 look bad then well since I already 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.410
 we put here and we can put you here in 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.720
 six more to keep it in the 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.190
 desktop or safe to device which is what 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.490
 that I recommend that the insect 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.690
 device flash drive and good now we 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.460
 the little message that 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.190
 our subject has been saved in the 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.169
 drive nobody already football that 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.140
 is web successful to transfer your flash 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.810
 trade animes and then here we can 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.990
 check in our usb we give sims 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.300
 and here we can see the anime if not and already 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.730
 we can in fact we can avoid it in case 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.560
 we did not like this we can even 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.290
 change here the images that have 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.600
 these small images here can be 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.670
 change if you want 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.950
 so with this replay button you can 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.770
 change the icon so that in your interface 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.170
 appear the different image this is not 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.360
 variable so they do not have what 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.570
 worry and well then we're going to 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.220
 close here our our program and 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.220
 see you in the console 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.010
 and I cta at least youtube and good 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.170
 Well, welcome here to this 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.720
 second part of the tutorial and good already 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:27.000
 we connect our usb to what's coming 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.190
 being the xbox 360 and good simply 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.040
 we go here to the social tab 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.650
 we select our profile and we go to 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.240
 give it in change subject here in change 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.850
 good topic you just have to look for the 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.170
 theme that we put to our people and 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.740
 that our subject that in this case was 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.540
 anime sim and we selected it once 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.169
 is selected good we already take charge 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.930
 in this here as I tell you the 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:53.690
 selector like that of background 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:56.310
 Image ingredient is automatic 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.500
 this I do not make any change with 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.000
 no topic that I have done but 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.150
 circle you can try there with 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.530
 with the different images that they have and 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.240
 well let's check here that 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.240
 example we are on the tab 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.890
 recent and in the image changes so 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.750
 good the only way to see it well 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.990
 it's leaving until the end of our 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:18.330
 games to be able to appreciate it 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.220
 perfectly equal here at stake if you 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.590
 we give in my games good change the 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.660
 image for the third that equal 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:28.890
 going to the end you can appreciate 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.170
 or in navigating games we will be able to 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.630
 appreciate the first image I told you 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:36.960
 who was going to be searching for d lc 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:39.000
 no and now good as I tell you the last 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.280
 image in whom my applications are going to 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.920
 see the third there if you appreciate a little 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.320
 better unfortunately not here but 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:49.340
 if you put him here if you can appreciate the 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.570
 well not and the last one is here in system 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.430
 as I say not well appreciated the 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:56.310
 image except when they squeeze some 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.710
 button to observe something but 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.270
 Leave out do not be not appreciated very well 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.690
 then it is a matter of which one of two or 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.490
 you create your images with photoshop 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:08.460
 adjusting the let's say that towards those 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.530
 to the movement not of the interface or in 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.790
 this case making the image that 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.010
 it's been upstairs down the corner 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:17.610
 right so that it looks good in this 

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:20.610
 case like images around what 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:22.920
 is this being so, so this 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.080
 is for is never for the some of 

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.490
 the parts of the images but good 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.300
 I hope that this tutorial has 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.220
 served that many were not 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.550
 and well I say goodbye we see the 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.550
 next
