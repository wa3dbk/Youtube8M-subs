00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.210
 in this video would like to show how 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.590
 to Catch before the end crass where will 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.960
 the grasshopper is best of course 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.340
 I happen to find myself on a meadow 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.660
 me straight on one and always the one 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.899
 small user begins I show you 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.899
 now 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.809
 so that I can start at all 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.640
 I would like to show you how to collect 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.520
 I myself always to containers so bauer 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.770
 we associate the class to what they 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.140
 you need a simple pc bottle 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.269
 and a ladies pantyhose in this 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.710
 case of my grandma käthe but you can 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.820
 even those of his wife or his 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.190
 Use your own if you wear in which 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.400
 so as a tool comes a pair of scissors and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.839
 a cutter knife for use with the 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.550
 cutter knife i cut myself that 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.710
 proportion to the size as I do it 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.680
 need for that I simply put the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.680
 above a bottle of wine once 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:25.490
 namely the ladies pantyhose cuts 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.490
 Take her leg off 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:44.870
 and then put the container in just 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:47.350
 so close to the ladies it is here 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.260
 Of course it is still a bit too long 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:56.240
 disconnect here a little up down about 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.770
 the longer it is and the nice thing about it 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.170
 Now I can put my grasshopper in it 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.750
 then I can do it in my own 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.790
 hand here can engage him 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.130
 remove grasshopper and thereby that 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.730
 that is so tight here can the grass 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.730
 while not running away 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.060
 1 again of course you can 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.460
 also locusts from the zoo 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.510
 but take in the domestic crass for the 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.310
 best experiences made 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.310
 so make me accumulate now 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.170
 I have the free köhler grasshopper 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.550
 Now in the box and I hope that you 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.550
 bring me some nice feet tomorrow 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.470
 good morning we are having a 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.940
 fishing hut in winzenburg due to the 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.040
 warm temperatures are the trout 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.390
 as a single fisherman in the surface and 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.920
 probably little food on and 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.010
 look at our self-searched 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.720
 can convince blatant for today to 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.560
 Montage fisherman floated a trainer 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.240
 two grams 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.060
 that's enough for the short distances 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.340
 completely out of this fish now 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.260
 go through and then comes a pilot 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.060
 ball which ensures that the vortex 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.800
 will be carried 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.390
 then comes the incident on the 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.330
 in turn a pilot bird sits 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.280
 then the hook comes with the pilot 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.230
 ball on the incident I can see the height 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.350
 vary how far the bait sink 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.350
 should 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.160
 I'll be easy with the crass ones 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.930
 sinking fishing could of course also 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.890
 still make sure with string fat that 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.430
 the grasshopper on the surface 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.430
 swim 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.950
 and so welcome the grasshopper I peck 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.450
 short in the wings with a small one 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.939
 hook I have hook size 12 here 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.290
 daily 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:05.909
 This ensures that the big bazaar 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.510
 holds and as long as possible 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.739
 fidget 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.739
 but now it starts 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.500
 worked the same with the first 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.680
 great trout like it 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.680
 go on 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.069
 my everyday life is now over, it was 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:23.680
 very difficult conditions today 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:25.240
 because of the weather but the force 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.270
 we have brought some nice fish 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.690
 and I 'm happy to go home this 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.690
 next time
