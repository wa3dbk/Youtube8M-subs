 all of its products are incredible and 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.560
 I'll recommend them now going back 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.500
 to our hair let's start at 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.390
 do it like any other day so 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.910
 nothing else I do not have any technique 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.220
 special simply by doing it as 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.540
 always but the only thing that we are now going to 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.220
 make different let's grab everything 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.890
 our hair to the side and we're going to 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.530
 make sure the tips are good to 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.720
 We do not want the hair to be blind 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.970
 a little Chinese nothing of that we want that 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.380
 You must make sure that the tips are 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.090
 well advised because this is going to be a 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.369
 difference with you from our hair 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.650
 upwards now we go back to 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.050
 section and the same thing we're going to do 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.700
 our hair as normal and the same 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.440
 again we are going to grab our hair 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.300
 to one side and let's make sure that 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.300
 the tips are good to the blind 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.700
 now when we get to the section of 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.950
 up our hair we are going to do 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.200
 something a little different first I'm going to 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.200
 grab my brush and I'll start to 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.510
 get rid of the knots that I've made and 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.520
 the last thing we're going to do is nothing more 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.890
 when making the tips for this not 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.080
 we need to do all the hair because 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.270
 the rest we will be doing pancake 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.800
 so the truth does not matter if everything 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.690
 the hair is on the floor you can 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.310
 do it if you want but the truth is me 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.500
 I think it's not worth it because the 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.540
 last you will undo it doing much 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.220
 crepe so is that again the last 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.110
 section we are going to do the same thing we are going to 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.240
 do the tips and now for 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.520
 start let's select our 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.740
 hair I'm going to grab the whole section of 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.290
 above our hair with a clip and 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.210
 the section below I'll make a tail 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.300
 so you have to make sure that 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.060
 all your hair hair is collected and 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.510
 I'm going to grab him with a league as high as 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.510
 I can 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.550
 now very well that 's how you look at my 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.870
 tail I know it as high as I could and now 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.580
 what we are going to do is select 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.650
 our hair I will grab a 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.990
 inch of our hair that I have 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.530
 I loose it and I'm going to grab it with a clip 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.530
 again 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.640
 now with the loose hair we have 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.190
 let's start growing our hair 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.470
 I will use a brush that is designed 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.640
 to help us with this and just 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.130
 you have to make sure that all your 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.130
 hair is full of volume 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.580
 once you have finished giving 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.920
 a lot of volume to your hair we are going to 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.080
 grab some pins and we will place them 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.240
 as close as we can to our 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.900
 tail so it just grabs your 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:56.690
 hair picks it up and with the thought of a 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.880
 form of x so cross you can use 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.160
 up to 4 people if you have the 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.200
 very thick hair and I really do 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.360
 I have too much fat and it is that I need 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.070
 many but good when you have 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.050
 finished making sure your hair 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.960
 be very sure we are going to throw you 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.060
 hairspray that is spray and now we are going to 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.700
 re- sectioning our hair another 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.430
 once we are going to select it one more time and 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.260
 if you have very thin hair to the best 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.330
 nothing else requires that sections two 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.100
 times but I eat my hair very 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.260
 Thick I need selected three times 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.120
 So, the same thing, we're going to twitch 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.670
 our hair to give it a lot of volume 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.550
 and the same thing I will place my hair 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.440
 back and I'm going to spray and go 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.080
 to hold my hair to my hands 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.360
 back to comb it a little smarter and 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.190
 again grabbing your feet we're going to 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.419
 start placing them as young 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.419
 what can we do to our tail 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.629
 now with the last section of our 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:56.830
 hair we are not going to give much volume 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.719
 because this is the part where 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.949
 we need our hair to be what 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:02.259
 smoother than you can to be able 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.810
 hide all the crepe and the volume that 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:07.360
 we have done to our hair so it is that 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.219
 I'm going to take a lot of spray and now with 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.560
 the brush I will start brushing my 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:13.689
 hair back to hide 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.210
 all the volume that we have made to 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:18.520
 our hair and if you need to throw it 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.840
 more spray to your hair 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.750
 she told him because you're really going to 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.879
 need I used too much spray so it's 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.310
 I recommend them to use what 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.870
 as much as they can to be able to brush their 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.169
 hair back as smooth as 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.169
 can 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.190
 Now we are going to select our 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.530
 hair in two sections let's grab 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.050
 two strands to the sides to be able 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.700
 this leave them out and the rest 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.590
 of our hair we are going to place 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.630
 back as close as we can to 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.880
 our tail and returning as a client 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.530
 let's give it a form of x to be able 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.960
 ensure that our hair is going to 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.060
 stay in place now let's brush 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.160
 our bar tail so it's a bit 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.950
 more ready because all the hair that 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.500
 we've been doing a lot 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.150
 volume makes it take off and now with 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.190
 the two locks that leave more loose 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.280
 let's start to put them back 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.710
 and now using your feet you can start 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.830
 This move your hair towards you 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:20.280
 you can give a lot of volume or take away 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.530
 good months that is what you want but 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.120
 grab us better let's start giving it 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.820
 return to our queue to be able 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:29.070
 hide all the feet and we 're going to 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.320
 place down our tail to 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:34.350
 hide it and we will accept one more time 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.300
 our tail and finally we're going to 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.550
 Spray back our hair 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.400
