only<00:00:36.040> thing<00:00:36.280> I<00:00:36.340> don't<00:00:36.400> like<00:00:36.640> about<00:00:36.730> it<00:00:37.030> is<00:00:37.150> on

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
only thing I don't like about it is on

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.970 
only thing I don't like about it is on
the<00:00:37.570> other<00:00:37.720> side<00:00:38.020> it's<00:00:38.200> not<00:00:38.290> circular<00:00:38.800> like

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
the other side it's not circular like

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.860 
the other side it's not circular like
this<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:41.020> actually<00:00:41.140> square<00:00:42.720> and<00:00:43.720> it's

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
this it's actually square and it's

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.390 
this it's actually square and it's
actually<00:00:44.260> thin<00:00:44.500> which<00:00:44.800> is<00:00:44.830> good<00:00:45.160> to<00:00:45.280> get

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
actually thin which is good to get

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.600 
actually thin which is good to get
between<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:45.730> walls<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:46.450> corals<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:48.520> the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
between the walls and corals but the

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.890 
between the walls and corals but the
reason<00:00:48.910> I<00:00:48.940> don't<00:00:49.000> like<00:00:49.120> how<00:00:49.450> square<00:00:49.750> in<00:00:49.840> the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
reason I don't like how square in the

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.080 
reason I don't like how square in the
back<00:00:50.020> is<00:00:50.200> because<00:00:50.350> when<00:00:50.590> you<00:00:50.680> think<00:00:50.940> hey<00:00:51.940> and

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
back is because when you think hey and

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.060 
back is because when you think hey and
we<00:00:52.150> go<00:00:52.270> against<00:00:52.600> this<00:00:52.720> right<00:00:52.930> here<00:00:53.170> actually

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
we go against this right here actually

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.420 
we go against this right here actually
not<00:00:55.000> enough<00:00:55.180> that<00:00:55.450> are<00:00:55.570> all<00:00:55.750> the<00:00:55.870> way<00:00:56.310> so<00:00:57.310> you

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
not enough that are all the way so you

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.530 
not enough that are all the way so you
don't<00:00:57.580> really<00:00:57.670> know<00:00:57.940> where<00:00:58.150> your<00:00:58.270> white

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
don't really know where your white

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.470 
don't really know where your white
wiping<00:00:59.050> off<00:00:59.730> should<00:01:00.730> make<00:01:00.820> sense<00:01:00.970> best<00:01:01.300> it

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
wiping off should make sense best it

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.680 
wiping off should make sense best it
it's<00:01:01.690> just<00:01:01.840> a<00:01:01.900> little<00:01:02.940> just<00:01:03.940> a<00:01:04.059> little<00:01:04.239> problem

how's the moon lights on this is what I

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.390 
how's the moon lights on this is what I
like<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.320> most<00:01:08.350> right<00:01:08.740> now<00:01:08.770> especially<00:01:08.950> since

from<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.800> protein<00:04:27.190> skimmer<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:28.470> first<00:04:29.470> thing

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
from the protein skimmer the first thing

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.800 
from the protein skimmer the first thing
we'll<00:04:29.800> do<00:04:29.950> is<00:04:29.979> you'll<00:04:30.190> cut<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.490> line<00:04:30.910> and<00:04:31.630> put

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
we'll do is you'll cut the line and put

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.710 
we'll do is you'll cut the line and put
in<00:04:31.900> your<00:04:32.190> new<00:04:33.190> check<00:04:33.430> valve<00:04:33.460> this<00:04:34.270> makes<00:04:34.630> sure

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
in your new check valve this makes sure

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.710 
in your new check valve this makes sure
that<00:04:35.020> if<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.910> power<00:04:36.910> goes<00:04:36.970> out<00:04:37.240> or<00:04:37.300> something

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
that if the power goes out or something

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.240 
that if the power goes out or something
and<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:37.990> water<00:04:38.229> comes<00:04:38.500> back<00:04:38.530> through<00:04:38.860> won't

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
and the water comes back through won't

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.560 
and the water comes back through won't
come<00:04:39.460> down<00:04:39.610> into<00:04:39.789> your<00:04:39.880> pump<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.330> bring<00:04:40.479> your

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
pump okay so you kind of cut the line

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.740 
pump okay so you kind of cut the line
and<00:04:43.479> put<00:04:43.810> that<00:04:43.930> in<00:04:44.110> there<00:04:44.700> okay<00:04:45.700> and<00:04:45.910> then<00:04:46.150> cut

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
and put that in there okay and then cut

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.640 
and put that in there okay and then cut
the<00:04:46.840> line<00:04:47.020> again<00:04:47.850> you<00:04:48.850> install<00:04:49.270> this

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
the line again you install this

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.510 
the line again you install this
this<00:04:50.890> is<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:52.290> this<00:04:53.290> is<00:04:53.350> the<00:04:53.500> valve<00:04:53.860> there<00:04:54.160> and

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
this is the this is the valve there and

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.000 
this is the this is the valve there and
their<00:04:54.880> valve<00:04:55.240> okay<00:04:56.230> and<00:04:56.530> then<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.710> other<00:04:56.860> end

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
their valve okay and then the other end

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.380 
their valve okay and then the other end
just<00:04:57.580> goes<00:04:58.680> right<00:04:59.680> to<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.890> pump<00:05:00.070> itself

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
just goes right to the pump itself

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.050 
just goes right to the pump itself
that's<00:05:01.390> simple<00:05:01.780> easy<00:05:02.610> it<00:05:03.610> takes<00:05:03.730> you<00:05:03.940> about
