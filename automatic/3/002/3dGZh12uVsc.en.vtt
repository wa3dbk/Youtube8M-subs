 good morning and welcome to tg2 health 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.440
 and now pay attention to the cork of the sparkling wine that can hit the eye 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.040
 doctors who are on call at the emergency room last year know this 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.040
 well we went to the cardarelli venha hospital 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.090
 80 million hits - pasta at the stroke of midnight 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.740
 also 2007 12 months ago that started like this 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.690
 if a gesture is not always harmless if it is true that at the time of the toast the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.520
 cap could turn into a bullet 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.860
 bottom called a blunt trauma closed I know the world more 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.300
 the blunt trauma closed for featured update from 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.360
 spills you want to mother good in some cases by retinal rupture 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.410
 weight all in the day muscle insertion because man is the most central area 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.750
 in the coliseum it has an important visual decline 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.600
 I believe in you Jesus every second 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.130
 if this is the really impressive speed at which a stopper can 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.610
 hit the eye before the peace closes in case of wounds 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.060

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.770

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.640

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.260
 I still try to squeeze in the part I am going to chew in 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.610
 all safety the important thing is to finish 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.600
 some simple rules 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.150
 and the bottle temperature is 8 free 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.170
 then gently loosening the metal protection cage the 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.900
 boss should always be kept under control 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.030
 once, however, the topical moment of opening with both came 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.870

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.320
 quite determined we try to counteract the force we exerted on the 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.750
 mushroom cap in modal then farouk unforeseen a small amount of 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.189
