I recommend that the looks super kit

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.849 
I recommend that the looks super kit
first<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.850> all<00:00:24.029> because<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.990> has<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.590> right

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
first of all because it has the right

first of all because it has the right
combination<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.760> parts<00:00:27.029> which<00:00:27.840> should<00:00:28.080> always

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
combination of parts which should always

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.659 
combination of parts which should always
be<00:00:28.560> replaced<00:00:29.160> during<00:00:29.910> an<00:00:30.029> overhaul<00:00:30.480> and
