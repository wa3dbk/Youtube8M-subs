00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.300
 As you can see, this is the box in which

 and the knife is absolutely 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:58.930
 This is 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.930
 the advantage but s 30 v

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.990
 the grips are from g 10 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.230

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.200
 carries 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.870
 also a hole for opening with a 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.830
 single hand 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.700
 and here comes 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.700
 Yes I can see 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.329
 engraved on the logo 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.780
 you do not see 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.170
 here voice s 30 v 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.200
 comes reinforced in steel as I said 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.810
 until ten 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.649
 with the flipper for assisted opening 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.939

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.939
 the lock liner lock 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.349
 and the clip the good thing is that 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.840
 completely covers the grips with which 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.900
 it is completely hidden in your pocket 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.379
 the view would only see this clip 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.010
 it has a leaf length of about 84 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.010
 millimeters 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.590
 the total open is about 192 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.989
 millimeters 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.080
 the weight is about 80 grams is not 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.430
 very heavy 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.430
 the drop point sheet 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.120
 and in his hand he holds on 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.760
 completely 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.299
 this clip here makes like a small 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.299
 guard 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.310
 it handles pretty well the hand is left 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.310
 very comfortable the sheet is a sheet 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.540
 quite 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.300
 pretty malita I liked it is a low that 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.440
 to carry daily 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.600
 a little classic does not look very 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.510
 tactics with which when it comes out 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.560
 well, it did not attract much attention and 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.940
 good is a low that if you buy 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.810
 was put then there in the middle that 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.810
 buy from here 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.270
 I bought by ebay and it comes out pretty 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.270
 good price 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.360
 the crazy iner 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.110
 and good 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.180
 a very elegant razor song I'm going to 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.870
 compare with for example the web 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.240
 because it is the size 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.370
 it's a tad more 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.520
 here the one to accompany with the ontario while 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.520
 one 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.170
 here 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.100
 Break the biggest ones that you will throw 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.100
 you risk is a little bigger 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.599
 open 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.820
 the sheet is also 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.530
 is a tad more therefore is with 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.220
 a low to carry daily is 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.020
 quite discreet as nothing companions 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.510
 a knife that I liked a lot 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.420
 I've tried it yet but come on 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:46.970
 pint to cut like a blade 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.970
 let's see if we have it if it comes out here 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.320
 cut shaves 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.949
 perfect 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.430
 Nothing here you have the book band g 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.590
 but s 30 v 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.160

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.240

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.240
