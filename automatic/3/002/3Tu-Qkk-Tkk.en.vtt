I<00:00:16.619> can<00:00:16.890> ranch<00:00:17.070> or<00:00:17.580> imagine<00:00:18.090> around<00:00:18.270> three

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
I can ranch or imagine around three

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.429 
I can ranch or imagine around three
maybe<00:00:18.900> four<00:00:19.289> inches<00:00:19.550> but<00:00:20.550> uh<00:00:20.720> this<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:22.020> what

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
maybe four inches but uh this is what

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.470 
maybe four inches but uh this is what
appears<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.279> be<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.400> juvenile<00:00:23.789> but<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.359> is

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
appears to be a juvenile but this is

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.849 
appears to be a juvenile but this is
actually<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.900> first<00:00:24.930> sound<00:00:25.289> manner<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.680> ever

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
actually the first sound manner to ever

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.220 
actually the first sound manner to ever
bite<00:00:26.130> me<00:00:26.570> it<00:00:27.570> didn't<00:00:27.720> really<00:00:27.810> hurt<00:00:27.990> at<00:00:28.140> all

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
bite me it didn't really hurt at all

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.890 
bite me it didn't really hurt at all
because<00:00:28.439> it's<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:28.830> small<00:00:28.910> good<00:00:29.910> features<00:00:30.750> on

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
because it's so small good features on

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.420 
because it's so small good features on
this<00:00:30.990> species<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.189> tail<00:00:32.399> is

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
this species is that the tail is

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.340 
this species is that the tail is
flattened<00:00:32.940> which<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.390> aids<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.870> swimming<00:00:34.110> and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
flattened which is aids and swimming and

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.510 
flattened which is aids and swimming and
also<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.910> underbelly<00:00:36.410> there<00:00:37.410> are<00:00:37.590> many

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
also on the underbelly there are many

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.130 
also on the underbelly there are many
lines<00:00:38.790> or<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.510> other<00:00:39.540> violent<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:39.989> can

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
lines or on the other violent you can

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.780 
lines or on the other violent you can
see<00:00:40.320> little<00:00:40.500> lines<00:00:40.800> which<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.460> where<00:00:41.579> they<00:00:41.670> get
