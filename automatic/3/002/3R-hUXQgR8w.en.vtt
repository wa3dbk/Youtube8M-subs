00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 good in this video I will show you the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.150
 best way to fish the list with 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.360
 costó consists of a boat and a 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.759
 hook and a fishing line or with nylon 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.350
 to fish and use a 60 of thread 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.800
 fishing 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.860
 in nylon I want nylon this book 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.290
 that thickness of fabric that leaves a 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.080
 lot of money 132 euros from the metro 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.890
 it also depends 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.290
 as is the good minor you see this 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.170
 is to put it in the short and here 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.840
 you put your anchovy sardine or pasta or 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.510
 whatever your pressures with the 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.300
 list and from the list as it comes from 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.670
 down and suck it takes a little 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.190
 it's a little bit the least time you 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.790
 North were made in the cork you 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.530
 you stretch and the list is hooked 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.530
 fish because it also serves for others 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.600
 fish not only to analyze you are 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.970
 hook the boat and you have it 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.500
 reception 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:05.470
 I consider a better nylon because 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.540
 here is the world many people with the 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.020
 book to fish the list as you turn 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.690
 a lot is turned a lot will be hits that 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.890
 thousands of in the weight and that then it 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.810
 it can break 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.210
 Well, I 'm going to teach you 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.970
 how it's done well I'm going to use a 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.990
 thread of this that I have here today 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.680
 prepared 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:34.200
 is born is a kind of bow with a knot 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.200
 there that is going to go for the carabiner 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.930
 have another video show how to ride 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.760
 a height and a caretaker as this one must 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.620
 the video this oak posture also 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.570
 but apart I'm just going to designate with 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.750
 the law together 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.540
 ok here we give it two laps so 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.850
 OK 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.630
 and take where you have gone around and 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.820
 you give it one more lap 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.820
 and you go through the tree 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.479
 my mother 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.009
 and it will be well stretched 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.369
 so that it does not come out and you take it to 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.369
 final 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.819
 now 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.069
 take wait because he has not gone very 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:33.030
 final and want and loose good 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.620
 now you take your toe 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.560
 OK 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.250
 you put it here 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.250
 OK 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.290
 and it is spinning 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.980
 be careful with our leave because to 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:54.710
 Sometimes it comes out and it does not count shares 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.010
 turning around silly 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:01.600
 ok since we have it goes through the 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.130
 hoop but the hole 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.130
 but this time different 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.850
 try to stretch forward what 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.850
 there is very little of the hook 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.530
 In this case he expects went wrong 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.300
 then do 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.790
 against much closer to the height 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.190
 much better if you hook up the 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.050
 list because the lisa does not have you 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.069
 very afraid of the caretaker but instead 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.069
 if you use it 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:39.500
 a sea bass one with a sea bass is scared 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.130
 the sea ​​bass innovates or with a lily 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.790
 palomita that pcn good palmita can 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.680
 go the truth is yes but lily and 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.170
 failed 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.290
 and other fish depends also which 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.590
 example except the golden one the smooth yes that 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:00.020
 can go to the octopus can go 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.630
 because many times brush soccer 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.050
 there on the beach next to the rocks 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:10.040
 using this he asked me for octopus because 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.640
 they go to the sardines to hook the pot of 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.640
 everyone gets 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.010
 you see 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:22.060
 and until there is a thing like that either 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:24.610
 it does not have to be very up above but 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.190
 not too far down as the minimum that 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.690
 be such a thing it is worth once 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.710
 you have done only you hook it to 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.470
 mosquito and that's it 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.600
 ok I know you'll have one thing like that only 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.420
 you want to make the other ten big 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.490
 I want you to do this like that but it's so much 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.060
 whatever a little smaller a 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.450
 trifle 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.330
 and until the great sun announced from 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:53.410
 hole that is this way and now you 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.810
 needs and nothing more than the caretaker is 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.560
 in this distance 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.919
 or better it depends on what it is that is 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.750
 in a distance it's still small and up 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:08.169
 try that hook as nazario 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.710
 almost did not come out a little bent that 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.810
 be straight I was fed up to be like 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.850
 this 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.760
 I hope you liked the video that 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.590
 your perspective jce and until the next 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.860
 video 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.860
 goodbye
