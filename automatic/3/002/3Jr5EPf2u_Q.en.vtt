you're just going to pick up a little

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.010 
you're just going to pick up a little
chunk<00:01:10.560> from<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.249> side<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.789> add<00:01:12.389> it<00:01:12.569> in<00:01:12.689> sort

chunk from the side and add it in sort
of<00:01:13.079> like<00:01:13.259> you<00:01:13.380> would<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.649> French<00:01:13.979> braid<00:01:14.219> and

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
of like you would on a French braid and

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.629 
of like you would on a French braid and
go<00:01:15.270> ahead<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.600> braid<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:16.079> and<00:01:16.319> then<00:01:17.130> grab<00:01:17.609> a

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:17.639 
go ahead and braid it in and then grab a

chunk from this side and add it in okay

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.819 
chunk from this side and add it in okay
so<00:01:20.639> what<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.270> trick<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.539> remember<00:01:22.529> that<00:01:22.560> we're

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
so what the trick is remember that we're

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:24.980 
so what the trick is remember that we're
always<00:01:22.979> pulling<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.459> stranding<00:01:23.909> down<00:01:24.420> we're

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
always pulling the stranding down we're

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.019 
always pulling the stranding down we're
not<00:01:25.020> pulling<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.649> over<00:01:26.069> like<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.429> normal<00:01:26.789> French

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:27.029 
not pulling it over like a normal French

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:28.459 
not pulling it over like a normal French
braid<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.389> grab<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.779> piece<00:01:27.959> and<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.259> pull

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
braid you grab this piece and you pull

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.499 
braid you grab this piece and you pull
it<00:01:28.590> tight<00:01:28.799> over<00:01:29.249> we're<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:30.029> going<00:01:30.209> to<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.359> that

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
it tight over we're not going to do that

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.109 
it tight over we're not going to do that
so<00:01:31.289> and<00:01:31.649> you'll<00:01:31.889> see<00:01:32.130> as<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.340> get<00:01:32.609> farther<00:01:32.789> down

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
so and you'll see as we get farther down

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.629 
so and you'll see as we get farther down
the<00:01:33.240> ponytail<00:01:33.719> how<00:01:33.899> that<00:01:34.079> affects<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:35.219> pull<00:01:35.520> it

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:35.639 
the ponytail how that affects so pull it

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:39.639 
the ponytail how that affects so pull it
down<00:01:35.969> into<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.779> braid<00:01:37.340> grab<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> little<00:01:38.579> chunk

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:42.749 
down into the braid and now because

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:44.510 
down into the braid and now because
we're<00:01:42.929> taking<00:01:43.229> little<00:01:43.439> chunks<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.249> does

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
we're taking little chunks this does

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.819 
we're taking little chunks this does
take<00:01:44.819> a<00:01:44.849> little<00:01:45.209> bit<00:01:45.329> longer<00:01:45.719> to<00:01:46.020> do<00:01:46.139> just<00:01:46.679> like

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
it in pulling it down now you can see
