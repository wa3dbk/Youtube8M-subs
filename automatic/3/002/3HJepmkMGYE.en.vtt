00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 absorb the system that appears in 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:09.980
 we can do it by the method 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.139
 of cause for it we write a matrix 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.360
 is divided by blocks in the first 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.650
 block appear the coefficients of the 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:23.230
 unknowns first equation is 1 x 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:25.900
 + 1 and minus 23 we put it here for 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.060
 separate with the independent terms 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:36.100
 equal to 0 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:43.000
 2 x 3 and 2 z equal to 1 and the last 3 x 2 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:45.070
 2 and 0 7 equal to 3 we know that the last 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.190
 equation with an athlete is 0 z we have already 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.870
 put here 10 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.840
 let's do by the gaussian method 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.199
 method of cause is to do what 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.000
 they are called elementary transformations and 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.680
 then the system that we are obtaining 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.019
 is equivalent, that is, has the same 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.969
 solutions and also has the property 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.969
 which is simpler than the previous one 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.280
 I promise Gauss is looking to do with this 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.130
 element here that is the first 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.050
 element of the diagonal zero below that 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.410
 number you have to multiply to 1 for 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.050
 consummate it with 2 give us 0 would be less 2 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:24.620
 we double minus 2 for the first 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.420
 equation plus the second one that number that 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.320
 multiply to 1 to add it with the 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.640
 3 90 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.760
 2 - 3 - 3 for the first equation plus the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.920
 third 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.260
 good if we multiply minus 2 by the 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.970
 first equation we would get less 2 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:46.630
 by 1 - 2 - 2 by 1 - 2 - 2 by less 2 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:50.440
 x 4 we see the line this and minus 2 x 0 that 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.659
 is 0 we copy the second equation 2 - 3 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.990
 2 1 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:02.399
 of the sum 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:04.899
 this would fit us 0 23 - 54 26 and 0 11 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.740
 we copy here the first equation 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.259
 11 - 2 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.110
 0 and now in the second equation 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:18.930
 we copy this that we have obtained here 0 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.970
 - 5 6 and 1 and now we have said minus 3 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.709
 for the first we do it minus three times 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.290
 one minus three this can be done from 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.489
 head and do the entire operation of 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.030
 but here we do it in a 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:33.180
 detailed minus three for one also 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.930
 minus three in our x minus 26 minus 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:42.340
 3 for 0 0 we copy the third equation 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:47.160
 3 - 2003 and we add 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:52.280
 is here zero x5 and x6 and here three 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:55.550
 we copy this here 0 15 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.680
 and 3 once we have this we have 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.910
 finished with the first element east of 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.620
 here on the diagonal 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.000
 we go with the second one that we are looking to do 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.860
 0 below also 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.050
 what number you have to multiply at least 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.590
 5 so that assuming it with minus 5 is not 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.300
 0 is clearly is the number is minus 1 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.910
 anyway if we have doubt then 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.170
 we have to multiply minus 5 so that 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.910
 assume it with less 5 give us 0 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.890
 and the question is cleared for less 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.200
 five minus five questions we look for 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.920
 who wonder about the five move on 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.300
 another part like five plus and from here 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.280
 questions would be equal to five 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.840
 matches minus five that happens dividing 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.000
 this is less one 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.879
 as we said we multiply minus 1 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.400
 for the second equation and we add it to 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:44.810
 the third we also do less apart 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:49.680
 1 for the second equation nos 1 for 0 0 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:53.150
 -1 for minus 55 minus 1 for 6 minus six 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:59.049
 and minus one by one minus one 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:07.190
 we copy the third equation 0 minus 563 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:09.320
 we add 000 and less 132 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.110
 then here the first copy is copied 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.420
 second equation the first because no 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.780
 the second one intervened because it was the one 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.209
 multiply by number 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:26.730
 they have the third equation we copy what 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:26.730
 that we have down 0 002 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.690
 we have arrived what we want below 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.760
 the diagonal all zeros 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.930
 then that system is going to be very 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.930
 simple as we are going to see now 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.169
 as we said we are doing 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.479
 elementary transformations on 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.880
 rows and then the system that we're going 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.310
 getting it has the same solutions 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.570
 than the previous ones as what we 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.120
 worries about a system are the 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.280
 solutions well the systems that we go 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.590
 getting served to solve also 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.340
 the first system that is what we are looking for 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.110
 solve 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.630
 we translate what we have done to 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:09.500
 beginning now the inverse 1 x 1 and 20 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.780
 let's notice that this is the first 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.630
 equation that we have 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:22.290
 and the second one is 0 x at least 5 and 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:27.050
 + 6 zeta equal to 1 and the third is 0 x 0 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:31.460
 080 equal to 2 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:33.919
 let's notice that the first system is 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.790
 equivalent to the system this we have 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:38.580
 here 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.670
 solve this system is to find xyz 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.250
 that satisfy the three equations the 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.070
 last equations equation is a 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.620
 false equality 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:53.490
 therefore , this last system does not 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:55.560
 there are xyz that make 0 equal 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.790
 to 2 that means that this system does not 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.790
 it has a solution 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.930
 and therefore in the initial system 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:08.720
 it also has no solution and therefore 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.720
 we have an incompatible system 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.820
 that is, the solution of this system 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.820
 it would be has no solution
