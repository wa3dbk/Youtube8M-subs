this egg and all other EAB eggs starts
to<00:01:20.299> hatch<00:01:20.510> and<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:21.049> larva<00:01:21.500> emerges<00:01:22.070> then<00:01:22.909> this

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
to hatch and a larva emerges then this

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.910 
to hatch and a larva emerges then this
little<00:01:23.330> guy<00:01:23.450> starts<00:01:23.960> chewing<00:01:24.380> into<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.680> bark

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
little guy starts chewing into the bark

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.460 
little guy starts chewing into the bark
of<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.100> ash<00:01:25.280> tree<00:01:25.960> protected<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.110> out<00:01:27.320> of

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
of the ash tree protected and out of

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.710 
of the ash tree protected and out of
sight<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:28.220> larva<00:01:28.610> begins<00:01:28.939> to<00:01:29.150> feed<00:01:29.420> on<00:01:29.600> the

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
sight the larva begins to feed on the

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.410 
sight the larva begins to feed on the
tree<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.140> grow<00:01:30.320> larger<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.610> it's<00:01:32.150> actually

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
tree and grow larger so it's actually

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.450 
tree and grow larger so it's actually
eating<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:32.990> tree<00:01:33.350> that's<00:01:33.830> right

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
eating the tree that's right

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.940 
eating the tree that's right
this<00:01:35.090> is<00:01:35.270> what<00:01:35.450> does<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.869> most<00:01:36.140> damage<00:01:36.320> to<00:01:36.860> an

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
this is what does the most damage to an

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.550 
this is what does the most damage to an
ash<00:01:37.130> tree<00:01:37.430> as<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:37.729> larva<00:01:38.600> eats<00:01:38.750> it<00:01:39.110> leaves<00:01:39.380> an

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
ash tree as a larva eats it leaves an

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.859 
ash tree as a larva eats it leaves an
s-shaped<00:01:40.130> trail<00:01:40.369> inside<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.000> tree<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.420> when

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
s-shaped trail inside the tree and when

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.510 
s-shaped trail inside the tree and when
there<00:01:42.080> are<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.259> lot<00:01:42.530> of<00:01:42.560> these<00:01:42.799> larva<00:01:43.220> eating

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
there are a lot of these larva eating

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.640 
there are a lot of these larva eating
the<00:01:43.610> same<00:01:43.820> tree<00:01:44.210> they<00:01:44.720> can<00:01:44.750> seriously<00:01:45.470> damage

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
the same tree they can seriously damage

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.940 
the same tree they can seriously damage
or<00:01:46.189> even<00:01:46.220> kill<00:01:46.880> it<00:01:47.060> out<00:01:47.590> throughout<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.740> fall

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
or even kill it out throughout the fall

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.800 
or even kill it out throughout the fall
in<00:01:49.130> winter<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.579> larva<00:01:49.970> continues<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:50.600> feed

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
in winter the larva continues to feed

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.260 
in winter the larva continues to feed
and<00:01:51.020> develop<00:01:51.439> when<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.250> larva<00:01:52.640> is<00:01:52.759> full-grown

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
and develop when the larva is full-grown

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.330 
and develop when the larva is full-grown
it<00:01:53.600> starts<00:01:54.079> to<00:01:54.200> chew<00:01:54.409> deeper<00:01:54.829> into<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.159> wood

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
it starts to chew deeper into the wood

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.490 
it starts to chew deeper into the wood
creating<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:55.970> cozy<00:01:56.360> chamber<00:01:56.840> yikes

to change shape becoming shorter and
wider<00:02:04.840> now<00:02:05.840> we<00:02:05.899> call<00:02:06.350> it<00:02:06.380> a<00:02:06.590> pupa<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.759> pupa

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
wider now we call it a pupa the pupa

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.810 
wider now we call it a pupa the pupa
eventually<00:02:08.840> becomes<00:02:09.140> an<00:02:09.259> adult<00:02:09.530> EAB<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.459> it

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
eventually becomes an adult EAB and it

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.280 
eventually becomes an adult EAB and it
choose<00:02:11.060> an<00:02:11.239> exit<00:02:11.570> hole<00:02:11.750> that<00:02:11.900> looks<00:02:12.079> like<00:02:12.230> a

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
choose an exit hole that looks like a

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.350 
choose an exit hole that looks like a
capital<00:02:12.769> D<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.340> finally<00:02:13.730> escape<00:02:13.880> from<00:02:14.269> the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
capital D to finally escape from the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.620 
capital D to finally escape from the
tree<00:02:14.570> wait<00:02:15.079> what's<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.709> pupa<00:02:16.160> again<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:17.360> just

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
tree wait what's a pupa again that just

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.870 
tree wait what's a pupa again that just
means<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.079> continues<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.739> grow<00:02:18.860> up<00:02:19.160> until<00:02:19.760> it

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
means it continues to grow up until it

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.970 
means it continues to grow up until it
finally<00:02:20.150> becomes<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:20.900> full-grown<00:02:21.470> adult

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
finally becomes a full-grown adult

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.000 
finally becomes a full-grown adult

emerald ash borer beetle okay got it

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.760 
emerald ash borer beetle okay got it
so<00:02:25.489> what<00:02:25.670> happened<00:02:26.000> is<00:02:26.060> next<00:02:26.629> well<00:02:27.110> once<00:02:27.620> an

so what happened is next well once an

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.309 
so what happened is next well once an
adult<00:02:28.069> EAB<00:02:28.430> gets<00:02:28.879> out<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.300> tree<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:29.840> flies

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
adult EAB gets out of the tree it flies

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.229 
adult EAB gets out of the tree it flies
up<00:02:30.349> into<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.890> trees<00:02:31.099> canopy<00:02:31.430> where<00:02:31.819> it<00:02:31.940> starts

to<00:02:53.450> any<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.930> these<00:02:54.050> trees<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:55.129> we<00:02:55.370> wouldn't

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
to any of these trees and we wouldn't

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.820 
to any of these trees and we wouldn't
even<00:02:55.790> know<00:02:55.970> it<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.989> brings<00:02:57.260> up<00:02:57.470> another<00:02:57.560> good

point

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.059 
point
EAB<00:02:59.060> larva<00:02:59.840> can<00:02:59.870> be<00:03:00.140> hidden<00:03:00.379> inside<00:03:00.650> both

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
EAB larva can be hidden inside both

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.650 
EAB larva can be hidden inside both
living<00:03:01.430> trees<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:01.970> trees<00:03:02.300> that<00:03:02.330> have<00:03:02.629> been

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
living trees and trees that have been

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.839 
living trees and trees that have been
cut<00:03:02.959> down<00:03:02.989> and<00:03:03.200> used<00:03:03.410> for<00:03:03.830> firewood<00:03:04.040> so<00:03:04.790> you

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
cut down and used for firewood so you

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.089 
cut down and used for firewood so you
could<00:03:05.090> actually<00:03:05.360> help<00:03:05.810> spread<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.379> EAB<00:03:06.709> by

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
could actually help spread the EAB by

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.130 
could actually help spread the EAB by
moving<00:03:07.550> firewood<00:03:07.879> from<00:03:08.330> one<00:03:08.540> location<00:03:08.959> to
