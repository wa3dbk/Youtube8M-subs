00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.899 

okay<00:00:01.439> and<00:00:01.500> everything<00:00:01.920> looks<00:00:02.159> fine<00:00:02.280> here<00:00:02.730> so

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
okay and everything looks fine here so

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.490 
okay and everything looks fine here so
the<00:00:03.060> next<00:00:03.210> step<00:00:03.389> is<00:00:03.689> I'm<00:00:03.899> just<00:00:03.990> going<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.230> nail

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
the next step is I'm just going to nail

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.490 
the next step is I'm just going to nail
these<00:00:04.710> down<00:00:05.069> now<00:00:05.850> I'm<00:00:06.330> using<00:00:06.540> nails<00:00:07.020> in<00:00:07.350> this

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
these down now I'm using nails in this

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.990 
these down now I'm using nails in this
case<00:00:07.740> because<00:00:08.099> nails<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:08.550> can<00:00:08.639> get<00:00:08.790> with

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
case because nails you can get with

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.410 
case because nails you can get with
flatheads<00:00:09.570> crews<00:00:10.110> not<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:10.830> much<00:00:11.179> and<00:00:12.179> that's

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
flatheads crews not so much and that's

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.940 
flatheads crews not so much and that's
what<00:00:12.599> we<00:00:12.750> want<00:00:13.019> with<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.320> flashing<00:00:13.620> because

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
what we want with the flashing because

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.320 
what we want with the flashing because
we're<00:00:14.099> eventually<00:00:14.610> afterwards<00:00:15.179> we're<00:00:15.299> going

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
we're eventually afterwards we're going

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.599 
we're eventually afterwards we're going
to<00:00:15.480> have<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.780> fill<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.260> out<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:17.190> make<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.580> a

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
to have to fill that out to make it a

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.630 
to have to fill that out to make it a
smooth<00:00:18.090> joint<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.529> fiberglass<00:00:20.160> surface

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
smooth joint to the fiberglass surface

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.849 
smooth joint to the fiberglass surface
on<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.939> plywood<00:00:21.420> if<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:22.140> don't<00:00:22.439> put<00:00:22.710> some

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
on the plywood if you don't put some

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.740 
on the plywood if you don't put some
filler<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.340> here<00:00:23.760> you're<00:00:24.150> going<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.300> see<00:00:24.359> that

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
filler in here you're going to see that

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.230 
filler in here you're going to see that
joint<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:25.830> not<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.160> end<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.430> world<00:00:26.580> my

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
joint it's not the end of the world my

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.890 
joint it's not the end of the world my
own<00:00:27.269> Sun<00:00:27.689> Deck<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.410> see<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.769> joint<00:00:29.660> but<00:00:30.660> if

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
own Sun Deck you see that joint but if

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.450 
own Sun Deck you see that joint but if
you<00:00:31.019> want<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.289> make<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.529> nicest-looking<00:00:31.920> deck

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
you want to make the nicest-looking deck

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.440 
you want to make the nicest-looking deck
you<00:00:33.270> fill<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:34.520> now<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.579> nails<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.300> we're

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
you fill it in now the nails that we're

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.979 
you fill it in now the nails that we're
using<00:00:36.630> here<00:00:37.230> are<00:00:37.890> ring<00:00:38.550> nails<00:00:38.820> they<00:00:39.780> basically

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
using here are ring nails they basically

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.590 
using here are ring nails they basically
just<00:00:40.320> got<00:00:40.620> little<00:00:40.890> rings<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:42.390> same

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
just got little rings and the same

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.380 
just got little rings and the same
reason<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.290> use<00:00:43.469> screws<00:00:44.030> for<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
reason that you use screws for the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.319 
reason that you use screws for the
sundeck<00:00:46.230> or<00:00:46.590> you'd<00:00:47.340> like<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.670> use<00:00:47.789> screws<00:00:48.090> is

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
sundeck or you'd like to use screws is

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.750 
sundeck or you'd like to use screws is
because<00:00:48.690> they<00:00:48.899> hold<00:00:49.110> well<00:00:49.410> that's<00:00:50.160> why<00:00:50.340> we<00:00:50.579> use

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
because they hold well that's why we use

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.639 
because they hold well that's why we use
ring<00:00:51.030> nails<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.480> nice<00:00:51.690> thing<00:00:51.960> about<00:00:51.989> these<00:00:52.350> ones

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
ring nails a nice thing about these ones

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.119 
ring nails a nice thing about these ones
as<00:00:52.860> well<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.910> they<00:00:54.000> have<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> nice<00:00:54.480> flat

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
as well is that they have a nice flat

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.709 
as well is that they have a nice flat
thin<00:00:56.129> head<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:56.969> they're<00:00:57.120> not<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.449> stick

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
thin head so they're not going to stick

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:16.020 
thin head so they're not going to stick
up<00:00:57.899> very<00:00:58.109> much<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.379> that's<00:00:59.100> ideal

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.280 

now<00:01:17.030> what<00:01:17.180> i'm<00:01:17.299> doing<00:01:17.570> here<00:01:17.750> is<00:01:17.810> i'm<00:01:17.960> checking

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
now what i'm doing here is i'm checking

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.469 
now what i'm doing here is i'm checking
my<00:01:18.409> corners<00:01:18.829> first<00:01:21.790> so<00:01:22.790> i<00:01:22.820> don't<00:01:23.030> have<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.240> take

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
my corners first so i don't have to take

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.109 
my corners first so i don't have to take
these<00:01:23.659> nails<00:01:23.930> up<00:01:24.700> get<00:01:25.700> it<00:01:25.820> right<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.090> first

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
these nails up get it right the first

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:37.870 
these nails up get it right the first
time<00:01:26.450> as<00:01:26.720> they<00:01:26.869> say<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:37.429> don't<00:01:37.549> need<00:01:37.759> to

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
time as they say and you don't need to

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.179 
time as they say and you don't need to
put<00:01:38.179> a<00:01:38.210> huge<00:01:38.780> number<00:01:39.350> of<00:01:40.360> nails<00:01:41.360> in<00:01:41.780> it<00:01:42.189> really

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
put a huge number of nails in it really

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.169 
put a huge number of nails in it really
does<00:01:43.369> try<00:01:43.610> to<00:01:45.130> hold<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.429> against<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:46.970> surface

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
does try to hold it against the surface

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.289 
does try to hold it against the surface
of<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.630> sun<00:01:47.869> deck<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:48.909> once<00:01:49.909> you<00:01:50.030> put<00:01:50.209> the

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
of the sun deck and once you put the

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.029 
of the sun deck and once you put the
fiberglass<00:01:50.750> on<00:01:51.020> over<00:01:51.289> top<00:01:51.530> it's<00:01:51.799> going<00:01:51.979> to

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
fiberglass on over top it's going to

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.649 
fiberglass on over top it's going to
come<00:01:52.220> right<00:01:52.459> up<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:52.909> edge<00:01:53.030> here<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:53.390> it's

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
come right up to the edge here and it's

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.320 
come right up to the edge here and it's
going<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:53.869> make<00:01:54.020> all<00:01:54.289> one<00:01:54.560> surface<00:01:54.950> but<00:01:55.880> you

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
going to make all one surface but you

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.510 
going to make all one surface but you
can't<00:01:56.810> have<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.170> flashing<00:01:57.709> loose<00:01:57.979> while<00:01:58.310> you

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
can't have the flashing loose while you

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.469 
can't have the flashing loose while you
do<00:01:58.729> that<00:01:58.759> you<00:01:59.299> need<00:01:59.479> it<00:01:59.630> against<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.200> surface

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
do that you need it against the surface

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:44.700 
do that you need it against the surface
so<00:02:02.479> i'm<00:02:02.539> just<00:02:02.600> going<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.899> continue<00:02:03.080> on<00:02:03.649> here

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.530 

now<00:02:45.710> at<00:02:45.890> this<00:02:46.010> point<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:46.610> need<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.910> do<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.090> slight

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
now at this point I need to do a slight

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.160 
now at this point I need to do a slight
trim<00:02:47.870> here<00:02:48.520> I'm<00:02:49.520> fine<00:02:49.940> on<00:02:50.210> the<00:02:50.420> vertical<00:02:50.630> but

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
trim here I'm fine on the vertical but

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:12.610 
trim here I'm fine on the vertical but
not<00:02:51.470> quite<00:02:51.920> on<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.340> 45

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.800 

and<00:03:13.250> that's<00:03:13.489> got<00:03:13.640> a<00:03:13.700> slight<00:03:14.030> gap<00:03:14.330> there<00:03:14.629> but

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
and that's got a slight gap there but

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:53.699 
and that's got a slight gap there but
that's<00:03:14.959> okay

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.790 

it's<00:03:54.709> giving<00:03:54.950> these<00:03:55.069> nails<00:03:56.290> an<00:03:57.290> extra<00:03:57.620> little

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
it's giving these nails an extra little

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.240 
it's giving these nails an extra little
hammer<00:03:58.160> just<00:03:58.519> make<00:03:58.670> sure<00:03:58.849> they're<00:03:59.000> all<00:03:59.150> down

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.090 

as<00:04:04.250> tight<00:04:04.459> as<00:04:04.610> they<00:04:04.760> can<00:04:05.060> be<00:04:05.530> because<00:04:06.530> again<00:04:06.860> we

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
as tight as they can be because again we

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.440 
as tight as they can be because again we
want<00:04:07.280> to<00:04:07.370> make<00:04:07.489> sure<00:04:07.519> it's<00:04:07.819> as<00:04:08.000> smooth<00:04:08.239> as<00:04:08.420> it

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
want to make sure it's as smooth as it

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.250 
want to make sure it's as smooth as it
can<00:04:08.810> be<00:04:08.989> when<00:04:09.620> we're<00:04:09.799> finished<00:04:13.930> that's<00:04:14.930> really

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
can be when we're finished that's really

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.379 
can be when we're finished that's really
tight<00:04:15.470> there<00:04:15.680> but<00:04:15.890> it<00:04:16.100> fits<00:04:16.570> so<00:04:17.570> we're<00:04:17.690> fine<00:04:19.389> so

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
tight there but it fits so we're fine so

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.879 
tight there but it fits so we're fine so
just<00:04:20.600> clean<00:04:20.810> up<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:21.049> surface<00:04:21.470> of<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.680> deck

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
just clean up the surface of the deck

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.430 
just clean up the surface of the deck
here<00:04:22.270> and<00:04:23.270> then<00:04:23.600> we'll<00:04:23.750> go<00:04:23.840> on<00:04:23.870> to<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.229> next

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
here and then we'll go on to the next

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.540 
here and then we'll go on to the next
step<00:04:24.770> which<00:04:25.100> is<00:04:26.500> mixing<00:04:27.500> up<00:04:27.620> some<00:04:27.650> filler<00:04:28.250> and

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
step which is mixing up some filler and

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.330 
step which is mixing up some filler and
then<00:04:29.300> filling<00:04:29.780> in<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.530> imperfections<00:04:31.250> that

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
then filling in the imperfections that

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.490 
then filling in the imperfections that
we<00:04:31.520> have<00:04:31.760> on<00:04:31.940> this<00:04:32.090> deck<00:04:32.389> the<00:04:32.990> need<00:04:33.200> to<00:04:33.260> be<00:04:33.380> done

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
we have on this deck the need to be done

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.300 
we have on this deck the need to be done
before<00:04:33.740> we<00:04:34.070> go<00:04:34.880> any<00:04:35.060> further
