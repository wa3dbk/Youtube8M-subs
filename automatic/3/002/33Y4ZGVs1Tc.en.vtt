00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.140

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.379
 you will find after that you will complete all the 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.030
 emissions of the epsilon program and how 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.890
 final I recommend after that 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.449
 handed over the money 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.830
 get out of the car and kill 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.080
 all destroy the helicopter 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.019
 destroy everything because you will take it 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.640
 over 2 million dollars then 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.030
 get killed of all those 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.519
 assholes and me as I'm doing 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.589
 see after you kill everyone e 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.710
 run away from the police and so on 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:01:00.760
 this message will come to you from merni o 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.860

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.080
 first clue guys and I will now you 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.020
 i will find where this first 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.520
 treatise of tips ilo nismo etc. 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.200

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:49.340
 well guys we finally got the 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.560
 tenth treatise these treaties serve 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.200
 only to complete the history of 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.440
 epsilon program completely precisely 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.300
 however they are not necessary in order to 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.970
 complete the game one hundred percent is 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.280
 only a little extra so we say 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.230
 because they won't give you any 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.600
 reward I thought that maybe there 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.310
 were it something instead of guys there 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.990
 they give absolutely nothing as you see 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.360
 precisely the message of merni that makes us 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.640
 compliments for completing the 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.920
 treated now you see it indicating 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.070

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.140
 read these ten treatises 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.820
 anyway, it's just so right 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.930

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.760
