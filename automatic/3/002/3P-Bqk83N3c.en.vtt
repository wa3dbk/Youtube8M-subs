the<00:00:10.139> transition<00:00:10.650> right<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.010> right<00:00:11.130> I've

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
the transition right is the right I've

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:25.220 
the transition right is the right I've
always<00:00:11.670> wanted<00:00:11.820> someone<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.240> make<00:00:24.080> and<00:00:25.080> now

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
always wanted someone to make and now

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:36.569 
always wanted someone to make and now
vinyl<00:00:25.590> has

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.740 

when<00:00:37.579> we<00:00:37.670> started<00:00:37.910> working<00:00:38.149> on<00:00:38.300> developing

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
when we started working on developing

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.069 
when we started working on developing
the<00:00:38.870> transition<00:00:39.379> red<00:00:39.559> the<00:00:40.010> goal<00:00:40.250> is<00:00:40.460> to<00:00:41.079> create

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
the transition red the goal is to create

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.079 
the transition red the goal is to create
a<00:00:42.140> symbol<00:00:42.469> that<00:00:42.920> could<00:00:43.250> seamlessly<00:00:43.789> make<00:00:43.969> the

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
a symbol that could seamlessly make the

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:45.790 
a symbol that could seamlessly make the
transition<00:00:44.570> between<00:00:44.690> articulate<00:00:45.530> stick

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
transition between articulate stick

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.200 
transition between articulate stick
definition<00:00:46.370> when<00:00:46.460> you<00:00:46.489> play<00:00:46.729> it<00:00:46.789> on<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:46.909> top

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
definition when you play it on the top

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.719 
definition when you play it on the top
into<00:00:47.899> that<00:00:48.079> wide<00:00:48.440> open<00:00:48.890> crash<00:00:49.219> out<00:00:49.519> you're

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
into that wide open crash out you're

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.469 
into that wide open crash out you're
really<00:00:49.879> late<00:00:50.179> into<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.539> side<00:00:50.750> of<00:00:50.780> it<00:00:52.479> the

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:53.479 
really late into the side of it the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:55.299 
really late into the side of it the
symbol<00:00:53.839> itself<00:00:54.079> is<00:00:54.320> a<00:00:54.350> joy<00:00:54.710> to<00:00:54.739> play<00:00:54.949> like

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
symbol itself is a joy to play like

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.279 
symbol itself is a joy to play like
physically<00:00:55.909> it's<00:00:56.089> a<00:00:56.210> joy<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.479> play<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:57.019> symbol

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
physically it's a joy to play the symbol

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.340 
physically it's a joy to play the symbol
because<00:00:57.820> it's<00:00:58.820> got<00:00:59.000> a<00:00:59.030> little<00:00:59.210> give<00:00:59.539> in<00:00:59.719> it<00:00:59.839> so

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
because it's got a little give in it so

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.049 
because it's got a little give in it so
when<00:01:00.530> you<00:01:00.649> play<00:01:00.920> it<00:01:01.100> it<00:01:01.159> kind<00:01:01.399> of<00:01:01.460> plays<00:01:01.699> back

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
when you play it it kind of plays back

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.700 
when you play it it kind of plays back
for<00:01:02.359> you<00:01:02.479> and<00:01:02.629> it's<00:01:02.989> actually<00:01:03.289> a<00:01:03.350> lot<00:01:03.559> of<00:01:03.589> fun

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
for you and it's actually a lot of fun

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.380 
for you and it's actually a lot of fun
to<00:01:03.979> play<00:01:04.100> when<00:01:04.430> you<00:01:04.489> play<00:01:04.670> it<00:01:04.970> for<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:05.180> first

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
to play when you play it for the first

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.669 
to play when you play it for the first
time<00:01:05.570> you'll<00:01:05.899> know<00:01:06.020> exactly<00:01:06.439> what<00:01:06.590> I'm

00:01:06.669 --> 00:01:06.679 
time you'll know exactly what I'm

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:11.260 
time you'll know exactly what I'm
talking<00:01:06.710> about<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:10.580> transition<00:01:10.819> right<00:01:11.210> it

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
talking about the transition right it

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.389 
talking about the transition right it
has<00:01:11.360> fine<00:01:11.810> fine<00:01:12.140> leading<00:01:12.649> on<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:12.979> bottom<00:01:13.280> of

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
has fine fine leading on the bottom of

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:14.770 
has fine fine leading on the bottom of
the<00:01:13.490> symbol<00:01:13.819> leading<00:01:14.090> all<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.270> way<00:01:14.390> up<00:01:14.509> to<00:01:14.659> the

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
the symbol leading all the way up to the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.539 
the symbol leading all the way up to the
belt<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.350> what<00:01:15.440> that<00:01:15.590> does<00:01:15.799> is<00:01:16.009> that<00:01:16.039> allows<00:01:16.190> a

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
belt and what that does is that allows a

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.700 
belt and what that does is that allows a
little<00:01:16.909> bit<00:01:17.000> of<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.149> crash<00:01:17.539> to<00:01:17.990> come<00:01:18.200> into<00:01:18.470> the

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
little bit of the crash to come into the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.289 
little bit of the crash to come into the
ride<00:01:18.920> so<00:01:19.429> when<00:01:19.580> you're<00:01:19.700> playing<00:01:19.940> the<00:01:20.119> ride

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
ride so when you're playing the ride

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.449 
ride so when you're playing the ride
symbol<00:01:20.659> in<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:20.869> traditional<00:01:21.470> sense<00:01:21.709> there's

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:22.459 
symbol in the traditional sense there's

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:24.370 
symbol in the traditional sense there's
this<00:01:22.670> wash<00:01:23.179> there's<00:01:23.720> almost<00:01:23.899> like<00:01:24.200> this

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
this wash there's almost like this

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.230 
this wash there's almost like this
shimmer<00:01:24.740> that<00:01:24.860> goes<00:01:25.130> over<00:01:25.459> the<00:01:25.549> drumset<00:01:26.000> and

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
shimmer that goes over the drumset and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.300 
shimmer that goes over the drumset and
once<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:26.869> have<00:01:27.080> that<00:01:27.289> you<00:01:28.039> don't<00:01:28.159> want<00:01:28.280> to

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
once you have that you don't want to

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.590 
once you have that you don't want to
play<00:01:28.459> without<00:01:28.640> it<00:01:28.940> I<00:01:33.130> grew<00:01:34.130> up<00:01:34.190> playing<00:01:35.090> rock

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
play without it I grew up playing rock

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.679 
play without it I grew up playing rock
so<00:01:36.530> uh<00:01:36.560> I've<00:01:37.009> always<00:01:37.490> been<00:01:37.700> somebody<00:01:37.970> crashes

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
so uh I've always been somebody crashes

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.200 
so uh I've always been somebody crashes
on<00:01:38.810> my<00:01:38.930> ride<00:01:39.280> but<00:01:40.280> generally<00:01:40.729> when<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:41.000> do

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
on my ride but generally when you do

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.359 
on my ride but generally when you do
that<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.990> ride<00:01:42.259> just<00:01:42.560> gets<00:01:42.770> really<00:01:43.189> loud

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
that the ride just gets really loud

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.249 
that the ride just gets really loud
they've<00:01:43.670> never<00:01:43.820> really<00:01:44.030> crashes<00:01:44.719> just<00:01:44.960> keeps

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
they've never really crashes just keeps

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.569 
they've never really crashes just keeps
getting<00:01:45.560> louder<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:45.979> louder<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.490> louder

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
getting louder and louder and louder

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.880 
getting louder and louder and louder
sounding<00:01:47.420> like<00:01:47.570> a<00:01:47.600> ride<00:01:47.840> cymbal<00:01:48.079> so<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.649> have<00:01:48.859> a

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
sounding like a ride cymbal so to have a

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.179 
sounding like a ride cymbal so to have a
symbol<00:01:49.399> like<00:01:49.789> this<00:01:50.090> where<00:01:50.990> I<00:01:51.380> can<00:01:51.829> start<00:01:52.100> to

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
symbol like this where I can start to

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.950 
symbol like this where I can start to
crash<00:01:52.490> on<00:01:52.729> it<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:52.969> it<00:01:53.090> sounds<00:01:53.450> like<00:01:53.479> a<00:01:53.570> big

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
crash on it and it sounds like a big

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.080 
crash on it and it sounds like a big
giant<00:01:54.289> crash<00:01:54.590> it's<00:01:54.829> a<00:01:54.859> 21<00:01:55.340> inch<00:01:55.369> cymbal<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:55.969> it

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
giant crash it's a 21 inch cymbal so it

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.060 
giant crash it's a 21 inch cymbal so it
is<00:01:56.179> a<00:01:56.210> big<00:01:56.539> symbol<00:01:56.869> but<00:01:57.530> because<00:01:57.859> of<00:01:57.890> the

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
is a big symbol but because of the

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.380 
is a big symbol but because of the
lading<00:01:58.369> on<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.579> bottom<00:01:58.880> it<00:01:58.969> allows<00:01:59.179> it<00:01:59.359> to

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
lading on the bottom it allows it to

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.570 
lading on the bottom it allows it to
open<00:01:59.750> up<00:01:59.869> into<00:02:00.229> a<00:02:00.259> crash<00:02:00.590> cymbal<00:02:00.770> which<00:02:01.039> is

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
open up into a crash cymbal which is

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.670 
open up into a crash cymbal which is
it's<00:02:02.330> a<00:02:02.420> dream<00:02:02.630> come<00:02:02.840> true<00:02:05.470> well<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.560> other

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
it's a dream come true well the other

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.600 
it's a dream come true well the other
thing<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:06.860> we<00:02:07.040> work<00:02:07.160> really<00:02:07.310> hard<00:02:07.430> to

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
thing that we work really hard to

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.700 
thing that we work really hard to
achieve<00:02:07.700> with<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.150> transition<00:02:08.630> ride<00:02:08.810> was<00:02:09.320> to

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
achieve with the transition ride was to

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:10.900 
achieve with the transition ride was to
get<00:02:09.890> it<00:02:10.010> so<00:02:10.160> that<00:02:10.190> when<00:02:10.460> you<00:02:10.580> were<00:02:10.700> done

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
get it so that when you were done

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.090 
get it so that when you were done
crashing<00:02:11.540> on<00:02:11.660> it<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:12.140> decay<00:02:12.500> would<00:02:12.620> be<00:02:12.770> very

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
crashing on it the decay would be very

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.890 
crashing on it the decay would be very
fast<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.670> allow<00:02:13.880> you<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.090> get<00:02:14.390> right<00:02:14.660> back

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
fast and allow you to get right back

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.630 
fast and allow you to get right back
into<00:02:15.320> playing<00:02:15.530> on<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.740> top<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.310> getting<00:02:16.490> that

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
into playing on the top and getting that

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.960 
into playing on the top and getting that
great<00:02:16.850> stick<00:02:17.150> definition<00:02:18.550> that<00:02:19.550> was<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.790> big

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
great stick definition that was the big

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.250 
great stick definition that was the big
goal<00:02:20.150> with<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.420> transition<00:02:20.900> ride<00:02:21.050> was

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
goal with the transition ride was

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:29.430 
goal with the transition ride was
getting<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.680> happen<00:02:21.830> almost<00:02:22.220> instantly

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.810 

but<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.560> bell<00:02:30.770> I<00:02:30.800> wanted<00:02:31.220> something<00:02:31.550> really

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
but the bell I wanted something really

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.460 
but the bell I wanted something really
specific<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.570> was<00:02:32.690> really<00:02:32.930> important<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.410> me

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
specific it was really important to me

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.110 
specific it was really important to me
to<00:02:33.620> get<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.860> bell<00:02:34.070> right<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.850> what<00:02:34.940> I<00:02:34.970> was

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
to get the bell right and what I was

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.840 
to get the bell right and what I was
looking<00:02:35.420> for<00:02:35.660> was<00:02:35.960> a<00:02:36.230> bell<00:02:36.740> version<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.610> the

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
looking for was a bell version of the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.330 
looking for was a bell version of the
symbol<00:02:38.240> I<00:02:38.510> wanted<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.560> bell<00:02:39.740> to<00:02:39.950> sound<00:02:40.160> like

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
symbol I wanted the bell to sound like

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:49.880 
symbol I wanted the bell to sound like
simple<00:02:40.790> instead<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.150> being<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:41.420> detached

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.870 

another<00:02:50.890> thing<00:02:51.070> that<00:02:51.100> was<00:02:51.220> really<00:02:51.280> important

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
another thing that was really important

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.000 
another thing that was really important
was<00:02:51.910> that<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.660> bell<00:02:52.960> would<00:02:53.560> actually

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
was that the bell would actually

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.340 
was that the bell would actually
activate<00:02:54.610> simple<00:02:55.120> what<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:55.780> mean<00:02:55.960> by<00:02:56.080> that<00:02:56.200> is

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
activate simple what I mean by that is

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.050 
activate simple what I mean by that is
when<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.650> play<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.160> bell<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.520> transition

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
when you play the bell of the transition

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.780 
when you play the bell of the transition
right<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:59.260> whole<00:02:59.590> ride<00:02:59.920> starts<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.460> move<00:03:00.610> and

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
right the whole ride starts to move and

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.910 
right the whole ride starts to move and
you<00:03:00.820> start<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.240> hear<00:03:01.450> that<00:03:02.110> really<00:03:02.440> beautiful

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
you start to hear that really beautiful

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.410 
you start to hear that really beautiful
shimmer<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:03.460> the<00:03:03.580> transition<00:03:04.030> ride<00:03:04.180> makes

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
shimmer that the transition ride makes

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.150 
shimmer that the transition ride makes
you<00:03:04.870> hear<00:03:05.080> that<00:03:05.200> even<00:03:05.530> when<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:05.770> play<00:03:05.950> off<00:03:06.070> the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
you hear that even when you play off the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.740 
you hear that even when you play off the
bell<00:03:11.760> when<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.850> came<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.300> look<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.630> the

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
bell when it came to the look of the

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.390 
bell when it came to the look of the
symbol<00:03:14.140> you<00:03:14.290> know<00:03:14.350> I've<00:03:14.680> always<00:03:14.980> loved<00:03:15.190> the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
symbol you know I've always loved the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.870 
symbol you know I've always loved the
look<00:03:15.610> of<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.000> Meinl<00:03:16.690> extra-dry<00:03:17.380> series<00:03:18.070> and

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
look of the Meinl extra-dry series and

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.470 
look of the Meinl extra-dry series and
so<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.120> wanted<00:03:19.390> it<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.720> be<00:03:20.070> similar<00:03:21.070> to<00:03:21.280> that<00:03:21.480> but

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
so I wanted it to be similar to that but

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.180 
so I wanted it to be similar to that but
still<00:03:22.720> unique<00:03:23.170> so<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.500> transition<00:03:23.860> lightly

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
still unique so the transition lightly

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.500 
still unique so the transition lightly
stick<00:03:24.460> out<00:03:24.640> so<00:03:24.850> what<00:03:24.970> they<00:03:25.090> did<00:03:25.240> was<00:03:25.360> they<00:03:25.480> did

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
stick out so what they did was they did

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.720 
stick out so what they did was they did
kind<00:03:25.810> of<00:03:25.900> like<00:03:25.990> a<00:03:26.110> half<00:03:26.380> polish<00:03:26.770> so<00:03:27.460> it's<00:03:27.580> not

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
kind of like a half polish so it's not

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.910 
kind of like a half polish so it's not
completely<00:03:28.270> raw<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:28.900> it's<00:03:29.110> not<00:03:29.290> completely

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
completely raw and it's not completely

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.790 
completely raw and it's not completely
brilliant<00:03:30.490> very<00:03:31.330> cool<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:31.990> then<00:03:32.500> on<00:03:32.680> the

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
brilliant very cool and then on the

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.160 
brilliant very cool and then on the
bottom<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.940> leaving<00:03:34.480> goes<00:03:34.660> all<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.900> way<00:03:35.020> up

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
bottom the leaving goes all the way up

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.870 
bottom the leaving goes all the way up
to<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.380> bell<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:35.680> was<00:03:35.830> done<00:03:36.130> for<00:03:36.310> sound<00:03:36.610> I

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
to the bell that was done for sound I

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:45.100 
to the bell that was done for sound I
think<00:03:37.270> it<00:03:37.420> also<00:03:37.570> looks<00:03:37.900> pretty<00:03:37.990> amazing<00:03:38.530> too

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.670 

I<00:03:49.870> think<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:50.930> thing<00:03:51.080> that<00:03:51.110> I'm<00:03:51.320> most<00:03:51.350> excited

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
I think the thing that I'm most excited

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.220 
I think the thing that I'm most excited
about<00:03:52.070> besides<00:03:52.310> having<00:03:52.850> the<00:03:52.940> symbol<00:03:53.270> is<00:03:53.720> you

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
about besides having the symbol is you

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.960 
about besides having the symbol is you
guys<00:03:54.410> having<00:03:54.800> the<00:03:54.860> symbol<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.340> idea<00:03:55.700> that<00:03:55.880> I

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
guys having the symbol the idea that I

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.090 
guys having the symbol the idea that I
could<00:03:56.120> walk<00:03:56.300> into<00:03:56.540> a<00:03:56.570> club<00:03:56.780> one<00:03:56.990> day<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:57.830> see

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
could walk into a club one day and see

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.740 
could walk into a club one day and see
someone<00:03:58.310> playing<00:03:58.700> my<00:03:58.880> signature<00:03:59.300> symbol<00:03:59.600> go

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
someone playing my signature symbol go

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.300 
someone playing my signature symbol go
dude<00:04:00.230> is<00:04:00.410> that<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.680> transition<00:04:00.980> right<00:04:01.280> I

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
dude is that the transition right I

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.280 
dude is that the transition right I
would<00:04:01.760> freak<00:04:02.120> out<00:04:02.300> and<00:04:02.360> lose<00:04:02.720> my<00:04:02.900> mind<00:04:03.080> it
