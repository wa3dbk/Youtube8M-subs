00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.450
 the national autonomous university of 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:07.370
 Mexico through the faculty of 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.309
 and its chemical laboratory 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.309
 experimental microbiology presents 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.910
 staining in two by a 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.730
 the in 2 x is a structure of 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.900
 resistance that is formed in some 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.900
 bacterial genera such as bacillus and 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.239
 clostridium this structure conforms 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.550
 for a proto dish containing the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.820
 genetic material and a high percentage 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.339
 Eddie's picolinate calcium 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.909
 found surrounded by different layers of 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:47.790
 variable composition because of this are 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:50.460
 impervious to dyes and in 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.309
 simple functions appear as regions 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.410
 colorless so to dye them is 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.930
 necessary to use heat 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.330
 the selective staining technique of endo 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.420
 spore is a procedure where the 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.000
 primary dye ring this structure 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.320
 and another dye is applied to highlight 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.320
 to the vegetative cell 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.100
 to perform the staining we need the 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.490
 next material a box of 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.490
 slide 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.770
 a tray with a little background 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.750
 a glass bridge 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.930
 It is an apex with tap water 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.190
 a lighter 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.280
 a tripod with foil 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.590
 a beaker 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:56.130
 pieces of filter paper 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.130
 and some blunt-nose pliers 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.010
 a clock 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:07.880
 a jar with malachite green 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.569
 a jar with zafra or na to the 5 % point 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.040
 immersion oil 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.040
 and a microscope 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.200
 Once the smear is done and after 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.290
 fix it we start the procedure of 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.260
 staining first we place on the 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.569
 smear a fragment of filter paper and 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.239
 add a few drops of the green dye 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.819
 from malachite to saturate them avoiding 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.760
 that runs to dye the two in a 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.190
 it is necessary to heat the preparation and 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.379
 be applying the flame directly 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.930
 about preparation or so 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:53.340
 Indirect through the vapors emitted 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.340
 by boiling water 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.710
 the application of contrast dye 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.710
 It is done cold 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.650
 for the direct heating process 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.230
 we add a few drops of the dye 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.930
 malachite green to moisten the 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.569
 paper we heat the smear doing 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.239
 pass the lighter on in 5 loops 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.239
 to 10 seconds for a total time of 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.860
 10 minutes it is important to avoid that the 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.440
 coloring boils or dries and 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.750
 crystallize for it you have to add 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.370
 a few drops of the dye when the paper 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.370
 filter starts to dry 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.320
 during indirect heating the 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.870
 slide with filter paper 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.090
 moistened with the green malachite 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.970
 place on a beaker that 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.090
 contains boiling water heating 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.950
 it stays for 10 minutes lapse in 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.710
 which is added a few drops of 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.080
 dye to prevent this dry 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.350
 and crystallize after the time of 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.350
 heating 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.770
 the lighter is turned off and placed 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.540
 glass slide on the bridge 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:14.100
 we remove the filter paper and place it 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:17.019
 in a plastic bag for disposal 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.090
 we wash the preparation with enough 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.720
 water to eliminate excess 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.720
 Colorant 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.759
 finally we added the child harvest to 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:36.300
 0.5 percent and we let it act a 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.300
 minute 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.680
 passed the time 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.900
 and we're going with water to eliminate the 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.900
 excess reagent 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.580
 and we let the preparation dry 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.420
 to observe it later at 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:06.400
 microscope with the objective of 100 xy 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.400
 perform the description of the bacteria 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:17.009
 we observe the shape and position of the 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.470
 two by which were dyed 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:22.150
 green color 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:25.540
 remember that the two hours can 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.420
 be oval or round and can be 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:32.220
 find in terminal or central position 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.220
 in the bacillus that originates it 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.760
 once the observation is finished 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.890
 we place the slide in a 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.520
 container with disinfectant for your 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.889
 after washing 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.690
 and we also have to clean the oil 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.690
 of immersion of the objective 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.460
 remember that it is important that the 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.800
 dye is only applied during the 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.449
 time indicated as it dries 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:04.629
 crystallizes and observation is difficult 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:06.759
 also we should not use saffron 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:09.849
 inah of great because it has a 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:14.159
 lower concentration which would not allow 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:14.159
 adequately highlight the cells
