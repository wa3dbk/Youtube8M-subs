okay now the soul is not totally

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.460 
okay now the soul is not totally
defrosted<00:01:11.880> cause<00:01:12.880> it<00:01:13.030> is<00:01:13.150> a<00:01:13.180> little<00:01:13.390> easier<00:01:13.720> to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
defrosted cause it is a little easier to

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.219 
defrosted cause it is a little easier to
pull<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.830> bone<00:01:15.040> off<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:16.479> pull<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:16.840> skin<00:01:17.170> off

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
pull the bone off to pull the skin off

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.830 
pull the bone off to pull the skin off
when<00:01:17.680> it<00:01:17.830> is<00:01:18.040> one<00:01:18.820> of<00:01:18.940> there's<00:01:19.120> still<00:01:19.420> a<00:01:19.450> little

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
when it is one of there's still a little

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.400 
when it is one of there's still a little
bit<00:01:20.050> frozen<00:01:20.830> so<00:01:21.670> first<00:01:22.360> I<00:01:22.540> cut<00:01:22.780> off<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.020> little

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
bit frozen so first I cut off the little

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.160 
bit frozen so first I cut off the little
bit<00:01:23.530> of<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:23.920> side<00:01:24.190> bone<00:01:24.490> here<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.900> I<00:01:25.930> don't

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
bit of the side bone here so I don't

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.970 
bit of the side bone here so I don't
have<00:01:26.290> to<00:01:26.470> deal<00:01:26.770> with<00:01:26.800> that<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.880> I<00:01:30.970> cut<00:01:31.270> this

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
have to deal with that and so I cut this

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.500 
have to deal with that and so I cut this
and<00:01:32.980> he's<00:01:33.130> actually<00:01:33.580> it<00:01:33.730> works<00:01:33.940> better<00:01:34.240> with

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
and he's actually it works better with

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:44.000 
and he's actually it works better with
this<00:01:34.690> knife<00:01:35.670> see<00:01:38.250> there<00:01:39.250> you<00:01:39.340> go<00:01:40.410> that's<00:01:41.410> gone

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.330 

that's<00:01:45.010> it<00:01:45.340> I<00:01:45.720> put<00:01:46.720> that<00:01:46.840> in<00:01:47.080> this<00:01:47.800> is<00:01:47.980> gonna<00:01:48.190> be

do the same thing on this side and I'll
remember<00:01:54.160> there's<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.610> row<00:01:54.910> so<00:01:55.660> I<00:01:55.720> don't<00:01:55.900> want

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
remember there's a row so I don't want

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.280 
remember there's a row so I don't want
to<00:01:56.110> do<00:01:56.230> anything<00:01:56.500> with<00:01:56.800> that<00:01:57.720> this<00:01:58.720> knife<00:01:59.050> is

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
to do anything with that this knife is

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.920

sharp<00:01:59.980> enough<00:02:00.100> I<00:02:00.990> can<00:02:01.990> just<00:02:02.200> cut<00:02:02.440> off<00:02:02.620> that

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
sharp enough I can just cut off that

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.469 
sharp enough I can just cut off that
little<00:02:04.930> side<00:02:05.200> strip<00:02:07.140> there<00:02:08.140> she<00:02:08.349> goes

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
little side strip there she goes

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.300 
little side strip there she goes
there<00:02:10.479> we<00:02:10.810> go<00:02:11.019> now<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.970> is<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.269> tricky<00:02:13.659> part

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
there we go now this is a tricky part

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.610 
there we go now this is a tricky part
I'm<00:02:15.310> gonna<00:02:15.550> stop<00:02:15.819> one<00:02:16.030> time<00:02:16.269> okay<00:02:17.050> so<00:02:17.080> now<00:02:17.560> the

I'm gonna stop one time okay so now the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.430 
I'm gonna stop one time okay so now the
tricky<00:02:18.340> part<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:18.819> I<00:02:19.150> have<00:02:19.659> to<00:02:19.810> pull<00:02:20.080> off<00:02:20.260> the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
tricky part is I have to pull off the

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.860 
tricky part is I have to pull off the
skin<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:21.250> light<00:02:21.519> skin<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.360> skin<00:02:22.510> from

look at that

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.619 
look at that
now<00:02:58.000> let's<00:02:58.390> do<00:02:58.510> this<00:02:58.689> side<00:02:59.459> and<00:03:00.459> see<00:03:01.180> how<00:03:01.389> it

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
now let's do this side and see how it

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:09.660 
now let's do this side and see how it
works<00:03:04.469> it's<00:03:05.469> very<00:03:05.769> similar<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.769> trim<00:03:09.489> it<00:03:09.579> a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
works it's very similar and trim it a

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.330 
works it's very similar and trim it a
little<00:03:09.700> bit<00:03:10.180> so<00:03:10.540> it<00:03:10.599> comes<00:03:10.900> off<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.379> after

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
little bit so it comes off the after

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.159 
little bit so it comes off the after
flash<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:13.780> now<00:03:14.109> I<00:03:14.139> just<00:03:14.620> pull<00:03:15.689> with<00:03:16.689> my<00:03:16.900> hand

flash and now I just pull with my hand
is<00:03:17.409> a<00:03:17.439> little<00:03:17.680> slippery<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:18.609> I<00:03:18.669> guess<00:03:19.000> I'll<00:03:19.299> use

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
is a little slippery so I guess I'll use

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.080

go oh this will show how you can just do

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.270 
go oh this will show how you can just do
it<00:03:46.150> that<00:03:46.540> way<00:03:46.780> too<00:03:47.909> and<00:03:48.909> then<00:03:49.739> there<00:03:50.739> you<00:03:50.769> go

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
it that way too and then there you go

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.860 
it that way too and then there you go
see<00:03:53.190> now<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.930> write<00:03:55.930> back<00:03:56.199> to<00:03:56.409> the<00:03:56.530> whole<00:03:56.709> skin

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
see now I write back to the whole skin

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.539 
see now I write back to the whole skin
and<00:03:58.870> I<00:03:59.019> put<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:01.000> there<00:04:01.449> he<00:04:01.750> goes

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
and I put and there he goes

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.759 
and I put and there he goes
and<00:04:03.549> I<00:04:03.760> guess<00:04:04.030> that<00:04:04.060> but<00:04:04.599> it's<00:04:04.750> more<00:04:05.079> ways<00:04:05.409> to

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
and I guess that but it's more ways to

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.830 
and I guess that but it's more ways to
skin<00:04:06.250> a<00:04:06.280> cat<00:04:07.229> not<00:04:08.229> use<00:04:08.409> the<00:04:08.650> row<00:04:09.329> so<00:04:10.329> now<00:04:10.510> I'm
