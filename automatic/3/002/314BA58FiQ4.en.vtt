against f 4 for 11 squad and this
opponent<00:00:26.279> was<00:00:26.490> just<00:00:26.670> really<00:00:27.210> really<00:00:27.449> strong

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
opponent was just really really strong

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.570

and<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:30.210> was<00:00:30.330> really<00:00:30.660> difficult<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.320> defend

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
and it was really difficult to defend

the food bowls and over the tofu balls

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.180

because<00:00:33.870> there's<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.410> many<00:00:34.620> attacking

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
because there's so many attacking

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.220 
because there's so many attacking
players<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.670> he<00:00:36.030> will<00:00:36.239> make<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.630> one<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
players and he will make it one in the

kickoff would pick the ball up we go

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.410 
kickoff would pick the ball up we go
with<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> basic<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.490> very<00:01:32.520> effective<00:01:33.000> skill

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
with the basic and very effective skill

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.569 
with the basic and very effective skill
moves<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.689> go<00:01:33.840> past<00:01:34.079> three<00:01:34.380> defenders<00:01:34.579> made

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
moves to go past three defenders made

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.609 
moves to go past three defenders made
our<00:01:35.729> way<00:01:35.850> into<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.360> box<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:37.020> his<00:01:37.140> final

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
our way into the box but his final

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.380 
our way into the box but his final
defender<00:01:37.979> will<00:01:38.130> get<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> foot<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.850> ball<00:01:39.150> and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
defender will get a foot to the ball and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.030 
defender will get a foot to the ball and
save<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.990> maybe<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.259> should<00:01:40.470> take<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.740> shot

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
save and maybe I should take this shot

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.010 
save and maybe I should take this shot
at<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.369> near<00:01:41.520> post<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.030> maybe<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.780> could<00:01:42.960> have

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
at the near post and maybe I could have

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.270 
at the near post and maybe I could have
gotten<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.259> gold<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:43.590> nonetheless<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.100> game

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
gotten a gold but nonetheless the game

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.999 
gotten a gold but nonetheless the game
and<00:01:44.430> set<00:01:44.610> for<00:01:44.850> 24<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:46.110> only<00:01:46.320> get<00:01:46.500> one<00:01:46.710> point

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
and set for 24 and I only get one point

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.620 
and set for 24 and I only get one point
and<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.250> means<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.610> do<00:01:47.670> not<00:01:48.000> get<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.390> title

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
and that means I do not get the title

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.200 
and that means I do not get the title
after<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.740> game<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.970> would<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.149> been

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
after this game and it would have been

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.609 
after this game and it would have been
nice<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.420> pick<00:01:51.750> up<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> win<00:01:52.049> there<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.439> get

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
nice to pick up the win there and get

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.380 
nice to pick up the win there and get
the<00:01:52.770> exact<00:01:53.100> amount<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.520> points<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.030> win<00:01:54.210> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
the exact amount of points and win the

that goal but straight from his kick off

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.840 
that goal but straight from his kick off
he<00:03:04.990> runs<00:03:05.170> down<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.560> line<00:03:05.740> he<00:03:05.950> crosses<00:03:06.280> in<00:03:06.640> and

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
he runs down the line he crosses in and

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.449 
he runs down the line he crosses in and
it's<00:03:07.630> matter<00:03:08.020> of<00:03:08.320> all<00:03:08.560> people<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:08.980> head<00:03:09.310> it

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
it's matter of all people to head it

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.610

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
into making 11 and at that point time I

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.190 
into making 11 and at that point time I
believe<00:03:11.890> he<00:03:11.980> only<00:03:12.130> had<00:03:12.340> two<00:03:12.550> shots<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.200> after

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
believe he only had two shots and after

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.840 
believe he only had two shots and after
that<00:03:14.320> it<00:03:14.560> just<00:03:14.590> went<00:03:15.010> downhill<00:03:15.070> Mikey<00:03:15.670> but

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
that it just went downhill Mikey but

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.580 
that it just went downhill Mikey but
didn't<00:03:16.120> clear<00:03:16.360> it<00:03:16.390> when<00:03:16.630> he<00:03:16.720> rushed<00:03:17.320> out<00:03:17.560> to

i do prefer playing with two strikers on
top<00:05:48.340> and<00:05:48.490> I<00:05:48.580> felt<00:05:48.819> playing<00:05:49.509> the<00:05:49.630> fall<00:05:49.779> to<00:05:49.930> 31<00:05:50.349> I

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
top and I felt playing the fall to 31 I

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.019 
top and I felt playing the fall to 31 I
had<00:05:50.830> a<00:05:50.860> lot<00:05:51.039> of<00:05:51.099> players<00:05:51.310> going<00:05:51.550> forward<00:05:51.940> but

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:52.029 
had a lot of players going forward but

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:53.879 
had a lot of players going forward but

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
only partial alone on the top and I

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:55.290 
only partial alone on the top and I
wanted<00:05:54.099> to<00:05:54.219> try<00:05:54.400> it<00:05:54.430> out<00:05:54.550> with<00:05:54.610> Sturridge<00:05:55.120> and

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
wanted to try it out with Sturridge and

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.059 
wanted to try it out with Sturridge and
partial<00:05:55.750> alongside<00:05:56.050> each<00:05:56.229> other<00:05:56.529> on<00:05:56.740> the<00:05:56.860> top

partial alongside each other on the top

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:58.589 
partial alongside each other on the top
so<00:05:57.250> change<00:05:57.610> the<00:05:57.669> formation<00:05:58.060> around<00:05:58.150> pick<00:05:58.479> up

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
so change the formation around pick up

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:00.480 
so change the formation around pick up
storage<00:05:58.930> as<00:05:59.139> a<00:05:59.169> striker<00:05:59.529> picked<00:06:00.279> up<00:06:00.400> a

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
storage as a striker picked up a

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.029 
storage as a striker picked up a
precision<00:06:00.940> modifier<00:06:01.060> for<00:06:01.840> farella<00:06:02.680> and<00:06:02.949> we

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
precision modifier for farella and we

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:05.490 
precision modifier for farella and we
picked<00:06:03.310> up<00:06:03.490> a<00:06:03.699> chemistry<00:06:04.509> style<00:06:04.779> for<00:06:04.960> check<00:06:05.229> so

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
picked up a chemistry style for check so

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.950 
picked up a chemistry style for check so
yeah<00:06:06.099> we<00:06:06.279> change<00:06:06.490> the<00:06:06.639> 4231<00:06:07.210> formation<00:06:07.719> squad

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
yeah we change the 4231 formation squad

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.860 
yeah we change the 4231 formation squad
into<00:06:08.319> a<00:06:08.349> 4222<00:06:09.130> and<00:06:09.610> we<00:06:10.029> got<00:06:10.210> Sturridge<00:06:10.569> on<00:06:10.750> the

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
into a 4222 and we got Sturridge on the

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.480 
into a 4222 and we got Sturridge on the

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
top alongside well part so instead of

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.100 
top alongside well part so instead of
having<00:06:12.550> started<00:06:13.029> on<00:06:13.180> the<00:06:13.360> center<00:06:13.690> attacking
