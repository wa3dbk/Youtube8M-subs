00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.960 

excellent<00:00:42.880> I<00:00:44.310> was<00:00:45.310> going<00:00:45.520> to<00:00:45.640> do<00:00:45.730> a<00:00:45.760> tutorial

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
excellent I was going to do a tutorial

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.760 
excellent I was going to do a tutorial
for<00:00:46.510> this<00:00:48.210> but<00:00:49.210> with<00:00:49.330> 1.3<00:00:49.900> coming<00:00:50.440> out<00:00:50.590> very

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
for this but with 1.3 coming out very

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.970 
for this but with 1.3 coming out very
soon<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.910> will<00:00:52.360> only<00:00:52.540> need<00:00:52.810> half<00:00:53.440> as<00:00:53.620> many<00:00:53.770> of

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
soon you will only need half as many of

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.460 
soon you will only need half as many of
these<00:00:54.100> bookshelves<00:00:54.640> to<00:00:54.820> get<00:00:55.000> maximum

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
these bookshelves to get maximum

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.180 
these bookshelves to get maximum
enchanting<00:00:58.080> so<00:00:59.080> I'm<00:00:59.470> thinking<00:00:59.800> that<00:00:59.980> instead

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
enchanting so I'm thinking that instead

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.220 
enchanting so I'm thinking that instead
of<00:01:00.370> doing<00:01:00.550> a<00:01:00.700> tutorial<00:01:00.850> on<00:01:01.180> this<00:01:01.420> I'll<00:01:01.810> do<00:01:02.200> a

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
of doing a tutorial on this I'll do a

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.210 
of doing a tutorial on this I'll do a
tutorial<00:01:02.410> on<00:01:02.800> this<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:06.580> a<00:01:06.640> lot<00:01:06.820> more<00:01:07.060> simple

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
tutorial on this it's a lot more simple

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.859 
tutorial on this it's a lot more simple
but<00:01:09.220> it's<00:01:09.370> still<00:01:09.520> bud<00:01:09.910> activated<00:01:10.780> and

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
but it's still bud activated and

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.770 
but it's still bud activated and
significantly<00:01:13.869> faster<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:16.000> let's<00:01:16.630> get

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
significantly faster so let's get

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.540 
significantly faster so let's get
started

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
started

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.499 
started
we're<00:01:18.550> gonna<00:01:18.640> start<00:01:18.970> off<00:01:19.060> with<00:01:19.210> a<00:01:19.240> whole

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
we're gonna start off with a whole

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.859 
we're gonna start off with a whole
that's<00:01:20.050> eight<00:01:20.550> blocks<00:01:21.550> by<00:01:21.880> nine<00:01:22.180> blocks<00:01:22.509> by

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
that's eight blocks by nine blocks by

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.499 
that's eight blocks by nine blocks by
four<00:01:23.259> blocks<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:24.280> we're<00:01:24.970> gonna<00:01:25.060> find<00:01:25.360> the

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
four blocks and we're gonna find the

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.980 
four blocks and we're gonna find the
middle<00:01:25.720> of<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.050> nine<00:01:26.320> side<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:27.570> build<00:01:28.570> three

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
middle of the nine side and build three

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.370 
middle of the nine side and build three
blocks<00:01:29.290> out<00:01:29.470> and<00:01:29.830> then<00:01:30.790> a<00:01:31.200> sticky<00:01:32.200> piston

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
blocks out and then a sticky piston

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.920 
blocks out and then a sticky piston
facing<00:01:32.800> downwards<00:01:33.400> from<00:01:33.580> that<00:01:33.729> block<00:01:34.000> and<00:01:34.270> we

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
facing downwards from that block and we

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.080 
facing downwards from that block and we
can<00:01:35.050> break<00:01:35.259> these<00:01:35.470> two<00:01:35.770> we're<00:01:36.580> starting<00:01:36.940> by

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
can break these two we're starting by

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.469 
can break these two we're starting by
building<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.869> underground<00:01:38.380> bud<00:01:39.250> switch<00:01:39.479> so

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
building the underground bud switch so

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.030 
building the underground bud switch so
we're<00:01:40.630> gonna<00:01:40.720> put<00:01:40.960> a<00:01:40.990> torch<00:01:41.290> directly<00:01:41.770> under

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
we're gonna put a torch directly under

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.020 
we're gonna put a torch directly under
that<00:01:42.070> and<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:43.090> block<00:01:43.360> on<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.990> piston<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:45.030> then

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
that and a block on the piston and then

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.520 
that and a block on the piston and then
we're<00:01:46.240> going<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.450> put<00:01:46.630> blocks<00:01:46.899> all<00:01:47.170> around

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
we're going to put blocks all around

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.660 
we're going to put blocks all around
this<00:01:49.229> torch<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:52.830> then<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:53.979> side<00:01:54.190> that's<00:01:54.460> got

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
this torch and then the side that's got

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.249 
this torch and then the side that's got
the<00:01:54.789> block<00:01:55.000> on<00:01:55.179> it<00:01:55.330> we're<00:01:55.929> just<00:01:55.960> going<00:01:56.170> to

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
the block on it we're just going to

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.260 
the block on it we're just going to
build<00:01:56.500> up<00:01:56.679> a<00:01:56.890> staircase<00:01:57.220> like<00:01:57.729> that

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
build up a staircase like that

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.969 
build up a staircase like that
the<00:01:58.960> last<00:01:59.170> place<00:01:59.410> we're<00:01:59.590> going<00:01:59.679> to<00:01:59.770> put<00:01:59.950> a

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
the last place we're going to put a

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.050 
the last place we're going to put a
block<00:02:00.280> is<00:02:00.580> in<00:02:00.910> this<00:02:01.119> back<00:02:01.420> corner<00:02:01.810> here<00:02:02.140> so<00:02:03.060> if

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
block is in this back corner here so if

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.190 
block is in this back corner here so if
we<00:02:04.119> place<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:05.020> redstone<00:02:05.380> here<00:02:05.979> and<00:02:07.050> here<00:02:08.050> and

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
we place a redstone here and here and

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.790 
we place a redstone here and here and
put<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.619> repeater<00:02:08.979> on<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.490> here<00:02:10.530> wire<00:02:11.530> around

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
put a repeater on to here wire around

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.150 
put a repeater on to here wire around
here<00:02:12.400> and<00:02:12.550> then<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:12.760> torch<00:02:13.150> there<00:02:14.010> try<00:02:15.010> that

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
here and then a torch there try that

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.570 
here and then a torch there try that
again<00:02:15.390> we're<00:02:16.390> gonna<00:02:16.480> start<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.930> clock<00:02:17.200> run<00:02:17.580> now

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
again we're gonna start a clock run now

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.750 
again we're gonna start a clock run now
we're<00:02:18.700> going<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.880> interrupt<00:02:19.120> this<00:02:19.620> clock<00:02:20.760> by

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
we're going to interrupt this clock by

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.130 
we're going to interrupt this clock by
putting<00:02:22.240> a<00:02:22.500> normal<00:02:23.500> piston<00:02:23.740> right<00:02:24.130> here<00:02:24.430> and

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
putting a normal piston right here and

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.510 
putting a normal piston right here and
wiring<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.260> on<00:02:26.530> an<00:02:26.680> extra<00:02:27.040> one<00:02:27.220> tick<00:02:27.459> delay

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
wiring that on an extra one tick delay

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.500 
wiring that on an extra one tick delay
so<00:02:30.520> that<00:02:30.730> when<00:02:31.300> we<00:02:31.680> when<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:32.770> goes<00:02:32.950> off<00:02:33.510> this

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
so that when we when it goes off this

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.600 
so that when we when it goes off this
this<00:02:34.569> piston<00:02:35.230> pushes<00:02:35.530> just<00:02:35.830> in<00:02:35.980> time<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.400> stop

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
this piston pushes just in time to stop

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.030 
this piston pushes just in time to stop
this<00:02:36.790> one<00:02:37.000> from<00:02:37.300> pushing<00:02:37.540> back<00:02:37.840> down<00:02:38.080> so<00:02:38.920> now

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
this one from pushing back down so now

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.070 
this one from pushing back down so now
this<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.400> even<00:02:39.640> though<00:02:39.849> it's<00:02:40.030> powered<00:02:40.480> it

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
this is even though it's powered it

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.750 
this is even though it's powered it
doesn't<00:02:41.470> realize<00:02:41.770> yet<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.220> it's<00:02:42.459> waiting<00:02:42.640> for

doesn't realize yet and it's waiting for

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.540 
doesn't realize yet and it's waiting for
a<00:02:42.910> block<00:02:43.090> update<00:02:43.300> so<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.870> is<00:02:44.080> actually<00:02:44.550> the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
a block update so that is actually the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.780 
a block update so that is actually the
bus<00:02:45.760> switch<00:02:46.209> completed<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.520> now<00:02:48.520> we're<00:02:48.670> going

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
bus switch completed and now we're going

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.750 
bus switch completed and now we're going
to<00:02:48.880> turn<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.090> into<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.540> tea<00:02:49.870> bud<00:02:50.110> which<00:02:50.680> is<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.430> bud

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
to turn it into a tea bud which is a bud

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.760 
to turn it into a tea bud which is a bud
switch<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.450> act

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
switch that act

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.160 
switch that act
as<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.920> tea<00:02:53.160> flip-flop<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.570> do<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.930> we

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
as a tea flip-flop and to do that we

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.020 
as a tea flip-flop and to do that we
just<00:02:55.350> put<00:02:55.560> some<00:02:55.590> redstone<00:02:55.950> on<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.460> block<00:02:56.730> or

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
just put some redstone on this block or

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.440 
just put some redstone on this block or
repeater<00:02:58.020> here<00:02:58.230> set<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.620> three<00:02:59.180> torch<00:03:00.180> on<00:03:00.420> the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
repeater here set to three torch on the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.420 
repeater here set to three torch on the
side<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.930> block<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.380> then<00:03:01.980> connect<00:03:02.340> this

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
side of the block and then connect this

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.970 
side of the block and then connect this
redstone<00:03:02.790> together<00:03:03.240> we're<00:03:04.230> going<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.410> connect

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
redstone together we're going to connect

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.070 
redstone together we're going to connect
that<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.370> this<00:03:05.520> block<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.150> put<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.450> torch<00:03:06.720> on<00:03:06.900> it

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
that to this block and put a torch on it

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.440 
that to this block and put a torch on it
and<00:03:07.230> then<00:03:08.190> just<00:03:08.370> for<00:03:08.550> testing<00:03:08.940> we're<00:03:09.270> going<00:03:09.390> to

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
and then just for testing we're going to

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.660 
and then just for testing we're going to
put<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.870> sticky<00:03:10.470> piston<00:03:10.650> on<00:03:11.010> that<00:03:11.190> with<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.400> block

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
put a sticky piston on that with a block

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.900 
put a sticky piston on that with a block
so<00:03:12.480> when<00:03:12.630> we<00:03:12.750> activate<00:03:13.230> this<00:03:13.410> bud<00:03:13.650> switch<00:03:13.910> it

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
so when we activate this bud switch it

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.230 
so when we activate this bud switch it
will<00:03:15.120> send<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.750> will<00:03:16.700> toggle<00:03:17.700> back<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.060> forth

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
will send it will toggle back and forth

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.830 
will send it will toggle back and forth
in<00:03:18.810> other<00:03:18.960> words<00:03:19.170> it's<00:03:19.380> it's<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:20.010> T<00:03:20.460> output<00:03:20.970> from

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
in other words it's it's a T output from

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.340 
in other words it's it's a T output from
the<00:03:22.050> bud<00:03:22.230> switch<00:03:22.580> so<00:03:23.580> that's<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.780> buzz<00:03:25.140> which

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
the bud switch so that's the buzz which

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.100 
the bud switch so that's the buzz which
done<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.860> we<00:03:26.070> can<00:03:26.220> move<00:03:26.400> on<00:03:26.610> to<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:27.110> pistons

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
done and we can move on to the pistons

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.010 
done and we can move on to the pistons
just<00:03:29.070> before<00:03:29.310> we<00:03:29.400> do<00:03:29.550> that<00:03:29.760> I'm<00:03:29.970> going<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.870> run

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
just before we do that I'm going to run

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.660 
just before we do that I'm going to run
a<00:03:31.050> wire<00:03:31.320> here<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:31.920> this<00:03:32.190> is<00:03:32.310> completely

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
a wire here and this is completely

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.850 
a wire here and this is completely
optional<00:03:32.960> but<00:03:33.960> what<00:03:34.140> this<00:03:34.260> will<00:03:34.440> allow<00:03:34.470> us<00:03:34.830> to

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
optional but what this will allow us to

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.640 
optional but what this will allow us to
do<00:03:35.160> is<00:03:35.460> add<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.760> button<00:03:36.180> later<00:03:36.420> if<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.930> want<00:03:37.200> to

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
do is add a button later if you want to

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.140 
do is add a button later if you want to
be<00:03:37.770> able<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:37.980> control<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:38.460> with<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.670> button<00:03:39.000> as

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
be able to control this with a button as

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.050 
be able to control this with a button as
well<00:03:39.390> as<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.600> bud<00:03:39.840> switch<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:40.580> I'm<00:03:41.580> also<00:03:41.790> just

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
well as the bud switch and I'm also just

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.390 
well as the bud switch and I'm also just
going<00:03:42.210> to<00:03:42.300> get<00:03:42.420> rid<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.470> testing<00:03:44.010> piston

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
going to get rid of the testing piston

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.940 
going to get rid of the testing piston
and<00:03:44.610> torch<00:03:45.000> there<00:03:45.300> so<00:03:46.290> now<00:03:46.500> we<00:03:46.560> can<00:03:46.740> put<00:03:46.860> the

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
and torch there so now we can put the

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.190 
and torch there so now we can put the
Pistons<00:03:47.340> in<00:03:47.520> and<00:03:47.730> I'm<00:03:48.390> going<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.600> do<00:03:48.720> that<00:03:48.930> just

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
Pistons in and I'm going to do that just

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:57.790 
Pistons in and I'm going to do that just
by<00:03:50.090> moving<00:03:51.090> one<00:03:51.240> out<00:03:51.540> here<00:03:51.990> and<00:03:52.200> making<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.890> ring

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.150 

and<00:03:59.540> then<00:04:00.540> we<00:04:00.570> want<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:00.930> put<00:04:01.140> blocks<00:04:01.650> in<00:04:01.920> so

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
and then we want to put blocks in so

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.490 
and then we want to put blocks in so
that<00:04:02.250> we<00:04:02.370> can<00:04:02.520> power<00:04:02.730> them<00:04:06.020> now<00:04:07.020> the<00:04:07.080> block

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
that we can power them now the block

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.690 
that we can power them now the block
that<00:04:07.709> goes<00:04:07.830> right<00:04:08.070> here<00:04:08.130> you're<00:04:08.550> going<00:04:08.640> to

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
that goes right here you're going to

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:17.990 
that goes right here you're going to
want<00:04:08.850> to<00:04:08.880> use<00:04:09.000> guy<00:04:09.240> stone

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.310 

now<00:04:19.000> these<00:04:19.180> parts<00:04:19.600> are<00:04:19.690> going<00:04:19.780> to<00:04:19.840> be<00:04:19.900> wired<00:04:20.170> up

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
now these parts are going to be wired up

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.780 
now these parts are going to be wired up
slightly<00:04:20.590> differently<00:04:20.799> we're<00:04:21.609> going<00:04:21.730> to

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
slightly differently we're going to

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.410 
slightly differently we're going to
power<00:04:22.030> these<00:04:22.270> four<00:04:22.630> Pistons<00:04:23.110> via<00:04:23.940> blocks<00:04:24.940> here

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
power these four Pistons via blocks here

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.000 
power these four Pistons via blocks here
the<00:04:25.690> repeater<00:04:26.020> goes<00:04:26.200> into<00:04:26.380> that<00:04:26.500> block<00:04:26.710> and

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
the repeater goes into that block and

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.070 
the repeater goes into that block and
then<00:04:27.190> redstone<00:04:27.730> on<00:04:27.940> this<00:04:28.540> block<00:04:28.780> to<00:04:28.810> power

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
then redstone on this block to power

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.330 
then redstone on this block to power
this<00:04:29.290> one<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:35.530> now<00:04:35.740> we<00:04:35.800> can<00:04:35.980> put<00:04:36.130> all<00:04:36.220> the

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
this one and now we can put all the

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:50.430 
this one and now we can put all the
repeaters<00:04:36.760> in<00:04:39.990> and<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.860> redstone<00:04:48.120> okay<00:04:49.440> next

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
repeaters in and the redstone okay next

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.470 
repeaters in and the redstone okay next
we<00:04:50.710> want<00:04:50.950> to<00:04:51.220> put<00:04:51.790> a<00:04:51.820> block<00:04:52.210> here<00:04:52.780> and<00:04:54.480> redstone

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
we want to put a block here and redstone

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.350 
we want to put a block here and redstone
there<00:04:56.110> and<00:04:56.500> there<00:04:56.710> and<00:04:56.919> then<00:04:57.669> we<00:04:57.760> want<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:57.970> cut

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
there and there and then we want to cut

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.800 
there and there and then we want to cut
these<00:04:58.510> off<00:04:58.750> with<00:04:58.960> some<00:04:59.350> extra<00:04:59.680> blocks<00:04:59.919> and<00:05:00.810> in

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
these off with some extra blocks and in

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.110 
these off with some extra blocks and in
fact<00:05:02.050> in<00:05:02.169> this<00:05:02.290> spot<00:05:02.530> right<00:05:02.590> here<00:05:02.910> we<00:05:03.910> want<00:05:04.060> to

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
fact in this spot right here we want to

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.860 
fact in this spot right here we want to
put<00:05:04.240> a<00:05:04.270> torch<00:05:04.570> so<00:05:05.500> this<00:05:06.130> wire<00:05:06.400> underneath

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
put a torch so this wire underneath

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.000 
put a torch so this wire underneath
actually<00:05:07.870> points<00:05:08.169> directly<00:05:08.530> into<00:05:08.650> that<00:05:08.680> block

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
actually points directly into that block

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.250 
actually points directly into that block
so<00:05:09.730> that's<00:05:09.910> where<00:05:10.090> that<00:05:10.210> torch<00:05:10.660> is<00:05:10.900> getting

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
so that's where that torch is getting

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.520 
so that's where that torch is getting
its<00:05:11.620> power<00:05:11.950> from<00:05:12.450> so<00:05:13.450> at<00:05:13.570> this<00:05:13.690> point<00:05:13.930> we<00:05:14.200> can

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
its power from so at this point we can

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
its power from so at this point we can
put<00:05:14.919> on<00:05:15.100> the<00:05:15.430> bookshelves<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:20.310> then<00:05:21.310> we<00:05:21.430> can

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
put on the bookshelves and then we can

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.930 
put on the bookshelves and then we can
give<00:05:21.669> it<00:05:21.760> a<00:05:21.820> test<00:05:25.290> looks<00:05:26.290> good<00:05:26.500> so<00:05:27.010> now<00:05:27.640> we<00:05:27.700> just

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
give it a test looks good so now we just

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:41.430 
give it a test looks good so now we just
need<00:05:28.150> to<00:05:28.419> fill<00:05:28.990> in<00:05:29.169> the<00:05:29.440> ground<00:05:40.320> let's<00:05:41.320> just

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
need to fill in the ground let's just

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
need to fill in the ground let's just
try<00:05:41.590> it<00:05:41.650> out<00:05:41.710> one<00:05:41.890> more<00:05:42.040> time

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.190 

perfect<00:05:45.460> now<00:05:46.300> if<00:05:46.419> you<00:05:46.510> want<00:05:46.690> the<00:05:46.780> optional

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
perfect now if you want the optional

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.340 
perfect now if you want the optional
button<00:05:47.560> you<00:05:48.070> can<00:05:48.250> place<00:05:48.550> a<00:05:48.820> block<00:05:49.630> with<00:05:50.229> a

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
button you can place a block with a

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.070 
button you can place a block with a
button<00:05:50.770> on<00:05:50.860> it<00:05:50.979> here<00:05:51.280> and<00:05:51.600> then<00:05:52.600> just<00:05:52.840> sort<00:05:52.960> of

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
button on it here and then just sort of

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.140 
button on it here and then just sort of
dig<00:05:53.350> down<00:05:54.180> put<00:05:55.180> a<00:05:55.210> redstone<00:05:55.690> here<00:05:57.150> repeater

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
dig down put a redstone here repeater

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.730 
dig down put a redstone here repeater
right<00:05:58.630> there<00:05:58.960> and<00:05:59.650> then<00:06:00.190> why<00:06:00.430> here<00:06:01.000> yeah<00:06:01.740> dig

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
right there and then why here yeah dig

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.180 
right there and then why here yeah dig
down<00:06:02.979> in<00:06:03.729> and<00:06:04.320> connect<00:06:05.320> it<00:06:05.440> to<00:06:05.560> that<00:06:05.590> wire<00:06:05.950> that

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
down in and connect it to that wire that

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.610 
down in and connect it to that wire that
we<00:06:06.310> added<00:06:06.520> earlier<00:06:07.020> we<00:06:08.020> can<00:06:08.169> fill<00:06:08.470> this

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
we added earlier we can fill this

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:14.280 
we added earlier we can fill this
grassing<00:06:10.140> Tridel<00:06:12.990> so<00:06:13.990> that<00:06:14.110> can<00:06:14.260> be

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
grassing Tridel so that can be

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.830 
grassing Tridel so that can be
particularly<00:06:14.680> useful<00:06:14.860> if<00:06:15.580> it<00:06:16.330> gets<00:06:16.630> out<00:06:16.810> of

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
particularly useful if it gets out of

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.290 
particularly useful if it gets out of
the<00:06:16.960> sink<00:06:17.229> so<00:06:17.919> like<00:06:18.220> it's<00:06:18.460> activated<00:06:19.000> without

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
the sink so like it's activated without

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.550 
the sink so like it's activated without
anything<00:06:19.720> there<00:06:20.160> you<00:06:21.160> can<00:06:21.370> reset<00:06:22.120> it<00:06:22.270> to<00:06:22.560> its

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
anything there you can reset it to its

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.500 
anything there you can reset it to its
right<00:06:23.800> setting<00:06:24.160> so<00:06:24.849> that's<00:06:24.940> all<00:06:25.150> for<00:06:25.330> today

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
right setting so that's all for today

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.870 
right setting so that's all for today
