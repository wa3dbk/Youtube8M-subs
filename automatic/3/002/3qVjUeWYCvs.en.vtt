00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hi everyone, it's a little 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.549
 moment I did not send two videos 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.870
 so I'm going to start putting myself on 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.269
 this bonus chain is not for nothing 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.830
 that I created so we start with a 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.389
 little video where it will be just 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.370
 the observation here I drew two 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.970
 mangas like that in a few minutes and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.439
 the blood is there because I wanted 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.359
 and so I film them and for you 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.090
 send it I'm not going I'm not going 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.830
 detail step by step as I the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.750
 usually do I just go to you 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.699
 leave like that with music that 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.949
 I will have drawn not draw the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.940
 mythical but that I would have composed me 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.620
 even among so many others and I can 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.790
 still tell you the morning at the level 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.579
 material there for train purchases 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.399
 to use a 2b pencil to trace the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.399
 sketches of the character so they are 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.250
 many I do a big lack rookie 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:52.590
 by inspecting the basic shapes of a 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.059
 manga character who are besides at 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.050
 pretty much the same as a character 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.910
 human so all that I will send others 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.960
 really tutorial tutorial videos 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.359
 Explanatory 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.250
 that's not the case then for 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.740
 anchor so that will be a little later to 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.920
 the video I'm going to create all this with a 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.479
 micropayment silo then from here 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.610
 minutes 30 it will start I think to 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.810
 anchor it's not there yet so the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.290
 silo micro pigments it's super convenient 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.080
 it is from lancre and therefore the mine is 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.710
 super fine she is super fine ago 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.590
 several sizes 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:35.009
 so I have a 0.8 mm yes there is 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.130
 even 0.1 mm if you look for it is very 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.710
 practice we pressed it's not too much 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.729
 given either so but once we 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.170
 what to watch out for 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.899
 to close a corruption because 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.960
 that after a day it dries and 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.979
 after what am I using 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.970
 I think it's all our video 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.100
 I use my lack that and 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.590
 here is so do not hesitate to ask your 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.430
 questions I will answer art in the 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.480
 comments from this video and on this 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.580
 I will send more videos 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.320
 maybe today where the days that 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.410
 come and I wish a good 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.410
 continuation 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.030
