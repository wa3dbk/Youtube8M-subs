00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.000
 110 meters long luxury and think cost 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.260

 card players as many as 260 million 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.120
 dollars an extraordinarily high price 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.650
 exorbitant but you haven't seen it yet 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.760

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.170
 Billionaires, look at some of Rome 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.540
 indeed billionaires look at each other a little 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.790
 in the pockets they hunt out 260 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.650
 millions of dollars they prefer 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.060
 get the yacht rather than buy a 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.100
 because they seem once 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.630
 in the closet a winter jacket if me 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.280

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.280

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.880
 fourth place we have the saiid 300 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.490
 million dollars and belongs to a 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.680
 sultan to the sultan of the oman we see 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.940
 here in the nice slides yes 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.390

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:21.200
 greeted the salt on his helicopter 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.690
 the technician $ 300 million you know 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.940
 what it cost 300 million dollars 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:30.560
 this very famous gauguin painting 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.830
 napfea fi polpo that means when you 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.320
 spouses and the meaning of this of 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.640
 this picture is among the dollar centers 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.069
 guys this is not a ship from 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.630
 cruise and this is a yacht state 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:44.330
 looking at a yacht this is the thing 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.830
 important fundamental no look at me 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.569
 I think the most important thing 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.990
 fundamental both as you speak the 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:54.380
 Tahitian think this you are 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.270
 seeing is a bad cruise ship 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.789
 island escape 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.549
 we compare the yacht look at the 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:05.899
 from this is the cruise ship at that 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:09.140
 the yacht is much nicer than the mastrotto 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.850
 finished much much better and there will be 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.230
 definitely super-luxury furnishings 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.690
 as in the superyacht at 323 million 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.860
 even dollars this belongs to a 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.019
 Russian magnate 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.750
 in short, until now the Russians play and 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:27.390
 Arabs and that race in this race to whom 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.030
 it has it more expensive along too 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.280
 he calls himself I would go to the mere hundred 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.860
 owns this extraordinary yacht 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.890
 from the shape reminiscent of a submarine 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.480
 however with very modern shapes but 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.130
 look how beautiful gray and white it was 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.350
 look at something like that i don't 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.350
 would serve it 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.260
 I wouldn't even accept it if they gave me it 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.720
 pity that I was wrapping it looks 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.490
 a little look a little look you take it 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.230
 the sun there is a small pool with 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:03.640
 wonderful lads from the amazing guys 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.320
 this is really beautiful, it's really beautiful 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.110
 object you know this these are the 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.570
 we saw them for a moment 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.930
 here is a lot of a mirror with many 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.070
 glasses like at my grandmother's house 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.830
 only these are crystals 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:22.430
 very expensive, for example, you go down 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:27.020
 in short, these stairs are so furnished 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:29.680
 that you press a button this happens 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.180
 like in batman's house 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.840
 what happens in the batam house this 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:39.860
 opens and there is no bathroom what is not 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.150
 I know there is a place a super screen yes 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.800
 look what happens now 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.320
 TV this TV comes 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.000
 sucked from the fantastic ceiling but it is 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.840
 clear this is the dashboard 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.569
 this is real wood mahogany steering 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:58.040
 of sandalwood the whole sandal 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:00.799
 real wow aged sandalwood got this 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.760
 and all the equipment guys ok but e 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:08.480
 this is the second yacht the dub at 350 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.060
 million dollars guys look at the 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.689
 giant this the second most yacht 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.269
 long largest and most expensive in the world 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:19.280
 think that it is still a matter of or 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.840
 individuals are not cruise ships with 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.440
 passengers who pay a regular fee 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.289
 ticket is private yes it is true and without 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.289
 Only this yacht costs as much 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.880
 the entire juventus brand does not speak 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.849
 of the team I'm not talking about the players 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.960
 I speak of the brand, therefore, of everything 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:43.729
 that exists around the juventus brand 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:48.620
 inter is incredible they are brands 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:50.780
 juventus with the top of the top at the first 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.530
 place have something voice clips 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.660
 antro 150 million women sato 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:01.960
 belongs to a Russian such an aircraft is 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:06.800
 understood such a roman abramovich e the e 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:09.199
 very expensive a real 11 plus 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.690
 of a cruise ship in practice 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:13.370
 Well what is there to say what thing 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.229
 want more look than nice 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.360
 beige 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.000
 to me it would be enough even if you half 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.400
 of this lamela madama I want to stay 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.419

 paranza you can play hide and seek you can 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.310
 say I think you can but I believe that 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.950
 they also have crazy security and 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.220
 why 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.020
 in the end there is a crew formed by 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.350
 so many people in these eyes 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.470
 very impressive you think 450 million 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:46.950
 dollars is all around business 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:50.520
