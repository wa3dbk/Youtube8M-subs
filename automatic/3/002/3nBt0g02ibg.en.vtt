 the nostalgic ones of the school of formerly one their music on the sorgue 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.719
 a place which are thus returned in caustic and the soft peace of the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.800
 dreams of children during the long days various why for the 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.800
 room while the master trying to inculcate the multiplication tables 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.289
 this place that plunges us but devilishly into the atmosphere of the great meaulnes 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.289
 it is precisely the museum of the school of the past 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:33.399
 but the efforts of the association which took a decade to gather 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.880
 photos of obsolete objects today 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.710
 the museum has taken up residence in the associative pole of l'ill sur la sorgue 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.380
 there are strange machines like this machine to learn spelling 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.650
 older instruments and especially all the passion of the members of 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.010
 the association 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.540
 the formula pleases since more than 4000 visitors passed in this room 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.980
 of class looking for a bygone era 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.299
 so we can wonder what people are coming here for 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:02.430
 visit in a museum visit 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.420
 for older people it is often 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.679
 with a little nostalgia find the school in which they lived 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.930
 write intermission howlett interstage with them the door hurts and 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.610
 the inkwell 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.470
 on paper and with the blotter 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.590
 this technique that got lost 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.050
 since the arrival the production of skill pencils and even more the 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.050
 since the use of the computer 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.150
 but this museum is not to freeze it on the contrary 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.210
 it is a lively place we held a popular animation of the public as 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.790
 the inevitable diptych which once a month brings together enthusiasts 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.350
 spelling history to get back to life for a few moments in his 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.350
