word processing you know general life

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.400 
word processing you know general life
stuff<00:00:23.680> however<00:00:25.420> when<00:00:26.420> I<00:00:26.480> gained<00:00:26.869> on<00:00:27.170> the

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
stuff however when I gained on the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.630 
stuff however when I gained on the
macbook<00:00:28.420> using<00:00:29.420> XP<00:00:29.779> Windows<00:00:30.080> XP<00:00:30.349> it<00:00:31.340> did<00:00:31.519> get

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
macbook using XP Windows XP it did get

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.960 
macbook using XP Windows XP it did get
really<00:00:32.059> really<00:00:32.269> hot<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:33.500> I'm<00:00:33.620> hoping<00:00:34.070> that

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
really really hot so I'm hoping that

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.680 
really really hot so I'm hoping that
this<00:00:35.269> is<00:00:35.300> going<00:00:35.660> to<00:00:35.750> be<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:35.989> solution<00:00:36.200> to<00:00:36.410> that

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
this is going to be the solution to that

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:54.130

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.670 

not<00:02:50.410> sure<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.800> can<00:02:50.920> hear<00:02:51.130> that<00:02:51.370> but<00:02:51.670> it's

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
not sure you can hear that but it's

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:03.800 
not sure you can hear that but it's
quite<00:02:53.680> loud

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.229 

but<00:03:04.560> there's<00:03:05.370> definitely<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:05.760> lot<00:03:05.819> of<00:03:05.940> airflow

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
but there's definitely a lot of airflow

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.170 
but there's definitely a lot of airflow
coming<00:03:06.770> underneath<00:03:07.770> this<00:03:08.099> which<00:03:08.849> is<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.030> good

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
coming underneath this which is a good

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
coming underneath this which is a good
thing<00:03:09.920> enormously<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.190> macbook<00:03:11.870> get<00:03:12.870> quite

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
thing enormously the macbook get quite

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.479 
thing enormously the macbook get quite
hot<00:03:14.209> at<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.360> bottom<00:03:16.220> especially<00:03:17.220> at<00:03:17.430> the

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
hot at the bottom especially at the

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.199 
hot at the bottom especially at the
bottom<00:03:17.819> of<00:03:17.970> this<00:03:18.060> area<00:03:18.480> here<00:03:19.340> so<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.970> will

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
bottom of this area here so this will

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.589 
bottom of this area here so this will
definitely<00:03:21.450> help<00:03:22.080> with<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.099> heat<00:03:23.310> issue<00:03:23.599> but

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
definitely help with the heat issue but

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:51.710 
definitely help with the heat issue but
like<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:24.840> said<00:03:26.000> it<00:03:27.000> is<00:03:27.060> quite<00:03:27.630> loud

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.530 

it's<00:03:52.320> not<00:03:52.470> annoyingly<00:03:53.130> loud<00:03:53.400> but<00:03:53.850> you<00:03:54.090> know

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
it's not annoyingly loud but you know

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.110 
it's not annoyingly loud but you know
the<00:03:55.530> macro<00:03:55.890> cool<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.400> macbooks<00:03:56.700> always<00:03:56.940> been

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
the macro cool the macbooks always been

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.830 
the macro cool the macbooks always been
quiet<00:03:57.480> so<00:03:58.020> exactly<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:58.950> definitely<00:03:59.840> need

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
quiet so exactly so you definitely need

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.950 
quiet so exactly so you definitely need
to<00:04:00.930> turn<00:04:01.080> up<00:04:01.170> your<00:04:01.260> volume<00:04:01.350> a<00:04:01.650> bit<00:04:02.750> but<00:04:03.750> like<00:04:03.930> i

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
to turn up your volume a bit but like i

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.240 
to turn up your volume a bit but like i
said<00:04:04.020> i'll<00:04:04.530> probably<00:04:04.680> only<00:04:04.860> use<00:04:05.070> it<00:04:05.220> for

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
said i'll probably only use it for

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:12.880 
said i'll probably only use it for
gaming<00:04:07.730> okay<00:04:08.730> using<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.270> as<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:10.250> lot<00:04:11.250> of<00:04:11.460> stand

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
gaming okay using it as a lot of stand

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.680 
gaming okay using it as a lot of stand
now<00:04:13.890> it<00:04:14.010> helps<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:15.620> macbook<00:04:16.620> a<00:04:16.859> slight<00:04:17.220> angle

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
now it helps the macbook a slight angle

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
because the width is so small it doesn't

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.910 
because the width is so small it doesn't
actually<00:04:36.420> see<00:04:36.750> no<00:04:36.870> it's<00:04:37.260> not<00:04:37.380> really<00:04:37.590> can<00:04:37.710> play

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.550 
actually see no it's not really can play

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
left so i'm not i'm trying to use them a

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.560 
left so i'm not i'm trying to use them a
lot<00:04:40.590> because<00:04:40.800> i<00:04:41.340> have<00:04:41.790> a<00:04:43.940> belkin<00:04:45.680> comfort<00:04:46.680> disk

lot because i have a belkin comfort disk
you<00:04:48.570> can<00:04:48.630> see<00:04:48.930> wish<00:04:49.080> I<00:04:49.200> use<00:04:50.090> when<00:04:51.090> I'm<00:04:51.270> on<00:04:51.480> my

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
you can see wish I use when I'm on my

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.510 
you can see wish I use when I'm on my
bed<00:04:52.190> or<00:04:54.200> you<00:04:55.200> know<00:04:55.290> on<00:04:55.470> my<00:04:55.590> lap<00:04:55.770> which<00:04:56.220> really

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
bed or you know on my lap which really

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.930 
bed or you know on my lap which really
good<00:04:57.830> so

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.180 

this<00:05:01.940> is<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:02.480> keep<00:05:02.690> it<00:05:02.810> cool<00:05:03.050> and<00:05:03.980> I<00:05:04.130> think

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
this is the keep it cool and I think

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.550 
this is the keep it cool and I think
that's<00:05:04.550> a<00:05:04.610> job<00:05:04.850> it<00:05:05.750> is<00:05:05.900> the<00:05:06.050> deafening<00:05:06.410> noise

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
that's a job it is the deafening noise

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.390 
that's a job it is the deafening noise
temperature<00:05:08.650> there<00:05:09.650> is<00:05:09.680> no<00:05:09.830> temperature<00:05:10.190> my

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
temperature there is no temperature my

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.680 
temperature there is no temperature my
laptop<00:05:11.440> but<00:05:12.440> like<00:05:12.650> i<00:05:12.680> said<00:05:12.740> it's<00:05:13.010> quite<00:05:13.220> loud

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
laptop but like i said it's quite loud

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.470 
laptop but like i said it's quite loud
so<00:05:14.690> i<00:05:14.720> probably<00:05:14.960> want<00:05:15.169> to<00:05:15.200> use<00:05:15.260> it<00:05:15.620> for<00:05:16.300> why<00:05:17.300> not

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
so i probably want to use it for why not

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.870 
so i probably want to use it for why not
only<00:05:17.660> when<00:05:17.930> I'm<00:05:18.080> gaming<00:05:18.740> or<00:05:18.919> when<00:05:19.460> I<00:05:19.490> encode

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
only when I'm gaming or when I encode

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.350 
only when I'm gaming or when I encode
videos<00:05:21.220> with<00:05:22.220> some<00:05:22.370> be<00:05:22.550> a<00:05:22.580> mushroom<00:05:22.940> problem

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
videos with some be a mushroom problem

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.720 
videos with some be a mushroom problem
i'll<00:05:23.870> still<00:05:24.200> use<00:05:24.350> it<00:05:24.380> about<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.830> fans<00:05:25.040> because

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
i'll still use it about the fans because

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.360 
i'll still use it about the fans because
it<00:05:26.000> is<00:05:26.210> free<00:05:26.540> you<00:05:27.530> see<00:05:27.710> how<00:05:27.770> much<00:05:27.919> more

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
it is free you see how much more

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.870 
it is free you see how much more
comfortable<00:05:28.820> I<00:05:29.740> think<00:05:30.740> overall<00:05:32.139> good<00:05:33.139> point

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
comfortable I think overall good point

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.540 
comfortable I think overall good point
is<00:05:34.880> light<00:05:36.760> sources<00:05:37.760> good<00:05:37.970> angle<00:05:39.430> helps<00:05:40.430> with

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
is light sources good angle helps with

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.129 
is light sources good angle helps with
probably<00:05:40.820> helps<00:05:41.090> with<00:05:41.240> the<00:05:41.270> anticipation

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
probably helps with the anticipation

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:44.680 
probably helps with the anticipation
heat<00:05:42.380> even<00:05:43.280> without<00:05:43.370> the<00:05:43.639> fans<00:05:43.850> because<00:05:44.210> it<00:05:44.510> is

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
heat even without the fans because it is

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.469 
heat even without the fans because it is
a<00:05:44.840> really<00:05:45.020> big<00:05:45.290> gap<00:05:45.560> underneath<00:05:46.240> so<00:05:47.240> that's

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
a really big gap underneath so that's

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:54.879 
a really big gap underneath so that's
good<00:05:52.389> exactly<00:05:53.389> what<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:54.020> crew<00:05:54.260> like<00:05:54.500> I<00:05:54.530> said

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
good exactly what the crew like I said

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.129 
good exactly what the crew like I said
the<00:05:55.160> practice<00:05:55.580> but<00:05:55.970> its<00:05:56.150> downside<00:05:56.870> is

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
the practice but its downside is

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:07.339 
the practice but its downside is
probably<00:05:57.590> the<00:05:57.800> fan<00:05:58.070> again

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349
