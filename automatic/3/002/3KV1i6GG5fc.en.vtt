reason<00:02:31.650> but<00:02:32.250> then<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.459> Bungie<00:02:33.090> got<00:02:33.390> noted<00:02:33.810> for

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
reason but then a Bungie got noted for

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.910 
reason but then a Bungie got noted for
it<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.379> think<00:02:34.459> his<00:02:35.459> mom<00:02:36.290> did<00:02:37.290> something<00:02:37.680> on<00:02:37.799> the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
it I think his mom did something on the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.920 
it I think his mom did something on the
forms<00:02:38.310> or<00:02:38.579> she<00:02:38.790> did<00:02:38.970> something<00:02:39.239> about<00:02:39.599> it<00:02:39.810> and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
forms or she did something about it and

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.680 
forms or she did something about it and
now<00:02:40.049> Bungie<00:02:41.040> instead<00:02:41.519> of<00:02:41.670> giving<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.239> guy<00:02:42.450> of

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
now Bungie instead of giving the guy of

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.420 
now Bungie instead of giving the guy of
his<00:02:42.989> guns<00:02:43.230> back<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.709> his<00:02:43.799> characters<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.400> think

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
his guns back and his characters I think

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.330 
his guns back and his characters I think
they're<00:02:44.790> just<00:02:44.910> going<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.180> just<00:02:46.109> let<00:02:46.500> him<00:02:46.680> allow

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
they're just going to just let him allow

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.160 
they're just going to just let him allow
him<00:02:47.579> to<00:02:47.760> level<00:02:48.060> up<00:02:48.180> faster<00:02:48.750> he's<00:02:48.959> probably

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
him to level up faster he's probably

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.259 
him to level up faster he's probably
going<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.560> share<00:02:50.459> play<00:02:50.760> with<00:02:50.970> some<00:02:51.180> other

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269
