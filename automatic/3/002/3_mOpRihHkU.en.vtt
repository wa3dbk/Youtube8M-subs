00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.570
 we made a perilous trip to the most 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.430
 heart of separatism and find out what lives 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.960
 and went the way of the Russian mercenaries 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.970
 driving from Rostov to occupied 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.380
 Donetsk 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.700
 author of the video is authoritative 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.829
 Ukrainian television journalist 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.570
 News Service Mariya cold but it 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.189
 page on the social network vkontakte 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.929
 which is for some details and and so 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.989
 called reportage sheds light 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.550
 our starting point was Kharkov with 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.350
 Kiev residence permit and minimum 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.949
 the amount of equipment we first 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.120
 We are going to Russia from Kiev registration and 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.980
 speak announcer voice 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.899
 but the author's page in the social network 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.610
 says that she comes from 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.620
 Donetsk region where 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.110
 and studied maybe and registration with her 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.320
 Donetsk as soon as the view with our 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.600
 passport did not get off the bus he 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.140
 returned about two minutes later 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.210
 rendered us said you two go out 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.190
 nonsense that is filled with this pseudo 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.020
 the reportage is beyond description 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.850
 objectivity of journalism is no question 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.770
 just tells you the information 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.320
 which you should perceive a priori 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.210
 unproved journalistic work tsn 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.680
 offers the viewer a new batch of lies 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.540
 which is peculiar to Ukrainian 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.040
 side manner is not backed by 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.049
 no evidence any 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.240
 evidence of half an hour 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.979
 questionable information which is the best 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.750
 your moments are reinforced by emotions 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.729
 author frankly just not 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.740
 deserves a detailed analysis to 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.659
 get lost a little among us 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.960
 I had to buy myself a symbol 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.070
 Russian army now we are more like 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.780
 on local 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:46.260
 prove the queen of camouflage when I look 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.260
 so I can see 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.720
 how not see me see me not see 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.890
 I can see I can not see Can not see 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.410
 but now you can see me you can see a little 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.700
 can not see 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.470
 literally every frame every sentence 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.479
 can be disassembled by bone and 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.490
 propose an outline argument which 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.500
 difference from the thesis in the Ukrainian media will be 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.900
 have a real basis for 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.330
 For example, the suburb of Donetsk meets us 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.959
 concrete blocks on the roads and military 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.959
 by trucks 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.110
 yes this happens when the city 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.460
 undergoes periodically artillery 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.050
 shelling by ISU 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.050
 and forced to be ready for similar 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.570
 situations just a year ago Donetsk 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.640
 every night was dying in traffic jams now 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.750
 on the main street you can arrange 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.750
 slow walk 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.400
 here you should pay your attention to something 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.840
 what is important as the author artery put it 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.400
 has been covered for several days for 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.319
 rehearsal celebrations 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.260
 70th anniversary of the Victory Day and so the whole plot 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.129
 horror and injustice and neglect 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.680
 European values ​​literally 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.840
 pierces the story Mary frost said 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.459
 let's go to another room with us and 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.590
 They brought us in close little room I 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.129
 sat on an iron bed 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.349
 started who why where do you work what 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:13.730
 doing we managed to force them 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:16.500
 believe that mine is on their side 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.900
 fool them at that moment I felt 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.370
 as shiver 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.220
 of course I tried to control myself somehow 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.140
 but it was very scary but everything 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.250
 not much more prosaic just 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.319
 watch this opus 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.420
 and if you decide then keep in mind 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.299
 what is the material that will appear to your 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.540
 Attention this man created the results 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:40.620

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.340

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.739
