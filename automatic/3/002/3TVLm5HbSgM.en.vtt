00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.140
 yes hello my dear 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.850
 Welcome to a new video of mine 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.600
 nice that you also that time again 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.690
 reingeschaut 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.840
 Today I want you our absolute 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:36.890
 Show favorite goulash dish and 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.680
 though my children love my husband 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.790
 So that's just how the court is 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:47.450
 we have our special recipe so to speak 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.090
 and for that we need three titles myself 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:55.070
 ashamed and encouraged they are coming now 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:58.220
 hope the mountain really quite completely 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.320
 roughly reduced so if you are the 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.330
 not in goulash with that onion 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.850
 even if it is so big then it is just longer 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.470
 little witches but if you have the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.750
 background my kids like that 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:14.180
 onions and brothers do not and if I do 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.430
 live quite big then you can 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.409
 this better with the ladle like that 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.760
 fish pole on the way 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.600
 who has perhaps the children and 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.240
 knows the problem 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.130
 So with me it is like that and Sicily 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.649
 is just as big stay I do it that way 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.000
 I'm going up to five very quickly and 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.619
 right back down so that will be 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.610
 probably not be my seconds 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.610
 I'll show you briefly 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.159
 so entertaining also shows how much land 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.479
 disguised to look it really is 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:49.799
 not possible 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:56.100
 but exactly the ideal consistency now 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:59.970
 but i want to show you that 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.979
 I now like spoonful of oil 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.709
 said by eye and not at all 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:11.519
 more a war tactic for you and 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:16.410
 then the whole three minutes was grandpa 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:19.670
 and stage 1 offer the onions 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.920
 steamed , the meat is added 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.170
 and I always take 500 grams 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.569
 ham and we still snow this 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.630
 sometimes smaller because the pieces are too big for me 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.360
 are they ready to be cut? 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.890
 becomes 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.200
 and now all the others are coming 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.780
 ingredients are easy and then you can 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.190
 make the appointment and that happens 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.720
 go and I do not need to stir 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.390
 and not at all I think the recipe is so 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.520
 great class as I said now comes 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.520
 30 grams of tomato marc in 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.260
 10 grams middle class you can next 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.730
 which you want I always take on 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:04.060
 dearest to thank this bautzner mustard 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.060
 laurel leaves with two teaspoons of salt 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:25.200
 a vegetable stock exchange a tablespoon 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:33.750
 Chilies big button paprika 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:37.739
 noble sweet and 400 grams of water lid 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.799
 on it and the whole we leave now 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.959
 first 60 minutes because longer is the 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:46.620
 Clock not scheduled anymore you can not 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.150
 set 60 minutes 100 watts left 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.569
 Run very important otherwise you have 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.980
 After that, slap the mush and gently 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.340
 early stage when the 60 minutes 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.949
 are derived 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.730
 then you can go back 15 minutes 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:04.709
 position and I give up a small state 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.169
 with purely that I will then afterwards 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.120
 show it and eat it ready 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.159
 boil the green or dumplings 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.099
 or what already inexperienced rest 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:16.409
 eat finished supermarkets the hour is 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.120
 I'm just going around again briefly 15 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:22.409
 minutes to adjust 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.810
 So as I said 15 minutes left 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:28.080
 is still in there 100 degrees in it leave 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.590
 and again this head dice else 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.370
 high level among friends says that me 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:38.479
 just a shot cream to it 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:41.520
 not just eyes 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.470
 great shot cream in that was it 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.419
 even if she does not like it needs it 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.750
 not do 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:51.870
 yes and I still get on with water and 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.300
 boil down our families and then 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.430
 let's play snails 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.650
 of course, as always a child 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.440
 so you see the ready meal 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.539
 I wish you a lot 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.300
 Have a good appetite while cooking 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.710
 and we'll see each other in common 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.630
 hopefully I'm looking forward 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.630
 My song is good on it
