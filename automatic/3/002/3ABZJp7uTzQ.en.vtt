we'll get into that in a little bit just

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.120 
we'll get into that in a little bit just
a<00:04:17.790> quick<00:04:18.000> review<00:04:18.209> we<00:04:18.930> learned<00:04:19.230> in<00:04:19.500> lesson<00:04:19.890> two

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
a quick review we learned in lesson two
