thing it is literally a useless machine
the<00:02:00.390> point<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.780> machine<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.380> destroy

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the point of this machine is to destroy

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.140 
the point of this machine is to destroy
its<00:02:02.219> input<00:02:02.960> like<00:02:03.960> that

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
its input like that

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.540 

the<00:02:06.510> first<00:02:06.830> one<00:02:07.830> of<00:02:07.950> these<00:02:08.070> things<00:02:08.310> ever

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
the first one of these things ever

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.490 
the first one of these things ever
demonstrated<00:02:09.270> was<00:02:09.450> by<00:02:09.600> sethbling<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.410> his

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
demonstrated was by sethbling and his

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.030 
demonstrated was by sethbling and his
map<00:02:10.740> a<00:02:10.770> pile<00:02:11.100> of<00:02:11.130> bodies<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.700> want<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.000> say<00:02:12.710> so<00:02:13.710> I

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
map a pile of bodies I want to say so I

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.760 
map a pile of bodies I want to say so I
just<00:02:14.400> made<00:02:14.670> another<00:02:14.850> this<00:02:15.660> one<00:02:15.900> works<00:02:16.140> upwards

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
just made another this one works upwards

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.130 
just made another this one works upwards
his<00:02:17.010> worked<00:02:17.310> sideways<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:18.030> think<00:02:18.270> yeah<00:02:18.990> like

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
his worked sideways I think yeah like

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.890 
his worked sideways I think yeah like
that<00:02:19.910> say<00:02:20.910> yeah<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.270> then<00:02:21.570> I<00:02:21.660> tried<00:02:21.870> to

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
that say yeah and then I tried to

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.510 
that say yeah and then I tried to
compact<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.470> down<00:02:22.650> but<00:02:22.950> I'm<00:02:23.100> not<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.400> best

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
compact it down but I'm not the best

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.430 
compact it down but I'm not the best
compactor<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.330> got<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.780> down<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.080> three<00:02:25.290> by

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
compactor so I got it down to three by

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.470 
compactor so I got it down to three by
five<00:02:25.620> footprint<00:02:27.950> excuse<00:02:28.950> me<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.310> then<00:02:30.030> I

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480

I mean for some of you five days may not
seem<00:03:17.370> like<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.640> big<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:18.060> gap<00:03:18.240> but<00:03:18.480> for<00:03:18.690> me

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
seem like that big of a gap but for me

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.449 
seem like that big of a gap but for me
that's<00:03:18.959> probably<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.560> largest<00:03:19.860> gap<00:03:20.310> in

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
that's probably the largest gap in

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.370 
that's probably the largest gap in
