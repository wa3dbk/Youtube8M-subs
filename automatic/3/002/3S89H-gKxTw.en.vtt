general<00:02:25.940> so<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.690> first<00:02:26.840> pro<00:02:27.440> obviously<00:02:27.890> is

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
general so the first pro obviously is

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.620 
general so the first pro obviously is
convenience<00:02:28.610> it's<00:02:28.760> so<00:02:28.880> simple<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.300> throw<00:02:29.570> this

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
convenience it's so simple to throw this

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.600 
convenience it's so simple to throw this
device<00:02:29.960> your<00:02:30.590> phone<00:02:30.830> round<00:02:31.070> top<00:02:31.310> of<00:02:31.460> it<00:02:31.580> and

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
device your phone round top of it and

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.120 
device your phone round top of it and
charges<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.480> second<00:02:33.410> one<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:33.710> specific<00:02:34.100> to

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
charges the second one is specific to

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.520 
charges the second one is specific to
this<00:02:34.280> one<00:02:34.460> specifically<00:02:34.850> so<00:02:35.540> it's<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.810> angle

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
this one specifically so it's the angle

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.710 
this one specifically so it's the angle
so<00:02:37.130> because<00:02:37.490> it's<00:02:37.640> on<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.000> oh<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:38.210> can<00:02:38.360> use<00:02:38.570> it

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
so because it's on and oh you can use it

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.800 
so because it's on and oh you can use it
while<00:02:39.020> it's<00:02:39.230> being<00:02:39.350> charged<00:02:40.360> other<00:02:41.360> third

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
while it's being charged other third

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.110 
while it's being charged other third
option<00:02:41.960> here<00:02:42.350> is<00:02:42.470> that<00:02:43.010> it's<00:02:43.250> why<00:02:43.610> wave<00:02:43.760> colors

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
option here is that it's why wave colors

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.930 
option here is that it's why wave colors
and<00:02:44.360> overall<00:02:44.750> well-designed<00:02:45.670> now<00:02:46.670> some<00:02:46.880> of

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
and overall well-designed now some of

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.600 
and overall well-designed now some of
the<00:02:47.000> cons<00:02:47.180> are<00:02:47.420> obviously<00:02:47.780> it's<00:02:47.960> very<00:02:48.140> pricey

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
the cons are obviously it's very pricey

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.400 
the cons are obviously it's very pricey
there's<00:02:49.610> a<00:02:49.700> slower<00:02:50.030> charge<00:02:50.420> compared<00:02:51.020> to<00:02:51.140> USB

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
there's a slower charge compared to USB

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.120 
there's a slower charge compared to USB
so<00:02:52.370> I<00:02:52.400> found<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.970> eight<00:02:53.360> with<00:02:53.840> about<00:02:53.960> 75%<00:02:54.680> as

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
so I found that eight with about 75% as

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.390 
so I found that eight with about 75% as
fast<00:02:55.370> as<00:02:55.610> a<00:02:55.670> USB<00:02:56.150> so<00:02:56.450> for<00:02:56.630> example<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:57.400> let's

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
fast as a USB so for example and let's

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.960 
fast as a USB so for example and let's
say<00:02:58.610> took<00:02:58.820> an<00:02:58.970> hour<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.330> go<00:02:59.720> from<00:03:00.760> zero<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.790> one

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
say took an hour to go from zero to one

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.760 
say took an hour to go from zero to one
hundred<00:03:02.000> percent<00:03:02.240> then<00:03:03.080> it<00:03:03.290> would<00:03:03.410> take<00:03:03.620> an

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
hundred percent then it would take an

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.340 
hundred percent then it would take an
hour<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.430> about<00:03:05.330> 15<00:03:05.780> minutes<00:03:05.960> to<00:03:06.200> go<00:03:06.320> from

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
hour and about 15 minutes to go from

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.190 
hour and about 15 minutes to go from
zero<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:06.830> a<00:03:06.920> higher<00:03:07.070> percent<00:03:07.400> on<00:03:08.050> discharge<00:03:09.050> or

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
zero to a higher percent on discharge or

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.500 
zero to a higher percent on discharge or
so<00:03:09.350> it's<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.070> bit<00:03:10.190> slower<00:03:10.460> than<00:03:10.610> USB<00:03:10.940> not<00:03:11.300> much

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
so it's a bit slower than USB not much

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.690 
so it's a bit slower than USB not much
of<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.780> bit<00:03:11.960> and<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.830> second<00:03:13.160> one<00:03:13.280> is<00:03:13.370> a<00:03:13.400> slight

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
of a bit and the second one is a slight

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.250 
of a bit and the second one is a slight
heat<00:03:13.940> up<00:03:14.090> now<00:03:14.270> this<00:03:14.420> isn't<00:03:14.600> because<00:03:15.050> of<00:03:15.080> the

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
heat up now this isn't because of the

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.290 
heat up now this isn't because of the
discharge<00:03:15.800> of<00:03:15.890> pacifically<00:03:16.370> all<00:03:16.610> wireless

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
discharge of pacifically all wireless

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.690 
discharge of pacifically all wireless
charges<00:03:17.630> do<00:03:17.810> do<00:03:17.960> is<00:03:18.110> as<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.410> right<00:03:18.560> now<00:03:18.700> so

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
charges do do is as of right now so

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.970 
charges do do is as of right now so
there's<00:03:20.300> a<00:03:20.360> bit<00:03:20.540> warm<00:03:20.900> it's<00:03:21.200> not<00:03:21.290> much<00:03:21.650> and

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
there's a bit warm it's not much and

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.940 
there's a bit warm it's not much and
it's<00:03:22.430> nothing<00:03:22.700> to<00:03:22.820> be<00:03:22.910> scared<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.540> but<00:03:23.950> there

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
it's nothing to be scared of but there

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.250 
it's nothing to be scared of but there
is<00:03:25.100> a<00:03:25.160> slight<00:03:25.550> warm-up<00:03:26.000> on<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.450> pad<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:27.170> the

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
is a slight warm-up on the pad and the

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.300 
is a slight warm-up on the pad and the
phone<00:03:27.470> itself<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:30.470> third<00:03:30.710> one<00:03:30.890> is<00:03:31.100> obviously
