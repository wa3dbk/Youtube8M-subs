00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.500
 professors of the college 21 in dialogue 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.930
 draft drawings for the lectures 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.570
 be created here carefully 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.190
 discussed architecture in the dual stock 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.230
 is a new study course of the 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.050
 architecture and engineering knowledge 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.510
 connecting more and more with each other 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.390
 meanwhile is rehabilitated approx. 70 of the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.190
 construction tasks is architecture in architecture 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.290
 generally because you have your own ideas 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.920
 can realize because you own something 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.540
 can create 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.250
 We have already started to do generations 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.380
 I would be the fifth generation in now 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.360
 a company that insisted on the company 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.280
 specialized truss renovation and 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.250
 live construction so I'm with the thought 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.650
 to continue the company and then has 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.489
 the offered and the dual that 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.320
 I mean the four times already 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.329
 you can get a taste of the whole structure 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.670
 learn from the company the students 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.070
 dual in eight semesters everything around 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.050
 architecture in the inventory belongs to the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.440
 for example, the planning of a construction project 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.600
 but also the design and design 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.290
 permanent right city ​​planning and much 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.660
 more 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.490
 and the special attraction is that the 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.230
 students not only theoretical 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.660
 but also at the construction site 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.430
 to put your knowledge to the test 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.470
 daniel martin a graduate of 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.460
 college 21 has dual studies 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.440
 already behind him and already in college 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.330
 he realized projects already in the 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.410
 building in buxtehude 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.280
 daniels bachelor thesis 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.880
 suddenly I designed the house 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.840
 and here's what and here 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.690
 can realize 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.369
 from the maximum area and ultimately 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.580
 So we built it with 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.110
 builders ultimately wish 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.910
 added and changed a bit but 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.890
 most of what is in mine 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.330
 bachelor thesis can also be seen and now 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.460
 he can be handy through his 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.280
 Drawings walk a study course 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.590
 with a future after the bachelor's degree 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.450
 at the college 21 should have 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.700
 because the possibility in the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.380
 to register the architects list 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.540
 architecture was already one 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.200
 focus on the study course in 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.300
 duration 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.730
 So far, the regular study period has been 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.470
 seven semesters and ended with one 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.330
 engineer what was on the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.760
 labor market is also an advantage 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.100
 Therefore, the proportion of technical 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.110
 Subjects also so high in the new study course 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.450
 held that the engineer title 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.570
 is preserved and the conclusion of the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.519
 college 21 is in addition 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.260
 Recognizable by the 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.750
 architects chamber important concerns 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.900
 my work is always that beside all 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.590
 technical and functional specifications 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.890
 the genius loci of the respective task 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.519
 of the place of the task 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.769
 and that students in particular 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:02.010
 also with passion to go and works 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.450
 later also as lawyers 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.370
 understand the visible 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.140
 it's not that we're just the pure one 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.319
 artistically talented students 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.999
 form 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.739
 but want the training spectrum 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:14.650
 is he already that means we have 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.239
 both the focus in the design as 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.519
 but also the focus in the 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.129
 classic construction surveillance controlling 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.569
 so that also people and 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.909
 students are not the ones now 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.799
 artistic veins are very good 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.480
 good to be selected here and 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:32.909
 also later in the working life of course 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.909
 then you will find your field of action 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.030
 For example, is Tragwerk teaching 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.129
 part of the study after all dry 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.159
 is taught at the college 21 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.290
 not in the drawer teach what 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.060
 I teach is very important to me 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.370
 that the students also speak the language 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.959
 the structure planner understand that 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.970
 means that you are able 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.200
 to recognize static systems 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.000
 and that they are also with one 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.099
 can talk tragwerk planner 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.599
 and my goal is in the lectures 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.940
 always that too complicated 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.370
 things just for example through models 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.530
 the work can be clearly explained 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.989
 between different disciplines so 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.930
 right at the college are 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.870
 work between our architecture 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.510
 faculties and other areas 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.470
 We at the college have the 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.970
 physiotherapist for example with the 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.560
 Provisioning projects together make the 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.530
 mechatronics with whom we also in one 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.820
 work together 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.220
 that extends our view of this 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.350
 extends our teaching and the expanded 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.669
 ultimately our knowledge comes too 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.750
 to use our stands 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.860
 the study of architecture in existence 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.099
 varied and challenging 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.550
 here are architects and 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.550
 Construction engineers made
