00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.729
 and detonating cocktail adrenaline 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:11.740
 outsiders often a total commitment 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.770
 there I'm doing a huge stress 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.090
 it's been two days too the roof kind 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.049
 three days that I could a child because 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.049
 we had prison 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.190

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.190
 it will make them 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:36.080
 at 6:30 am skates I dismasted funnels 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.880
 golden magician then flattened beaten 5 1 for 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.730
 the mac is found three smashed smashed 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.620
 two fingers are unpacked what do you have 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:49.530
 to burst the abscess is burst lounger of all 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.010

 Norwegian Portuguese President 12 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.220
 nationalities for a transatlantic 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.230
 solitary 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.270
 who said that this discipline was 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.130
 french franco 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.410
 proof that it is possible to go out 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.920
 hexagon limits in this type 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.200
 of competition there are years of 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.430
 other people with wind blowing 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.930
 violent 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.090
 what tough conditions has team for 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.209
 this first step towards funchal to 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.340
 Azores the 85 competitors should 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.770
 to start from la rochelle Sunday 13 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.890
 with winds from east to northeast so 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.320
 great conditions that are generated so 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.720
 on the one hand by the anticyclone which is 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.200
 placed very drag so on the big 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.300
 Britain 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.180
 and then a depression center that 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.340
 is on spain and on africa on 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.330
 north africa here so between the 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.470
 two a stream of is well established so if 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.060
 we look a little bit at it 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.380
 at the level of the routing we see therefore the 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.370
 competitors leaving September 13 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.810
 always with a flow of is here we see 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.310
 that around Cape Finistere the wind 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.840
 change direction with a 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.380
 strong acceleration at heading level 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.900
 Finistere 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.260
 so here they can take up to 30 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.110
 35 knots of wind in the gusts and 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.660
 then then always wearing it until 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.850
 Madeira with an arrival that could 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.070
 do in after five days five 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.360
 days and a half of racing so with 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.800
 always windy because we see 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.160
 high ranking on Madeira there is still 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.440
 fifteen knots of wind 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.690
 of east wind is therefore always a 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.060
 nice descent under spinnaker so the points 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.580
 important prepare the mind and then he 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.600
 Competitors need to prepare 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.510
 to make beautiful beautiful slips 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.450

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.270

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.730

 and it's not because the 2001 boat 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.959

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.110
 they allowed the phillies created the
