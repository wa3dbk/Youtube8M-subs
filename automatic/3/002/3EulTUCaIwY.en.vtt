shaming all the time and finally there's

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.520 
shaming all the time and finally there's
some<00:00:37.920> science<00:00:38.129> behind<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.930> fact<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.260> it's

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
some science behind the fact that it's

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.290 
some science behind the fact that it's
detrimental<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.340> weight<00:00:41.700> loss<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:41.910> not

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
detrimental to weight loss and not

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.910 
detrimental to weight loss and not
helping<00:00:42.930> weight<00:00:43.140> loss<00:00:43.350> because<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.739> think

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
helping weight loss because I think

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.860 
helping weight loss because I think
that's<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> misconception<00:00:44.910> yeah<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.809> I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
that's the misconception yeah and I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.270 
that's the misconception yeah and I
think<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.170> misconception<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.920> strange<00:00:47.190> that

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
think that misconception is strange that

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.100 
think that misconception is strange that
it<00:00:47.460> even<00:00:47.550> exists<00:00:48.180> because<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.539> lot<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.840> times

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
it even exists because a lot of times

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.229 
it even exists because a lot of times
you<00:00:49.230> hear<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.590> people<00:00:49.770> have<00:00:50.520> problems<00:00:50.910> with
