this were all called split spirit the
spirit<00:01:59.520> run<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.940> two<00:02:00.060> at<00:02:00.120> the<00:02:00.180> same<00:02:00.330> time<00:02:00.570> it's

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
spirit run the two at the same time it's

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.660 
spirit run the two at the same time it's
it<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.500> we<00:02:01.620> can<00:02:01.710> go<00:02:01.770> down<00:02:01.800> here<00:02:01.980> so<00:02:02.340> we<00:02:02.430> can<00:02:02.550> have

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
it so we can go down here so we can have

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.930 
it so we can go down here so we can have
actually<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> combined<00:02:03.770> chart<00:02:04.770> view<00:02:05.010> with<00:02:05.400> the

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
actually a combined chart view with the

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.690 
actually a combined chart view with the
sonar<00:02:06.330> view<00:02:06.950> and<00:02:07.950> also<00:02:08.399> you've<00:02:08.520> got<00:02:08.550> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
sonar view and also you've got the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.639 
sonar view and also you've got the
ability<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:09.180> go<00:02:09.869> through<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.229> also<00:02:10.320> pull<00:02:10.619> up

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
ability to go through and also pull up

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.860 
ability to go through and also pull up
the<00:02:11.280> full<00:02:11.670> screen<00:02:11.940> sonar<00:02:12.390> if<00:02:12.600> you're<00:02:12.750> not

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
the full screen sonar if you're not

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
the full screen sonar if you're not
worried<00:02:13.140> about<00:02:13.290> seeing<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.650> chart

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
worried about seeing the chart

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.910 
worried about seeing the chart
information<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:15.570> fishermen<00:02:15.990> might<00:02:16.680> just

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
information so the fishermen might just

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.680 
information so the fishermen might just
want<00:02:17.100> that<00:02:17.250> that's<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.640> one<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.790> want<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.570> know

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
want that that's the one I want to know

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.600 
want that that's the one I want to know
where<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.900> fish<00:02:19.050> are<00:02:19.170> yeah<00:02:19.320> yeah<00:02:19.530> these<00:02:20.310> units

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
where the fish are yeah yeah these units

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.540 
where the fish are yeah yeah these units
also<00:02:20.790> now<00:02:21.180> they<00:02:21.690> will<00:02:21.930> use<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.800> XS<00:02:23.160> models

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
also now they will use the the XS models

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.490 
also now they will use the the XS models
will<00:02:23.760> have<00:02:23.910> our<00:02:24.090> new<00:02:24.300> chirp<00:02:24.690> technology<00:02:25.290> built

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
will have our new chirp technology built

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.330 
will have our new chirp technology built
into<00:02:25.709> what<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.600> chirp<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.780> it's<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.560> new<00:02:29.070> type

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
into what is a chirp is it's a new type

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.710 
into what is a chirp is it's a new type
of<00:02:29.370> transducer<00:02:30.120> that's<00:02:30.300> being<00:02:30.480> brought<00:02:30.690> out

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
of transducer that's being brought out

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.560 
of transducer that's being brought out
and<00:02:31.170> it's<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.860> spread<00:02:32.400> spectrum<00:02:32.640> transducer<00:02:33.480> so

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
and it's a spread spectrum transducer so

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.270 
and it's a spread spectrum transducer so
actually<00:02:33.930> pulses<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.440> frequency<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.130> rather

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
actually pulses the frequency so rather

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.340 
actually pulses the frequency so rather
than<00:02:35.459> using<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.850> set<00:02:36.060> frequency<00:02:36.300> like<00:02:36.840> 50<00:02:37.260> or

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
than using a set frequency like 50 or

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.460 
than using a set frequency like 50 or
200<00:02:37.530> kilohertz<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.820> uses<00:02:39.270> different<00:02:39.990> range<00:02:40.230> of

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
200 kilohertz it uses different range of

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.650 
200 kilohertz it uses different range of
frequencies<00:02:40.980> all<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.310> one<00:02:41.459> go<00:02:41.670> which<00:02:42.330> gives

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
frequencies all in one go which gives

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.750 
frequencies all in one go which gives
you<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.930> much<00:02:43.170> clearer<00:02:43.590> image<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.550> better

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
you the much clearer image the better

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.850 
you the much clearer image the better
target<00:02:45.240> definition<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.350> if<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.620> shoal<00:02:46.830> of

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
target definition so if the shoal of

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.440 
target definition so if the shoal of
fish<00:02:47.010> as<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.430> see<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:47.700> here<00:02:47.910> rather<00:02:48.300> than

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
fish as you see in here rather than

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.150 
fish as you see in here rather than
hearing<00:02:48.780> there's<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.050> large<00:02:49.290> mass<00:02:49.770> on<00:02:50.010> the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
hearing there's a large mass on the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.220 
hearing there's a large mass on the
screen<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:51.030> will<00:02:51.090> actually<00:02:51.300> pick<00:02:51.780> out<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
screen it will actually pick out the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.870 
screen it will actually pick out the
individual<00:02:52.830> fish<00:02:53.010> target<00:02:53.489> breaks<00:02:53.700> them<00:02:53.850> down

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
individual fish target breaks them down

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.270 
individual fish target breaks them down
yeah<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.019> would<00:02:55.260> see<00:02:55.470> as<00:02:55.860> we're<00:02:56.070> seeing

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
yeah so you would see as we're seeing

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.430 
yeah so you would see as we're seeing
here<00:02:56.459> each<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.030> individual<00:02:57.540> fish<00:02:57.720> but

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
here each of the individual fish but

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.530 
here each of the individual fish but
also<00:02:58.590> when<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.610> fish<00:02:59.790> are<00:02:59.940> lying<00:03:00.090> close<00:03:00.360> to

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
also when the fish are lying close to

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.540 
also when the fish are lying close to
the<00:03:00.630> seabed<00:03:01.019> you're<00:03:01.980> going<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.160> stand<00:03:02.340> more

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
the seabed you're going to stand more

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.860 
the seabed you're going to stand more
chance<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:02.910> seeing<00:03:03.120> them<00:03:03.330> rather<00:03:03.540> than

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
chance of seeing them rather than

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.690 
chance of seeing them rather than
blending<00:03:04.320> into<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.650> sea<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:05.280> mean<00:03:05.459> yes

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
blending into the sea so you mean yes

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.040 
blending into the sea so you mean yes
yeah<00:03:05.910> so<00:03:06.090> we'll<00:03:06.330> have<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.540> new<00:03:06.720> range<00:03:06.930> of

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
yeah so we'll have a new range of

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.390 
yeah so we'll have a new range of
transducers<00:03:07.739> that<00:03:07.860> are<00:03:07.950> coming<00:03:08.160> out<00:03:08.280> with

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
transducers that are coming out with

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.979 
transducers that are coming out with
these<00:03:08.519> a<00:03:08.580> little<00:03:08.940> bit<00:03:09.060> plug<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:09.420> play<00:03:09.570> so<00:03:09.630> I'll

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
these a little bit plug and play so I'll

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.420 
these a little bit plug and play so I'll
have<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.230> connections<00:03:10.680> on<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.830> end<00:03:11.070> you're

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
have the connections on the end you're

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.949 
have the connections on the end you're
not<00:03:11.489> having<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.790> sit<00:03:11.970> there<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.269> hardwire<00:03:12.690> and

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
not having to sit there and hardwire and

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.720 
not having to sit there and hardwire and
link<00:03:13.080> together<00:03:13.230> it's<00:03:13.980> just<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.220> simple<00:03:14.489> plug

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
link together it's just a simple plug

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.490 
link together it's just a simple plug
and<00:03:14.760> play<00:03:15.030> option

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
and play option

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.650 
and play option
GPS<00:03:17.500> antenna<00:03:17.830> built<00:03:18.040> in<00:03:18.250> on<00:03:18.340> these<00:03:18.520> as<00:03:19.510> an

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
GPS antenna built in on these as an

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.730 
GPS antenna built in on these as an
internal<00:03:20.110> one<00:03:20.200> yeah

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
internal one yeah

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.040 
internal one yeah
they<00:03:21.040> have<00:03:21.220> our<00:03:21.250> new<00:03:21.490> 10<00:03:21.850> Hertz<00:03:22.120> GPS<00:03:22.630> antenna

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
they have our new 10 Hertz GPS antenna

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.530 
they have our new 10 Hertz GPS antenna
so<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.800> GPS<00:03:24.160> information<00:03:24.400> we<00:03:24.790> update<00:03:25.120> from<00:03:25.270> 10

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
so the GPS information we update from 10

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.199 
so the GPS information we update from 10
times<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:25.959> second<00:03:26.380> grows<00:03:27.010> on<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.340> old<00:03:27.459> stuff<00:03:27.819> it

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
times a second grows on the old stuff it

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.390 
times a second grows on the old stuff it
was<00:03:28.330> only<00:03:28.480> one<00:03:28.720> second<00:03:29.410> so<00:03:29.860> that's<00:03:29.980> quite<00:03:30.340> a

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
was only one second so that's quite a

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.210 
was only one second so that's quite a
big<00:03:30.610> improvement<00:03:31.170> what<00:03:32.170> you'll<00:03:32.319> notice<00:03:32.500> is<00:03:32.770> if

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
big improvement what you'll notice is if

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.180 
big improvement what you'll notice is if
you're<00:03:33.459> stood<00:03:33.790> stationary<00:03:34.390> with<00:03:34.600> the<00:03:34.630> GPS

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
you're stood stationary with the GPS

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.860 
you're stood stationary with the GPS
you'll<00:03:36.190> notice<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.670> best<00:03:36.880> like<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.330> start<00:03:37.660> to

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
you'll notice the best like and start to

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.270 
you'll notice the best like and start to
twitch<00:03:38.080> around<00:03:38.470> on<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.740> screen<00:03:38.830> and<00:03:39.220> you

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
twitch around on the screen and you

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.040 
twitch around on the screen and you
won't<00:03:39.459> have<00:03:39.610> a<00:03:39.670> very<00:03:39.910> accurate<00:03:40.120> heading<00:03:40.690> yes

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
won't have a very accurate heading yes

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.170 
won't have a very accurate heading yes
with<00:03:41.770> the<00:03:41.890> 10<00:03:42.070> Hertz<00:03:42.280> GPS<00:03:42.700> because<00:03:43.030> it's

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
with the 10 Hertz GPS because it's

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.910 
with the 10 Hertz GPS because it's
refreshing<00:03:43.480> that<00:03:43.750> it's<00:03:44.080> about<00:03:44.230> that<00:03:44.290> more

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
refreshing that it's about that more

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.949 
refreshing that it's about that more
often<00:03:45.100> it's<00:03:46.000> going<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.300> be<00:03:46.390> giving<00:03:46.660> you<00:03:46.750> that

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
often it's going to be giving you that

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.300 
often it's going to be giving you that
much<00:03:47.170> more<00:03:47.500> accurate<00:03:47.920> heading<00:03:48.160> information

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
much more accurate heading information

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.520 
much more accurate heading information
at<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.850> slower<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.420> slower<00:03:49.750> speed<00:03:50.080> again<00:03:50.380> I

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
at the slower and slower speed again I

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.960 
at the slower and slower speed again I
get<00:03:50.680> out<00:03:50.800> of<00:03:50.890> my<00:03:50.980> boats<00:03:51.220> most<00:03:51.489> be<00:03:51.670> on<00:03:51.760> sale<00:03:51.880> I

end<00:03:52.300> up<00:03:52.420> wandering<00:03:52.570> around<00:03:52.750> this<00:03:52.930> earth

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
end up wandering around this earth

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.390 
end up wandering around this earth
that's<00:03:53.350> why<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:53.620> looks<00:03:53.800> like<00:03:53.950> you're<00:03:54.070> crabbing

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
that's why it looks like you're crabbing

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.040 
that's why it looks like you're crabbing
a<00:03:54.459> little<00:03:54.670> bit<00:03:54.820> yes<00:03:55.150> yeah<00:03:55.540> that's<00:03:55.780> that's

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
a little bit yes yeah that's that's

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.190 
a little bit yes yeah that's that's
because<00:03:56.350> of<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.500> update<00:03:56.800> rate<00:03:56.950> of<00:03:57.070> the<00:03:57.130> GPS<00:03:57.550> ok

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
because of the update rate of the GPS ok

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.729 
because of the update rate of the GPS ok
so<00:03:59.200> a<00:03:59.620> few<00:04:00.070> other<00:04:00.100> pages<00:04:00.459> we've<00:04:00.820> got<00:04:00.940> on<00:04:01.060> here

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
so a few other pages we've got on here

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.680 
so a few other pages we've got on here
we've<00:04:02.739> got<00:04:02.830> the<00:04:02.980> gauges<00:04:03.610> pages<00:04:04.030> so<00:04:04.239> we<00:04:04.390> can<00:04:04.600> do

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
we've got the gauges pages so we can do

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.770 
we've got the gauges pages so we can do
like<00:04:04.900> trip<00:04:05.110> computer<00:04:05.440> compass<00:04:06.780> wind

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
like trip computer compass wind

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.380 
like trip computer compass wind
information<00:04:08.440> so<00:04:09.220> if<00:04:09.280> we<00:04:09.340> go<00:04:09.459> down<00:04:09.610> here<00:04:09.670> if

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
information so if we go down here if

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.150 
information so if we go down here if
you've<00:04:10.600> got<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.840> outboard<00:04:11.709> engine<00:04:12.040> that

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
you've got a outboard engine that

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.970 
you've got a outboard engine that
outputs<00:04:12.580> and<00:04:12.910> in<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.090> 2000<00:04:13.720> information<00:04:14.230> you

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
outputs and in a 2000 information you

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.229 
outputs and in a 2000 information you
can<00:04:15.130> actually<00:04:15.250> pull<00:04:15.580> up<00:04:15.700> all<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:15.880> engine

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
can actually pull up all the engine

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.539 
can actually pull up all the engine
dates<00:04:16.450> are<00:04:16.630> on<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.810> screens<00:04:17.140> as<00:04:17.350> well<00:04:17.590> so<00:04:18.340> cab

going to get how much fuel you're

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.240 
going to get how much fuel you're
burning<00:04:25.600> you<00:04:26.169> get<00:04:26.290> all<00:04:26.380> that<00:04:26.560> information<00:04:26.710> up

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
burning you get all that information up

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.690 
burning you get all that information up
on<00:04:27.370> here<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:29.500> then<00:04:29.620> we've<00:04:29.740> got<00:04:29.979> the<00:04:30.490> wind

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
on here and then we've got the wind

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.090 
on here and then we've got the wind
pages<00:04:31.120> as<00:04:31.240> well<00:04:31.419> so<00:04:31.750> if<00:04:32.710> you've<00:04:32.860> got<00:04:32.950> windows

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
linked into that give me the wind

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.710 
linked into that give me the wind
direction<00:04:34.960> and<00:04:35.440> speed<00:04:35.790> Sandhya<00:04:36.820> so<00:04:37.120> one<00:04:37.510> unit

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
direction and speed Sandhya so one unit

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.480 
direction and speed Sandhya so one unit
and<00:04:38.140> do<00:04:38.320> everything<00:04:38.740> I'm<00:04:38.919> very<00:04:39.160> compatible
