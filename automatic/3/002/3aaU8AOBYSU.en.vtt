the wrist will will show you what it

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.800 
the wrist will will show you what it
looks<00:02:43.350> like<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.850> bright<00:02:48.120> wear<00:02:48.390> on<00:02:48.660> this

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
looks like the the bright wear on this

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.790 
looks like the the bright wear on this
strap<00:02:49.680> is<00:02:49.710> all<00:02:50.040> polished<00:02:50.910> steel<00:02:51.650> which<00:02:52.650> I

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
strap is all polished steel which I

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.130 
strap is all polished steel which I
think<00:02:52.980> matches<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.670> polished<00:02:54.030> steel<00:02:54.570> sides

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140
