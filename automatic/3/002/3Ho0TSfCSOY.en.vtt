in front I don't know the gear wrenches
I<00:00:15.690> haven't<00:00:15.960> measured<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.410> yet<00:00:18.020> the<00:00:19.020> frame<00:00:19.320> as

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
I haven't measured that yet the frame as

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.340 
I haven't measured that yet the frame as
I<00:00:19.890> think<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:21.020> 540<00:00:22.020> or<00:00:22.939> 550<00:00:23.939> centimeter<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.689> can't

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
I think of 540 or 550 centimeter I can't

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.740 
I think of 540 or 550 centimeter I can't
really<00:00:25.560> remember<00:00:26.090> but<00:00:27.090> that's<00:00:27.210> not<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.570> point

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
really remember but that's not the point

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.410 
really remember but that's not the point
the<00:00:28.019> point<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.590> took<00:00:28.800> off<00:00:29.300> basically<00:00:30.300> this

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
the point is I took off basically this

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.690 
the point is I took off basically this
thing<00:00:30.480> was<00:00:30.779> found<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.170> an<00:00:31.289> old<00:00:31.439> car<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.009> at<00:00:32.579> an

relatively cheap I stripped off all the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.160 
relatively cheap I stripped off all the
components<00:00:38.129> but<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.090> should<00:00:39.270> do<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.510> show<00:00:40.140> you

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
components but I should do is show you

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.389 
components but I should do is show you
before<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.620> after<00:00:40.680> picture<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.309> can

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
before and after picture so you can

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.660 
before and after picture so you can
actually<00:00:41.610> see<00:00:43.100> basically<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.190> replace<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
actually see basically I replace the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.569

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
wheels completely after tackling the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.959 
wheels completely after tackling the
rear<00:00:47.760> wheel<00:00:47.910> while<00:00:48.600> trying<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.820> let's<00:00:50.820> just

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
rear wheel while trying to do let's just

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.450 
rear wheel while trying to do let's just
say<00:00:51.090> flatland<00:00:51.600> moves<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:53.250> didn't

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
say flatland moves on it that didn't

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.479 
say flatland moves on it that didn't
work<00:00:53.550> too<00:00:53.579> well<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.170> I<00:00:55.170> flipped<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> bars<00:00:55.949> I'm

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
work too well and I flipped the bars I'm

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.130 
work too well and I flipped the bars I'm
not<00:00:56.879> going<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> cut<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> bars<00:00:57.660> I'm<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
not going to cut the bars I'm going to

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.959 
not going to cut the bars I'm going to
keep<00:00:58.289> them<00:00:58.469> because<00:00:59.430> they're<00:00:59.820> actually

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
keep them because they're actually

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.090 
keep them because they're actually
relatively<00:01:00.840> nice<00:01:01.199> bars<00:01:01.559> they're<00:01:01.920> neato

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
relatively nice bars they're neato

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
olympiad they're 115 I think they're

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.390 
olympiad they're 115 I think they're
worth<00:01:07.229> something<00:01:07.560> because<00:01:07.920> they're<00:01:08.250> very

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
worth something because they're very

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.850 
worth something because they're very
light<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.119> I'd<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.260> keep<00:01:10.409> them<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.740> their

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
light and I'd like to keep them in their

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.910 
light and I'd like to keep them in their
stock<00:01:11.510> configuration<00:01:12.590> I'm<00:01:13.590> gonna<00:01:13.799> actually

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
stock configuration I'm gonna actually

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.890 
stock configuration I'm gonna actually
just<00:01:14.280> flip<00:01:14.700> them<00:01:14.790> back<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.180> normal<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.630> keep

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
just flip them back to normal and keep

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.719
