00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
29.1 components of the plant body now

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.570 
29.1 components of the plant body now
plants<00:00:06.540> typically<00:00:07.080> are<00:00:07.259> made<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:07.710> two<00:00:08.069> systems

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
plants typically are made of two systems

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.180 
plants typically are made of two systems
we<00:00:09.330> have<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.660> chute<00:00:09.960> system<00:00:10.679> which<00:00:11.010> is

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
we have the chute system which is

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.999 
we have the chute system which is
basically<00:00:11.639> above-ground<00:00:12.710> consisting<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
basically above-ground consisting of the

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.269 
basically above-ground consisting of the
stem<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.670> leaves<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.929> flowers<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.800> then<00:00:17.130> we

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
stem and leaves and flowers and then we

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.880 
stem and leaves and flowers and then we
have<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.699> root<00:00:17.940> system<00:00:18.449> which<00:00:19.170> consists<00:00:19.800> of

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
have the root system which consists of

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.570 
have the root system which consists of
the<00:00:20.039> primary<00:00:20.550> roots<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.090> lateral<00:00:21.720> roots<00:00:22.580> now

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the primary roots and lateral roots now

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.320 
the primary roots and lateral roots now
shoots<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.330> roots<00:00:24.570> shoots<00:00:25.699> produce<00:00:26.699> food<00:00:27.029> by

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
shoots and roots shoots produce food by

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.630 
shoots and roots shoots produce food by
photosynthesis<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.349> they<00:00:28.890> also<00:00:29.070> carry<00:00:29.550> out

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
photosynthesis and they also carry out

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.479 
photosynthesis and they also carry out
the<00:00:29.849> reproductive<00:00:30.449> fun<00:00:30.689> functions<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
the reproductive fun functions so the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.600 
the reproductive fun functions so the
leaves<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.930> green<00:00:34.140> stem<00:00:34.530> are<00:00:34.829> where

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
leaves and the green stem are where

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.880 
leaves and the green stem are where
photosynthesis<00:00:36.420> occurs<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.350> mesophyll

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
photosynthesis occurs and the mesophyll

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.639 
photosynthesis occurs and the mesophyll
tissue<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.510> reproductive<00:00:39.930> structures

inside size by the lateral buds we also

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.970 
inside size by the lateral buds we also
have<00:02:42.360> leaves<00:02:42.690> which<00:02:43.020> will<00:02:43.170> be<00:02:43.260> discussed<00:02:43.709> in<00:02:43.890> a

have leaves which will be discussed in a

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.970 
have leaves which will be discussed in a
later<00:02:44.010> chapter<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.910> then<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.900> angle<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.680> the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
later chapter and then the angle of the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.030 
later chapter and then the angle of the
petiole<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.239> stem<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.780> called<00:02:49.470> an<00:02:49.590> axial

petiole to the stem is called an axial
now<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.400> plant<00:02:53.850> will<00:02:54.180> increase<00:02:54.540> in<00:02:54.780> its<00:02:54.930> primary

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
now a plant will increase in its primary

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.760 
now a plant will increase in its primary
growth<00:02:55.940> which<00:02:56.940> means<00:02:57.239> it'll<00:02:57.630> grow<00:02:57.840> taller<00:02:58.230> if

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
growth which means it'll grow taller if

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.610 
growth which means it'll grow taller if
it's<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.489> chute<00:02:59.850> system<00:03:00.330> or<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:01.140> roots<00:03:01.380> will

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
it's a chute system or the roots will

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.460 
it's a chute system or the roots will
extend<00:03:02.040> more<00:03:02.310> into<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.670> soil<00:03:02.970> if<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.600> the
