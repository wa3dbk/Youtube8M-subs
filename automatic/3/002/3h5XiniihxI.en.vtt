00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
can see so I decided to get something a

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.040 
can see so I decided to get something a
little<00:00:32.730> bit<00:00:32.820> bigger<00:00:32.969> size<00:00:33.390> only<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.840> like

really<00:00:34.710> small<00:00:35.280> hair<00:00:35.610> curler<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.149> thought

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
really small hair curler so I thought

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.209 
really small hair curler so I thought
this<00:00:36.390> would<00:00:36.480> be<00:00:36.540> really<00:00:36.600> cool<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:38.160> is

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
this would be really cool and this is

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
looks like this it's a two-year warranty

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.920 
looks like this it's a two-year warranty
and<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.020> has<00:01:07.170> 40<00:01:08.040> heat<00:01:08.400> settings<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.600> have

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
and it has 40 heat settings so I have

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.380 
and it has 40 heat settings so I have
tourmaline<00:01:10.770> which<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.430> natural<00:01:11.909> source<00:01:12.180> of

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
tourmaline which is a natural source of

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.770 
tourmaline which is a natural source of
negative<00:01:12.780> ions<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.350> far<00:01:13.770> infrared<00:01:14.159> heat

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
negative ions and far infrared heat

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.480 
negative ions and far infrared heat
negative<00:01:15.780> ions<00:01:16.049> eliminate<00:01:16.500> frizz<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.070> close

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
negative ions eliminate frizz and close

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.039 
negative ions eliminate frizz and close
the<00:01:17.640> cuticle<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:18.150> create<00:01:18.360> smooth<00:01:18.630> shiny<00:01:18.900> hair

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
the cuticle to create smooth shiny hair

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.800 
the cuticle to create smooth shiny hair
and<00:01:19.530> far<00:01:20.310> infrared<00:01:20.640> heat<00:01:20.790> penetrate<00:01:21.570> hair

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and far infrared heat penetrate hair

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.020 
and far infrared heat penetrate hair
from<00:01:22.140> within<00:01:22.380> resulting<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.220> faster<00:01:23.400> styling

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
from within resulting in faster styling

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.640 
from within resulting in faster styling
and<00:01:24.150> less<00:01:24.330> damage<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.020> sounds<00:01:25.409> really

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
and less damage so that sounds really

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.499 
and less damage so that sounds really
good<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.860> me<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.369> then<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.000> back<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.360> kind<00:01:27.479> of

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
good to me and then the back and kind of

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.359 
good to me and then the back and kind of
has<00:01:27.689> temperature<00:01:28.380> setting<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:28.890> hair<00:01:29.070> types

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
has temperature setting for hair types

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.330 
has temperature setting for hair types
and<00:01:29.869> for<00:01:30.869> fragile<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.380> thin<00:01:31.680> easy<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.130> curl

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
and for fragile you thin easy to curl
