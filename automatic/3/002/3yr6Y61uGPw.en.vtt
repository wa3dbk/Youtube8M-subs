at<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.039> box<00:00:59.309> oh<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.730> guys<00:00:59.969> can't<00:01:00.239> see<00:01:00.420> inside

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
at this box oh you guys can't see inside

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.720 
at this box oh you guys can't see inside
of<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.230> box<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.829> little<00:01:02.129> bit<00:01:02.340> smaller

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
of it so the box is a little bit smaller

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.910 
of it so the box is a little bit smaller
than<00:01:02.969> normal<00:01:03.149> loot<00:01:03.480> crate<00:01:03.719> boxes<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.650> think

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.050 
than normal loot crate boxes but I think
that<00:01:05.070> means<00:01:05.280> there's<00:01:05.430> still<00:01:05.610> gonna<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:05.820> some

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
that means there's still gonna be some

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.940 
that means there's still gonna be some
great<00:01:06.240> things<00:01:06.630> inside<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.409> first<00:01:07.680> thing
