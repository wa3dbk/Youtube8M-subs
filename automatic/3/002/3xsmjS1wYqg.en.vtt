it involves both doors working but only
one<00:01:25.259> pressure<00:01:25.560> plate<00:01:25.999> and<00:01:26.999> if<00:01:27.270> I'm<00:01:27.450> gonna<00:01:27.570> have

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
one pressure plate and if I'm gonna have

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.389 
one pressure plate and if I'm gonna have
to<00:01:27.899> remember<00:01:28.049> what<00:01:28.439> perfectly<00:01:28.950> i'm<00:01:29.070> supposed

single door so ours you know des bois
book<00:01:36.030> pressure<00:01:36.359> plates<00:01:36.689> from<00:01:36.899> both<00:01:37.530> sides

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
book pressure plates from both sides

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.450 
book pressure plates from both sides
yeah<00:01:40.450> we'll<00:01:40.810> get<00:01:40.900> started<00:01:41.130> I'm<00:01:42.130> not<00:01:42.340> gonna

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
count or anything i'm not here to do

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.910 
count or anything i'm not here to do
math<00:01:44.620> people<00:01:45.300> but<00:01:46.300> it<00:01:46.420> is<00:01:46.570> very<00:01:47.050> very<00:01:47.140> simple

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
math people but it is very very simple

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.180 
math people but it is very very simple
to<00:01:48.040> do<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:49.720> think<00:01:50.140> need<00:01:50.230> to<00:01:50.260> go<00:01:50.530> at<00:01:50.710> least<00:01:50.890> like

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
to do I think need to go at least like

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.600 
to do I think need to go at least like
three<00:01:51.550> into<00:01:52.120> the<00:01:52.210> ground<00:01:52.480> potentially<00:01:53.610> which

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
three into the ground potentially which

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.370 
three into the ground potentially which
should<00:01:55.120> only<00:01:55.150> be<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.450> problem<00:01:55.810> unless<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.230> only

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
should only be a problem unless you only

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.660 
should only be a problem unless you only
have<00:01:56.560> something<00:01:56.860> one<00:01:56.980> you<00:01:57.070> want<00:01:57.280> your<00:01:57.400> door<00:01:57.580> to

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
have something one you want your door to

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.470 
have something one you want your door to
go<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:58.030> then<00:01:58.150> you<00:01:58.180> know<00:01:58.420> just<00:01:58.570> figure<00:01:59.080> it<00:01:59.200> out

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
go and then you know just figure it out

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.330 
go and then you know just figure it out
yeah<00:02:01.480> so<00:02:02.200> you<00:02:02.320> know<00:02:02.470> you<00:02:02.800> know<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:02.950> put<00:02:03.220> your

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
yeah so you know you know you put your

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.310 
yeah so you know you know you put your
doors<00:02:03.580> in<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:03.940> platform<00:02:04.180> will<00:02:04.990> keep<00:02:05.170> it

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
doors in the platform will keep it

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.080 
doors in the platform will keep it
consistent<00:02:05.980> with<00:02:06.370> that<00:02:06.400> side<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:08.500> doors<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
consistent with that side just doors the

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.940 
consistent with that side just doors the
pressure<00:02:10.360> plates<00:02:10.720> go<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:10.930> little<00:02:11.200> further<00:02:11.590> back

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
pressure plates go a little further back

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.360 
pressure plates go a little further back
in<00:02:12.220> this<00:02:12.400> design<00:02:13.260> which<00:02:14.340> repeaters<00:02:15.340> are

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
in this design which repeaters are

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.700 
in this design which repeaters are
involved<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.150> all<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.570> knowledge<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:17.590> know

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
involved so all the knowledge you know

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.500 
involved so all the knowledge you know
you<00:02:17.770> don't<00:02:18.070> like<00:02:18.220> run<00:02:18.550> into<00:02:18.820> it<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.270> shuts

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
you don't like run into it and it shuts

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.590 
you don't like run into it and it shuts
on<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:19.900> or<00:02:20.080> anything<00:02:20.110> crazy<00:02:20.650> like<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:21.600> but

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
guys something about video making she's

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.950 
guys something about video making she's
like<00:02:27.370> my<00:02:27.520> first<00:02:27.790> go<00:02:28.030> at<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.240> I<00:02:28.720> don't<00:02:28.870> really

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
like my first go at it I don't really

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.940 
like my first go at it I don't really
new<00:02:29.140> music<00:02:29.560> i<00:02:29.740> use<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.340> production<00:02:30.790> stuff<00:02:31.090> and

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
new music i use the production stuff and

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.650 
new music i use the production stuff and
at<00:02:32.950> least<00:02:33.100> simple<00:02:33.490> to<00:02:33.610> me<00:02:33.730> now<00:02:33.910> it's<00:02:34.180> awesome

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
at least simple to me now it's awesome

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.920 
at least simple to me now it's awesome
video<00:02:35.050> editing<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.650> not<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.310> much<00:02:36.930> especially

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
video editing and not so much especially

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.290 
video editing and not so much especially
with<00:02:38.260> this<00:02:39.870> HD<00:02:40.870> PVR<00:02:41.430> or<00:02:42.430> some<00:02:42.670> reason<00:02:42.820> they

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
with this HD PVR or some reason they

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.990 
with this HD PVR or some reason they
found<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.380> not<00:02:44.650> necessary<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.340> be<00:02:45.640> able<00:02:45.820> to

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
found it not necessary to be able to

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.140 
found it not necessary to be able to
record<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:47.310> commentate<00:02:48.310> live<00:02:48.550> at<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.910> same

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
record and commentate live at the same

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.100 
record and commentate live at the same
time<00:02:50.940> so<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.000> know<00:02:52.209> normally<00:02:52.660> gotta<00:02:52.810> sync

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
time so you know normally gotta sync

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.720 
time so you know normally gotta sync
your<00:02:53.200> audio<00:02:53.590> with<00:02:53.770> it<00:02:53.890> like<00:02:54.040> an<00:02:54.220> outside

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
your audio with it like an outside

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.250 
your audio with it like an outside
program<00:02:55.360> or<00:02:55.570> something<00:02:55.720> like<00:02:56.019> that<00:02:56.250> which<00:02:57.250> is

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
program or something like that which is

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.130 
program or something like that which is
pretty<00:02:59.260> dumb<00:03:00.130> but<00:03:00.489> I<00:03:01.239> did<00:03:01.450> figure<00:03:01.630> out<00:03:01.810> the

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
pretty dumb but I did figure out the

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.540 
pretty dumb but I did figure out the
cables<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.650> are<00:03:02.709> included<00:03:02.980> if<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:03.430> have

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
cables that are included if you have

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.470 
cables that are included if you have
like<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.760> little<00:03:03.970> less<00:03:04.269> mixer<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:06.480> microphone

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
like a little less mixer and microphone

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.860 
like a little less mixer and microphone
is<00:03:07.600> some<00:03:07.750> kind<00:03:08.019> preferably<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:09.760> know<00:03:09.820> XLR<00:03:10.660> or

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
is some kind preferably you know XLR or

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.509 
is some kind preferably you know XLR or
lie<00:03:10.989> condenser<00:03:11.590> mic<00:03:11.800> so<00:03:12.070> that<00:03:12.220> your<00:03:12.340> voice

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
lie condenser mic so that your voice
