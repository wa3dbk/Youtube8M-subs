I'm showing progress with my metrics

I'm showing progress with my metrics
through<00:00:05.370> light<00:00:06.200> that's<00:00:07.200> traffic<00:00:08.150> that's

weather<00:00:09.540> in<00:00:09.870> Los<00:00:10.230> Angeles<00:00:10.280> California<00:00:11.330> this

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
weather in Los Angeles California this

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.629 
weather in Los Angeles California this
is<00:00:12.509> whether<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:13.259> santa<00:00:14.070> monica<00:00:14.250> california

is whether in santa monica california
and<00:00:15.529> this<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.740> traffic<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.430> between<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.970> two

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
and this is traffic in between the two

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.700 
and this is traffic in between the two
so<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.369> number<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.850> leds<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.330> might<00:00:21.840> not<00:00:22.050> for

degrees<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.549> wind<00:01:39.580> is<00:01:39.880> one<00:01:40.090> mile<00:01:40.299> per<00:01:40.420> hour<00:01:41.670> so

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
degrees the wind is one mile per hour so

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.560 
degrees the wind is one mile per hour so
that's<00:01:42.820> md<00:01:43.119> a<00:01:43.150> gun<00:01:43.360> now

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.649 

and<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.409> Atlanta<00:01:49.770> traffic<00:01:50.210> that<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.510> will

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
and the Atlanta traffic that it will

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.410 
and the Atlanta traffic that it will
take<00:01:51.960> between<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:53.159> two<00:01:53.400> of<00:01:53.430> them<00:01:53.760> is<00:01:54.030> an<00:01:54.479> hour

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
take between the two of them is an hour

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.300 
take between the two of them is an hour
so<00:01:57.420> we'll<00:01:57.570> see<00:01:57.720> one<00:01:58.050> arm<00:01:58.440> and<00:01:58.770> half<00:01:59.010> of<00:01:59.160> another

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
so we'll see one arm and half of another

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.660 
so we'll see one arm and half of another
arm<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.860> Los<00:02:02.190> Angeles<00:02:02.610> windy<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.770> hot<00:02:05.070> San

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
arm so Los Angeles windy and hot San

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.219 
arm so Los Angeles windy and hot San
Diego<00:02:05.700> less<00:02:06.570> hot<00:02:06.900> less<00:02:07.800> windy<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:09.229> then

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
Diego less hot less windy and then

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.540 
Diego less hot less windy and then
you'll<00:02:10.440> see<00:02:11.959> a<00:02:12.959> total<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.590> nine<00:02:13.650> LEDs<00:02:14.280> will

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
you'll see a total of nine LEDs will

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.000 
you'll see a total of nine LEDs will
light<00:02:14.730> up<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.990> will<00:02:16.110> go<00:02:16.260> around<00:02:16.530> in<00:02:16.920> a

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
light up and it will go around in a

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.910 
light up and it will go around in a
circle<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.580> that's<00:02:18.270> for<00:02:18.480> traffic<00:02:18.900> right<00:02:19.890> now

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
circle and that's for traffic right now

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.010 
circle and that's for traffic right now
the<00:02:20.130> way<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.490> code<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:20.880> they<00:02:21.270> can't<00:02:21.540> support

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
the way the code is they can't support

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.280 
the way the code is they can't support
more<00:02:22.590> than<00:02:22.620> three<00:02:23.190> hours<00:02:23.310> from<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.730> traffic

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.380 

but<00:02:27.860> it'll<00:02:28.099> be<00:02:28.129> cool<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.640> maybe<00:02:28.790> add<00:02:29.060> something

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
but it'll be cool to maybe add something

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.130 
but it'll be cool to maybe add something
for<00:02:29.810> playing<00:02:30.079> with<00:02:30.200> lights<00:02:30.469> or<00:02:30.739> something

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
for playing with lights or something

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.069 
for playing with lights or something
that's<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:33.319> thanks
