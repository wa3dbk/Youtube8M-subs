00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 too hot or kindly no pond 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.109
 Stop, you have to get out, need the protector. 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.700

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.400

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.530
 tip the staff there little you a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.540
 Today video I came to talk about care 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.210
 with skin mainly for you that 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.029
 has oily skin that lives in the capital 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.920
 very hot so independent that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.470
 You who need a sunscreen? 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.750
 with spicy soul mates to protect 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.590
 and maintain the brightness of your skin 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.770
 The sole capital award of dressing is a 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.989
 wonderful sunscreen 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.210
 his protection at least when I 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.950
 I bought this from here the protection of 50 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.800
 then maximum protection said that this 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.500
 business is bullshit it's the best 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.620
 with sunscreen it can reach and even 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.370
 30 fps which is the sun protection filter 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.520
 but this one is 51 legal from him if people 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.680
 is the following the drt law a texture well 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.440
 cool 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.369
 it even looks like cowboys but it is not like 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.680
 we have a maturing action then 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.930
 you can even use it as if it were 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:16.040
 a prize to make your skin look like 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.370
 it has a very light and well fragrance 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.920
 it is not sticky, it is not 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.700
 sticky and like I said have a 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.870
 fragrance soft and leaves the taste of people 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.450
 well protected I do not know is for sure 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.330
 Let's just say how it feels 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.940
 this protection but for example I'll 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.820
 I'm leaving soon I do not feel 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.500
 example just picking at my skin as if 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.259
 was causing with that car 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.090
 absurd i'm using it on that 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.149
 The moment I prepared my skin 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.610
 I used it and I do not feel like let's say 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.390
 so that heat or that smother mail 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.040
 of the absurd when I use and on the skin 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.820
 the sunscreen filter is fundamental 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.520
 for all skin types because it 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.220
 prevents the harmful rays of the sun from 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.530
 witty sun penetrates in our 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.000
 skin protection as a trampoline 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.459
 other violent 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.310
 so it protects the skin by avoiding 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.980
 premature aging by avoiding 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.470
 stains while also preventing your skin from 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.610
 comes to strip fundamental people a 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.880
 sun block 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.070
 it prevents skin cancer 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.580
 then it is independent of its headquarters 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.460
 your skin that I am white or your 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.710
 piece is very dark wears sunscreen 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.680
 because it is magical with the product 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:41.950
 aesthetics is a health product that I 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.140
 So I know I use the one of the fish that is 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:48.250
 excellent for oily skin because it leaves 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.950
 the skin is very dry and I believe 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.880
 that he did not have the mark of 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.190
 a sound 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.250
 she should also have a sunscreen 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.470
 with the matte effect there are other brands 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.840
 Unfortunately, I do not know in this 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.900
 Moment until apologies 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.480
 because even so, I do not have it, it's not everything 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.210
 this arsenal of information so I 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.060
 I speak from my experience but suddenly 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.150
 the natura avon I do not know if the marks 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.430
 have sunscreen specific for skin 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.370
 oily to your skin or not to scream 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.660
 but this one from the brand tar is worth a lot 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.730
 the penalty 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.400
 so that's it I hope this information 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.320
 be very useful to you 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.000
 Kiss in the heart, God be with you. 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.000
 Czech until the next video
