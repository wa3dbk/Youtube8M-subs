00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
suppose they could have tried to start

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.499 
suppose they could have tried to start
start<00:05:04.349> attacking<00:05:04.560> his<00:05:04.770> life<00:05:04.919> tale<00:05:05.129> but<00:05:05.509> we

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
start attacking his life tale but we

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.149 
start attacking his life tale but we
can't<00:05:06.750> really<00:05:06.900> we<00:05:07.139> couldn't<00:05:07.409> allow<00:05:07.560> count<00:05:07.979> to

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:08.159 
can't really we couldn't allow count to

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:09.740 
can't really we couldn't allow count to
get<00:05:08.430> too<00:05:08.580> out<00:05:08.699> of<00:05:08.729> hand<00:05:08.849> because<00:05:09.419> we<00:05:09.659> always

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
get too out of hand because we always

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.600 
get too out of hand because we always
just<00:05:09.900> reset<00:05:10.289> the<00:05:10.349> game<00:05:10.500> as<00:05:10.740> a<00:05:10.949> ton<00:05:11.400> of<00:05:11.430> it

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
just reset the game as a ton of it

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.600 
just reset the game as a ton of it
powers<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.090> exiled<00:05:12.659> with<00:05:13.469> it<00:05:13.620> and<00:05:14.580> so<00:05:16.370> ya<00:05:17.370> can

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
powers the exiled with it and so ya can

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.969 
powers the exiled with it and so ya can
basically<00:05:18.000> took<00:05:18.270> over<00:05:18.389> the<00:05:18.539> game<00:05:18.690> and<00:05:18.960> wind<00:05:19.889> up

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979
