up<00:01:36.420> ready<00:01:36.720> for<00:01:37.020> assembly<00:01:37.200> let's<00:01:38.159> talk<00:01:38.280> about

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
up ready for assembly let's talk about

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.249 
up ready for assembly let's talk about
clamps<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:39.090> they<00:01:39.390> come<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.689> many<00:01:39.930> different

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
clamps now they come in many different

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.130 
clamps now they come in many different
sizes<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.430> varieties<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:42.329> primarily<00:01:42.780> use<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
sizes and varieties I primarily use the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.200 
sizes and varieties I primarily use the
metal<00:01:43.770> ones<00:01:43.950> with<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.579> rubber<00:01:44.759> ends

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
metal ones with the rubber ends

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.780 
metal ones with the rubber ends
sometimes<00:01:45.869> parts<00:01:46.409> need<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:47.009> held<00:01:47.340> by<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
sometimes parts need to be held by the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.249 
sometimes parts need to be held by the
clamps<00:01:48.240> without<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> rubber<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.140> end

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
clamps without the rubber on the end

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.289 
clamps without the rubber on the end
this<00:01:49.619> allows<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> more<00:01:50.130> secure<00:01:50.670> fit<00:01:50.909> if<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
this allows a more secure fit if the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.210 
this allows a more secure fit if the
part<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.990> neutral<00:01:52.170> shape<00:01:52.649> you'll<00:01:53.040> have

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
part is in a neutral shape you'll have

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.310 
part is in a neutral shape you'll have
to<00:01:53.310> try<00:01:53.579> out<00:01:53.729> which<00:01:54.000> works<00:01:54.420> best<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.079> part

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
to try out which works best for the part

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.050 
to try out which works best for the part
you<00:01:55.470> want<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.680> hold<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.070> course<00:01:56.310> an<00:01:56.549> added

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
you want to hold of course an added

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.030 
you want to hold of course an added
bonus<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:57.930> when<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> clamps<00:01:58.829> are

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
bonus is that when the clamps are

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.560 
bonus is that when the clamps are
covered<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.460> paint<00:01:59.670> they<00:01:59.850> become<00:02:00.090> less<00:02:00.329> like

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
covered in paint they become less like

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.899 
covered in paint they become less like
mousetraps<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.799> little<00:02:02.040> bit<00:02:02.130> less<00:02:02.310> grippy

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
mousetraps and a little bit less grippy

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.730 
mousetraps and a little bit less grippy
so<00:02:03.119> there's<00:02:03.270> less<00:02:03.689> danger<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.290> possibly

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
so there's less danger of possibly

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.249 
so there's less danger of possibly
breaking<00:02:05.340> any<00:02:05.549> parts<00:02:06.090> some<00:02:06.570> other<00:02:06.810> options

polystyrene<00:03:10.140> these<00:03:10.860> all<00:03:11.129> come<00:03:11.370> in<00:03:11.459> various

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
polystyrene these all come in various

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.490 
polystyrene these all come in various
shapes<00:03:12.209> I'd<00:03:12.480> recommend<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:12.959> get<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.140> big

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
shapes I'd recommend you get a big

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.830 
shapes I'd recommend you get a big
square<00:03:14.160> one<00:03:14.430> it<00:03:14.579> does<00:03:14.760> help<00:03:15.180> with<00:03:15.239> holding<00:03:15.720> all

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
square one it does help with holding all

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.509 
square one it does help with holding all
the<00:03:15.959> parts<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:16.680> can<00:03:16.709> sort<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.099> organize

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
the parts and you can sort of organize

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.309 
the parts and you can sort of organize
them<00:03:17.760> in<00:03:17.910> any<00:03:18.090> which<00:03:18.329> way<00:03:18.359> you<00:03:18.569> want<00:03:18.930> they're

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
them in any which way you want they're

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.809 
them in any which way you want they're
very<00:03:19.590> cheap<00:03:19.889> as<00:03:20.100> well<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.430> they<00:03:20.519> will<00:03:20.670> last

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
very cheap as well and they will last

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.569 
very cheap as well and they will last
you<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.389> very<00:03:21.450> very<00:03:22.440> long<00:03:22.620> time<00:03:22.680> you'll<00:03:23.250> know

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
you a very very long time you'll know

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.160 
you a very very long time you'll know
when<00:03:23.910> they<00:03:24.030> need<00:03:24.150> replace<00:03:24.480> him<00:03:24.690> because<00:03:24.930> bits

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
when they need replace him because bits

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.289 
when they need replace him because bits
of<00:03:25.350> styrene<00:03:25.829> will<00:03:26.190> start<00:03:26.430> flying<00:03:26.790> everywhere

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
of styrene will start flying everywhere
