00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:23.089 
anywhere from a 7 ounce ball to a 2

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.460 
anywhere from a 7 ounce ball to a 2
pound<00:00:23.330> bomb<00:00:23.509> we<00:00:23.660> first<00:00:23.869> started<00:00:24.140> because<00:00:24.230> we

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
pound bomb we first started because we

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.540 
pound bomb we first started because we
were<00:00:24.499> really<00:00:24.679> just<00:00:24.800> trying<00:00:25.130> to<00:00:25.189> figure<00:00:25.339> it<00:00:25.429> all

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
were really just trying to figure it all

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.599 
were really just trying to figure it all
out<00:00:25.609> and<00:00:25.939> we<00:00:26.419> had<00:00:26.570> our<00:00:26.689> guys<00:00:26.839> actually<00:00:27.079> throw

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609 
out and we had our guys actually throw

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.679 
out and we had our guys actually throw
go<00:00:28.609> through<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:28.880> throwing<00:00:29.150> motion<00:00:29.419> and<00:00:29.570> hang

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
go through the throwing motion and hang

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.370 
go through the throwing motion and hang
on<00:00:29.810> to<00:00:29.900> the<00:00:29.990> ball<00:00:30.550> alright<00:00:31.550> and<00:00:31.960> we<00:00:32.960> liked<00:00:33.170> what

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
on to the ball alright and we liked what

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
on to the ball alright and we liked what
we<00:00:33.470> got<00:00:33.650> and<00:00:33.770> we<00:00:33.830> got<00:00:33.980> some<00:00:34.160> pretty<00:00:34.280> good

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
we got and we got some pretty good

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.220 
we got and we got some pretty good
results<00:00:34.880> from<00:00:34.970> that<00:00:35.150> but<00:00:35.390> I<00:00:35.420> also<00:00:35.660> noticed

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
results from that but I also noticed

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.920 
results from that but I also noticed
that<00:00:36.680> when<00:00:37.040> they<00:00:37.580> held<00:00:38.060> on<00:00:38.270> to<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:38.540> ball<00:00:38.660> that

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
that when they held on to the ball that

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.110 
that when they held on to the ball that
the<00:00:39.380> movement<00:00:39.800> pattern<00:00:40.100> kind<00:00:40.340> of<00:00:40.520> eroded<00:00:41.000> that

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
the movement pattern kind of eroded that

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.730 
the movement pattern kind of eroded that
it<00:00:41.270> didn't<00:00:41.540> look<00:00:41.720> like<00:00:41.780> a<00:00:41.990> real<00:00:42.110> throw<00:00:42.590> there

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
it didn't look like a real throw there

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.520 
it didn't look like a real throw there
was<00:00:42.860> something<00:00:43.310> weird<00:00:44.210> about<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:45.110> way<00:00:45.140> their

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
was something weird about the way their

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.520 
was something weird about the way their
movement<00:00:45.830> pattern<00:00:46.130> changed<00:00:46.700> when<00:00:47.420> they<00:00:48.320> had

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
movement pattern changed when they had

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.290 
movement pattern changed when they had
to<00:00:48.650> hang<00:00:48.800> on<00:00:48.950> to<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.160> ball<00:00:49.250> ok<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:49.760> so<00:00:50.030> I

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
to hang on to the ball ok and so I

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.270

us this this sock hold apparatus here
and<00:01:02.630> what<00:01:03.170> we<00:01:03.260> have<00:01:03.440> inside<00:01:03.830> of<00:01:03.950> it<00:01:04.040> if<00:01:04.100> you<00:01:04.189> can

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
and what we have inside of it if you can

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.950 
and what we have inside of it if you can
look<00:01:04.400> inside<00:01:04.729> of<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:04.939> sock<00:01:05.180> it<00:01:05.420> has<00:01:05.630> a<00:01:05.659> little

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
look inside of the sock it has a little

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.810 
look inside of the sock it has a little
loop<00:01:06.170> right<00:01:06.469> here<00:01:06.499> and<00:01:06.890> so<00:01:07.369> what<00:01:07.520> we<00:01:07.609> do<00:01:07.729> with

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
loop right here and so what we do with

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.239 
loop right here and so what we do with
the<00:01:07.939> loop<00:01:08.090> is<00:01:08.240> we<00:01:08.359> put<00:01:08.570> our<00:01:09.200> two<00:01:09.560> small<00:01:09.920> fingers

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:10.249 
the loop is we put our two small fingers

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:14.230 
the loop is we put our two small fingers
through<00:01:10.429> the<00:01:10.520> loop<00:01:10.670> like<00:01:10.909> that<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:11.770> then<00:01:13.240> we

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
through the loop like that and then we

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.770 
through the loop like that and then we
put<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.509> ball<00:01:14.719> in<00:01:14.899> the<00:01:14.960> sock<00:01:16.450> and<00:01:17.450> we<00:01:17.569> stick

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
put the ball in the sock and we stick

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.690 
put the ball in the sock and we stick
our<00:01:17.899> hand<00:01:18.079> in<00:01:18.200> there<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:18.560> we're<00:01:19.280> hanging<00:01:19.609> on

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
our hand in there and we're hanging on

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.429 
our hand in there and we're hanging on
to<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:19.969> ball<00:01:22.840> we're<00:01:23.840> hanging<00:01:24.049> on<00:01:24.140> to<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:24.319> ball

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
to the ball we're hanging on to the ball

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.139 
to the ball we're hanging on to the ball
the<00:01:24.560> end<00:01:24.679> of<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.799> sock<00:01:25.009> and<00:01:25.249> then<00:01:25.640> we<00:01:25.819> cinch<00:01:26.030> it

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
the end of the sock and then we cinch it

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:27.309 
the end of the sock and then we cinch it
down<00:01:26.179> on<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.509> wrist<00:01:26.689> and<00:01:26.869> he<00:01:26.960> still<00:01:27.170> got<00:01:27.259> his

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:27.319 
down on the wrist and he still got his

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:28.630 
down on the wrist and he still got his
fingers<00:01:27.679> through<00:01:27.770> that<00:01:27.920> little<00:01:28.069> loop<00:01:28.280> inside

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
fingers through that little loop inside

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.370 
fingers through that little loop inside
and<00:01:29.499> and<00:01:30.969> then<00:01:31.969> now<00:01:32.569> when<00:01:32.780> we<00:01:32.869> go<00:01:32.990> to<00:01:33.049> throw<00:01:33.259> the

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
and and then now when we go to throw the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.739 
and and then now when we go to throw the
ball<00:01:33.499> it<00:01:34.130> looks<00:01:34.399> more<00:01:34.549> natural<00:01:34.609> and<00:01:35.179> the<00:01:35.569> ball

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:35.749 
ball it looks more natural and the ball

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:38.620 
ball it looks more natural and the ball
stays<00:01:35.990> in<00:01:36.139> the<00:01:36.200> sock<00:01:36.409> ok<00:01:36.889> and<00:01:37.189> we<00:01:37.999> really<00:01:38.479> like

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
stays in the sock ok and we really like

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.149 
stays in the sock ok and we really like
the<00:01:38.780> way<00:01:38.869> that<00:01:39.020> looked<00:01:39.289> the<00:01:39.560> movement<00:01:39.889> pattern

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
the way that looked the movement pattern

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.340 
the way that looked the movement pattern
improved<00:01:40.609> the<00:01:41.060> guy<00:01:41.270> said<00:01:41.659> it<00:01:41.689> felt<00:01:41.990> great<00:01:42.319> the

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
improved the guy said it felt great the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.289 
improved the guy said it felt great the
feedback<00:01:42.920> from<00:01:43.100> our<00:01:43.249> from<00:01:43.520> our<00:01:43.609> students<00:01:44.149> was
