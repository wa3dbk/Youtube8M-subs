00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.970
 Hello my name is Stas and 80 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.710
 soft club company 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.769
 so today i decided to tell for 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.809
 application traffic she rather ask 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.910
 forgiveness was quite comfortable and 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.130
 allows you to control your traffic 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.080
 which you spend on the internet and so 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.539
 expose number one 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.810
 but understandably mobile traffic well 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.000
 let's say the limit for my mobile 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.790
 cellular I put 500 megabytes 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.520
 As for wifi, I put well, just 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.890
 for interest i put five thousand usually 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.200
 and it happens that I digest it happens that not 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.149
 reload to remind of reset 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.090
 and naturally take into account downloads 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.160
 internet click given so the first thing we 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.800
 we see it on mobile 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.110
 we spent traffic that is something with 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.510
 mobile sim card how many we sit 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.510
 Internet vayfay also understandable and 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.680
 the settings are what we changed 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.989
 gradually you will see a percentage 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.650
 proportion so quantity but let me 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.770
 Now I will go to some example site 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:11.990
 let's choose apple apple 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.720
 so fine and now we turn 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.870
 directly to the traffic 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.490
 attention 70 this is what we get 700 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.430
 kilobyte until it turns out there is one 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.740
 megabyte date 07 700 kilobytes I already 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.370
 spent as a percentage of you 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.060
 it will be shown how much traffic you 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.910
 already spent 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.200
 and naturally the billing period that is 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.560
 the first day of the day is left until the end 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.900
 month 7 and naturally last day 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.960
 the thirty first number you can reset 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.630
 do in time so to speak exploitation 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.430
 programs press 0 and reset either in 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.479
 the very end of the month if you set here 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.630
 this is a reminder then you will be push push 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.180
 they will be allowed to show that update 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.190
 please traffic here he traffic here push 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.979
 all included if you don't need it then you 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.740
 you can turn everything off here and then 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.750
 that is, well, essentially nothing will happen and 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.119
 so you can control 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.800
