and physiology for many years one of the
core<00:00:27.359> problems<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.170> students<00:00:28.619> run<00:00:28.800> into

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
core problems that students run into

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.740 
core problems that students run into
when<00:00:29.339> they<00:00:29.460> take<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.939> course<00:00:30.269> which<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
when they take this course which is the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.450 
when they take this course which is the
study<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.410> structure<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.949> function<00:00:32.400> of

study of the structure and function of

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.420 
study of the structure and function of
the<00:00:32.580> human<00:00:32.730> body<00:00:33.060> is<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:34.290> voluminous<00:00:35.220> amount

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
the human body is the voluminous amount

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.220 
the human body is the voluminous amount
of<00:00:35.730> information<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.390> they<00:00:36.660> have<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.200> can

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
of information that they have you can

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.100 
of information that they have you can
see<00:00:37.560> from<00:00:37.770> these<00:00:37.890> textbooks<00:00:38.550> which<00:00:39.360> average

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
see from these textbooks which average

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.290 
see from these textbooks which average
over<00:00:40.380> a<00:00:40.410> thousand<00:00:40.920> pages<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:42.060> they're

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
over a thousand pages that they're

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.540 
over a thousand pages that they're
overwhelmed<00:00:43.050> by<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.230> amount<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.770> detail<00:00:44.280> and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
overwhelmed by the amount of detail and

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.520 
overwhelmed by the amount of detail and
complexity<00:00:45.150> of<00:00:45.270> concepts<00:00:45.900> that<00:00:45.990> are<00:00:46.140> covered

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
complexity of concepts that are covered

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.150 
complexity of concepts that are covered
in<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> course<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.350> came<00:00:49.350> up<00:00:49.560> with<00:00:49.740> a<00:00:49.890> little

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
in the course so I came up with a little

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.250 
in the course so I came up with a little
solution<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.880> the<00:00:51.240> solution<00:00:51.390> was<00:00:51.900> to

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
solution and the solution was to

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.770 
solution and the solution was to
actually<00:00:53.010> create<00:00:53.610> my<00:00:53.790> own<00:00:53.970> book<00:00:54.330> series

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
actually create my own book series

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.660 
actually create my own book series
called<00:00:55.200> the<00:00:55.350> visual<00:00:55.530> analogy<00:00:56.070> guide<00:00:56.340> series

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
called the visual analogy guide series

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.330 
called the visual analogy guide series
that<00:00:57.360> consists<00:00:57.810> of<00:00:57.870> three<00:00:58.200> books<00:00:58.470> the<00:00:58.800> first

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
that consists of three books the first

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.270 
that consists of three books the first
that<00:00:59.790> I<00:00:59.820> wrote<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.330> illustrated<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.800> visual

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
that I wrote and illustrated is a visual

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.369 
that I wrote and illustrated is a visual
analogy<00:01:02.610> guide<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.210> human<00:01:03.510> anatomy<00:01:03.750> which

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
analogy guide to human anatomy which

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.440 
analogy guide to human anatomy which
covers<00:01:04.739> structure<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.489> human<00:01:05.789> body<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
covers structure of the human body the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.870 
covers structure of the human body the
second<00:01:07.259> was<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.679> visual<00:01:08.130> analogy<00:01:08.460> guide<00:01:08.700> to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
second was a visual analogy guide to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.179 
second was a visual analogy guide to
human<00:01:09.179> physiology<00:01:09.530> covering<00:01:10.530> function<00:01:11.039> and

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
human physiology covering function and

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.730 
human physiology covering function and
then<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.909> third<00:01:12.299> was<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.049> visual<00:01:13.439> analogy

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
then the third was a visual analogy

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.340 
then the third was a visual analogy
guide<00:01:14.009> to<00:01:14.280> human<00:01:14.609> anatomy<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.149> physiology

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
guide to human anatomy and physiology

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.840 
guide to human anatomy and physiology
which<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.530> integration<00:01:17.219> of<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> first<00:01:17.670> two

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
which is integration of the first two

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.450 
which is integration of the first two
books<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.960> let's<00:01:19.350> look<00:01:19.469> at<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> few<00:01:19.799> examples<00:01:20.369> to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
books so let's look at a few examples to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.179 
books so let's look at a few examples to
see<00:01:20.850> what<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.780> did<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.049> make<00:01:22.409> things<00:01:22.799> simpler

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
see what we did to make things simpler

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.410 
see what we did to make things simpler
and<00:01:23.549> more<00:01:23.789> memorable<00:01:24.329> for<00:01:24.390> students<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:27.210> what

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and more memorable for students so what

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.870 
and more memorable for students so what
is<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> visual<00:01:28.049> analogy<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.829> visual<00:01:29.369> analogy<00:01:29.700> is

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
is a visual analogy a visual analogy is

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.149 
is a visual analogy a visual analogy is
the<00:01:30.060> theme<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.509> all<00:01:30.659> these<00:01:30.840> books<00:01:31.140> one<00:01:32.009> good

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the theme of all these books one good

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.880 
the theme of all these books one good
example<00:01:32.280> would<00:01:32.850> be<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.749> bones<00:01:34.289> that<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.679> have

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
example would be the bones that you have

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.160 
example would be the bones that you have
in<00:01:35.069> your<00:01:35.219> vertebral<00:01:35.640> column<00:01:36.359> if<00:01:36.689> we<00:01:36.899> were<00:01:37.049> to

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
in your vertebral column if we were to

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.469 
in your vertebral column if we were to
look<00:01:37.439> at<00:01:37.499> one<00:01:38.039> of<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.310> thoracic<00:01:38.939> vertebra

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
look at one of the thoracic vertebra

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.760 
look at one of the thoracic vertebra
you'll<00:01:39.689> notice<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.200> looks<00:01:40.350> very<00:01:40.380> similar

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
you'll notice that it looks very similar

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.639 
you'll notice that it looks very similar
to<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.159> giraffe<00:01:41.579> head<00:01:41.929> another<00:01:42.929> example<00:01:43.499> would

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
to a giraffe head another example would

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.179 
to a giraffe head another example would
be<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:44.179> lumbar<00:01:45.179> vertebra<00:01:45.719> a<00:01:46.020> lumbar<00:01:46.679> vertebra

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
be a lumbar vertebra a lumbar vertebra

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.010 
be a lumbar vertebra a lumbar vertebra
if<00:01:47.249> you<00:01:47.369> look<00:01:47.549> at<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.759> from<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.060> side<00:01:48.270> looks<00:01:48.899> a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
if you look at it from the side looks a

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.959 
if you look at it from the side looks a
lot<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.409> Moose's<00:01:49.889> head<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.369> if<00:01:50.880> you

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
lot like a Moose's head and if you

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:53.480 
lot like a Moose's head and if you
superimpose<00:01:51.420> again<00:01:52.109> the<00:01:52.380> moose<00:01:52.560> head<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
superimpose again the moose head on the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.910 
superimpose again the moose head on the
different<00:01:53.819> parts<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.569> lumbar<00:01:54.929> vertebra

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
different parts of the lumbar vertebra

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.179 
different parts of the lumbar vertebra
they<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.310> learn<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.670> parts<00:01:57.000> much<00:01:57.210> better

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
they can learn the parts much better

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.679 
they can learn the parts much better
another<00:01:59.189> good<00:01:59.430> example<00:01:59.460> would<00:02:00.119> be<00:02:00.180> one<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
another good example would be one of the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.330 
another good example would be one of the
bones<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.200> find<00:02:01.470> inside<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.979> skull

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
bones that you find inside the skull

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.359 
bones that you find inside the skull
refer<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.210> as<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.570> sphenoid<00:02:03.840> bone<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:05.310> bone

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
refer to as the sphenoid bone this bone

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.399 
refer to as the sphenoid bone this bone
is<00:02:05.790> embedded<00:02:06.330> inside<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.720> skull<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.259> it's

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
is embedded inside the skull and it's

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.029
