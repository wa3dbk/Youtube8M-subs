00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.279
 very good everyone here we are in a 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.609
 new gta 5 video online here we are 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:10.400
 with fargas and well then let's make a 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.790
 speed test of the environment against 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.020
 adn let's see who wins and well then 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.999
 here we are doing a little bit the 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.130
 asshole with the new gestures and good 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:21.619
 Well first of all let's tell you who 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.560
 well who is the winner who comes out 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.080
 faster 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.779
 burning wheel who leaves faster 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.220
 without more wheel so good 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.070
 Many people have not said is that you 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.079
 that more wheels and good comes before a 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.329
 car than another but it rolls me and the 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.210
 final then well let's do the test 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.699
 okay and so nothing then that 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.400
 tell you, I was very surprised by the 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.379
 speed of the environment but very much already 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.110
 how good is much faster than 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.570
 I believed an hour not go we're going to 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.229
 check in agreement we are in the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.900
 airport we are good to tell you that 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:02.320
 the two cars are tuned to the maximum 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.570
 agree let's do it without burning 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.030
 wheel for the first time according 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.310
 we have both left at the same time and 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.860
 Well, as you can see in that environment, 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.290
 quite before and well it seems that 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.790
 leaves a little behind Alava what's going 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.400
 leaving a little behind more and more and 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.950
 more and more but in the end the dt seems 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.320
 that takes a little bit of run and 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.750
 wants to catch from environment but 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.320
 it seems that it ends just before the 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.080
 track before he could finish no 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.510
 and well, it's just that one 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.610
 straight longer than that of the 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.520
 airport you will not find then 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.700
 the round to this one has won that environment 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.979
 because basically because it is not 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.290
 faster is faster output is 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.800
 faster top speed but who 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.619
 knows maybe if another beaten track 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.979
 that this to the good and equal twice as 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.140
 long maybe it's the one of the pilla pilla 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.940
 to the around who knows what happens is 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.820
 that we could not do it 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.130
 because the track because the track is not not 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.100
 as long as we would like 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.840
 of agreement but today I tell you we have 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.090
 done now burning wheel here we are 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.920
 doing a little bit of the cocoon and good 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.170
 Well, let's do 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.110
 the second round burning wheel so that 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.670
 you see the comparison between the one that more 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.800
 wheel and one that rolls the most is 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.780
 that here gives a little the same goes the 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.090
 environment before and good as I'm already 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.250
 watching moderate of 3 2 1 and we left 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.980
 both at the same time and as you see this 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.410
 environment comes out pretty early even 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.470
 exceeds in tip speed at the beginning to 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.440
 the time what happens is that when the ade 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.200
 It has been running for several seconds now 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.150
 it seems that it accelerates a little more than 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.830
 the environment I do not want you are seeing that 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.110
 It looks like he's going to take a little more 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.090
 run but the center does not follow 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.640
 taking a huge advantage to that of 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.260
 so nothing then in winner for 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.959
 elimination since it has been 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.370
 that environment the truth is that it is a car 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:05.439
 Well, I did not expect it to be so 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.230
 fast the truth and well then now I'm going 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:11.769
 to explain a little more what I 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.530
 would buy good environments and the leader would 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:18.750
 truth is that this environment is very much 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.519
 much more handsome more cool not and good 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.950
 the truth is that it is for price as 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:28.780
 you are seeing the environment worth 725,000 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:31.030
 and the leader is worth a million so the 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.950
 it's true that well, here I am 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.049
 looking between ladder and good then here 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.780
 goes a million the truth is that what 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.489
 so it happens that with money that does not spend 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.250
 and I know ladder you can tune in that 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.790
 environment almost to the maximum because good because 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.780
 is that it happens to you that they cost 300 thousand 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:52.540
 300 thousand that I will save you in spending 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.400
 the tune in the environment so nothing 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.909
 you know I recommend the environment 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.669
 as much as for aesthetics as for 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:02.230
 speed acceleration tip and others and 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.040
 Well, you know if you liked it
