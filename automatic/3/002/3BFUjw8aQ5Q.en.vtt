00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.700
 francky dury 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.280
 at rest it would look good 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.269
 you score in the 44th minute 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.690
 and then you become 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.970
 silenced in the second half 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.920
 what went wrong if something went wrong 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.939
 or the chemistry you just it 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.130
 game then I think we now how to mat 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:35.540
 do not play super but become and hours 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.540
 control over the game and nature 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.280
 yes we have some people within my team and 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.230
 outside my team yes a bit de 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.530
 pedals lost 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.370
 why we lost the pedals to him 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.020
 before that I dig a little bit in it 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.020
 Darkness of light suddenly went 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.910
 out and I hope we like this one 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.770
 match must be able to analyze together 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.120
 with the team but there how lessons 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.770
 pull out then I think living in it 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.019
 but could be better but good and 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.739
 first look at all its everything 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.570
 under control 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.000
 I think I will be here in geert 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.670
 never did we see that 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.909
 hands to give but then yes then 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.600
 too many things happen to each other 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:24.150
 so you have to be strong as a team 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:27.140
 in building a new team to get there 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.140
 to respond to 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.430
 you say a new team is not yet there 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.470
 all on his leg but still bring 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.600
 julian and number of young players again 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.100
 those that are a surprise today 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.460
 Communion is n't exactly the difference 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.460
 to make 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.350
 they built a team that happens with 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.270
 height to smile and for my mom 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.720
 gelish rest in between sitting 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.040
 why do we have to have to have lessons 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.290
 We have to know what we are 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.960
 can and must know what we do not 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.670
 being able 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.860
 can't play against our own then 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.440
 you should never do that 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.150
 We must therefore draw good lessons 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.280
 to the future because everyone is expecting 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:15.220
 from Zulu Waregem that we are good 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.920
 bring performance and at the top something 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.430
 news happened in boarding 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.650
 but you may not return from where 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.030
 the you come you have to take steps 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:31.350
 forward and I think that's such a big one 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.350
 lesson is from corner
