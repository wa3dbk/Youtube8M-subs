than<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.140> virtually<00:01:49.140> all<00:01:49.320> plastic<00:01:49.890> Sony

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
than the virtually all plastic Sony

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.480 
than the virtually all plastic Sony
mdr-1r<00:01:50.939> though<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.840> not<00:01:52.110> quite<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:52.680> nice<00:01:53.430> in

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
mdr-1r though it's not quite as nice in

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.190 
mdr-1r though it's not quite as nice in
terms<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.060> fit<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.240> finish<00:01:54.390> as<00:01:54.810> something

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
terms of fit and finish as something

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.789 
terms of fit and finish as something
like<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.500> sennheiser<00:01:55.799> momentum<00:01:56.310> um<00:01:57.170> as<00:01:58.170> I

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
like the sennheiser momentum um as I

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.649 
like the sennheiser momentum um as I
said<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:59.070> think<00:01:59.250> these<00:01:59.520> are<00:01:59.640> relatively<00:02:00.149> subtle

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
said I think these are relatively subtle

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.289 
said I think these are relatively subtle
in<00:02:00.810> terms<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.350> their<00:02:01.590> design<00:02:02.009> they<00:02:02.520> come<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.119> a

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
in terms of their design they come in a

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.080 
in terms of their design they come in a
number<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.810> different<00:02:04.170> colors<00:02:04.560> now<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.090> they

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
number of different colors now and they

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.719 
number of different colors now and they
have<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> number<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.899> design<00:02:07.350> features<00:02:07.619> which<00:02:08.190> I

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
have a number of design features which I

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.580 
have a number of design features which I
or<00:02:08.940> work<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:09.209> closer<00:02:09.420> look<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.259> with<00:02:10.500> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
or work for closer look so with the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.440 
or work for closer look so with the
mixers<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:10.950> cables<00:02:11.430> are<00:02:11.580> detachable<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.390> you

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
mixers the cables are detachable and you

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.449 
mixers the cables are detachable and you
get<00:02:12.720> two<00:02:13.080> headphone<00:02:13.620> cables<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.160> get<00:02:14.310> a

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
get two headphone cables you get a

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.880 
get two headphone cables you get a
coiled<00:02:14.940> DJ<00:02:15.390> style<00:02:15.690> cable<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.230> you<00:02:16.680> get<00:02:16.860> a

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
coiled DJ style cable and you get a

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.490 
coiled DJ style cable and you get a
normal<00:02:17.220> straight<00:02:17.760> cable<00:02:18.030> with<00:02:18.720> an<00:02:18.959> iPhone

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
normal straight cable with an iPhone

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.920 
normal straight cable with an iPhone
remote<00:02:19.709> now<00:02:20.459> what's<00:02:20.640> cool<00:02:20.910> about<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.480> cable

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
remote now what's cool about this cable

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.690 
remote now what's cool about this cable
is<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.410> can<00:02:22.560> actually<00:02:22.709> attach<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.459> to

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
is that you can actually attach it to

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.270 
is that you can actually attach it to
either<00:02:24.330> side<00:02:24.660> either<00:02:25.200> ear<00:02:25.620> cup<00:02:25.890> because

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
either side either ear cup because

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.890 
either side either ear cup because
there's<00:02:26.459> Jack's<00:02:26.730> on<00:02:26.940> both<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.510> what's<00:02:27.690> cool

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
there's Jack's on both and what's cool

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.600 
there's Jack's on both and what's cool
about<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.230> jack<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:28.860> it's<00:02:28.980> not<00:02:29.160> recessed

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
about the jack is that it's not recessed

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.490 
about the jack is that it's not recessed
in<00:02:29.760> any<00:02:29.880> way<00:02:30.090> it's<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.690> standard<00:02:31.200> 3.5

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
in any way it's a standard 3.5

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.350 
in any way it's a standard 3.5
millimeter<00:02:32.400> jack<00:02:32.489> so<00:02:32.849> if<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.000> break<00:02:33.180> the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
millimeter jack so if you break the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.420 
millimeter jack so if you break the
cable<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:34.230> can<00:02:34.380> pretty<00:02:34.560> much<00:02:34.650> replace<00:02:35.160> it

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
cable you can pretty much replace it

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.030 
cable you can pretty much replace it
with<00:02:35.610> any<00:02:35.910> off-the-shelf<00:02:36.620> 3.5<00:02:37.620> millimeter

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
with any off-the-shelf 3.5 millimeter

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.890 
with any off-the-shelf 3.5 millimeter
cable<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:38.760> that's<00:02:38.940> really<00:02:39.120> cool<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.750> other

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
cable so that's really cool the other

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.539 
cable so that's really cool the other
nice<00:02:40.110> thing<00:02:40.349> about<00:02:40.379> the<00:02:40.620> mixers<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.430> the

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
nice thing about the mixers is that the

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.300 
nice thing about the mixers is that the
ear<00:02:41.760> cups<00:02:42.090> are<00:02:42.540> swivel<00:02:42.989> up<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.650> can<00:02:43.950> fold

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
ear cups are swivel up so you can fold

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.190 
ear cups are swivel up so you can fold
it<00:02:44.489> all<00:02:44.580> up<00:02:44.610> into<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.239> nice<00:02:45.510> little<00:02:45.720> compact

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
it all up into this nice little compact

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.380 
it all up into this nice little compact
shape<00:02:46.440> because<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.459> ear<00:02:47.610> cups<00:02:47.880> swivel<00:02:48.299> up

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
shape because the ear cups swivel up

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.240 
shape because the ear cups swivel up
individually<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.290> can<00:02:49.380> actually<00:02:49.560> do<00:02:49.890> neat

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
individually you can actually do neat

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.550 
individually you can actually do neat
little<00:02:50.519> things<00:02:50.790> like<00:02:51.090> are<00:02:51.390> where<00:02:52.319> the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
little things like are where the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.410 
little things like are where the
headphone<00:02:53.010> on<00:02:53.250> one<00:02:53.489> side<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.790> your<00:02:53.940> head<00:02:54.209> which

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
headphone on one side of your head which

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.559 
headphone on one side of your head which
again<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:55.140> suppose<00:02:55.349> is<00:02:55.829> useful<00:02:56.790> if<00:02:56.880> you're<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.090> DJ

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
again I suppose is useful if you're a DJ

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.300 
again I suppose is useful if you're a DJ
now<00:02:58.019> this<00:02:58.200> actually<00:02:58.560> brings<00:02:58.739> me<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.130> my

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
now this actually brings me to my

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.309 
now this actually brings me to my
biggest<00:02:59.640> complaint<00:03:00.209> about<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.660> beats<00:03:00.870> mixers

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
biggest complaint about the beats mixers

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.559 
biggest complaint about the beats mixers
which<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:02.010> that<00:03:02.340> they're<00:03:02.940> just<00:03:03.269> not<00:03:03.420> very

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
which is that they're just not very

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:04.880 
which is that they're just not very
comfortable<00:03:03.720> at<00:03:04.470> all

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
comfortable at all

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.030 
comfortable at all
um<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:06.150> clamping<00:03:06.720> force<00:03:06.750> on<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.380> mixes<00:03:07.769> is

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
um the clamping force on the mixes is

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.000 
um the clamping force on the mixes is
very<00:03:08.400> very<00:03:08.760> high<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.510> ear<00:03:10.079> pads<00:03:10.410> even

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
very very high and the ear pads even

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.680 
very very high and the ear pads even
though<00:03:11.190> they're<00:03:11.400> quite<00:03:11.670> soft<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.450> supple

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
though they're quite soft and supple

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.349 
though they're quite soft and supple
they're<00:03:13.319> not<00:03:13.500> very<00:03:13.709> thick<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:14.970> can

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
they're not very thick so you can

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:17.420 
they're not very thick so you can
actually<00:03:15.510> feel<00:03:15.959> parts<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:16.920> headphone

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
actually feel parts of the headphone

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.610 
actually feel parts of the headphone
frame<00:03:17.790> just<00:03:18.060> pressing<00:03:18.630> right<00:03:18.930> on<00:03:19.139> top<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:19.410> your

frame just pressing right on top of your

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.360 
frame just pressing right on top of your
ear<00:03:19.920> with<00:03:20.400> quite<00:03:20.639> a<00:03:20.670> lot<00:03:20.910> of<00:03:20.940> force<00:03:21.269> um<00:03:22.130> again<00:03:23.130> I

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
ear with quite a lot of force um again I

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.360 
ear with quite a lot of force um again I
suppose<00:03:23.819> if<00:03:24.150> you're<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.600> DJ<00:03:25.440> this<00:03:25.829> is<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.040> good

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
suppose if you're a DJ this is a good

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.129 
suppose if you're a DJ this is a good
thing<00:03:26.579> because<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:27.209> headphones<00:03:27.630> are<00:03:27.810> secured

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
thing because the headphones are secured

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:29.330 
thing because the headphones are secured
on<00:03:28.290> your<00:03:28.440> head<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.889> there's<00:03:29.069> a<00:03:29.130> lot<00:03:29.310> of

on your head and there's a lot of
external<00:03:30.150> noise<00:03:30.420> isolation<00:03:31.100> but<00:03:32.100> um

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
external noise isolation but um

external noise isolation but um
personally<00:03:33.389> for<00:03:33.569> me<00:03:33.750> especially<00:03:34.350> because<00:03:34.859> I

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
personally for me especially because I

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
wear glasses I just find them really

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
uncomfortable I can wear them for about

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.309 
uncomfortable I can wear them for about
an<00:03:38.549> hour<00:03:38.609> before<00:03:39.329> I<00:03:39.359> have<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.840> take<00:03:40.019> them<00:03:40.139> off

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
an hour before I have to take them off

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.580 
an hour before I have to take them off
because<00:03:40.500> my<00:03:40.680> ears<00:03:40.980> start<00:03:41.250> getting<00:03:41.459> sore<00:03:41.700> now

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
especially tiny or something but I just

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.229 
especially tiny or something but I just
found<00:03:52.799> these<00:03:52.980> uncomfortable<00:03:53.639> and<00:03:53.790> if<00:03:53.910> you<00:03:54.060> are

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239

interested<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:54.900> them<00:03:55.109> I<00:03:55.290> do<00:03:55.410> recommend<00:03:56.190> you

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
interested in them I do recommend you

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.300 
interested in them I do recommend you
try<00:03:57.750> them<00:03:57.989> on<00:03:58.139> first<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.769> just<00:03:59.010> make<00:03:59.280> sure

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
that you're not going to find them too

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.990 
that you're not going to find them too

uncomfortable
ah<00:04:02.440> this<00:04:03.440> is<00:04:03.650> actually<00:04:04.040> really<00:04:04.280> surprising<00:04:05.060> to

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
ah this is actually really surprising to

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.610 
ah this is actually really surprising to
me<00:04:05.270> that<00:04:05.300> these<00:04:05.570> are<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:05.840> sewing<00:04:06.140> comfortable

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
me that these are the sewing comfortable

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.980 
me that these are the sewing comfortable
because<00:04:06.740> I<00:04:06.890> would<00:04:07.040> have<00:04:07.130> thought<00:04:07.370> that<00:04:07.990> beats

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
because I would have thought that beats

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.440 
because I would have thought that beats
would<00:04:09.260> have<00:04:09.410> nailed<00:04:09.950> it<00:04:10.310> as<00:04:10.490> far<00:04:10.820> as<00:04:11.000> comfort

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
would have nailed it as far as comfort

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.600 
would have nailed it as far as comfort
was<00:04:11.840> concerned<00:04:12.290> for<00:04:12.440> the<00:04:12.620> average<00:04:12.770> consumer

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
was concerned for the average consumer

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.300 
was concerned for the average consumer
and<00:04:13.730> I<00:04:14.210> really<00:04:14.780> don't<00:04:15.170> think<00:04:15.290> that<00:04:15.710> this

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
and I really don't think that this

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.360 
and I really don't think that this
headphone<00:04:16.760> which<00:04:17.230> given<00:04:18.230> the<00:04:18.260> design<00:04:18.739> and<00:04:19.130> the

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
headphone which given the design and the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.300 
headphone which given the design and the
retail<00:04:19.820> availability<00:04:20.440> they<00:04:21.440> really<00:04:21.859> intended

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
retail availability they really intended

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.520 
retail availability they really intended
only<00:04:22.490> to<00:04:22.730> be<00:04:22.940> sold<00:04:23.210> to<00:04:23.300> DJs<00:04:23.840> so<00:04:24.080> my<00:04:24.260> biggest

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
only to be sold to DJs so my biggest

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.080 
only to be sold to DJs so my biggest
complaint<00:04:24.980> is<00:04:25.040> about<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.340> comfort<00:04:25.640> of<00:04:25.970> the

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
complaint is about the comfort of the

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.940 
complaint is about the comfort of the
mixes<00:04:26.480> then<00:04:26.750> does<00:04:27.380> that<00:04:27.410> mean<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:27.650> don't<00:04:27.710> have

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
mixes then does that mean I don't have

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.650 
mixes then does that mean I don't have
any<00:04:28.100> complaints<00:04:28.490> about<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.760> sound<00:04:29.000> well

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
any complaints about the sound well

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.380 
any complaints about the sound well
actually<00:04:29.990> kind<00:04:30.650> of<00:04:30.890> um<00:04:31.100> I<00:04:31.610> actually<00:04:32.000> think

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
actually kind of um I actually think

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.570 
actually kind of um I actually think
that<00:04:32.510> the<00:04:32.720> mixes<00:04:33.200> sound<00:04:33.590> decent<00:04:34.250> for<00:04:34.550> the

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
that the mixes sound decent for the

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.620 
that the mixes sound decent for the
price<00:04:34.880> ah<00:04:35.660> they<00:04:36.170> definitely<00:04:36.740> do<00:04:37.370> have<00:04:37.790> a<00:04:38.090> base

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
price ah they definitely do have a base

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.320 
price ah they definitely do have a base
E<00:04:38.660> and<00:04:39.110> warm<00:04:39.740> tone<00:04:40.130> but<00:04:40.430> not<00:04:40.460> in<00:04:40.820> a<00:04:40.910> way<00:04:41.120> that

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
E and warm tone but not in a way that

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.000 
E and warm tone but not in a way that
sounds<00:04:41.570> just<00:04:41.960> so<00:04:42.350> bassy

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
sounds just so bassy

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.480 
sounds just so bassy
that<00:04:43.430> they<00:04:43.640> sound<00:04:44.000> bloated<00:04:44.540> or<00:04:44.690> overblown<00:04:45.490> um

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
that they sound bloated or overblown um

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.790 
that they sound bloated or overblown um
they<00:04:46.880> actually<00:04:47.060> have<00:04:47.540> quite<00:04:47.810> a<00:04:47.900> lot<00:04:48.260> of<00:04:48.290> energy

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
they actually have quite a lot of energy

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.500 
they actually have quite a lot of energy
in<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:50.030> mids<00:04:50.360> and<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.720> vocals<00:04:51.290> are<00:04:51.590> and

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
in the mids and the vocals are and

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.150 
in the mids and the vocals are and
actually<00:04:53.510> my<00:04:53.660> one<00:04:53.870> issue<00:04:54.050> with<00:04:54.470> the<00:04:54.500> mixes<00:04:55.010> is

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
actually my one issue with the mixes is

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.760 
actually my one issue with the mixes is
that<00:04:55.460> at<00:04:55.669> times<00:04:56.060> this<00:04:56.720> energy<00:04:57.169> is<00:04:57.320> just<00:04:57.530> too

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
that at times this energy is just too

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.430 
that at times this energy is just too
aggressive<00:04:58.370> uh<00:04:58.580> they<00:04:59.540> can<00:04:59.780> sound<00:04:59.990> at<00:05:00.200> higher

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
aggressive uh they can sound at higher

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.010 
aggressive uh they can sound at higher
volumes<00:05:00.980> quite<00:05:01.430> indistinct<00:05:02.210> and<00:05:02.360> splashy<00:05:02.690> the

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
volumes quite indistinct and splashy the

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.040 
volumes quite indistinct and splashy the
vocals<00:05:03.440> get<00:05:03.650> too<00:05:04.070> aggressive<00:05:04.720> now<00:05:05.720> to<00:05:05.780> me<00:05:06.020> I

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
vocals get too aggressive now to me I

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.000 
vocals get too aggressive now to me I
think<00:05:06.410> that's<00:05:06.560> actually<00:05:07.030> preferable<00:05:08.030> to<00:05:08.360> a

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
think that's actually preferable to a

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.730 
think that's actually preferable to a
headphone<00:05:10.010> that<00:05:10.640> actually<00:05:11.030> sounds<00:05:11.540> to<00:05:12.500> bassy

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
headphone that actually sounds to bassy

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.680 
headphone that actually sounds to bassy
but<00:05:13.220> there's<00:05:13.520> not<00:05:13.640> much<00:05:13.820> trouble<00:05:14.060> so<00:05:14.270> it<00:05:14.510> ends

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
but there's not much trouble so it ends

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.120 
but there's not much trouble so it ends
up<00:05:14.720> sounding<00:05:14.900> dull<00:05:15.290> something<00:05:15.800> like<00:05:15.950> the

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
up sounding dull something like the

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.310 
up sounding dull something like the
Skullcandy<00:05:16.550> navigator<00:05:17.150> or<00:05:17.360> the<00:05:17.630> Logitech<00:05:18.110> UE

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
Skullcandy navigator or the Logitech UE

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.000 
Skullcandy navigator or the Logitech UE
4000<00:05:19.070> a<00:05:19.220> sound<00:05:19.910> like<00:05:20.150> that<00:05:20.180> ah<00:05:20.870> in<00:05:21.350> comparison

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
4000 a sound like that ah in comparison

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.500 
4000 a sound like that ah in comparison
I<00:05:22.100> think<00:05:22.310> the<00:05:22.400> mixes<00:05:22.820> with<00:05:23.030> their<00:05:23.150> aggressive

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
I think the mixes with their aggressive

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.650 
I think the mixes with their aggressive
tone<00:05:23.990> actually<00:05:24.890> work<00:05:25.250> quite<00:05:25.280> well<00:05:25.820> with<00:05:26.210> a<00:05:26.450> lot

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
tone actually work quite well with a lot

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.659 
tone actually work quite well with a lot
of<00:05:26.690> music<00:05:26.960> funnily<00:05:27.680> enough<00:05:27.710> I<00:05:28.010> enjoyed<00:05:28.460> them

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
of music funnily enough I enjoyed them

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.300 
of music funnily enough I enjoyed them
more<00:05:28.880> with<00:05:29.510> slower<00:05:29.990> acoustic<00:05:30.710> tracks<00:05:30.979> than<00:05:31.190> I

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
more with slower acoustic tracks than I

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.120 
more with slower acoustic tracks than I
did<00:05:31.550> with<00:05:31.790> the<00:05:32.330> electronic<00:05:33.200> or<00:05:33.410> dance<00:05:33.710> tracks

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
did with the electronic or dance tracks

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.280 
did with the electronic or dance tracks
that<00:05:34.400> supposedly<00:05:35.180> these<00:05:35.510> headphones<00:05:35.810> were

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
that supposedly these headphones were

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.680 
that supposedly these headphones were
designed<00:05:36.680> for<00:05:36.860> now<00:05:37.550> of<00:05:37.729> course<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.330> mixers

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
designed for now of course the mixers

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.810 
designed for now of course the mixers
are<00:05:38.870> a<00:05:38.900> relatively<00:05:39.500> expensive<00:05:39.890> headphone<00:05:40.550> and

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
are a relatively expensive headphone and

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.330 
are a relatively expensive headphone and
while<00:05:41.030> I<00:05:41.060> think<00:05:41.240> that<00:05:41.750> the<00:05:41.990> build<00:05:42.680> quality<00:05:42.979> and

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
while I think that the build quality and

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.130 
while I think that the build quality and
the<00:05:43.490> sound<00:05:43.760> quality<00:05:43.910> are<00:05:44.330> about<00:05:44.660> right<00:05:44.900> for

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
the sound quality are about right for

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.680 
the sound quality are about right for
the<00:05:45.229> price<00:05:45.500> I<00:05:45.770> really<00:05:46.610> find<00:05:46.880> comfort<00:05:47.419> to<00:05:47.570> be<00:05:47.660> a

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
the price I really find comfort to be a

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.260 
the price I really find comfort to be a
huge<00:05:48.110> issue<00:05:48.380> with<00:05:48.830> these<00:05:48.979> headphones<00:05:49.280> now<00:05:50.150> if
