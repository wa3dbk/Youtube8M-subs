all fights a lot more easier I'm not

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.940 
all fights a lot more easier I'm not
sure<00:00:26.300> if<00:00:26.660> this<00:00:26.810> is<00:00:26.960> going<00:00:27.080> to<00:00:27.170> be<00:00:27.289> patched<00:00:27.530> or

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
sure if this is going to be patched or

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.100 
sure if this is going to be patched or
if<00:00:28.130> it<00:00:28.250> can<00:00:28.640> even<00:00:28.880> be<00:00:29.030> patched<00:00:29.570> I<00:00:29.810> don't<00:00:30.020> know

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.110 
if it can even be patched I don't know

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.499 
if it can even be patched I don't know
so<00:00:30.860> the<00:00:31.010> first<00:00:31.160> really<00:00:31.640> hard<00:00:31.850> part<00:00:32.119> that<00:00:32.329> comes

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
so the first really hard part that comes

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.330 
so the first really hard part that comes
up<00:00:32.840> is<00:00:33.020> we're<00:00:33.199> going<00:00:33.410> to<00:00:33.530> be<00:00:33.680> fighting<00:00:33.890> three

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
up is we're going to be fighting three

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.580 
up is we're going to be fighting three
waves<00:00:34.579> of<00:00:34.790> enemies<00:00:35.180> before<00:00:35.450> this<00:00:35.780> door<00:00:36.140> opens

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
waves of enemies before this door opens

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.130 
waves of enemies before this door opens
since<00:00:37.520> this<00:00:37.670> strike<00:00:37.940> is<00:00:37.970> an<00:00:38.239> art<00:00:38.480> burn<00:00:38.750> that

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
since this strike is an art burn that

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.830 
since this strike is an art burn that
means<00:00:39.410> arc<00:00:39.880> weapons<00:00:40.880> do<00:00:41.120> a<00:00:41.149> lot<00:00:41.390> more<00:00:41.420> damage

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
means arc weapons do a lot more damage

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.860 
means arc weapons do a lot more damage
so<00:00:42.320> patience<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:43.070> time<00:00:43.250> so<00:00:43.790> any<00:00:44.030> art<00:00:44.390> damage

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
so patience and time so any art damage

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.540 
so patience and time so any art damage
weapons<00:00:45.290> will<00:00:45.620> be<00:00:45.649> stronger<00:00:46.070> in<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.399> night

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
weapons will be stronger in the night

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.700 
weapons will be stronger in the night
ball<00:00:46.760> it's<00:00:46.910> just<00:00:47.059> according<00:00:47.570> what<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:48.500> burn

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
ball it's just according what the burn

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.100 
ball it's just according what the burn
is<00:00:49.010> on<00:00:49.220> like<00:00:49.670> if<00:00:49.850> its<00:00:50.030> solar<00:00:50.270> burn<00:00:50.570> well<00:00:50.930> then

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
is on like if its solar burn well then

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.240 
is on like if its solar burn well then
the<00:00:51.260> solar<00:00:51.470> damage<00:00:51.890> are<00:00:51.980> going<00:00:52.130> to<00:00:52.190> be

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
the solar damage are going to be

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.910 
the solar damage are going to be
stronger<00:00:52.550> right<00:00:53.420> now<00:00:53.600> is<00:00:53.660> the<00:00:53.840> arc<00:00:54.020> burn<00:00:54.290> so

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
stronger right now is the arc burn so

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.340 
stronger right now is the arc burn so
i'm<00:00:55.190> using<00:00:55.370> patience<00:00:55.940> and<00:00:56.090> time<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:56.630> this

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
i'm using patience and time and this

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.990 
i'm using patience and time and this
part<00:00:57.620> right<00:00:57.680> here<00:00:57.829> we're<00:00:58.610> going<00:00:58.730> to<00:00:58.790> be<00:00:58.880> having

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
part right here we're going to be having

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.760 
part right here we're going to be having
to<00:00:59.149> fight<00:00:59.360> three<00:00:59.690> waves<00:00:59.930> of<00:01:00.079> enemies<00:01:00.469> in<00:01:00.500> it

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
to fight three waves of enemies in it

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.459 
to fight three waves of enemies in it
and<00:01:00.920> it<00:01:01.160> gets<00:01:01.309> tough<00:01:01.579> in<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.719> best<00:01:02.930> place<00:01:03.170> that

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
and it gets tough in the best place that

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.370 
and it gets tough in the best place that
I<00:01:03.590> say<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:04.100> set<00:01:04.489> up<00:01:04.670> at<00:01:04.879> is<00:01:05.059> back<00:01:05.329> here<00:01:05.929> well

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
I say to set up at is back here well

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.129 
I say to set up at is back here well
that's<00:01:06.590> just<00:01:06.679> my<00:01:06.920> opinion<00:01:06.950> but<00:01:07.780> it<00:01:08.780> seems<00:01:09.020> to

00:01:09.129 --> 00:01:09.139 
that's just my opinion but it seems to

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:11.739 
that's just my opinion but it seems to
work<00:01:09.289> out<00:01:09.499> quite<00:01:10.009> well<00:01:10.069> if<00:01:10.729> I<00:01:10.909> set<00:01:11.389> up<00:01:11.509> back

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:11.749 
work out quite well if I set up back

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:14.410 
work out quite well if I set up back
here<00:01:12.200> because<00:01:12.560> it's<00:01:13.069> kind<00:01:13.219> of<00:01:13.310> makes<00:01:13.579> it<00:01:13.759> so

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
here because it's kind of makes it so

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.690 
here because it's kind of makes it so
the<00:01:14.539> enemies<00:01:14.810> are<00:01:14.840> more<00:01:15.079> narrow<00:01:15.409> so<00:01:16.009> there<00:01:16.490> an

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
the enemies are more narrow so there an

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.819 
the enemies are more narrow so there an
easier<00:01:17.209> target<00:01:17.509> and<00:01:17.990> not<00:01:18.109> like<00:01:18.350> cluttered

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
easier target and not like cluttered

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.249 
easier target and not like cluttered
around<00:01:19.130> you<00:01:19.369> and<00:01:19.490> stuff<00:01:19.789> so<00:01:20.450> they're<00:01:21.170> like

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
around you and stuff so they're like

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.010 
around you and stuff so they're like
more<00:01:21.560> of<00:01:21.590> an<00:01:21.709> open<00:01:22.069> target<00:01:22.340> and<00:01:22.840> not<00:01:23.840> to

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
more of an open target and not to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.269 
more of an open target and not to
mention<00:01:24.139> you're<00:01:24.409> splitting<00:01:24.649> a<00:01:24.770> cover<00:01:25.009> back

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:25.279 
mention you're splitting a cover back

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:27.639 
mention you're splitting a cover back
here<00:01:25.520> as<00:01:25.609> well<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.359> third<00:01:26.630> wave<00:01:26.929> is<00:01:27.229> actually

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
here as well the third wave is actually

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.739 
here as well the third wave is actually
the<00:01:27.799> hardest<00:01:28.009> wave<00:01:28.490> in<00:01:28.759> my<00:01:28.909> opinion<00:01:29.209> and

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:29.749 
the hardest wave in my opinion and

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:32.289 
the hardest wave in my opinion and
because<00:01:30.259> there's<00:01:31.009> a<00:01:31.219> ton<00:01:31.609> of<00:01:31.639> wizards<00:01:32.149> that

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
because there's a ton of wizards that

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.779 
because there's a ton of wizards that
come<00:01:32.450> after<00:01:32.599> you<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.590> I<00:01:33.619> normally<00:01:33.979> go<00:01:34.159> way<00:01:34.490> back

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
come after you so I normally go way back

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.410 
come after you so I normally go way back
here<00:01:35.389> in<00:01:35.539> the<00:01:36.499> back<00:01:36.679> and<00:01:37.039> when<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:37.909> am<00:01:38.090> back<00:01:38.270> here

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
here in the back and when I am back here

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.699 
here in the back and when I am back here
the<00:01:38.569> Wizards<00:01:38.869> come<00:01:39.020> after<00:01:39.319> me<00:01:39.439> and<00:01:39.590> they're

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:39.709 
the Wizards come after me and they're

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:41.830 
the Wizards come after me and they're
easy<00:01:39.920> targets<00:01:40.299> because<00:01:41.299> I<00:01:41.389> have<00:01:41.509> plenty<00:01:41.689> of

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
easy targets because I have plenty of

Fogo<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:11.000> rest<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.330> it<00:02:11.510> it's<00:02:12.050> quite<00:02:12.260> simple<00:02:12.590> so

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
Fogo the rest of it it's quite simple so

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.350

once you've gotten to pass those three
waves<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:14.810> progress<00:02:15.080> for

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
waves and progress for

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.940 
waves and progress for
into<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.900> level<00:02:16.200> you'll<00:02:16.320> finally<00:02:16.560> get<00:02:16.800> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
into the level you'll finally get the

into the level you'll finally get the
phone<00:02:17.220> calls<00:02:17.460> this<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.150> when<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.330> gets<00:02:18.450> pretty

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
do not focus on the enemies on the right

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.400 
do not focus on the enemies on the right
side<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.490> don't<00:02:48.000> know<00:02:48.150> why<00:02:48.390> but<00:02:48.720> if<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.230> just

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
side I don't know why but if you just

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.780 
side I don't know why but if you just
focus<00:02:49.560> on<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.950> enemies<00:02:50.190> on<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.340> left<00:02:50.610> side

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
focus on the enemies on the left side

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.060 
focus on the enemies on the left side
for<00:02:51.150> some<00:02:51.300> reason<00:02:51.690> they<00:02:52.230> do<00:02:52.290> not<00:02:52.530> spawn<00:02:52.890> again

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
for some reason they do not spawn again

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.100 
for some reason they do not spawn again
but<00:02:53.700> if<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.910> focus<00:02:54.209> on<00:02:54.330> both<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.570> them<00:02:54.930> they<00:02:55.050> do

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
but if you focus on both of them they do

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.590 
but if you focus on both of them they do
spawn<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.560> think<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.040> might<00:02:56.190> be<00:02:56.220> because

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
spawn I think it might be because

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.120 
spawn I think it might be because
certain<00:02:57.600> amount<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.810> enemies<00:02:58.200> have<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.709> be<00:02:58.890> in

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
certain amount of enemies have to be in

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.210 
certain amount of enemies have to be in
the<00:02:59.730> room<00:03:00.150> at<00:03:00.360> once<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.410> if<00:03:01.560> there<00:03:01.739> isn't<00:03:02.100> that

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
the room at once and if there isn't that

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.490 
the room at once and if there isn't that
certain<00:03:02.580> amount<00:03:02.880> well<00:03:03.209> then<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.870> causes<00:03:04.110> them

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
certain amount well then it causes them

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.560 
certain amount well then it causes them
to<00:03:04.530> spawn<00:03:04.980> again<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.550> could<00:03:06.239> be<00:03:06.360> wrong<00:03:06.510> about

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
to spawn again I could be wrong about

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.150 
to spawn again I could be wrong about
that<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:06.930> don't<00:03:07.200> know<00:03:07.290> why<00:03:07.500> they<00:03:07.709> don't<00:03:07.830> spawn

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
that I don't know why they don't spawn

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.130 
that I don't know why they don't spawn
but<00:03:08.610> for<00:03:08.760> some<00:03:08.940> reason<00:03:09.239> if<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.630> just<00:03:09.840> take<00:03:09.959> out

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
but for some reason if you just take out
