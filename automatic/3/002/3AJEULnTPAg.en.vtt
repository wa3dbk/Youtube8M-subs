00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.750
 when miguel herrera arrived in america 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.280
 he warned him of the eagle's bench not 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.470
 I took it out more than for selection 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.120
 national has now done it again and is 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.100
 that the louse is so sure that a 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.449
 New Zealand will pass over you 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.939
 If you are the one chosen to take the tri to 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.599
 Brazil-2014 selection does not take it out 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:25.449
 at least until 2018 but I can 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.339
 ensure that being December they decide 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.720
 that I was a coach of the national team 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:33.280
 you'll you're going to see here until 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.710
 2018 I just got my two games and 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.960
 with those we convince that we 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.840
 we can be in brazil because mexico 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.330
 sure will it be I do not know if only 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.190
 sure is the miguel herrera of always 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.410
 committed and sure that the tri 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.180
 will win the repechage and with nothing to hide 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.860
 with respect to your alignment to your 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.740
 would sign is a Mexican victory in the 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.800
 meeting and you're done 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:02.730
 his paintings 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:05.489
 rafa more to the fasting by measures 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.820
 they had before 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.800
 jimÃ©nez and if commitment is needed today 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.990
 Herrera even talks about the number of goals 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.320
 with which the tri would be comfortable to the duel of 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.320
 return 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.430
 the goals are very good but when 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.170
 it's a very good advantage over three 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.060
 goals are not going to try to do the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.700
 bowling that we get that we 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.039
 allow them when they allow us the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.350
 play well and forcefully carry 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.270
 while higher of course a lot 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.640
 more without equipping the series you can think 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.320
 that this one not to finish the old 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.509
 discarded that new zealand expect it from 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.310
 mexico a hostile public and dialed 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.250
 distances with what does happen in 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.869
 Central America and then I think that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.049
 mexico has never been held with any 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.100
 rival 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.979
 We would like to take a day when 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.750
 We go to Salvador to Honduras for some 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.560
 place to see what it really is 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.960
 hostile we are a country to all 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.090
 mother today we receive everyone with the 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.840
 open arms 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.239
 we're craving serena is starting 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.979
 We're stuck because soccer is 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.989
 he plays on the court and in Mexico he 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.700
 respects that on the street 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.560
 you find that people know they will be 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.330
 pedestrians or calculations that applaud 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.500
 obviously when we want to do 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.239
 feel but we are not suddenly that 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.350
 circumstance that we do not 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.350
 happens in Central America not
