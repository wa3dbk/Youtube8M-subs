but whatever
now<00:01:47.130> I've<00:01:47.689> realized<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.229> actually

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
now I've realized that it's actually

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.100 
now I've realized that it's actually
more<00:01:49.890> dangerous<00:01:50.329> to<00:01:51.329> bitch<00:01:51.540> out<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
more dangerous to bitch out in the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.289 
more dangerous to bitch out in the
middle<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.530> trick<00:01:52.799> then<00:01:53.310> actually<00:01:53.790> go<00:01:53.970> for

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
middle of a trick then actually go for

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.240 
middle of a trick then actually go for
it<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.540> mean<00:01:54.600> look<00:01:55.020> at<00:01:55.110> me<00:01:55.229> here<00:01:55.439> slip<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.009> slide

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
it I mean look at me here slip and slide

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.280 
it I mean look at me here slip and slide
and<00:01:56.280> dip<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:56.969> dodge<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.540> ducking<00:01:57.899> everywhere

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
and dip and dodge and ducking everywhere

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.639 
and dip and dodge and ducking everywhere
but<00:01:58.799> now<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.430> have<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.149> confidence<00:02:00.840> now<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.409> I

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
but now I have the confidence now that I

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.080 
but now I have the confidence now that I
have<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.890> confidence<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.759> have<00:02:02.909> to

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
have the confidence I just have to

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.469 
have the confidence I just have to
rework<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.409> skill<00:02:04.799> every<00:02:05.520> time<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.060> try<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
rework the skill every time I try the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.869 
rework the skill every time I try the
trick<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.020> think<00:02:07.049> about<00:02:07.799> how<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.099> messed<00:02:08.489> up<00:02:08.700> on

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
trick I think about how I messed up on

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.089 
trick I think about how I messed up on
the<00:02:09.360> next<00:02:09.629> attempt<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.110> right<00:02:10.259> here<00:02:10.500> huge

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099

I<00:02:12.300> didn't<00:02:12.870> land<00:02:13.050> it

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
I didn't land it

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.920 
I didn't land it
what<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.250> hell<00:02:14.490> slip<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.090> slide<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.570> dip<00:02:15.720> and

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
what the hell slip and slide and dip and

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
what the hell slip and slide and dip and
dodge<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.110> do<00:02:16.500> doing

dodge and do doing

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.950 
dodge and do doing
I<00:02:16.980> didn't<00:02:17.700> land<00:02:17.850> it<00:02:18.030> clean<00:02:18.330> but<00:02:18.510> that's<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:18.780> huge

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
I didn't land it clean but that's a huge

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.650 
I didn't land it clean but that's a huge
confidence<00:02:19.530> boost<00:02:19.950> because<00:02:20.220> now<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:21.030> know<00:02:21.390> in

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
confidence boost because now I know in

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.350 
confidence boost because now I know in
my<00:02:21.780> head<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.320> can<00:02:22.770> absolutely<00:02:23.040> land<00:02:23.910> this<00:02:24.150> and

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
my head I can absolutely land this and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.930 
my head I can absolutely land this and
as<00:02:24.750> you'll<00:02:24.960> see<00:02:25.050> it's<00:02:25.380> probably<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.430> next<00:02:26.730> one

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
as you'll see it's probably the next one

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.990 
as you'll see it's probably the next one
or<00:02:26.970> two<00:02:27.090> tries<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.930> land<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.770> like<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.460> said<00:02:29.700> every

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
or two tries I land it like I said every

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.510 
or two tries I land it like I said every
time<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.210> do<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.780> trick<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.470> next<00:02:31.770> try<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.040> try

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
time I do the trick the next try I try

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.640 
time I do the trick the next try I try
to<00:02:32.580> figure<00:02:32.820> out<00:02:33.060> what<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.300> did<00:02:33.420> wrong<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.960> not

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
to figure out what I did wrong and not

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.990 
to figure out what I did wrong and not
make<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.070> same<00:02:35.310> mistake<00:02:35.670> twice

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
make the same mistake twice

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.230 
make the same mistake twice
BAM<00:02:36.840> that's<00:02:37.620> what<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.920> do<00:02:38.040> people<00:02:38.400> perfect<00:02:39.000> back

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
BAM that's what I do people perfect back

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.120 
BAM that's what I do people perfect back
tale<00:02:39.540> at<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.380> point<00:02:40.710> I'm<00:02:40.860> kind<00:02:41.070> of

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
tale at this point I'm kind of

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.530 
tale at this point I'm kind of
considering<00:02:41.670> like<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:42.000> know<00:02:42.120> what<00:02:42.330> I

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
considering like you know what I

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.530 
considering like you know what I
relearned<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.530> but<00:02:44.010> I'm<00:02:44.100> not<00:02:44.280> done<00:02:44.640> okay<00:02:45.360> I

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
relearned it but I'm not done okay I

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.690 
relearned it but I'm not done okay I
want<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:45.990> do<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.320> fakie<00:02:46.740> which<00:02:47.340> there<00:02:47.610> it

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
want to do it to fakie which there it

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.740 
want to do it to fakie which there it
was<00:02:47.850> first<00:02:48.180> try

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
was first try

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.980 
was first try
like<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.260> said<00:02:49.320> oh<00:02:49.620> no<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:51.480> was<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.720> big

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
like I said oh no that was a big

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.010 
like I said oh no that was a big
confidence<00:02:52.860> taker<00:02:53.280> aware<00:02:53.940> didn't<00:02:54.810> appreciate

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
confidence taker aware didn't appreciate

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.650 
confidence taker aware didn't appreciate
that<00:02:55.470> at<00:02:55.590> all<00:02:55.740> but<00:02:56.280> then<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.490> landed<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.000> just

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
that at all but then I landed it just

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.450 
that at all but then I landed it just
like<00:02:57.900> if<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.200> watch<00:02:58.350> earlier<00:02:58.770> in<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.010> video<00:02:59.100> I

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
like if you watch earlier in the video I

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.820 
like if you watch earlier in the video I
keep<00:02:59.970> falling<00:03:00.240> away<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.080> kind<00:03:01.290> of<00:03:01.350> ride<00:03:01.590> off

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
keep falling away and I kind of ride off

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.150 
keep falling away and I kind of ride off
I<00:03:02.330> ride<00:03:03.330> off<00:03:03.510> going<00:03:03.840> left<00:03:04.140> or<00:03:04.560> actually<00:03:04.950> right

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
I ride off going left or actually right

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.530 
I ride off going left or actually right
on<00:03:05.190> your<00:03:05.460> screen<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:05.970> want<00:03:06.300> to<00:03:06.390> go<00:03:06.480> straight

on your screen I want to go straight

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.630 
on your screen I want to go straight
like<00:03:07.020> you<00:03:07.140> just<00:03:07.320> saw<00:03:07.500> right<00:03:07.710> there<00:03:08.010> then<00:03:08.610> I

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
like you just saw right there then I

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.390 
like you just saw right there then I
land<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.210> what<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.530> skateboarders<00:03:11.160> do

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
land it and what the skateboarders do

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.760 
land it and what the skateboarders do
you<00:03:11.910> want<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.210> keep<00:03:12.450> stepping<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.530> up<00:03:13.620> you

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
you want to keep stepping it up you

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.160 
you want to keep stepping it up you
don't<00:03:13.890> want<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.130> lose<00:03:14.310> momentum<00:03:14.940> okay<00:03:15.930> I'm<00:03:16.050> in

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
don't want to lose momentum okay I'm in

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.470 
don't want to lose momentum okay I'm in
the<00:03:16.200> mood<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.770> just<00:03:17.130> relearning

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
the mood I just relearning

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.960 
the mood I just relearning
I<00:03:18.510> might<00:03:18.930> as<00:03:19.080> well<00:03:19.230> try<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:20.370> learn<00:03:20.580> something

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
I might as well try to learn something

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.199 
I might as well try to learn something
new<00:03:21.150> you<00:03:21.510> can<00:03:22.050> guess<00:03:22.290> you're<00:03:23.220> probably<00:03:23.490> right

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
new you can guess you're probably right

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.670 
new you can guess you're probably right
I<00:03:24.240> go<00:03:24.690> ahead<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:24.959> land<00:03:25.110> this<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.350> little<00:03:25.500> bit

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
I go ahead and land this a little bit

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.940 
I go ahead and land this a little bit
later<00:03:25.830> it's<00:03:26.070> not<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.400> clean<00:03:26.760> but<00:03:27.680> this<00:03:28.680> is

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
later it's not that clean but this is

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.370 
later it's not that clean but this is
the<00:03:29.430> process<00:03:29.640> for<00:03:30.120> relearning<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.750> trick<00:03:30.990> you

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380
