ballast on ebay and youtube being
submerged<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:29.539> so<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.869> ended<00:00:31.500> up<00:00:31.859> buying<00:00:32.099> this

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
submerged and so I ended up buying this

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.920 
submerged and so I ended up buying this
one<00:00:32.430> I'm<00:00:32.759> actually<00:00:32.969> very<00:00:33.149> impressed<00:00:33.450> with<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
one I'm actually very impressed with the

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.840 
one I'm actually very impressed with the
quality<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.649> know<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.309> construction

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
quality you know the construction

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.540 
quality you know the construction
quality<00:00:36.000> here<00:00:36.540> seems<00:00:36.870> very<00:00:37.020> nice<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.590> as<00:00:38.399> you

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
quality here seems very nice and as you

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.420 
quality here seems very nice and as you
can<00:00:38.670> see<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.210> an<00:00:39.360> r1<00:00:40.040> headlight<00:00:41.040> assembly

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
can see this is an r1 headlight assembly

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.150 
can see this is an r1 headlight assembly
this<00:00:41.520> as<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> right<00:00:41.940> side<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:43.010> one<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
this as a right side and one of the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.380 
this as a right side and one of the
reasons<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.550> wanted<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:46.489> this<00:00:47.489> small<00:00:47.850> ballast

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
reasons I wanted this this small ballast

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.430 
reasons I wanted this this small ballast
is<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:49.020> can<00:00:49.170> see<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.860> tucks<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.700> nicely<00:00:51.660> right

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
is you can see it tucks in nicely right

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.580 
is you can see it tucks in nicely right
here<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.520> think<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:54.270> I'll<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:55.289> able<00:00:55.320> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
here and I think that I'll be able to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.770 
here and I think that I'll be able to
mount<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.070> kind<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.430> tuck<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.760> away<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.329> on

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
mount it and kind of tuck it away and on

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.840 
mount it and kind of tuck it away and on
the<00:00:57.930> motorcycle<00:00:58.620> there's<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.730> other

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the motorcycle there's the other

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.389 
the motorcycle there's the other
headlight<00:01:00.270> comes<00:01:00.600> right<00:01:01.079> here<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:02.160> then<00:01:02.370> this

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
headlight comes right here and then this

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.600 
headlight comes right here and then this
is<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.730> nose<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.539> when<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> front<00:01:04.610> cowling

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
is the nose and when the front cowling

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.030 
is the nose and when the front cowling
goes<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:06.000> there's<00:01:06.270> kind<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.689> void<00:01:07.020> right<00:01:07.830> in

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
goes on there's kind of a void right in

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.490 
goes on there's kind of a void right in
here<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.090> there<00:01:09.600> should<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.930> room<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.320> tuck

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
here so there should be room to tuck

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.770 
here so there should be room to tuck
this<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.890> still<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.369> check<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.880> put

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
this and I still have to check and put

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.109 
this and I still have to check and put
the<00:01:12.900> whole<00:01:12.990> thing<00:01:13.020> together<00:01:13.580> but<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.610> think

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
the whole thing together but I think

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.870 
the whole thing together but I think
it'll<00:01:15.299> be<00:01:15.330> okay<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.900> anyways<00:01:16.770> real<00:01:17.520> happy<00:01:17.790> with

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
it'll be okay so anyways real happy with

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.149 
it'll be okay so anyways real happy with
this<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.150> was<00:01:18.270> only<00:01:18.390> 38<00:01:18.750> bucks<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.860> forgot

very small and good construction I'm
going<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.380> try<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.710> out<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.000> maybe<00:02:09.000> I'll<00:02:09.149> make

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
going to try it out and maybe I'll make

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.570 
going to try it out and maybe I'll make
a<00:02:09.330> little<00:02:09.570> video<00:02:09.720> showing<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.550> difference<00:02:11.550> i

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
a little video showing the difference i

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.770 
a little video showing the difference i
think<00:02:11.820> i'm<00:02:11.880> going<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.030> mount<00:02:12.210> it<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.600> low

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
think i'm going to mount it in the low

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.990 
think i'm going to mount it in the low
beam<00:02:13.050> socket<00:02:13.680> but<00:02:14.100> i'm<00:02:14.250> also<00:02:14.430> going<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.730> test

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
beam socket but i'm also going to test

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.210 
beam socket but i'm also going to test
it<00:02:15.210> in<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.870> high<00:02:16.050> beam<00:02:16.290> socket<00:02:16.740> just<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.040> see

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
it in the high beam socket just to see

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.280 
it in the high beam socket just to see
the<00:02:17.370> difference<00:02:17.730> in<00:02:17.850> line<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:18.270> anyway<00:02:18.720> nice

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
the difference in line so anyway nice

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.560 
the difference in line so anyway nice
and<00:02:19.470> small<00:02:19.620> balanced<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.300> just<00:02:21.300> wanted<00:02:21.510> to

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
and small balanced and just wanted to
