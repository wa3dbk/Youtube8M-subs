linus<00:00:08.460> has<00:00:08.580> asked<00:00:08.880> us<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.000> question<00:00:09.090> about<00:00:09.599> how

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
linus has asked us a question about how

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.589 
linus has asked us a question about how
to<00:00:10.050> do<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.620> tomahawk<00:00:11.550> serve<00:00:11.880> with<00:00:12.300> the

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
to do the tomahawk serve with the

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.919 
to do the tomahawk serve with the
penhold<00:00:13.259> grip<00:00:13.580> what<00:00:14.580> well<00:00:14.969> Linus<00:00:15.360> it<00:00:15.540> is

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
penhold grip what well Linus it is

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.630 
penhold grip what well Linus it is
possible<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> little<00:00:17.400> bit<00:00:17.490> more

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
possible it is a little bit more

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.730 
possible it is a little bit more
difficult<00:00:18.090> perhaps<00:00:18.390> but<00:00:18.690> it's<00:00:18.930> just<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.470> matter

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
difficult perhaps but it's just a matter

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.880 
difficult perhaps but it's just a matter
of<00:00:19.949> getting<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.550> angle<00:00:21.180> right<00:00:21.619> to<00:00:22.619> do<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
of getting the angle right to do the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.370 
of getting the angle right to do the
tomahawk<00:00:23.820> serve<00:00:24.119> what<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.810> need<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.080> do<00:00:25.230> is

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
tomahawk serve what you need to do is

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.040 
tomahawk serve what you need to do is
you<00:00:25.470> need<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.710> get<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.949> bat<00:00:26.189> at<00:00:26.460> an<00:00:27.050> angle

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
you need to get the bat at an angle

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.570 
you need to get the bat at an angle
something<00:00:28.500> like<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.890> if<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.189> want<00:00:29.369> pure

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
something like that if you want pure

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.540 
something like that if you want pure
side<00:00:29.970> spin<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.170> if<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.830> want<00:00:31.980> backspin

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
side spin like that if you want backspin

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.410 
side spin like that if you want backspin
or<00:00:33.000> like<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.660> if<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.200> want<00:00:34.380> topspin<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.910> it's

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
or like that if you want topspin so it's

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.000 
or like that if you want topspin so it's
a<00:00:36.540> matter<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.870> adjusting<00:00:37.079> your<00:00:37.620> fingers

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
a matter of adjusting your fingers

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.430 
a matter of adjusting your fingers
perhaps<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.550> yourself<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.450> just<00:00:39.480> find<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
perhaps for yourself you just find a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.369 
perhaps for yourself you just find a
position<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.940> feels<00:00:42.180> comfortable<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.350> that

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
position that feels comfortable so that

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.650 
position that feels comfortable so that
you<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.860> get<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> bat<00:00:44.370> into<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:45.000> position

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
you can get the bat into that position

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.130 
you can get the bat into that position
I<00:00:45.920> find<00:00:47.120> playing<00:00:48.120> my<00:00:48.329> fingers<00:00:48.660> out<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.899> little

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
I find playing my fingers out a little

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.990 
I find playing my fingers out a little
bit<00:00:49.320> more<00:00:49.469> gives<00:00:49.980> me<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> bit<00:00:50.340> more<00:00:50.370> control

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
bit more gives me a bit more control

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.080 
bit more gives me a bit more control
over<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:52.440> angle<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.860> my<00:00:53.010> back<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.399> that

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
over the angle of my back on that

over the angle of my back on that
tomahawk<00:00:54.510> penhold<00:00:55.260> serve<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.809> what<00:00:57.809> we're

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
tomahawk penhold serve so what we're

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.779 
tomahawk penhold serve so what we're
going<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.140> try<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.559> do<00:00:58.710> firstly<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.430> just<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
going to try and do firstly is just the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.389 
going to try and do firstly is just the
side<00:01:00.059> spin<00:01:00.480> tomahawk<00:01:01.140> serve<00:01:01.469> remembering

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
side spin tomahawk serve remembering

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.280 
side spin tomahawk serve remembering
when<00:01:02.969> when<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.449> do<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.690> we're<00:01:03.840> going<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.049> bend

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
when when we do it we're going to bend

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.190 
when when we do it we're going to bend
down<00:01:04.470> nice<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.799> low<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:06.180> we<00:01:06.270> get<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
down nice and low so that we get the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:16.760 
down nice and low so that we get the
contact<00:01:07.710> at<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.010> low<00:01:08.700> height<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.210> well<00:01:15.650> to<00:01:16.650> do

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
contact at a low height as well to do

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.190 
contact at a low height as well to do
the<00:01:16.920> topspin<00:01:17.490> tomahawk<00:01:18.420> serve<00:01:18.720> with<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the topspin tomahawk serve with the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.810 
the topspin tomahawk serve with the
penhold<00:01:19.590> grip<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.009> little<00:01:20.340> bit<00:01:20.460> harder

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
penhold grip is a little bit harder

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.820 
penhold grip is a little bit harder
because<00:01:21.299> your<00:01:21.600> natural<00:01:21.750> angle<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.710> have

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
because your natural angle is to have

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.670 
because your natural angle is to have
your<00:01:22.950> bat<00:01:23.130> at<00:01:23.369> you're<00:01:24.119> facing<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.750> way<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.560> do

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
your bat at you're facing that way to do

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.649 
your bat at you're facing that way to do
the<00:01:25.799> topspin<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.850> want<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.450> want

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the topspin what you want is you want

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.929 
the topspin what you want is you want
the<00:01:27.900> bat<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.470> over<00:01:28.770> there<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.579> can't

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
the bat to be over there so you can't

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.499 
the bat to be over there so you can't
even<00:01:30.090> adjust<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.070> grip<00:01:32.070> here<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:33.150> your

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
even adjust the grip here in your

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.270 
even adjust the grip here in your
fingers<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.259> or<00:01:34.700> push<00:01:35.960> with<00:01:36.960> your<00:01:37.280> fingers

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
fingers here or push with your fingers

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.460 
fingers here or push with your fingers
on<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.790> back<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> bat<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.960> make<00:01:39.990> that

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
on on the back of the bat to make that

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.740 
on on the back of the bat to make that
angle<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.280> need<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.549> get<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.030> bat<00:01:42.240> over<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
angle you need to get that bat over the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.010 
angle you need to get that bat over the
top<00:01:43.020> there

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.050 

the<00:01:47.020> backspin<00:01:47.469> servers<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.340> little<00:01:48.579> bit<00:01:48.670> easier

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
the backspin servers a little bit easier

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.090 
the backspin servers a little bit easier
with<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.299> pinhole<00:01:49.509> grip<00:01:49.899> because<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.710> bat<00:01:50.890> is

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
with the pinhole grip because the bat is

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.039 
with the pinhole grip because the bat is
naturally<00:01:51.729> at<00:01:51.850> that<00:01:52.030> angle<00:01:52.210> so<00:01:52.509> you<00:01:52.689> want<00:01:52.930> to

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
naturally at that angle so you want to

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.649 
naturally at that angle so you want to
be<00:01:53.170> coming<00:01:53.500> underneath<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.820> ball<00:01:55.030> for<00:01:55.570> the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
be coming underneath the ball for the

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.169 
be coming underneath the ball for the
backspin<00:01:56.140> tomahawk<00:01:57.070> serve<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.820> pinhole

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
backspin tomahawk serve so the pinhole

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.270 
backspin tomahawk serve so the pinhole
grip<00:02:01.420> is<00:02:01.539> really<00:02:01.840> conducive<00:02:02.229> to<00:02:02.679> doing<00:02:02.829> the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
grip is really conducive to doing the

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.029 
grip is really conducive to doing the
the<00:02:03.789> pendulum<00:02:04.360> serve<00:02:04.569> because<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.990> your<00:02:05.530> bat

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
the pendulum serve because you your bat
