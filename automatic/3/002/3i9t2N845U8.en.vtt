okay<00:00:01.439> I'm<00:00:01.500> back<00:00:01.770> again<00:00:02.460> this<00:00:02.730> time<00:00:03.000> with<00:00:03.149> a

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
okay I'm back again this time with a

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.059 
okay I'm back again this time with a
quick<00:00:03.389> review<00:00:03.780> on<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:03.990> Energizer's<00:00:04.680> hybrid

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
quick review on the Energizer's hybrid

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.220 
quick review on the Energizer's hybrid
solar<00:00:05.279> Lantern<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:06.480> reason<00:00:06.779> is<00:00:06.870> considered

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
solar Lantern the reason is considered

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.720 
solar Lantern the reason is considered
hybrid<00:00:07.680> it's<00:00:07.830> because<00:00:08.069> it<00:00:08.189> uses<00:00:08.519> two

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
hybrid it's because it uses two

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.060 
hybrid it's because it uses two
different<00:00:09.059> battery<00:00:09.300> technologies<00:00:10.050> you<00:00:10.800> first

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
different battery technologies you first

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.190 
different battery technologies you first
have<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.610> solar<00:00:12.059> Turnersville<00:00:12.630> battery<00:00:12.929> pack

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
have a solar Turnersville battery pack

cell it's rated for a half a watt and

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.830 
cell it's rated for a half a watt and
then<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.460> second<00:00:23.939> battery<00:00:24.210> technology<00:00:24.810> is

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
then the second battery technology is

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.320 
then the second battery technology is
going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.230> be<00:00:25.289> regular<00:00:26.279> alkaline<00:00:26.640> cells<00:00:27.119> that

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
going to be regular alkaline cells that

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.269 
going to be regular alkaline cells that
you<00:00:27.480> can<00:00:27.599> get<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.930> pretty<00:00:28.260> much<00:00:28.320> any<00:00:28.710> store<00:00:29.099> it

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
you can get in pretty much any store it

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.030 
you can get in pretty much any store it
just<00:00:29.490> takes<00:00:29.730> three<00:00:30.060> d<00:00:30.449> cell<00:00:30.689> batteries<00:00:31.040> the

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
just takes three d cell batteries the

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.590 
just takes three d cell batteries the
main<00:00:32.219> difference<00:00:32.669> between<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.090> two<00:00:33.120> is

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
main difference between the two is

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.229 
main difference between the two is
you're<00:00:34.079> gonna<00:00:34.170> get<00:00:34.380> more<00:00:34.620> runtime<00:00:35.130> with<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
you're gonna get more runtime with the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.180 
you're gonna get more runtime with the
alkaline<00:00:36.780> batteries<00:00:37.260> because<00:00:37.620> they're<00:00:37.890> much

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
alkaline batteries because they're much

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.850 
alkaline batteries because they're much
larger<00:00:38.870> before<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.899> get<00:00:40.050> into<00:00:40.200> any<00:00:40.410> more<00:00:40.530> specs

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
larger before I get into any more specs

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.799 
larger before I get into any more specs
let<00:00:41.190> me<00:00:41.250> go<00:00:41.370> ahead<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.000> thank<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> folks<00:00:42.540> over

right<00:01:08.970> now<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.450> device<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.770> done

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
right now on this device and it's done

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.340 
right now on this device and it's done
pretty<00:01:11.490> darn<00:01:11.820> good<00:01:12.180> over<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> past<00:01:13.049> two<00:01:13.320> weeks

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
pretty darn good over the past two weeks

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.510 
pretty darn good over the past two weeks
so<00:01:13.970> let<00:01:14.970> me<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.180> back<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:17.009> main<00:01:17.220> point

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
so let me get back to the main point

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.539 
so let me get back to the main point
this<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.570> really<00:01:18.990> great<00:01:19.140> lantern<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.460> be

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
this is a really great lantern it can be

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.880 
this is a really great lantern it can be
used<00:01:20.880> for<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.659> bunch<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.619> different

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
used for a bunch of different

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.100 
used for a bunch of different
applications<00:01:23.060> if<00:01:24.060> people<00:01:24.450> are<00:01:24.570> fishing<00:01:24.990> at

to<00:01:27.990> use<00:01:28.140> up<00:01:28.170> your<00:01:28.530> boats<00:01:28.710> battery<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:29.579> use

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
to use up your boats battery you can use

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.420 
to use up your boats battery you can use
this<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.930> also<00:01:31.259> use<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.890> when<00:01:32.100> camping

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
this you can also use it when camping

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.660 
this you can also use it when camping
that's<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:32.909> main<00:01:33.210> purpose<00:01:34.100> is<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.159> be<00:01:35.400> used

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
that's this main purpose is to be used

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.870 
that's this main purpose is to be used
or<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> camping<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.810> probably<00:01:37.650> my<00:01:38.159> primary<00:01:38.490> use

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
or a camping but probably my primary use

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.730 
or a camping but probably my primary use
for<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.509> going<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.810> be<00:01:39.960> during<00:01:40.560> an

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
home you know it's going to be much

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.940 
home you know it's going to be much
safer<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.780> use<00:01:46.049> something<00:01:46.350> battery-operated

Lantern running inside of your house
there's<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.579> couple<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.909> different<00:01:57.210> hazards

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
there's a couple of different hazards

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.440 
there's a couple of different hazards
with<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.649> main<00:01:58.890> being<00:01:59.340> you<00:02:00.180> know<00:02:00.299> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
with that the main being you know the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.389 
with that the main being you know the
fire<00:02:00.689> hazard<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.259> even<00:02:01.590> end<00:02:01.770> up<00:02:01.920> burning<00:02:02.189> down

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
fire hazard you even end up burning down

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.749 
fire hazard you even end up burning down
your<00:02:02.460> house<00:02:03.380> trying<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.469> keep<00:02:04.740> light<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.430> so

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
your house trying to keep light going so

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.180 
your house trying to keep light going so
this<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.149> much<00:02:06.420> safer<00:02:06.659> alternative<00:02:07.190> you

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
this is a much safer alternative you

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.999 
this is a much safer alternative you
also<00:02:08.369> have<00:02:08.849> two<00:02:09.810> choices<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.379> powering<00:02:10.890> it

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
also have two choices of powering it

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.550 
also have two choices of powering it
again<00:02:11.310> if<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.610> run<00:02:11.819> out<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.030> regular<00:02:12.780> alkaline

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
again if you run out of regular alkaline

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.979 
again if you run out of regular alkaline
batteries<00:02:14.010> or<00:02:14.220> say<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:15.450> know<00:02:15.569> people<00:02:15.780> were

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
batteries or say you know people were

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.080 
batteries or say you know people were
anticipating<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.860> storm<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.489> there<00:02:17.760> aren't

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
anticipating the storm and there aren't

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.970 
anticipating the storm and there aren't
any<00:02:18.180> batteries<00:02:18.810> available<00:02:18.959> at<00:02:19.620> any<00:02:19.770> of<00:02:19.920> the

any batteries available at any of the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.220 
any batteries available at any of the
stores<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.430> go<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:21.360> still<00:02:21.630> have<00:02:21.989> the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
stores you go to you still have the

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.880 
stores you go to you still have the
solar<00:02:22.590> that's<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.370> backup<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.780> as<00:02:25.380> far<00:02:25.620> as<00:02:25.680> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
solar that's a backup so as far as the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.420 
solar that's a backup so as far as the
solar<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:27.000> has<00:02:27.209> again<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.810> amorphous<00:02:28.560> silicon

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
solar it has again the amorphous silicon

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.910 
solar it has again the amorphous silicon
solar<00:02:29.459> cell<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:31.430> this<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.610> very<00:02:32.910> efficient<00:02:33.920> can

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
solar cell so this is very efficient can

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.970 
solar cell so this is very efficient can
be<00:02:35.069> charged<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.819> full<00:02:36.540> sunlight<00:02:36.870> as<00:02:37.290> well<00:02:37.709> as

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
be charged and full sunlight as well as

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.089 
be charged and full sunlight as well as
low<00:02:38.340> light<00:02:38.550> conditions<00:02:39.150> so<00:02:39.390> if<00:02:39.840> it's<00:02:40.110> cloudy

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
low light conditions so if it's cloudy

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.979 
low light conditions so if it's cloudy
outside<00:02:41.370> this<00:02:41.940> will<00:02:42.120> steal<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.390> fully<00:02:42.660> charged

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
outside this will steal a fully charged

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.020 
outside this will steal a fully charged
unit<00:02:43.470> in<00:02:43.830> about<00:02:44.069> five<00:02:44.370> hours

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
unit in about five hours

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.390 
unit in about five hours
it's<00:02:45.630> also<00:02:45.780> fully<00:02:46.170> adjustable<00:02:46.680> on<00:02:47.250> this

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
it's also fully adjustable on this

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.580 
it's also fully adjustable on this
little<00:02:47.670> hinge<00:02:47.910> back<00:02:48.209> here<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.110> can<00:02:49.290> adjust

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
little hinge back here so you can adjust

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.280 
little hinge back here so you can adjust
it<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:49.769> pretty<00:02:50.130> much<00:02:50.310> any<00:02:50.610> angle<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.209> want<00:02:51.510> in

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
it to pretty much any angle you want in

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.050 
it to pretty much any angle you want in
order<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.650> get<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.069> most<00:02:53.370> sunlight<00:02:53.880> in<00:02:54.030> the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
order to get the most sunlight in the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.600 
order to get the most sunlight in the
panel<00:02:54.540> another<00:02:55.410> great<00:02:55.650> thing<00:02:55.860> about<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.400> is

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
panel another great thing about it is

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.160 
panel another great thing about it is
since<00:02:56.910> it's<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:57.209> efficient<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.870> can<00:02:58.019> leave

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
since it's so efficient you can leave

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.470 
since it's so efficient you can leave
this<00:02:58.349> in<00:02:58.530> your<00:02:58.560> window<00:02:58.880> either<00:02:59.880> in<00:03:00.120> your<00:03:00.209> car

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
the charge on the battery if you try

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.360 
the charge on the battery if you try
that<00:03:04.670> with<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.940> crystalline<00:03:06.780> solar<00:03:07.019> cell<00:03:07.410> most

that with a crystalline solar cell most

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.370 
that with a crystalline solar cell most
likely<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:09.090> would<00:03:09.239> not<00:03:09.420> charge<00:03:09.720> because<00:03:10.230> of

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
likely it would not charge because of

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.640 
likely it would not charge because of
course<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.950> needs<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:12.150> maximum<00:03:13.019> sunlight<00:03:13.319> in

order to do what it needs to do this
does<00:03:15.840> not<00:03:16.110> so<00:03:16.560> I'm<00:03:16.680> pretty<00:03:16.890> glad<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.400> use<00:03:17.670> the

LEDs two at the top two at the bottom
what<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.230> found<00:03:37.500> about<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.950> light<00:03:38.160> output

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
what I found about the light output

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.440 
what I found about the light output
producing<00:03:39.840> 66<00:03:40.350> lumens<00:03:40.709> it's<00:03:40.829> actually<00:03:41.450> pretty

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
producing 66 lumens it's actually pretty

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.360 
producing 66 lumens it's actually pretty
close<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:43.170> what<00:03:43.319> a<00:03:43.350> fluorescent<00:03:44.010> Lander<00:03:44.250> will

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
close to what a fluorescent Lander will

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.180 
close to what a fluorescent Lander will
produce<00:03:44.840> pretty<00:03:45.840> much<00:03:46.079> like<00:03:46.440> fluorescent

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
produce pretty much like fluorescent

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.629 
produce pretty much like fluorescent
lanterns<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:48.060> little<00:03:48.359> bit<00:03:48.480> more<00:03:48.750> than<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:50.190> LED

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
lanterns a little bit more than the LED

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.789 
lanterns a little bit more than the LED
lantern<00:03:51.030> so<00:03:51.150> I've<00:03:51.269> used<00:03:51.959> in<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.170> past<00:03:52.440> just

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
lantern so I've used in the past just

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.059 
lantern so I've used in the past just
because<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:54.090> fluorescent<00:03:54.810> tubes<00:03:55.079> produce<00:03:55.859> a

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
because the fluorescent tubes produce a

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.729 
because the fluorescent tubes produce a
more<00:03:56.400> even<00:03:56.880> light<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.600> don't<00:03:57.900> have<00:03:58.139> any<00:03:58.440> dark

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739

output<00:04:01.769> you<00:04:02.160> just<00:04:02.400> get<00:04:02.549> a<00:04:02.579> clear<00:04:03.440> diffused

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
output you just get a clear diffused

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.970 
output you just get a clear diffused
area<00:04:05.010> light<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.489> to<00:04:06.359> my<00:04:06.510> surprise<00:04:06.980> this

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
area light and to my surprise this

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.979 
area light and to my surprise this
energize<00:04:08.549> our<00:04:08.819> hybrid<00:04:09.180> solar<00:04:09.359> Lantern<00:04:09.810> with

energize our hybrid solar Lantern with

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.699 
energize our hybrid solar Lantern with
the<00:04:10.200> diffuse<00:04:11.480> LED<00:04:12.480> bulbs<00:04:12.900> actually<00:04:13.410> comes

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
the diffuse LED bulbs actually comes

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.150 
the diffuse LED bulbs actually comes
pretty<00:04:14.130> close<00:04:14.579> to<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.690> light<00:04:15.930> output<00:04:16.169> of<00:04:16.590> a

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
pretty close to the light output of a

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.830 
pretty close to the light output of a
normal<00:04:17.609> fluorescent<00:04:18.120> tube<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:18.690> is

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
normal fluorescent tube and this is

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.409 
normal fluorescent tube and this is
another<00:04:19.519> energizer<00:04:20.519> light<00:04:20.880> one<00:04:21.150> of<00:04:21.269> their

another energizer light one of their
under<00:04:21.780> cabinet<00:04:22.200> lights<00:04:22.409> that<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.830> got<00:04:23.550> a<00:04:23.580> little

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
under cabinet lights that I got a little

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.610 
under cabinet lights that I got a little
while<00:04:24.070> ago<00:04:24.430> so<00:04:25.300> you<00:04:25.360> can<00:04:25.570> see<00:04:25.840> comparing<00:04:26.530> the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
while ago so you can see comparing the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.340 
while ago so you can see comparing the
lights<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:27.280> little<00:04:28.270> bit<00:04:28.420> of<00:04:28.540> color<00:04:28.840> temperature

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
lights a little bit of color temperature

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.020 
lights a little bit of color temperature
difference<00:04:29.800> but<00:04:30.100> when<00:04:31.030> testing<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:33.030> diffused

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
difference but when testing the diffused

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.980 
difference but when testing the diffused
LED<00:04:34.570> bulbs<00:04:34.960> and<00:04:35.110> this<00:04:35.230> actually<00:04:35.770> produce

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
LED bulbs and this actually produce

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.590 
LED bulbs and this actually produce
pretty<00:04:37.990> smooth<00:04:38.980> light<00:04:39.970> without<00:04:40.330> any

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
pretty smooth light without any

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.540 
pretty smooth light without any
artifacts<00:04:41.230> or<00:04:41.470> dark<00:04:41.680> spots<00:04:41.800> so<00:04:42.160> that's<00:04:42.370> what<00:04:42.490> I

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
artifacts or dark spots so that's what I

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.130 
artifacts or dark spots so that's what I
like<00:04:42.730> about<00:04:42.910> it

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
like about it

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.440 
like about it
another<00:04:44.830> thing<00:04:45.100> again<00:04:45.580> fully<00:04:46.000> adjustable

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
another thing again fully adjustable

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.280 
another thing again fully adjustable
gives<00:04:47.350> you<00:04:47.530> 360<00:04:48.310> degrees<00:04:48.640> of<00:04:48.670> output<00:04:49.360> front

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
gives you 360 degrees of output front

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.820 
gives you 360 degrees of output front
back<00:04:50.800> sides<00:04:51.840> you<00:04:52.840> can<00:04:52.960> also<00:04:53.140> clear<00:04:53.530> it<00:04:53.680> like

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
back sides you can also clear it like

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.900 
back sides you can also clear it like
this<00:04:54.070> and<00:04:54.400> it<00:04:54.490> has<00:04:54.670> a<00:04:54.700> little<00:04:55.030> reflector<00:04:55.690> to

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
this and it has a little reflector to

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.890 
this and it has a little reflector to
reflect<00:04:57.910> anything<00:04:58.210> like<00:04:58.360> this<00:04:58.540> cover<00:04:58.750> from

some<00:06:05.470> more<00:06:05.590> runtime<00:06:06.040> on<00:06:06.070> the<00:06:06.340> solar<00:06:06.610> side<00:06:06.940> and

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
some more runtime on the solar side and

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:12.150 
some more runtime on the solar side and
also<00:06:08.230> if<00:06:09.130> you<00:06:09.310> wanted<00:06:09.610> to<00:06:09.940> have<00:06:10.770> less<00:06:11.770> light

even then you can see a steel sort of

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.910 
even then you can see a steel sort of
gets<00:07:00.450> a<00:07:00.510> little<00:07:00.660> bit<00:07:00.840> of<00:07:00.960> dirt<00:07:01.170> on<00:07:01.350> it<00:07:01.530> I<00:07:01.650> wish

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:01.920 
gets a little bit of dirt on it I wish

gets a little bit of dirt on it I wish
they<00:07:02.100> would<00:07:02.310> have<00:07:02.400> made<00:07:03.180> this<00:07:03.360> entirely

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:03.780 
they would have made this entirely

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.410 
they would have made this entirely
orange<00:07:04.470> or<00:07:04.620> maybe<00:07:04.800> used<00:07:05.100> a<00:07:05.370> darker<00:07:06.180> color

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:06.420 
orange or maybe used a darker color

there<00:07:06.690> so<00:07:07.110> it<00:07:07.620> wouldn't<00:07:07.830> get<00:07:07.980> dirty<00:07:08.160> but

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
there so it wouldn't get dirty but

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.970 
there so it wouldn't get dirty but
besides<00:07:08.910> that<00:07:09.090> and<00:07:09.510> it's<00:07:09.720> a<00:07:09.870> great<00:07:10.440> Lantern

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:10.980
