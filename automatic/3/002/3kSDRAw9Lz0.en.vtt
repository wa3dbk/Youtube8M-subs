00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.320 

these<00:00:01.260> are<00:00:01.469> the<00:00:01.560> power<00:00:01.770> block<00:00:02.070> elite<00:00:02.399> 130s

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
these are the power block elite 130s

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.829 
these are the power block elite 130s
they<00:00:03.540> go<00:00:03.689> up<00:00:03.780> to<00:00:03.899> 130<00:00:04.470> pounds<00:00:04.920> per<00:00:05.250> hand<00:00:05.660> as<00:00:06.660> you

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
they go up to 130 pounds per hand as you

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.320 
they go up to 130 pounds per hand as you
can<00:00:06.990> see<00:00:07.170> they<00:00:07.319> are<00:00:07.410> so<00:00:07.770> large<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:10.280> the

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
can see they are so large that the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.470 
can see they are so large that the
dumbbell<00:00:12.330> actually<00:00:13.730> sticks<00:00:14.730> out<00:00:14.940> at<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.330> end

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
dumbbell actually sticks out at the end

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.510 
dumbbell actually sticks out at the end
of<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.719> stand<00:00:16.109> there<00:00:16.410> but<00:00:17.900> you<00:00:18.900> know<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.199> any

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
of the stand there but you know for any

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.470 
of the stand there but you know for any
activity<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.550> you'd<00:00:20.730> be<00:00:20.850> doing<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.330> would

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
activity that you'd be doing that would

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.380 
activity that you'd be doing that would
require<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:22.260> heavy<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:23.340> dumbbell<00:00:23.880> you're

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
require that heavy of a dumbbell you're

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.550 
require that heavy of a dumbbell you're
probably<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:25.260> length<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:27.560> dumbbell

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
probably the length of the the dumbbell

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.009 
probably the length of the the dumbbell
is<00:00:28.740> not<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> factor<00:00:29.460> but<00:00:30.300> anyway<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.660> just<00:00:30.750> want

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
is not a factor but anyway I just want

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.209 
is not a factor but anyway I just want
to<00:00:31.080> show<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.320> couple<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.590> things<00:00:31.740> here<00:00:31.949> on

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
to show you a couple of things here on

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.979 
to show you a couple of things here on
the<00:00:32.579> big<00:00:33.480> block<00:00:33.780> which<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.710> weights

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
the big block which is the weights

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:42.080 
the big block which is the weights
basically<00:00:37.969> above<00:00:38.969> 90<00:00:39.270> pounds<00:00:40.579> it<00:00:41.579> uses<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
basically above 90 pounds it uses a

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.170 
basically above 90 pounds it uses a
slightly<00:00:42.420> different<00:00:42.629> system<00:00:43.200> than<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
slightly different system than the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.360 
slightly different system than the
selector<00:00:45.710> pin<00:00:46.710> there<00:00:48.710> you<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.920> use<00:00:49.950> this

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
selector pin there you have to use this

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.400 
selector pin there you have to use this
big<00:00:50.610> block<00:00:50.850> retaining<00:00:51.059> pin<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:52.110> kind<00:00:52.379> of

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
big block retaining pin this kind of

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.850 
big block retaining pin this kind of
acts<00:00:52.590> as<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> double<00:00:53.219> safety<00:00:54.289> because<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.559> so

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
acts as a double safety because it is so

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.340 
acts as a double safety because it is so
heavy<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.460> large<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.109> see

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
heavy and so large but you can see

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.150 
heavy and so large but you can see
there's<00:00:58.789> that's<00:01:00.289> for<00:01:01.289> one<00:01:01.440> plate<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:02.010> that's

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
there's that's for one plate but that's

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.799 
there's that's for one plate but that's
for<00:01:02.340> another<00:01:02.370> plate<00:01:02.760> that's<00:01:02.969> for<00:01:03.180> another

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
for another plate that's for another

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.000 
for another plate that's for another
plate<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.260> depending<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.650> which<00:01:04.769> hole<00:01:04.979> you

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
plate and depending on which hole you

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.160 
plate and depending on which hole you
put<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:07.200> determines<00:01:09.110> how<00:01:10.110> many

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
put it in that determines how many

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.690 
put it in that determines how many
plates<00:01:10.619> you're<00:01:10.740> actually<00:01:11.070> picking<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.490> with

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
plates you're actually picking up with

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.780 
plates you're actually picking up with
the<00:01:11.820> rest<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> dumbbell<00:01:12.630> but<00:01:13.549> it<00:01:14.549> still

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the rest of the dumbbell but it still

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.450 
the rest of the dumbbell but it still
feels<00:01:14.909> pretty<00:01:15.060> solid<00:01:15.390> even<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:15.869> there's<00:01:16.049> heavy

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
feels pretty solid even if there's heavy

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.219 
feels pretty solid even if there's heavy
increments<00:01:17.509> these<00:01:18.509> are<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> two<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> half

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
increments these are the two and a half

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.240 
increments these are the two and a half
pound<00:01:19.530> chrome<00:01:19.890> at<00:01:20.280> our<00:01:20.909> weights<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:22.590> they

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
pound chrome at our weights and they

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.749 
pound chrome at our weights and they
give<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.700> basically<00:01:25.580> some<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
give you basically some of the

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.880 
give you basically some of the
in-between<00:01:26.939> weights<00:01:27.780> that's<00:01:28.140> my<00:01:28.470> cameras

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
in-between weights that's my cameras

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.920 
in-between weights that's my cameras
probably<00:01:29.159> blowing<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.579> but<00:01:29.759> uh<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:30.630> know<00:01:30.720> it

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
probably blowing that but uh you know it

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.510 
probably blowing that but uh you know it
weights<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.290> seventeen<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.950> half<00:01:32.130> pounds

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
weights like seventeen and a half pounds

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.819 
weights like seventeen and a half pounds
27<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.240> half<00:01:33.270> 37<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.680> so

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
27 and a half 37 I have and so on and so

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.660 
27 and a half 37 I have and so on and so
on<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.090> it<00:01:36.090> really<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.750> really<00:01:37.170> get

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
on so it really you can really get

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.679 
on so it really you can really get
exactly<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.820> weight<00:01:38.970> you're<00:01:39.090> looking<00:01:39.450> for

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
exactly the weight you're looking for

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.850 
exactly the weight you're looking for
with<00:01:39.840> these<00:01:40.759> and<00:01:42.439> to<00:01:43.439> put<00:01:43.590> them<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.770> you

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
with these and to put them in you

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.580 
with these and to put them in you
basically<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.430> pop<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.360> switch<00:01:46.140> into<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
basically just pop the switch into the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.649 
basically just pop the switch into the
open<00:01:46.860> position<00:01:47.329> drop<00:01:48.329> them<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.630> there<00:01:50.659> close

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
open position drop them in there close

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.929 
open position drop them in there close
it<00:01:51.689> with<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.079> level<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.770> lever<00:01:53.610> just

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
it with that level that lever just

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.709 
it with that level that lever just
basically<00:01:54.710> lower<00:01:55.710> tourism<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.640> place<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.299> metal

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
basically lower tourism to place a metal

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.899 
basically lower tourism to place a metal
plate<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.049> holds<00:01:58.469> them<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.619> there<00:01:58.950> could<00:01:59.790> be

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
plate that holds them in there could be

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.600 
plate that holds them in there could be
a<00:01:59.939> little<00:02:00.060> bit<00:02:00.240> loud<00:02:00.479> but<00:02:01.439> it's<00:02:01.979> not<00:02:02.130> too<00:02:02.340> bad

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
a little bit loud but it's not too bad

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:10.270 
a little bit loud but it's not too bad
actually<00:02:02.790> I'll<00:02:03.060> show<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.479> real<00:02:03.630> quickly

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.260 

that's<00:02:11.280> about<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:11.550> extent<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.060> noise

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
that's about the extent of the noise

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.950 
that's about the extent of the noise
fournette<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:14.390> again<00:02:15.390> these<00:02:15.540> are<00:02:15.690> just<00:02:15.720> the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
fournette so again these are just the

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.300 
fournette so again these are just the
power<00:02:16.140> block<00:02:17.300> 130s<00:02:18.650> pretty<00:02:19.650> nice<00:02:19.830> product

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
power block 130s pretty nice product

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.510 
power block 130s pretty nice product
very<00:02:20.730> solid<00:02:21.300> it's<00:02:21.960> pretty<00:02:22.260> pretty<00:02:22.980> amazing

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
very solid it's pretty pretty amazing
