00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 another quick view to which you mention 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 Agustin Herrera the tattoo artist who is not 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.280
 in this commitment takes the victory to 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.469
 the three points gives you also the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.460
 possibility of continuing there in the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.180
 first place in the table of placements 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:24.480
 We salute the Mexican and well there 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.789
 satisfaction of being able to reach 13 points 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.590
 in the first place 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.590
 it has been working well individual 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:44.860
 again a basis for the team 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.300
 I have shared 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.280
 very well I think we also had 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.270
 several goal opportunities though 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.550
 also the team is very hard but 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.219
 good 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.129
 whether it's my partner's turn 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.370
 we have to take advantage of the constant 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.370
 communication 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.790
 always win out of local and good 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:17.780
 for that we work 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:20.460
 the Mexican then faster than 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.290
 There is no doubt that we must rethink 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.649
 things you have to analyze very well what 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.649
 what is happening 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.560
 to work in the week 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.790
 I do not think we get complicated 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.030
 and we do not know 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.350
 at the time of tightening and trying to adjust 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.240
 the one that we spread the details for 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.710
 front but the important thing is that 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.230
 we returned the sea of three in our 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.650
 court and now to rest prepared 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.650
 for what is coming 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.750
 even though it has been a tournament with 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.980
 much game followed the team follows 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.360
 showing that he is physically okay 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:03.750
 keep running and I think it's important 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.500
 keep attending feels happy as 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.250
 I said it 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.590
 I also like the role that I play 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.600
 do within the team 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.640
 we will contribute today I had to attend 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:21.480
 Augustine and I think he deserved it for him 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.480
 because he is a striker who beat you 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.800
 the pressure of the rival work in the 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.140
 week because we know that all 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.569
 matches for back but thanks to pass 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.819
 de manuel contreras the group of 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.100
 petapa players let's see the 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.830
 possibility of at least 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.050
 listen to one of the elements of the 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.360
 petapa team because it has 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.420
 stayed with july van they is the 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.810
 player that our naughty and what not 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.810
 we hear 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:08.569
 we have to work hard to do 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:10.200
 things to new moments 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.330
 Club circumstances situation 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.960
 also with communications and pins 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.990
 thank you very much 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.990
 we lost that now we have to think about 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:25.050
 the next match in enforcing 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.820
 our locality and try to take advantage 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.920
 the opportunities since we had but 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.170
 we specify emotions not true 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.820
 now we plan to use part of what I 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.090
 I told you what you think happened because 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.090
 lost 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.070
 we work 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.300
 and communication 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.110
 we are going to attack them precisely 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.110
 it does not have other 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.260
 many yellow the petapa team 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.260
 both at home and visiting 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:28.190
 but next 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.190
 is the forward of the petapa team 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:39.150
 in the part of the southern part of the stadium 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:43.430
 of the stadium progress cements and people 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.430
 communications has also returned for 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.720
 enjoy this victory a cavill way 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.230
 the safe area of the capital won the 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.940
 three more than 10 to petapa neighborhood we think 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.790
 that his person with elena disciplines of 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.860
 this one of the howitzer of the night 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.860
 equally thank you then 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.760
 key play 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.460
 Augustine Herrera Ugarte 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:15.220
 the same Agustín Herrera with this touch 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.350
 preliminary on deliveries is attempted 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.390
 Roberto Cobas does not make contact with the 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.540
 local ball we can find 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:28.090
 a strong finish crossed with precision and 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:30.870
 power the action totally in this 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.870
 case for the goalkeeper 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:35.870
 application is somewhat against zero that 

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:40.230
 the start of the sector 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:43.230
 communications the practice dealt with 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.600
 party out more than it will come to another 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.450
 type of interventions but the 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.670
 goalkeeper in some cases and the lack 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.630
 of precision in some others the 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:56.040
 complication of what he did he will not achieve 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.260
 increase the account is on behalf of 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.450
 publio banegas tries to put his foot 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.270
 with the inner face so that he leaves 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.550
 closing in and being able to see being 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.250
 finally the goalkeeper wall is something 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.650
 that does not happen between manuel soto archila 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.240
 in the income in the second time and 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.150
 between the income also from orvelio 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.730
 mazariegos to communications like that 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.710
 they indigestaron those changes because they 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.380
 they were able to achieve those 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.720
 contain them and that was already a concern 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.720
 this move to stay the last 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.720
 movement of lovato to that of forced it 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.550
 to assist another player who was not 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.970
 finally josé manuel contreras that he 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.860
 I asked for the ball alone but that 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.290
 gives him time to attend what 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.820
 try for zeballos that was no longer what 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:44.490
 Right 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.930
 that way, that ball is deflected 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.510
 part of manuel software they throw to the 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.400
 users we reiterate to you of those who 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.200
 they tried to have a correct reading 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.330
 of the party but they did not have 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.180
 effectiveness we also saw the 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:59.130
 admonition towards sao paolo dog 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:03.030
 Suarez in the match statistics 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:05.160
 in that number diagram and summarize how 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.720
 it will be possible to observe what it is that 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.280
 end of accounts end up happening 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.070
 so that communication not only wins a 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.720
 match but also keep 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.430
 firm in the artur leader six shots at 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.950
 finally arc of communication in 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.690
 against 3 of petapa 7 corner shots 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.240
 for communications set 5 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.730
 for peta for 13 faults 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.670
 communications for warnings 

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:29.550
 of miranda marquez and suárez are among the 

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:33.030
 20 petapa fouls five cautioned from 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.950
 dicastillo novato orellana aceituno and 

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.960
 mazariegos no one was expelled in the 

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.670
 6 game out for the 

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.980
 petapa set included the controversial 

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.240
 I wanted to finish an annotation and not a 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.910
 alone for the set of communications 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.889
 that we reiterate the leader with 10 points 

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:49.199
 with 13 points 

00:07:46.889 --> 00:07:51.780
 and it's for the old set 

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:54.780
 guatemala pending and is still halfway 

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.939
 time to end the match between 

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:59.009
 xelajú mario camposeco and the set of 

00:07:56.939 --> 00:08:01.259
 hawks is winning the set of 

00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:02.819
 xelajú somewhat against zero in form 

00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:05.520
 momentary with which it would reach a 

00:08:02.819 --> 00:08:06.960
 total of seven very many units 

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:11.449
 thank you for the favor of your attention as 

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.449
 always very good night and pass lante
