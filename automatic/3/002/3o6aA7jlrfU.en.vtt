00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.890
 Good day, dear viewer 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.310
 my name is Andrei and this is the apple guide channel 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.529
 ips 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.230
 every week we do the best reviews 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.510
 applications so you know what it's worth 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.400
 pay attention and did not miss 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.830
 some useful program or 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.450
 exciting game we have already considered 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.550
 no ordinary calculator 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.469
 who understands handwriting and 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.640
 excellent program to learn 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.890
 foreign languages 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.410
 it's time to talk developing 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.539
 games in this issue we will meet 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.390
 interesting origami puzzle 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.090
 called anna piper gram or by 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.629
 our dad's frame on our desktop 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.649
 encounters an icon with the name of the application 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.960
 launched by pape frame 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.100
 very nicely decorated loading 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.620
 home page 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.640
 here we can turn the sound off and on 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.790
 top right 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.260
 awesome music programs 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.420
 accompaniment is created necessary for 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.380
 reflection atmosphere from below 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.799
 info is a summary of 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:21.630
 developers achievements are marked 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:24.689
 our progress in passing the game 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.659
 the store for real money can be 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.970
 buy tips game is fascinating but 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.720
 not at all easy for the authors 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.079
 enjoy go to levels page 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.409
 the game has three sets of 24 levels that is 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.570
 we have to fold 72 origami figures from 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.270
 most elementary yes very very 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.979
 complex open the first set for 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.640
 the correct passage of the level we 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.710
 we get stars from 1 to 3 new tasks 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.590
 Sets open only when 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.890
 successful previous previous 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.469
 learning levels let's see them and 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.710
 learn how to play this game on the sheet 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.110
 colored paper dotted whether 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.569
 and marked the figure you need 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.180
 fold make it necessary for 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.090
 a certain number of folds left 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.819
 there is a special graph limit there we see 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.430
 that you need to fold a triangle for 1 fold 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.310
 if we make a mistake we exhaust 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.890
 limit allowed paper turns gray 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.380
 we lose click on the reset button 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.690
 to start over the count bends 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.340
 shows how much we have already done 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.040
 let's collect this triangle in the graph points 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:42.470
 percentages are shown how accurately 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:46.910
 we fold the figure ready to lay down 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.370
 ideally we get 99 percent and 3 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.519
 stars 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.530
 move on to the second task 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.530
 here for only 20 gebo you need to collect 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:02.440
 quadro 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:05.420
 made 1 fold and finish the second figure 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.500
 process, pry on interest to 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.299
 see how well you do 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.140
 perfect one hundred percent and 3 stars 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:18.500
 move on the job gradually 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.560
 become complicated now for 3 fold need 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.750
 fold a small triangle if 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.620
 did some action and see what 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.680
 deadlocked 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.239
 that nothing good happens 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.739
 use the cancel button to 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.560
 go back a step 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.920
 orange level button brings us back 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.780
 set 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.450
 where can we choose some other 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.890
 Now let's choose a more complex figure. 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:47.250
 figure for example at number 19 for 6 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.220
 fold it is necessary to lay down just such an arch of 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.730
 it's not just let's say we are trying 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.370
 trying to add up and understand 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.640
 that this is beyond our intellectual powers 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.160
 abilities decide to use 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.370
 I have not yet used hints 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.950
 so points help a lot as many as 6 pieces 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.410
 press the hint button program 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.540
 makes the right fold one point 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.790
 help we lost now again 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.459
 we depict a violent activity and again 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.489
 let's go to a dead end we donâ€™t know how to assemble this 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.550
 archway and even forgot what told us 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.490
 program click on the help and choose 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.010
 item pre prompt this returns all 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.560
 at the time when the program helped 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.110
 we can now continue thinking 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.510
 in time and trying to assemble a figure we 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.030
 not limited if you use everything 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.600
 available hints for the new will have 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.370
 to pay 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.190
 Well, if you perform the task without 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.919
 tips game will make a pleasant surprise 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.820
 will give tips for the future because the figure 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.500
 in the game a lot and they are harder and harder 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.750
 I want to show you some 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.729
 figures from different sets which are bigger 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.180
 I just liked and made 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.450
 fairly break the brain of papa's frame 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.789
 addictive 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.570
 and very exciting game and what else 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:08.340
 very important it develops thinking 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.470
 spatial imagination here is one of 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.600
 secrets that I discovered for myself 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.150
 first imagine mentally how 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.669
 stack any of the figures right in your 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.770
 this paper is not important 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.630
 how many folds just build in 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.850
 imagination what is dotted 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.610
 on the screen and only after that 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.039
 proceed to the task of the feasts 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.229
 Great for playing together in 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.990
 friendly company because one head 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.580
 good but the more of them the better 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.889
 download the application we 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.530
 she is absolutely free at the link in 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:43.319
 the description of this video it fits and 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.330
 for ios and for android devices if not 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:47.360
 you will know how to pass a certain level 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.250
 ask in the comments 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.979
 we will help thanks that looked this 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.830
 review with you was andrew and channel 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:58.789
 apple guide x see you next 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.789
 release bye
