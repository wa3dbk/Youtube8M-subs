00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.419
 following with the mesh interface we 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.879
 we found another important area that 

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:09.240
 It would be that it would be online this 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:13.289
 line of icons that we have here 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.420
 represents that they are functions that are 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.369
 as quick accesses to some functions 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.470
 that we can already find in the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.689
 different mesh menus for example 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.050
 to create a new scene we can 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.050
 click here 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.509
 we tell you that we do not want to save 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.070
 but we can also access it from 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.750
 here in the same option it is simply 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.300
 as a quick access 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.580
 that is one of the functions of the statut 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.070
 line but other functions would be for 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.380
 example the selection mask the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.480
 selection mask would be these three 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.790
 icons that come here 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.190
 and this is also related to the 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.620
 selection mask and represents that 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.309
 when I work in maya for example if 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.309
 I have a sphere 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.240
 if I want to select that sphere 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.970
 completely 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.040
 some small selection window and 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.040
 as the selection mask I have 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.020
 selection by object automatically me 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.020
 select the complete object 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.800
 if the active selection mask 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.990
 components and fixed pulses that 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.649
 active 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.960
 a new way that would be therefore the 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:32.500
 vision of the components of the sphere 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.440
 a sphere a surface of type donate 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.150
 in mesh is made up of many things and 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.340
 between one of those things would be the 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.500
 cebures that are these points there 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.710
 here you can see that it will take a 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.810
 selection window as I did before 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.049
 I do not select the complete object if 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.619
 I do not select only those points 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.619
 if I move 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:00.400
 it automatically moves the points but 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.260
 I did not move the entire geometry me 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.900
 is deforming the geometry does not move me 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.120
 completely everything at the time of 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.890
 that I want to return to power again 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.780
 select the complete object because 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.780
 for example I want to position it in 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:19.440
 another area of the scene then I'm going another 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:21.900
 time here and activate the object selection 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.930
 and now he moves now he wants to move 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.440
 the complete object also within what 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.870
 what would be online to find 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.730
 some very basic tools that 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.810
 used in most programs like this 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.790
 3d that would be the snap in this case this 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.570
 icon that exactly corresponds to do 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.880
 Russian snap elena is adjust adjust in 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.070
 this case to gray to this grid that 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.560
 we have here then when I move the 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.170
 object 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.180
 the object now does not move free but 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.450
 that moves right at the intersection of 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.220
 the lines of the grit 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.560
 that's why it does like jumps 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.540
 we can also adjust a curve to a 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.540
 point or the same geometry
