00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.800 
I think that what we usually define our
company<00:05:00.889> as<00:05:00.980> and<00:05:01.550> also<00:05:01.669> in<00:05:01.820> that<00:05:01.970> place<00:05:02.210> of

course<00:05:02.990> having<00:05:03.320> it<00:05:03.410> physically<00:05:03.860> is<00:05:03.950> important

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
course having it physically is important

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.840 
course having it physically is important
but<00:05:04.940> if<00:05:05.030> you<00:05:05.120> don't<00:05:05.330> have<00:05:05.540> the<00:05:05.750> right<00:05:05.960> attitude

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
but if you don't have the right attitude

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.450 
but if you don't have the right attitude
the<00:05:07.850> mental<00:05:08.180> fortitude<00:05:08.450> and<00:05:08.810> a<00:05:09.560> team<00:05:09.860> to<00:05:10.280> work
