because we couldn't we import most of
our<00:01:12.930> food<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.700> so<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.390> action<00:01:16.020> was<00:01:16.200> to

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
our food and so the the action was to

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.070 
our food and so the the action was to
solve<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.830> problem<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.700> would<00:01:17.850> radek<00:01:18.689> ate<00:01:18.869> it

and<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.979> way<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.430> looked<00:01:20.700> at<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.090> cotorra

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and the way we looked at it in cotorra

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.300 
and the way we looked at it in cotorra
which<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.200> different<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.590> where<00:01:22.770> most<00:01:22.979> people

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
have gone is to solve the problem

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.850 
have gone is to solve the problem

we<00:01:54.799> started<00:01:55.799> looking<00:01:56.219> at<00:01:56.310> what<00:01:56.939> what<00:01:57.540> what<00:01:57.780> if

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
we started looking at what what what if

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.410 
we started looking at what what what if
do<00:01:58.229> we<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.350> any<00:01:58.619> other<00:01:58.710> source<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.579> water<00:01:59.759> how

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
do we have any other source of water how

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.749 
do we have any other source of water how
do<00:02:00.479> we<00:02:00.780> actually<00:02:00.990> live<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.159> country<00:02:02.399> then

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
do we actually live in this country then

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.359 
do we actually live in this country then
if<00:02:03.719> there<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.200> no<00:02:04.350> water<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.680> begin<00:02:05.009> with<00:02:05.189> and

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
if there is no water to begin with and

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.510 
if there is no water to begin with and
the<00:02:06.360> way<00:02:06.600> we<00:02:06.780> do<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:06.990> now<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.399> we

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
the way we do it now is that we

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.760 
the way we do it now is that we
desalinate<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.119> lot<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.479> water<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.989> we<00:02:10.560> use

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
desalinate a lot of water and we use

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.180 
desalinate a lot of water and we use
fossil<00:02:11.069> fuel<00:02:11.489> now<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:12.300> is<00:02:12.420> not<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.720> best

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
fossil fuel now that is not the best

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.860 
fossil fuel now that is not the best
a but<00:02:13.460> that's<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.820> only<00:02:14.240> way<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.690> we<00:02:14.840> can

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
a but that's the only way that we can

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.690 
a but that's the only way that we can

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
agricultural industry now that is a very

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.120 
agricultural industry now that is a very
very<00:02:40.790> daunting<00:02:41.330> task<00:02:41.810> but<00:02:42.140> how<00:02:42.590> do<00:02:42.650> we<00:02:42.920> do<00:02:43.100> it

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
very daunting task but how do we do it

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.240 
very daunting task but how do we do it
we<00:02:43.640> looked<00:02:44.240> at<00:02:44.450> is<00:02:45.410> there<00:02:45.620> any<00:02:45.710> aquifers<00:02:46.220> that

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
we looked at is there any aquifers that

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.740 
we looked at is there any aquifers that
we<00:02:46.460> can<00:02:46.580> explore<00:02:46.940> we<00:02:47.150> realize<00:02:47.540> that<00:02:47.570> our

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
we can explore we realize that our

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.170 
we can explore we realize that our
aquifers<00:02:48.290> are<00:02:48.730> pretty<00:02:49.730> much<00:02:49.850> depleted

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
aquifers are pretty much depleted

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.940 
aquifers are pretty much depleted
because<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.930> farmers<00:02:51.170> for<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.530> past<00:02:51.710> 30

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
because the farmers for the past 30

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.910 
because the farmers for the past 30
years<00:02:52.100> have<00:02:52.400> been<00:02:52.490> extracting<00:02:53.120> from<00:02:53.270> it<00:02:53.480> and

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
years have been extracting from it and

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.010 
years have been extracting from it and
the<00:02:54.920> replenishment<00:02:55.460> rate<00:02:55.730> is<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.390> quarter<00:02:56.990> of

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
the replenishment rate is a quarter of

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.770 
the replenishment rate is a quarter of
what<00:02:57.260> we<00:02:57.560> extract<00:02:58.070> and<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:59.060> math<00:02:59.240> makes<00:02:59.540> them

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
what we extract and the math makes them

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.290 
what we extract and the math makes them
self<00:03:00.050> you<00:03:00.950> know<00:03:01.100> it's<00:03:01.430> clearly<00:03:01.760> that<00:03:02.030> it's<00:03:02.180> not

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
self you know it's clearly that it's not

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.900 
self you know it's clearly that it's not
going<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.570> be<00:03:02.800> sustainable<00:03:03.800> so<00:03:04.280> we<00:03:04.460> eliminated

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
going to be sustainable so we eliminated

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.550 
going to be sustainable so we eliminated
that<00:03:05.120> option<00:03:05.180> are<00:03:05.660> there<00:03:06.140> any<00:03:06.230> other<00:03:06.470> options

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
that option are there any other options

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.980 
that option are there any other options
rain<00:03:07.190> rivers<00:03:07.550> we<00:03:08.180> don't<00:03:08.270> have<00:03:08.480> none<00:03:08.720> of<00:03:08.810> these

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
rain rivers we don't have none of these

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.790 
rain rivers we don't have none of these
so<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:10.370> whole<00:03:10.780> we<00:03:11.780> were<00:03:11.930> almost<00:03:12.140> forced<00:03:12.710> to

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
so the whole we were almost forced to

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.090 
so the whole we were almost forced to
consider<00:03:13.340> desalination<00:03:13.820> as<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.570> only<00:03:15.260> option

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
consider desalination as the only option

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.160 
consider desalination as the only option
that<00:03:16.250> we<00:03:16.400> have<00:03:16.580> but<00:03:17.150> we<00:03:17.180> were<00:03:17.690> left<00:03:17.959> with<00:03:18.050> a

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
that we have but we were left with a

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.620 
that we have but we were left with a
very<00:03:18.530> big<00:03:18.920> question<00:03:19.489> is<00:03:19.940> if<00:03:20.120> we<00:03:20.270> were<00:03:20.420> to

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
very big question is if we were to

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.650 
very big question is if we were to
consider<00:03:20.900> desalination<00:03:22.239> what<00:03:23.239> form<00:03:23.570> of

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
consider desalination what form of

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.400 
consider desalination what form of
energy<00:03:23.930> are<00:03:24.320> we<00:03:24.410> going<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.770> be<00:03:24.860> using<00:03:25.420> now<00:03:26.420> it

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
energy are we going to be using now it

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.740 
energy are we going to be using now it
may<00:03:27.650> be<00:03:27.680> very<00:03:28.459> obvious<00:03:28.670> that<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.239> country<00:03:29.480> luck

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
may be very obvious that a country luck

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.010 
may be very obvious that a country luck
guitar<00:03:30.080> would<00:03:30.320> go<00:03:31.040> and<00:03:31.300> exploit<00:03:32.300> its<00:03:32.540> natural

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
guitar would go and exploit its natural

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.650 
guitar would go and exploit its natural
resources<00:03:33.370> gas<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.670> oil<00:03:34.730> that<00:03:34.970> it<00:03:35.120> has<00:03:35.360> in

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.160 
resources gas and oil that it has in
abundance<00:03:35.830> in<00:03:36.830> order<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.209> burn<00:03:38.209> it<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:38.630> get

abundance in order to burn it and get

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.810 
abundance in order to burn it and get
the<00:03:39.320> necessary<00:03:39.500> energy<00:03:39.950> for<00:03:40.370> desalination

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
the necessary energy for desalination

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.580 
the necessary energy for desalination
but<00:03:41.239> instead<00:03:41.600> we<00:03:41.810> want<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.200> opposite

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
but instead we want the opposite

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.630 
but instead we want the opposite
direction<00:03:43.060> we<00:03:44.140> looked<00:03:45.140> at<00:03:45.350> do<00:03:46.040> we<00:03:46.160> have<00:03:46.400> a

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
direction we looked at do we have a

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.780 
direction we looked at do we have a
competitive<00:03:46.970> advantage<00:03:47.330> other<00:03:48.230> than<00:03:48.530> oil<00:03:49.010> and

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
competitive advantage other than oil and

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.140 
competitive advantage other than oil and
gas<00:03:50.330> and<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.380> answer<00:03:51.709> is<00:03:51.739> yes<00:03:51.860> it<00:03:52.430> is<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:52.910> Sun

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
gas and the answer is yes it is the Sun

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.690 
gas and the answer is yes it is the Sun
the<00:03:53.450> very<00:03:53.750> Sun<00:03:54.080> that<00:03:54.290> made<00:03:54.530> our<00:03:54.800> country<00:03:55.100> very

all<00:04:18.230> we<00:04:18.530> need<00:04:18.739> is<00:04:18.919> about<00:04:19.280> eighteen<00:04:19.730> hundred

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
all we need is about eighteen hundred

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.480 
all we need is about eighteen hundred
megawatts<00:04:20.450> of<00:04:20.660> power<00:04:20.870> to<00:04:21.770> provide<00:04:22.220> enough

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
megawatts of power to provide enough

million

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.870 
million
metres<00:04:25.110> of<00:04:25.230> water<00:04:25.260> then<00:04:26.190> we<00:04:26.340> will<00:04:26.460> distribute

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
metres of water then we will distribute

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.790 
metres of water then we will distribute
to<00:04:27.210> all<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.540> farmers<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.380> what<00:04:28.560> we're<00:04:28.710> going

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
to all the farmers and what we're going

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.380 
to all the farmers and what we're going
to<00:04:28.890> tell<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.190> farmers<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.670> do<00:04:29.790> is<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.120> stop

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
to tell the farmers to do is to stop

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.570 
to tell the farmers to do is to stop
using<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:30.840> aquifers<00:04:31.290> because<00:04:32.160> I<00:04:32.310> ought<00:04:32.550> to

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580

we don't have food and we don't have
water<00:04:38.790> and<00:04:39.470> we're<00:04:40.470> extremely<00:04:40.860> vulnerable<00:04:41.130> to

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
any shock but how do we treat that we

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.100 
any shock but how do we treat that we
treated<00:04:44.100> it<00:04:44.190> by<00:04:44.400> saying<00:04:44.760> okay<00:04:45.180> we<00:04:45.480> can<00:04:45.690> go<00:04:45.720> down

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
treated it by saying okay we can go down

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.600 
treated it by saying okay we can go down
the<00:04:46.140> route<00:04:46.380> of<00:04:46.530> desalination<00:04:46.830> but<00:04:47.310> it<00:04:47.400> has<00:04:47.580> to

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
the route of desalination but it has to

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.940 
the route of desalination but it has to
be<00:04:47.760> also<00:04:47.970> similar<00:04:48.420> principles<00:04:48.930> and<00:04:49.140> if<00:04:49.800> we

be also similar principles and if we

be also similar principles and if we
were<00:04:50.160> to<00:04:50.270> need<00:04:51.270> any<00:04:51.540> energy<00:04:52.020> for<00:04:52.290> the

Qatar<00:04:59.190> is<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.640> Sun<00:04:59.850> and<00:05:00.090> that's<00:05:00.480> what<00:05:00.660> we<00:05:00.750> did

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
Qatar is the Sun and that's what we did

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.110 
Qatar is the Sun and that's what we did
it<00:05:01.050> very<00:05:01.320> simple<00:05:01.800> but<00:05:02.430> when<00:05:02.610> we<00:05:02.730> go<00:05:02.880> down

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
it very simple but when we go down

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.850 
it very simple but when we go down
stream<00:05:03.540> beyond<00:05:03.960> desalination<00:05:04.530> where<00:05:04.770> we

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
stream beyond desalination where we

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.980 
stream beyond desalination where we
distribute<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.520> water<00:05:05.700> to<00:05:05.910> farmers<00:05:06.330> we<00:05:06.810> want

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
distribute the water to farmers we want

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.210 
distribute the water to farmers we want
to<00:05:07.110> make<00:05:07.260> sure<00:05:07.290> that<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.710> farmers<00:05:08.070> are

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
to make sure that the farmers are

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.450 
to make sure that the farmers are
adopting<00:05:08.700> 21st<00:05:09.240> century<00:05:10.130> methodologies<00:05:11.130> in

adopting 21st century methodologies in

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.210 
adopting 21st century methodologies in
agricultural<00:05:12.240> production<00:05:12.570> we<00:05:13.080> have<00:05:13.260> spent<00:05:14.130> a

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
agricultural production we have spent a

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.010 
agricultural production we have spent a
lot<00:05:14.400> of<00:05:14.430> money<00:05:14.580> in<00:05:15.030> generating<00:05:15.600> that<00:05:15.720> water

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
lot of money in generating that water

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.290 
lot of money in generating that water
but<00:05:16.800> we<00:05:16.890> want<00:05:17.070> to<00:05:17.130> make<00:05:17.220> sure<00:05:17.340> that<00:05:17.700> their

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
but we want to make sure that their

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.400 
but we want to make sure that their
activities<00:05:19.020> is<00:05:19.980> very<00:05:20.310> very<00:05:20.730> efficient<00:05:21.270> too<00:05:21.540> it

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
activities is very very efficient too it

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.270 
activities is very very efficient too it
sounds<00:05:22.590> like<00:05:22.650> there's<00:05:22.830> a<00:05:22.890> lot<00:05:22.980> of<00:05:23.040> challenges

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
sounds like there's a lot of challenges

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.270 
sounds like there's a lot of challenges
and<00:05:23.580> well<00:05:24.510> done<00:05:24.660> for<00:05:24.720> challenges<00:05:25.380> facing<00:05:26.010> them

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
and well done for challenges facing them

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.640 
and well done for challenges facing them
head-on<00:05:26.430> and<00:05:27.140> bring<00:05:28.140> it<00:05:28.290> opting<00:05:28.620> for

head-on and bring it opting for

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:29.990 
head-on and bring it opting for
renewable<00:05:29.040> energies<00:05:29.400> which<00:05:29.580> is<00:05:29.669> obviously<00:05:29.940> a

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
renewable energies which is obviously a

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.640 
renewable energies which is obviously a
big<00:05:30.150> part<00:05:30.390> of<00:05:30.450> it<00:05:30.570> so<00:05:30.780> we've<00:05:31.260> run<00:05:31.410> out<00:05:31.440> of<00:05:31.560> time

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
big part of it so we've run out of time

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.380 
big part of it so we've run out of time
unfortunately<00:05:32.160> but<00:05:32.669> thank<00:05:32.910> you<00:05:33.000> so<00:05:33.120> much<00:05:33.240> for
