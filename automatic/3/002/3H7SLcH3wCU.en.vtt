00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540

from<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.140> old<00:02:19.530> Retina<00:02:20.070> display<00:02:20.510> now<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.870> is

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
from the old Retina display now this is

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.220 
from the old Retina display now this is
because<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> 16<00:02:23.880> by<00:02:24.210> 9<00:02:24.600> display

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
because this is a 16 by 9 display

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.130 
because this is a 16 by 9 display
instead<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:26.040> 4<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.400> 3<00:02:26.430> ratio<00:02:26.700> if<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.720> look<00:02:27.840> very

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
instead of 4 to 3 ratio if you look very

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.320 
instead of 4 to 3 ratio if you look very
very<00:02:28.320> closely<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:29.130> still<00:02:29.430> has<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.910> antenna

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
very closely it still has the antenna

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.680 
very closely it still has the antenna
breaks<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.870> we<00:02:30.990> saw<00:02:31.230> from<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.560> iphone<00:02:31.980> 4s

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
breaks that we saw from the iphone 4s

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.930 
breaks that we saw from the iphone 4s
this<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.870> because<00:02:34.200> maybe<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:35.250> antenna<00:02:35.640> is

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
this is because maybe the antenna is

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.510 
this is because maybe the antenna is
still<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.630> outside<00:02:37.020> maybe<00:02:37.680> we<00:02:38.040> will<00:02:38.250> see<00:02:38.310> a

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
still on the outside maybe we will see a

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.430 
still on the outside maybe we will see a
death<00:02:38.730> grip<00:02:38.910> maybe<00:02:39.300> not<00:02:39.540> we<00:02:39.900> just<00:02:40.140> have<00:02:40.290> to

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
death grip maybe not we just have to

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.370 
death grip maybe not we just have to
