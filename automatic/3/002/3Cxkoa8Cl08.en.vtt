truck wallets in the air if you go off a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.920 
truck wallets in the air if you go off a
jump<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.890> your<00:00:44.190> truck<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.580> fine<00:00:44.850> nose<00:00:45.450> high

jump and your truck is fine nose high
you<00:00:46.920> need<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.250> tap<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.850> brake<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.330> lower<00:00:48.930> the

you need to tap the brake and lower the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.229 
you need to tap the brake and lower the
front<00:00:49.410> end<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.800> all<00:00:50.100> four<00:00:50.430> tires<00:00:50.790> hit<00:00:51.150> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
front end so all four tires hit the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.710 
front end so all four tires hit the
ground<00:00:51.449> at<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.690> same<00:00:51.900> time<00:00:52.489> if<00:00:53.489> your<00:00:53.670> truck<00:00:54.000> is

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
ground at the same time if your truck is

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.299 
ground at the same time if your truck is
flying<00:00:55.170> through<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.530> air<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.070> looks<00:00:56.280> like

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
flying through the air and it looks like

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.370 
flying through the air and it looks like
it's<00:00:56.400> going<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.790> hit<00:00:57.000> nose<00:00:57.360> first<00:00:57.810> what<00:00:58.290> you

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
it's going to hit nose first what you

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.350 
it's going to hit nose first what you
need<00:00:58.560> to<00:00:58.590> do<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.800> give<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.220> throttle<00:00:59.550> until<00:01:00.030> it

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
need to do is give it throttle until it

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.990 
need to do is give it throttle until it
levels<00:01:00.570> out<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.200> again<00:01:01.980> allow<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.430> hit<00:01:02.820> with

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
levels out and again allow to hit with

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.660 
levels out and again allow to hit with
all<00:01:03.210> four<00:01:03.600> tires<00:01:03.960> at<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.500> same<00:01:04.710> time<00:01:04.979> this

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
all four tires at the same time this

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.310 
all four tires at the same time this
allows<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.149> suspension<00:01:06.690> to<00:01:06.810> do<00:01:06.930> its<00:01:07.110> job

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
allows the suspension to do its job

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.889 
allows the suspension to do its job
completely<00:01:07.800> and<00:01:08.070> absorb<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> impact<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.360> all

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
completely and absorb the impact and all

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.710 
completely and absorb the impact and all
the<00:01:09.990> forces<00:01:10.350> from<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.770> big<00:01:10.979> air<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.390> do<00:01:12.570> it

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the forces from that big air and I do it

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.389 
the forces from that big air and I do it
back<00:01:12.930> plus<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.380> quite<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> lot<00:01:13.860> easier<00:01:14.100> than

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
back plus it's quite a lot easier than

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.820 
back plus it's quite a lot easier than
you<00:01:14.520> think<00:01:14.790> when<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.810> leave<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.290> jump<00:01:16.590> you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
you think when you leave the jump you

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.560 
you think when you leave the jump you
want<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> give<00:01:17.190> it<00:01:17.280> full<00:01:17.550> throttle<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.330> start

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
want to give it full throttle and start

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.230 
want to give it full throttle and start
a<00:01:18.660> large<00:01:18.990> rotation<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> truck<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.000> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
a large rotation so the truck is a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.150 
a large rotation so the truck is a
backflip<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.170> when<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.410> want<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> rotation

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
backflip and when you want the rotation

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.550 
backflip and when you want the rotation
to<00:01:23.250> stop<00:01:23.490> tap<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:24.479> brakes<00:01:24.750> level<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.530> truck

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560

if you're slightly off center your truck
will<00:01:33.119> fight<00:01:33.360> crooked<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:33.960> if<00:01:34.080> you<00:01:34.170> leave<00:01:34.470> them

brakes you'll do a front flip hold the
brakes<00:01:39.750> until<00:01:40.020> your<00:01:40.260> rotation<00:01:40.830> is<00:01:41.040> past

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
brakes until your rotation is past

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.830 
brakes until your rotation is past
halfway<00:01:42.330> let<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.350> rotate<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.010> then<00:01:44.189> tap<00:01:44.490> the

halfway let it rotate and then tap the
throttle<00:01:45.840> briefly<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.650> level<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> truck<00:01:47.100> out

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
throttle briefly to level the truck out

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.109 
throttle briefly to level the truck out
and<00:01:47.640> land<00:01:47.939> smoothly<00:01:49.070> here<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.460> truck<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.850> nose

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
and land smoothly here the truck is nose

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.600 
and land smoothly here the truck is nose
high<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.900> slight<00:01:52.290> break<00:01:52.710> tap<00:01:52.979> brings<00:01:53.460> it

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
high so a slight break tap brings it

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.370 
high so a slight break tap brings it
level<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.180> allows<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.630> land<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:54.930> all<00:01:55.080> four

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
level and allows it to land on all four

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.070 
level and allows it to land on all four
tires

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.330 

here's<00:01:59.080> a<00:01:59.140> similar<00:01:59.530> jump<00:01:59.830> from<00:02:00.010> a<00:02:00.070> different

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
here's a similar jump from a different

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.830 
here's a similar jump from a different
angle<00:02:00.460> you<00:02:00.760> can<00:02:00.910> see<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.150> truck<00:02:01.360> gets<00:02:01.570> nearly

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
angle you can see the truck gets nearly

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.440 
angle you can see the truck gets nearly
vertical<00:02:02.370> but<00:02:03.370> again<00:02:03.460> tapping<00:02:04.120> the<00:02:04.240> brakes

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
vertical but again tapping the brakes

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.050 
vertical but again tapping the brakes
brings<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:05.230> nose<00:02:05.470> down<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.280> lets<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:06.730> land<00:02:06.910> on

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
brings the nose down and lets it land on
