00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
and then that way you have like three

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.259 
and then that way you have like three
times<00:02:58.560> more<00:02:58.829> battery<00:02:59.159> life<00:02:59.189> if<00:02:59.549> you<00:02:59.969> carry

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
times more battery life if you carry

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.099 
times more battery life if you carry
this<00:03:00.540> one<00:03:00.750> too<00:03:00.930> with<00:03:01.139> you<00:03:02.540> or<00:03:03.540> you<00:03:03.810> can<00:03:03.959> leave
