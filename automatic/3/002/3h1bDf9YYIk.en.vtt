good morning today we're going to be
looking<00:00:22.289> at<00:00:22.439> something<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.630> solving<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.689> problem

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
looking at something a solving a problem

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.519 
looking at something a solving a problem
and<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:26.010> know<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.340> expression<00:00:27.230> necessity<00:00:28.230> is

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
and you know the expression necessity is

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.339 
and you know the expression necessity is
the<00:00:28.769> mother<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:29.070> invention

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
the mother of invention

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.080 
the mother of invention
around<00:00:31.349> our<00:00:31.560> Studios<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.309> an<00:00:32.579> awful<00:00:33.059> lot

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
around our Studios we have an awful lot

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.959 
around our Studios we have an awful lot
of<00:00:33.270> stuff<00:00:33.510> now<00:00:35.870> I'm<00:00:36.870> going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.200> use<00:00:37.489> to<00:00:38.489> help<00:00:38.670> me

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
of stuff now I'm going to use to help me

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.889 
of stuff now I'm going to use to help me
with<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.500> a<00:00:40.520> flipper<00:00:41.520> bracket<00:00:42.210> from<00:00:42.450> Lester

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
with this a flipper bracket from Lester

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.360 
with this a flipper bracket from Lester
light<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.879> basically<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.600> flash<00:00:46.100> it's<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
light and basically it's a flash it's a

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.000 
light and basically it's a flash it's a
flash<00:00:47.610> holder<00:00:48.260> but<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.440> one<00:00:49.680> has<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
flash holder but this one has the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
flash holder but this one has the
advantage<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.329> super<00:00:51.719> flash<00:00:51.960> holder

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
advantage and it's a super flash holder

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.700 
advantage and it's a super flash holder
very<00:00:54.030> expensive<00:00:54.660> threshold<00:00:55.170> runners<00:00:55.469> can

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
very expensive threshold runners can

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.869 
very expensive threshold runners can
tell<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.390> that<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.539> raises<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.260> flesh<00:00:58.500> up

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
tell you that it raises the flesh up

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.619 
tell you that it raises the flesh up
above<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.059> camera<00:01:00.510> for<00:01:00.780> me<00:01:01.609> not<00:01:02.609> high<00:01:03.149> enough

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
above the camera for me not high enough

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.780 
above the camera for me not high enough
but<00:01:04.080> I'm<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.680> solve<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.070> one<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.549> well

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
but I'm going to solve that one as well

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.750 
but I'm going to solve that one as well
in<00:01:06.000> my<00:01:06.150> next<00:01:06.360> video

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
in my next video

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.000 
in my next video
but<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:08.909> nice<00:01:09.180> quality<00:01:09.750> very<00:01:10.350> hard<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.890> got

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
but it's nice quality very hard it's got

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.520 
but it's nice quality very hard it's got
a<00:01:11.040> quick<00:01:11.310> release<00:01:11.340> bad<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.390> great<00:01:13.200> but

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
a quick release bad on it great but

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.870 
a quick release bad on it great but
that's<00:01:13.680> not<00:01:13.979> what<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.189> want<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.490> talk<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.790> you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
that's not what I want to talk to you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.960 
that's not what I want to talk to you
about<00:01:15.320> we<00:01:16.320> all<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.009> same<00:01:17.040> problem<00:01:17.759> I'm

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
about we all have the same problem I'm

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.740 
about we all have the same problem I'm
not<00:01:18.180> going<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.420> tell<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.659> what<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.080> yet<00:01:19.409> and

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
not going to tell you what it is yet and

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.020 
not going to tell you what it is yet and
I<00:01:21.750> don't<00:01:21.930> think<00:01:22.290> we've<00:01:22.650> really<00:01:22.890> solved<00:01:23.670> that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
I don't think we've really solved that

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.230 
I don't think we've really solved that
problem<00:01:24.270> very<00:01:25.080> few<00:01:25.470> people<00:01:25.710> do<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.210> a

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
problem very few people do but this is a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.380 
problem very few people do but this is a
lovely<00:01:27.720> way<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.930> doing<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:29.210> I'll<00:01:30.210> show<00:01:30.630> you

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
lovely way of doing it I'll show you

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.179 
lovely way of doing it I'll show you
it's<00:01:33.390> very<00:01:33.540> simple<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:36.439> take<00:01:37.439> off<00:01:37.710> this

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
it's very simple just take off this

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.630 
it's very simple just take off this
little<00:01:40.729> bit<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.780> put<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.710> little

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
little bit and we put on a little

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.350 
little bit and we put on a little
bracket<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:46.140> again<00:01:46.470> holds<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.890> flash<00:01:47.360> and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
bracket that again holds a flash and

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.420 
bracket that again holds a flash and
then<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.750> all<00:01:48.869> know<00:01:49.020> what<00:01:49.200> those<00:01:49.439> are<00:01:49.470> they

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
then we all know what those are they

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.840 
then we all know what those are they
cost<00:01:50.850> about<00:01:52.100> it's<00:01:53.100> not<00:01:53.250> particularly

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
cost about it's not particularly

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.700 
cost about it's not particularly
expensive<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.840> don't<00:01:54.990> know<00:01:55.229> what<00:01:55.320> they<00:01:55.439> cost

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
expensive I don't know what they cost

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.120 
expensive I don't know what they cost
but<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.520> get<00:01:56.670> them<00:01:56.850> quite<00:01:57.090> cheaply<00:01:57.799> not<00:01:58.799> a

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
but you can get them quite cheaply not a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.950 
but you can get them quite cheaply not a
lastolite<00:02:00.000> one<00:02:00.360> because<00:02:00.600> they're<00:02:00.780> more

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
lastolite one because they're more

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.700 
lastolite one because they're more
expensive<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.680> one's<00:02:01.950> less<00:02:02.159> -<00:02:02.340> like

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
expensive this one's less - like

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.590 
expensive this one's less - like
anyway<00:02:03.670> I<00:02:03.700> found<00:02:03.910> it<00:02:04.090> lying<00:02:04.240> around<00:02:04.360> the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
anyway I found it lying around the

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.510 
anyway I found it lying around the
studio<00:02:04.900> we've<00:02:05.650> all<00:02:05.830> got<00:02:06.070> them<00:02:06.250> for<00:02:06.430> holding

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
studio we've all got them for holding

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.200 
studio we've all got them for holding
strobes<00:02:07.030> etc<00:02:07.780> that<00:02:08.170> fits<00:02:08.649> very<00:02:09.009> nicely<00:02:09.310> on

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
strobes etc that fits very nicely on

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:18.360 
strobes etc that fits very nicely on
there<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.940> that's<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.420> start<00:02:16.780> now<00:02:17.440> that's<00:02:18.130> got

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
there so that's the start now that's got

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.370 
there so that's the start now that's got
the<00:02:18.520> advantage<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.270> course<00:02:19.540> of<00:02:19.780> being<00:02:19.990> able<00:02:20.140> to

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
the advantage of course of being able to

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.370 
the advantage of course of being able to
put<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.980> at<00:02:21.190> any<00:02:21.400> angle<00:02:22.110> well<00:02:23.110> we're<00:02:23.260> gonna

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
put it at any angle well we're gonna

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.510 
put it at any angle well we're gonna
start<00:02:23.530> with<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.130> at<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.940> angle

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
start with it at that angle

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.270 
start with it at that angle
get<00:02:27.520> that<00:02:27.670> big<00:02:28.090> paper<00:02:28.390> off<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:28.980> we'll<00:02:29.980> put<00:02:30.190> the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
get that big paper off and we'll put the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.100 
get that big paper off and we'll put the
camera<00:02:30.730> on<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:32.730> stand<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:34.209> fine<00:02:34.420> unlock<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:34.959> I

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
camera on the stand to fine unlock it I

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.479 
camera on the stand to fine unlock it I
can<00:02:35.290> open<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.680> right<00:02:36.420> that's<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.630> now<00:02:38.500> I'll<00:02:39.100> do

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
can open it right that's it now I'll do
