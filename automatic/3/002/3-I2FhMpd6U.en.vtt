00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:11.410
 Alvaro began to decompose the number 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.410
 875 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:21.180
 tell me this first on how he has 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:25.980
 recomposed the first and the second as 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.090
 the decomposed and the last one is what 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.090
 that he has done that so weird 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.470
 very well are the three compositions 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.730
 Furniture I had would be a question worth 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.970
 imagine that we have 64 of scenes and 3 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.970
 units 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.550
 and three units 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.170
 with the units I put there having three 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.720
 units how much we would need to have 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:57.910
 875 from there not how much we would miss for 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.910
 have the 875 alvaro 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.470
 it is 875 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.720
 this is the class that we go 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.220
 that you shut up 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.960
 come that otherwise Alvaro can not think 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.090
 how much was missing you have harvard lack 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.740
 dozens of missing and how much unity this 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.549
 factor 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.549
 Y 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:52.210
 to each position directly in units 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.210
 very well you need 232 units 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.750
 I'm fine 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.080
 to gold 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.810
 what is correct 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:10.890
 of the rose aguilar and that of your teacher 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.890
 well thank you very much
