00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
you actually if you tilt the machine

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.239 
you actually if you tilt the machine
there's<00:01:53.509> a<00:01:53.630> there's<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.079> sensor<00:01:54.649> that<00:01:54.829> actually

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:55.249 
there's a there's a sensor that actually

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:56.919 
there's a there's a sensor that actually
illuminates<00:01:55.999> the<00:01:56.179> port's<00:01:56.479> which<00:01:56.539> is<00:01:56.689> really

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
illuminates the port's which is really

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.349 
illuminates the port's which is really
really<00:01:57.020> cool<00:01:57.140> now<00:01:57.890> if<00:01:58.219> we<00:01:58.460> open<00:01:58.880> this<00:01:58.999> baby<00:01:59.210> up

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
really cool now if we open this baby up

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:00.969 
really cool now if we open this baby up
we<00:01:59.600> can<00:01:59.780> get<00:01:59.899> a<00:01:59.960> look<00:02:00.140> at<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.350> internals<00:02:00.770> this

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
that three of them are filled it should

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.330 
that three of them are filled it should
also<00:02:20.180> be<00:02:20.420> noted<00:02:20.569> that<00:02:20.870> this<00:02:21.080> is<00:02:21.140> ECC<00:02:22.130> memory

also be noted that this is ECC memory

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.050 
also be noted that this is ECC memory
and<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:23.540> can<00:02:23.780> add<00:02:24.020> more<00:02:24.470> but<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.160> can<00:02:25.490> you

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
and you can add more but you can you

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.970 
and you can add more but you can you
know<00:02:26.090> mix<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:26.930> match<00:02:27.110> buffered<00:02:27.770> and

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
looks like with a Torx bit you should be

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.470 
looks like with a Torx bit you should be
able<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.430> get<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:47.730> off<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.120> can<00:02:48.240> replace

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
able to get that off and you can replace

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.300

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
aftermarket SSDs now something that I've

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.290 
aftermarket SSDs now something that I've
wanted<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.830> test<00:02:56.070> for<00:02:56.280> quite<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.610> while<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:57.150> the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
wanted to test for quite a while is the

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.660 
wanted to test for quite a while is the
thermal<00:02:57.660> performance<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.350> noise<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.340> in

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
thermal performance and noise so in

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.980 
thermal performance and noise so in
order<00:02:59.880> to<00:03:00.000> have<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.180> quick<00:03:00.480> look<00:03:00.630> at<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:00.900> I

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
order to have a quick look at this I

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.030 
order to have a quick look at this I
mean<00:03:01.020> yeah<00:03:01.260> it's<00:03:01.380> not<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.590> most<00:03:01.740> scientific

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
mean yeah it's not the most scientific

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.940 
mean yeah it's not the most scientific
testing<00:03:02.880> ever<00:03:03.090> we<00:03:03.720> ramped<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.260> CP<00:03:04.560> up<00:03:04.710> with<00:03:04.830> a

performance compares a benchmark wise
first<00:03:24.510> we'll<00:03:24.660> give<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.930> rundown<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.440> what

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
first we'll give you a rundown of what

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.670 
first we'll give you a rundown of what
exactly<00:03:26.340> makes<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.420> up<00:03:27.600> so<00:03:28.110> here<00:03:28.410> is<00:03:28.530> the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
exactly makes it up so here is the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.590
