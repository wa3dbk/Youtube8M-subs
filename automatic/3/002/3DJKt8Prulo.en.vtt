00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:14.869
 palace next to serginho 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.800
 Trezeguet to deic 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.109
 pines / mackenzie 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.109
 I want to live a normal life 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:25.880
 but the mason 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.880
 the willow regina celi 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:31.960
 and today it leaves at 1 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.420
 after many attempts the band had in July 2000 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.270
 the tour continues 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.590
 ewerthon 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.590
 I had a poster with the photo of the first people come here 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.720
 she got bad 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.720
 so early in the 10th century 3 million 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.160
 at the time that corinthians are 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.450
 the cruise on your cell phone 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.490
 and she does not 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.540
 He taught in the state. 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.460
 also a month ago 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.760
 thought to give up 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.600
 the Argentines 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.030
 just crazy 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.720
 who arrives first 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.100
 be the first 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.800
 never arrived 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.800
 I find it easier to transform 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.900
 we can not agree but it's easier 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.700
 then three more arrived 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.340
 the guy is a little more 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.910
 drew 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.000
 but life in mines more 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.480
 problems 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.480
 we are aware that a greater facility 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.370
 I mean from the heart. 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.460
 washington 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.460
 20 years ago from the leading corinthians 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.800
 among them 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.680
 one thing is you 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.680
 at the top of the charts 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.900
 the voter 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.100
 and this force 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.100
 in three parts 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.649
 I think we will see 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.649
 I expect to start 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:20.029
 went over 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:24.589
 He started talking to the press. 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.629
 firemen 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.629
 the situation of this year's election 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.719
 but the sunflower 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.719
 there a bomb 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.609
 be the first 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.789
 is loose 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:55.789
 still in goiÃ¢nia 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.049
 without this power 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.049
 the mine 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.319
 My first 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.319
 held the position 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:20.709
 the assault 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.709
 I said it here 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.829
 for madson midfielder 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:41.809
 still on a treadmill 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:55.179
 the goalkeeper 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.829
 if there is no agreement 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.889
 first we have to do 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.889
 I'll continue this way 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.210
 I'll understand what he thinks so 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.210
 known as one of its neighbors 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.330
 bless you said 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.610
 and it does not happen 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:21.439
 they must know for sure 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.020
 after very very much deceived 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.219
 I could do 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:48.210
 said he did not leave 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.520
 businessmen and I also do not know 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.199
 he is a friend here 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.949
 but then they showed 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.509
 congratulations 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.320
 a trucking truck 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.410
 the senators also 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.539
 if it does not improve 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.550
 You ask the Hulu guy with the money in his pocket. 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.189
 it was a good image 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:12.490
 there is an overlap before you get to the best shape 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:16.229
 apart from sao paulo rio grande do sul 

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:20.089
 it's also in the beat 

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:24.520
 the beautiful goal of the wing luol deng xiaoping of the English-speaking countries 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.939
 all 2d digital 

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:31.499
 are also 

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:34.499
 I hope to adapt quickly 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.819
 I'm not going to fool the goalkeeper. 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:39.889
 but is like that 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:42.889
 nothing to see 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:44.429
 of the essay
