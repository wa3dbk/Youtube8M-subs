00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:15.633
The Little Pianist

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:26.550
By Brij Kothari

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.300
There was once

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.383
a little boy named Azul.

00:00:31.383 --> 00:00:35.050
He loved to play the piano

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.800
and dreamed of becoming

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.383
a pianist some day.

00:00:41.383 --> 00:00:42.967
Every Sunday, Azul

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:44.550
went to his piano class,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.717
and practiced

00:00:46.717 --> 00:00:49.217
every night at home,

00:00:49.217 --> 00:00:54.050
just before going to bed.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.800
Azul became good at it

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.550
because he was so sincere.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.800
He would forget

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.300
to brush his teeth

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.467
but would never

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:07.633
forget to practice

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:10.050
playing the piano!

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.717
One day, Vicki,

00:01:12.717 --> 00:01:15.467
his piano teacher

00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:17.300
told him,

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.467
“Azul,

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:20.883
you will perform tomorrow in front of

00:01:20.883 --> 00:01:24.717
a large audience.

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:26.383
You are getting to be

00:01:26.383 --> 00:01:28.883
quite the pianist!

00:01:28.883 --> 00:01:31.133
Your fingers move

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:34.633
like a squirrel on the piano keys.

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:35.883
But

00:01:35.883 --> 00:01:40.133
there is something missing.”

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.633
“What is it?”

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:46.467
Azul just had to know.

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:49.383
He really… really wanted to be,

00:01:49.383 --> 00:01:52.217
not just a good pianist,

00:01:52.217 --> 00:01:56.217
but a great pianist.

00:01:56.217 --> 00:01:58.133
Vicki smiled.

00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:01.383
She whispered into Azul’s ear

00:02:01.383 --> 00:02:05.883
a piano teacher’s secret.

00:02:05.883 --> 00:02:07.883
“Play with your heart,

00:02:07.883 --> 00:02:12.800
not with your fingers.”

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.967
As always, Vicki

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:18.383
pulled out her box of stickers.

00:02:18.383 --> 00:02:20.550
Azul held out his hand

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.717
and Vicki stuck on it,

00:02:22.717 --> 00:02:24.967
a gorgeous sticker

00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:28.133
of a butterfly.

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:29.717
“There,

00:02:29.717 --> 00:02:32.717
think of this butterfly

00:02:32.717 --> 00:02:35.800
when you want to play with your heart,”

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:46.550
she said.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.967
That day,

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:50.383
when all the children

00:02:50.383 --> 00:02:52.550
played in the park,

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.383
Azul just

00:02:55.383 --> 00:02:58.550
stared at his butterfly.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.550
He wondered,

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.800
“I can play with my fingers

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.883
because I can move them.

00:03:07.883 --> 00:03:12.300
I can touch the piano keys.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.300
How can I play

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.967
with my heart?

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:19.550
I can’t even

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.050
see my heart.”

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.717
For the first time,

00:03:27.717 --> 00:03:29.967
in a long time,

00:03:29.967 --> 00:03:32.883
Azul went to bed without

00:03:32.883 --> 00:03:37.967
playing the piano.

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:39.133
The night

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:41.467
before his performance,

00:03:41.467 --> 00:03:43.883
he did not practice

00:03:43.883 --> 00:03:45.133
because he did not know

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:46.717
how to play with his heart!

00:03:46.717 --> 00:03:59.217
how to play with his heart!

00:03:59.217 --> 00:04:01.633
When Azul woke up,

00:04:01.633 --> 00:04:02.967
he looked for

00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:04.883
the butterfly sticker.

00:04:04.883 --> 00:04:06.133
Oh no!

00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:09.050
The sticker was gone too!

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.550
Now Azul

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.967
was nervous.

00:04:12.967 --> 00:04:16.217
Really nervous...

00:04:16.217 --> 00:04:19.633
He tried playing the piano,

00:04:19.633 --> 00:04:21.300
but his fingers

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.050
would just not move!

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.800
However,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.050
that did not stop the clock from ticking.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.717
that did not stop the clock from ticking.

00:04:31.717 --> 00:04:33.633
Soon it was

00:04:33.633 --> 00:04:36.383
performance time.

00:04:36.383 --> 00:04:39.050
The piano was in

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.383
the middle of a round stage,

00:04:42.383 --> 00:04:44.383
surrounded by rows

00:04:44.383 --> 00:04:47.717
of people.

00:04:47.717 --> 00:04:49.800
Azul

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.883
walked onto the stage,

00:04:52.883 --> 00:04:57.133
sat on the piano bench

00:04:57.133 --> 00:05:02.967
and closed his eyes for a second.

00:05:02.967 --> 00:05:04.633
Remembering

00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:06.800
Vicki’s words,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.633
he thought of the butterfly.

00:05:10.633 --> 00:05:14.300
In the quiet of the auditorium,

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.800
Azul heard the flutter of wings.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.217
A butterfly sat on his shoulder

00:05:25.217 --> 00:05:30.467
and started to hum a tune.

00:05:30.467 --> 00:05:32.133
His fingers began

00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:36.383
to move by themselves.

00:05:36.383 --> 00:05:38.800
His heart began to play

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.467
the butterfly’s song.
