00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:16.410
 so we need the usual square on 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:19.260
 a box of paint tassels or nickname 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.789
 from pencil and also desire so for 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.680
 start we color our box 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.000
 green color to continue with us not 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.830
 there were no incidents 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.469
 and it was easier for us to glue colored paper 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:38.550
 next you take and draw on normal 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.989
 paper 4 cells with a size of 3 for 3 and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.750
 we are such a box so umbrellas 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.780
 dimensions here but you can do a lot 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.250
 easier to immediately buy green cardboard 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.500
 green paper we didn't find ours 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.070
 stores so we had to paint 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.579
 green cubes themselves so here is a husband 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:01.680
 finish coloring our box with 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:06.479
 green and cut out the squares 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.670
 which will be the angle to our box here 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.740
 so we have turned a box you we 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.909
 stuck the squares painted in black 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.170
 black 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.960
 here we plotted 3 by 3 and now we will 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.520
 paste over 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.409
 than we cut a hole here for your 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.689
 eye 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.960
 Hello, I want to tell you how I am 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.030
 I make this mask first I mark out three 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.820
 by three 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.189
 then I cut 3 inside the squares and 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.810
 scatter method glue everything 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.229
 square 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.000
 then I cut a hole for our 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.490
 an eye that we could see everything 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.930
 what is happening here and in principle the mask is ready 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.880
 if you feel uncomfortable wearing 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.830
 You can sew in here some 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.210
 cap yes you can always sew 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.330
 a cap so she lets you not 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.130
 dangling score 1 it means head 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.929
 After all, on him so hangs out and can him 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.270
 so fall off if you put a cap on it 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:06.079
 will you keep the Crimea stable not 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.410
 will stagger and so if you 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.610
 like put likes write 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.840
