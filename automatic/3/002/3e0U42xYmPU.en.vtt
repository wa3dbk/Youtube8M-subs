00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
up with this concept and just explain to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.060 
up with this concept and just explain to
the<00:01:04.229> listeners<00:01:04.970> exactly<00:01:05.970> what<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:07.070> sure

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the listeners exactly what it is sure

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.070 
the listeners exactly what it is sure
well<00:01:08.580> first<00:01:08.909> I'll<00:01:09.119> start<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:09.600> what<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.960> is

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
well first I'll start with what it is

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.399 
well first I'll start with what it is
then<00:01:10.350> I'll<00:01:10.470> get<00:01:10.650> into<00:01:10.770> how<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.520> put<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.880> okay

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
then I'll get into how I can put it okay

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.679 
then I'll get into how I can put it okay
so<00:01:13.409> what<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.040> Mike<00:01:14.369> rappers<00:01:14.790> or<00:01:15.000> set<00:01:15.450> of

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
so what is Mike rappers or set of

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.960 
so what is Mike rappers or set of
respective<00:01:16.560> wraps<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.460> go<00:01:17.610> around<00:01:17.729> with

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
respective wraps that go around with

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.960 
respective wraps that go around with
three<00:01:18.240> main<00:01:18.540> parts<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.170> your<00:01:19.320> bike<00:01:19.470> too<00:01:19.909> so<00:01:20.909> you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
three main parts of your bike too so you

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.090 
three main parts of your bike too so you
can<00:01:21.180> kind<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.509> think<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.810> them<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.100> reflective

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
can kind of think of them as reflective

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.219 
can kind of think of them as reflective
clothing<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.600> kind<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.110> think

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
clothing for you like you kind of think

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.140 
clothing for you like you kind of think
of<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.439> like<00:01:25.650> yours<00:01:26.009> your<00:01:26.430> bike<00:01:26.640> even<00:01:27.000> wear

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
of it like yours your bike even wear

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.010 
of it like yours your bike even wear
spandex<00:01:27.420> now<00:01:27.900> because<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:30.020> stretchy

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
spandex now because it is a stretchy

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.280 
spandex now because it is a stretchy
material<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:32.130> attaches<00:01:32.460> by<00:01:32.850> velcro<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:34.110> it's

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
material it attaches by velcro and it's

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.649 
material it attaches by velcro and it's
reverse<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.189> side<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.640> reflective<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
reverse so one side is reflective the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.620 
reverse so one side is reflective the
other<00:01:36.780> side<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.920> designer<00:01:38.850> pattern<00:01:39.360> so

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
other side is a designer pattern so

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.789 
other side is a designer pattern so
during<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> day<00:01:40.140> when<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.380> don't<00:01:40.560> need<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
during the day when you don't need to

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.319 
during the day when you don't need to
reflective<00:01:41.280> side<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.909> flip<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.210> around

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
reflective side you can flip it around

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.789 
reflective side you can flip it around
and<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.920> accommodates<00:01:44.460> bikes<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:46.530> know<00:01:46.560> all

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
and it accommodates bikes you know all

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.770 
and it accommodates bikes you know all
bikes<00:01:47.040> are<00:01:47.549> different<00:01:47.850> sizes<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.570> dimensions

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
bikes are different sizes and dimensions

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.649 
bikes are different sizes and dimensions
and<00:01:49.320> stuff<00:01:49.530> but<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.549> went<00:01:51.000> through<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.210> long

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
and stuff but I I went through a long

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.389 
and stuff but I I went through a long
process<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:52.320> designing<00:01:52.710> these<00:01:52.920> things<00:01:53.159> so

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
process of designing these things so

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.520 
process of designing these things so
they<00:01:53.490> fit<00:01:53.759> almost<00:01:54.060> all<00:01:54.479> conventional<00:01:55.259> style

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
they fit almost all conventional style

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.249 
they fit almost all conventional style
bikes<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.759> fit<00:01:57.000> frames<00:01:57.509> anywhere<00:01:58.110> between

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
bikes so the fit frames anywhere between

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.980 
bikes so the fit frames anywhere between
about<00:01:58.680> 4<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.159> an<00:01:59.340> 8<00:01:59.520> inch<00:01:59.729> circumference<00:02:00.299> and

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
about 4 and an 8 inch circumference and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.889 
about 4 and an 8 inch circumference and
they<00:02:01.229> also<00:02:01.380> tell<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.770> your<00:02:02.100> bottle<00:02:02.399> cages

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
they also tell that your bottle cages

both on the down tube and c2 and yes of
their<00:02:08.160> threat<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.610> protect<00:02:09.709> cycles<00:02:10.709> and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
their threat to protect cycles and

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.550 
their threat to protect cycles and
motors<00:02:11.220> at<00:02:12.060> night<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:12.660> they<00:02:12.780> can<00:02:12.959> be<00:02:13.080> seen

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
