00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.809 
but it might not distract everybody of
course<00:03:40.389> so<00:03:40.690> that's<00:03:41.470> one<00:03:41.859> thing<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.370> point<00:03:42.579> out

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
course so that's one thing to point out

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.909 
course so that's one thing to point out
there<00:03:43.180> this<00:03:43.780> one's<00:03:43.989> probably<00:03:44.200> less<00:03:44.590> prone<00:03:44.889> to

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
there this one's probably less prone to

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.550 
there this one's probably less prone to
get<00:03:45.250> dirty<00:03:45.579> in<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.880> front<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.419> mean<00:03:46.840> as<00:03:47.260> far<00:03:47.500> as

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
get dirty in the front I mean as far as

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.909 
get dirty in the front I mean as far as
like<00:03:47.819> smudges<00:03:48.819> being<00:03:49.120> visible<00:03:49.510> but<00:03:50.169> as<00:03:50.620> far<00:03:50.889> as

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
like smudges being visible but as far as

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.159 
like smudges being visible but as far as
dirt<00:03:51.790> getting<00:03:52.030> under<00:03:52.329> the<00:03:52.419> crevices<00:03:52.900> in<00:03:53.019> that

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.169 
dirt getting under the crevices in that

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:55.229 
dirt getting under the crevices in that
of<00:03:53.470> course<00:03:53.590> wasn't<00:03:54.069> going<00:03:54.220> to<00:03:54.310> get<00:03:54.400> more<00:03:54.970> dirty

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
of course wasn't going to get more dirty

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.020 
of course wasn't going to get more dirty
or<00:03:55.630> it's<00:03:56.079> going<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.290> be<00:03:56.410> more<00:03:56.590> visible<00:03:57.040> with

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
or it's going to be more visible with

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.860 
or it's going to be more visible with
dirt<00:03:59.040> um<00:04:00.040> something<00:04:00.849> to<00:04:00.940> point<00:04:01.090> out<00:04:01.269> here<00:04:01.569> is

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
dirt um something to point out here is

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.650 
dirt um something to point out here is

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
that the glare on these the anti glare

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.900 
that the glare on these the anti glare

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
year we're not this year because they've

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.700 
year we're not this year because they've
never<00:05:54.940> had<00:05:55.240> it<00:05:55.390> but<00:05:55.570> it<00:05:55.900> actually<00:05:56.050> looks<00:05:56.380> nicer

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
on a tablet and I thought it would and

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.500 
on a tablet and I thought it would and
of<00:06:00.340> course<00:06:00.669> this<00:06:00.760> won't<00:06:00.910> be<00:06:01.060> the<00:06:01.180> only<00:06:01.300> one

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
of course this won't be the only one

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.690 
of course this won't be the only one
because<00:06:01.750> the<00:06:01.840> Nexus<00:06:02.169> 9<00:06:02.200> is<00:06:02.590> soon<00:06:03.250> coming<00:06:03.520> out

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
because the Nexus 9 is soon coming out

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.110 
because the Nexus 9 is soon coming out
with<00:06:03.970> these<00:06:04.300> three<00:06:04.630> colors<00:06:04.930> as<00:06:05.169> well<00:06:05.440> and<00:06:06.120> yeah
