00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680 

I<00:00:03.950> think<00:00:04.950> we<00:00:05.100> can<00:00:05.310> recognize<00:00:05.970> this<00:00:06.420> picture

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
I think we can recognize this picture

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.549 
I think we can recognize this picture
clearly<00:00:07.560> as<00:00:07.770> being<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.250> kidney<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:09.200> think<00:00:10.200> we<00:00:10.380> can

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
clearly as being a kidney I think we can

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.830 
clearly as being a kidney I think we can
recognize<00:00:11.070> this<00:00:11.280> as<00:00:11.519> being<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.179> external

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
recognize this as being the external

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.060 
recognize this as being the external
surface<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.650> here<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:13.980> flat<00:00:14.849> cut<00:00:15.450> surface

here<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:18.170> medulla<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.439> pyramid<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.460> this

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
here is a medulla a pyramid and this

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.310 
here is a medulla a pyramid and this
lighter<00:00:21.660> stuff<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.279> cortex<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.090> here<00:00:25.080> are

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
lighter stuff is the cortex and here are

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.099 
lighter stuff is the cortex and here are
the<00:00:25.619> renal<00:00:26.460> columns<00:00:27.060> between<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.470> pyramids

the renal columns between the pyramids

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.639 
the renal columns between the pyramids
in<00:00:31.109> all<00:00:31.380> honesty<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:33.149> main<00:00:33.660> way<00:00:33.960> this

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
in all honesty the the main way this

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.060 
in all honesty the the main way this
kidney<00:00:35.190> differs<00:00:36.180> from<00:00:36.570> normal<00:00:37.350> kidneys<00:00:37.829> is

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
kidney differs from normal kidneys is

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.000 
kidney differs from normal kidneys is
that<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.940> look<00:00:39.149> at<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.480> surface<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that if you look at the surface of the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.240 
that if you look at the surface of the
kidney<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.360> not<00:00:42.570> smooth<00:00:43.140> at<00:00:43.350> all<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.739> kidney

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
kidney it is not smooth at all a kidney

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.299 
kidney it is not smooth at all a kidney
surface<00:00:44.760> should<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.270> as<00:00:45.530> smooth<00:00:46.530> surface<00:00:47.070> as<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
surface should be as smooth surface as a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.630 
surface should be as smooth surface as a
liver<00:00:47.670> or<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.600> spleen<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.710> one<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.219> very

microscopic<00:00:58.320> section<00:00:58.800> through<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.340> same

microscopic section through that same
kidney<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:01.309> think<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.609> could<00:01:02.789> recognize<00:01:03.180> this

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
kidney I think you could recognize this

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.440 
kidney I think you could recognize this
instantly<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.439> being<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.890> kidney<00:01:05.339> because<00:01:06.270> you

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
instantly as being a kidney because you

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.210 
instantly as being a kidney because you
could<00:01:06.659> see<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.170> whole<00:01:07.680> bunch<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.340> glomerular

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
could see a whole bunch of glomerular

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.700 
could see a whole bunch of glomerular
but<00:01:11.840> even<00:01:12.840> though<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.049> could<00:01:13.350> recognize

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
but even though you could recognize

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.390 
but even though you could recognize
perhaps<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.770> this<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:18.110> this<00:01:19.110> as

perhaps this this this this this this as

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.050

ischemic<00:01:55.820> Wilson<00:01:56.820> disease<00:01:57.509> also<00:01:58.350> notice<00:01:59.130> that

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
ischemic Wilson disease also notice that

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.539 
ischemic Wilson disease also notice that
the<00:01:59.880> cortex<00:02:00.450> does<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:01.110> little<00:02:01.500> patches<00:02:02.369> of

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
chronic inflammatory cells and also

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.900 
chronic inflammatory cells and also
notice<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.049> some<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.950> inflammatory

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
notice that some of the inflammatory

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.960 
notice that some of the inflammatory
cells<00:02:09.500> fill<00:02:10.500> up

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
the degenerated tubules as well so this

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.550 
the degenerated tubules as well so this
is<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> very<00:02:17.690> classical<00:02:20.300> appearance<00:02:21.350> seen<00:02:22.350> with

is a very classical appearance seen with

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.000 
is a very classical appearance seen with
many<00:02:22.830> diabetics<00:02:23.600> but<00:02:24.600> once<00:02:24.840> again<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.650> main

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
many diabetics but once again the main

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.680 
many diabetics but once again the main
feature<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.930> many<00:02:28.890> if<00:02:29.220> not<00:02:29.280> most<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.360> the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
feature is that many if not most of the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.370 
feature is that many if not most of the
