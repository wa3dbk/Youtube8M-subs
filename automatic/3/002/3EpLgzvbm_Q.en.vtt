00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.189
 today I will explain how to do better in a way 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:16.049
 correct 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:21.210
 david baker machine for sure 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:26.910
 winning then the right left depends 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:30.330
 who pd you are left-handed believes on 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.290
 left and the dsm of the pulp yes yes of the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.860
 right-handed like me the right hand of 20 up 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.340
 they also exist in the stern then you have to 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.480
 stop left 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:51.510
 and nobody knows before a test online 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:56.700
 you do so so given that in way 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:00.150
 which I like and then brother slide in 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:06.330
 so that the script goes obliquely 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:09.330
 nor area now in this manner so 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.369
 do the manuscript peaks slide 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:20.990
 thoughts and building the left before 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:28.850
 this part of accidental failures 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:33.140
 I add a word saying marine is not the 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:39.830
 first time today that you know these shoes 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:46.130
 given in a few words to do more 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:48.979
 high you will see better say to the videos of 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.140
 white arms that this move you do 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:56.350
 so you close yourself and then reopen all 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.350
 so it will be stronger 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.910
 but obviously being able to close it with 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.620
 feet when freezer 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.760
 when you ask and there must be 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.760
 all the way citizens had it in 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:21.420
 center with written does not engage in 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:25.230
 oblique and you are a little more put the 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:30.480
 right next to the stern fim to get up 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:33.959
 the classroom is a bit difficult 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.630
 these parties will now ask you for one of the 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.630
 bad we will also ask for the video
