okay so Thomas's I know you can't see
that<00:00:24.330> but<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.510> think<00:00:24.600> there's<00:00:24.960> an<00:00:25.109> owl<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.470> think

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
that but I think there's an owl I think

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.019 
that but I think there's an owl I think
he's<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.890> Whispering<00:00:26.310> Woods<00:00:26.490> or<00:00:26.730> something

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
he's in Whispering Woods or something

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.960 
he's in Whispering Woods or something
like<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.180> percy<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.960> with<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.470> Flynn<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.640> then

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
like that percy is with a Flynn and then

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.640 
like that percy is with a Flynn and then
diesel<00:00:30.660> comes<00:00:30.929> with<00:00:31.080> Mavis<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.560> think

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
diesel comes with Mavis so I think

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.440 
diesel comes with Mavis so I think
that's<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.040> diesel<00:00:32.340> works<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.820> Percy<00:00:33.329> must

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
that's the diesel works and Percy must

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.479 
that's the diesel works and Percy must
be<00:00:33.600> like<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.930> fire<00:00:34.110> house<00:00:34.350> okay<00:00:35.070> there's<00:00:35.430> a

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
be like the fire house okay there's a

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.030 
be like the fire house okay there's a

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.819 

now<00:04:15.420> we're<00:04:15.569> gonna<00:04:15.720> see<00:04:15.959> how<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.230> spiral

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
now we're gonna see how the spiral

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.349 
now we're gonna see how the spiral
tracks<00:04:17.070> hooked<00:04:17.340> up<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.609> a<00:04:17.639> regular<00:04:17.790> taking

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
tracks hooked up to a regular taking

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.670 
tracks hooked up to a regular taking
place<00:04:18.540> that<00:04:18.720> so<00:04:18.930> we<00:04:19.049> picked<00:04:19.290> this<00:04:19.410> Sodor

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
place that so we picked this Sodor

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.909 
place that so we picked this Sodor
mining<00:04:20.130> Co<00:04:20.370> oh<00:04:21.320> okay<00:04:22.320> well<00:04:22.440> there's<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.680> bummer

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
mining Co oh okay well there's a bummer

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.770 
mining Co oh okay well there's a bummer
we<00:04:23.100> can't<00:04:23.280> connect<00:04:23.610> this<00:04:23.790> track<00:04:24.120> because<00:04:24.570> we

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
we can't connect this track because we

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.500 
we can't connect this track because we
have<00:04:25.020> this<00:04:25.320> kind<00:04:25.620> of<00:04:25.740> end<00:04:25.950> there<00:04:26.400> and<00:04:26.760> that

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
have this kind of end there and that

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.909 
have this kind of end there and that
kind<00:04:27.720> of<00:04:27.840> end<00:04:28.020> right<00:04:28.229> there<00:04:28.440> as<00:04:28.560> well<00:04:28.710> so<00:04:28.740> I

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
kind of end right there as well so I

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.050 
kind of end right there as well so I
need<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.250> go<00:04:29.340> see<00:04:29.520> if<00:04:29.610> we<00:04:29.639> have<00:04:29.850> a<00:04:29.880> little

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
need to go see if we have a little

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.730 
need to go see if we have a little
section<00:04:30.660> of<00:04:30.780> take<00:04:30.990> and<00:04:31.139> play<00:04:31.260> track<00:04:31.530> that

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
section of take and play track that

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.740 
section of take and play track that
maybe<00:04:31.919> we<00:04:32.100> can<00:04:32.280> try<00:04:32.669> and<00:04:32.729> connect<00:04:33.120> it<00:04:33.300> okay<00:04:33.630> we

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
maybe we can try and connect it okay we

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.300 
maybe we can try and connect it okay we
had<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:34.020> take<00:04:34.200> away<00:04:34.380> Sodor<00:04:34.650> morning<00:04:35.100> Co

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
had to take away Sodor morning Co

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.680 
had to take away Sodor morning Co
because<00:04:35.520> it<00:04:35.940> did<00:04:36.090> not<00:04:36.120> have<00:04:36.419> the<00:04:36.540> right

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
because it did not have the right

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.930 
because it did not have the right
connector<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.470> we<00:04:37.860> did<00:04:38.160> take<00:04:38.310> some<00:04:38.370> track<00:04:38.729> off

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
connector and we did take some track off

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.969 
connector and we did take some track off

don't just go down the spiral track
really<00:05:35.110> well<00:05:35.229> but<00:05:35.410> they<00:05:35.500> actually<00:05:35.650> go<00:05:35.979> onto

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
really well but they actually go onto

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.890 
really well but they actually go onto
any<00:05:36.460> take<00:05:36.850> and<00:05:37.030> play<00:05:37.150> track<00:05:37.389> really<00:05:37.570> well<00:05:37.810> if

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
any take and play track really well if

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.240 
any take and play track really well if
you're<00:05:38.020> looking<00:05:38.229> for<00:05:38.350> a<00:05:38.440> track<00:05:38.650> to<00:05:38.830> play<00:05:38.979> I

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
you're looking for a track to play I

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.219 
you're looking for a track to play I
would<00:05:39.430> choose<00:05:39.700> take<00:05:40.060> and<00:05:40.240> play<00:05:40.450> for<00:05:40.810> the<00:05:40.900> minis

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
would choose take and play for the minis

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.990 
would choose take and play for the minis
as<00:05:41.470> opposed<00:05:41.770> to<00:05:41.860> of<00:05:41.950> course<00:05:42.220> the<00:05:42.430> track<00:05:42.639> master

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
as opposed to of course the track master

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:56.560 
as opposed to of course the track master
and<00:05:43.180> the<00:05:43.270> wooden<00:05:43.419> railway<00:05:43.780> to

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.480 

and<00:05:57.020> of<00:05:57.320> course<00:05:57.560> the<00:05:57.740> best<00:05:57.920> part<00:05:58.160> about<00:05:58.220> this

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
and of course the best part about this

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.820 
and of course the best part about this
toy<00:05:58.760> is<00:05:59.000> that<00:05:59.090> it<00:05:59.450> is<00:05:59.630> its<00:05:59.870> own<00:05:59.990> storage<00:06:00.470> so

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
toy is that it is its own storage so

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:01.960 
toy is that it is its own storage so
then<00:06:01.040> once<00:06:01.250> you're<00:06:01.370> done<00:06:01.460> with<00:06:01.640> it<00:06:01.760> you<00:06:01.820> can

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
then once you're done with it you can

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.030 
then once you're done with it you can
open<00:06:02.720> up<00:06:02.810> the<00:06:02.960> bucket<00:06:03.290> and<00:06:03.440> then<00:06:03.590> put<00:06:03.860> the

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
open up the bucket and then put the

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.490 
open up the bucket and then put the
track<00:06:04.460> pieces<00:06:04.700> back<00:06:05.180> in<00:06:05.420> there<00:06:05.690> and<00:06:05.960> your

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
track pieces back in there and your

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.920 
track pieces back in there and your
trains<00:06:06.770> can<00:06:07.070> even<00:06:07.340> fit<00:06:07.580> in<00:06:07.790> there<00:06:08.060> as<00:06:08.330> well

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
trains can even fit in there as well

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.780 
trains can even fit in there as well
which<00:06:09.320> is<00:06:09.650> kind<00:06:10.100> of<00:06:10.160> better<00:06:10.370> than<00:06:10.580> the<00:06:10.670> other

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
which is kind of better than the other

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.180 
which is kind of better than the other
taken<00:06:11.180> place<00:06:11.420> because<00:06:11.840> it's<00:06:11.990> hard<00:06:12.230> to<00:06:12.260> store<00:06:13.160> a
