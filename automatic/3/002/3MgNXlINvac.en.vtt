00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 and that's right, that reinaldo is fine 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.480
 andrÃ© pinto brazil and today I'm here with 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.130
 the lg flex 2 the new screen device 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.929
 curve of lg 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.219
 Good. Let's have a little bit of it for you. 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.400
 technical specifications 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.890
 device as his software 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.590
 is behaving since he is 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.640
 practically a version of rg3 only 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.380
 curve and I'll show you if everything 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.109
 what was said about this 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.960
 device is true or not 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.790
 just that the LG Flex 2 has his 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.430
 favor an extremely economical design 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.420
 which together with that curve leaves the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.030
 Extremely sensitive device footprint 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.160
 comfortable as user of xperia z2 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.530
 I'm used to a block due 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.230
 mass that is the smartphone by Sony 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.570
 this when I got the flex 2 I could not 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.789
 noticing this difference in the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.340
 rear we have the 3 megapixel camera 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.949
 with double led flash and a sensor to 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.050
 laser for fast focus of images 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.300
 Moreover we have power buttons and 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.300
 volume just below the camera that also 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.519
 are present in g2 in g3 and version 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.100
 anterior of the reflex in the lower part 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.960
 we have the loud speaker who stubbornly 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.240
 lg engineers continue to build 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.920
 on the rear of the device. 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.930
 audio quality is not impaired by 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.000
 However, we have already proven this by 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.130
 more b than audio speakers in the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.939
 front offers an audio experience 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.920
 higher 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.229
 so for a smartphone designed to 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.299
 deliver an image comparable to that of a 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.520
 television curves the speaker 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.659
 located on the back does not add 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.670
 cabin value 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.130
 to 1g and introduce a 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.560
 self-regeneration in them 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.049
 flex 2 that promises to repair scratches 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.880
 and risks with only ten seconds 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.250
 remember that the first version of 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.090
 the process took between 3 and 10 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.470
 minutes 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.180
 the feature would be very welcome if 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.759
 work as I show you 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.710
 said that my xperia c2e the year with him 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.180
 in my pocket and with my keys 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.640
 Good, I confess, I should use a 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.299
 protection, but he has already 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.680
 scratchy 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.329
 in my case the auto resource 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.490
 regeneration is very worthwhile. 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.049
 but he has proven once again that 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.189
 it does not work for meetings 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.930
 considerable 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.270
 here in my test a key with the 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.210
 sharp tips the same as I do 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.630
 my cell all 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:16.540
 lg days and flex 2 is not worth saving 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.970
 say that flex 2 is 15% lighter than 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.960
 that the original reflex aimed at the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.910
 gram and has between 7.1 and 9.4 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.360
 mm thick the back 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.370
 lg flex 2 removable however you 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.170
 does not have this battery as we can see 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.910
 here going to the front of the 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.420
 We perceive the importance of 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.390
 of your 5.2-inch screen the same 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.470
 of rg3 which by the way looks very much like 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.570
 the reflexes 2 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.270
 according to 1g the curvature of the 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.640
 The reflex display 2 offers a 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.580
 immersive experience as when we are 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.800
 watching a tv with curved screen as 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.890
 if 5.5 inches could be 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.720
 compared to 55 inch tvs 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.520
 in fact the experience is well 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.410
 similar to his of 3 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.050
 even though it provides scientifically 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.180
 benefit of the curved display the flex 2 comes 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.270
 with a screen LED and the p Gorilla glass 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.430
 customized with tough glass guard 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.350
 exclusive feature of LG that 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.960
 apparently offers 20% more 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.730
 resistance than the gorilla glass 3com 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.920
 better absorption of shocks in the corners of the 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.570
 The flex 2 has a 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.420
 higher resolution than its predecessor 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.620
 which should please those who criticized the 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.990
 previous model screen 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.060
 the reflection came with an integrated hd screen 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.070
 due to technical limitations 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.160
 already the flex 2 was manufactured with a screen 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.090
 full hd with a density of 403 pixels per 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.800
 inch 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.290
 however, it must be said that the absence 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.120
 of a screen that hd leaves to be desired in a 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.580
 smartphone developed for a 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.520
 excellent video and audio experience 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.980
 deflector wheel android 5.0.1 lollipop 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.500
 in combination with interface 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.900
 optimum all the functions of 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.360
 software were imported into 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.230
 the flex 2 with some extras as well 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.390
 interesting 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.000
 the flex 2 brings as a novel feature of the 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.440
 bid saw when the screen is off to 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.410
 use the finger from top to bottom 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.540
 we can see the weather forecast the 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.280
 time and notifications received 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.280
 the curved screen smartphone still has the 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.950
 resources in the cone in the agreement but 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.780
 with large saw you have more access 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.049
 fast and intuitive to the clock and 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.970
 Notifications 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.949
 still in relation to software is worth saying 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.900
 that some native mini apps were 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:29.479
 added to enable the 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.120
 integration with wearable devices 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.370
 running the android of course function 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.770
 multiple windows was integrated into the 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.470
 multitasking and is now faster 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.259
 we also have the martins for 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.870
 use of reflexes 2 and the option of adapting 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:47.000
 size of your keyboard with the ismac board 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.789
 in relation to the technical specifications of 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.440
 lg flex 2 it is possible to say that this is a 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.870
 of the best positives announced in 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.479
 2015 good at least so far and 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.389
 packaged by a snapdragon processor 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:02.300
 810 octa color rotating at 2 gigahertz 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:04.520
 clear technology and 64 bit 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.139
 hearing this need not be genius to 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.449
 know that reflections 2 promises 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.180
 compete on an equal footing with 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:13.520
 any top 2015 release 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.800
 ram varies between two and three 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.710
 gigabytes depending on the version of 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.300
 internal storage ranging from 16 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.030
 32 gigabytes 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.949
 as well as three and 64-bit technology 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.569
 promises not only a performance above 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:28.400
 average but also with better 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:29.779
 battery management with 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.610
 performance is required. 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:32.960
 to mention in this review the 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.210
 overheating 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.009
 she has been tirelessly mentioned 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.229
 by the specialized press and the 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.259
 confirmed that cpu performance was 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:43.909
 reduced to prevent overheating 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:45.830
 you may notice this limitation in some 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:48.139
 moments like a certain slowness in the 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.150
 app drawer and when opening 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.190
 apps like google maps for more 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.110
 lg flex hardware info 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.270
 2 access complete review of the device 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.909
 available in the description of that video 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.879
 despite the reflexes 2.1 in the same module 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:04.879
 of 3 megapixel rg3 camera 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:06.860
 the software was optimized optimum auto-focus 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:08.779
 laser is also present beyond the 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.759
 optical image stabilizer 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:13.250
 the camera interface is very simple and 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:14.810
 intuitive and the details of the images are 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.789
 faithful in terms of resolution and 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.129
 representation on the front 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:21.949
 the same 2.1 megapixel camera 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:24.289
 generally to integrated interface 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:26.240
 camera does not bring great news to 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:28.639
 be self portraits by the function 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.259
 famous self as well as being able to 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.320
 decrease the brightness of images 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:34.630
 captured with the front camera 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.860
 using gesture controls is possible 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.630
 turn on the camera 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.330
 just lift the smartphone to take 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.320
 a self and close your hand to start the 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.540
 timer 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.000
 Finally, it must be said that flex 2 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.040
 has a non-removable battery of 3,000 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.190
 a million that's it 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.910
 are 500 000 to less than the first ever 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.590
 flex 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.900
 however the device has a 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:58.420
 fast charging technology which 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.880
 delivery 50% capacity in 40 minutes 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.650
 of loading up to the moment the price of 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.540
 flex 2 was confirmed only from the states 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.070
 united and linked to the operator 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.200
 sprint 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:12.130
 it can be found in 24 plots 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:14.620
 of $ 21 or cost about 504 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.090
 dollars without link with the operator or 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.460
 giroflex two should be a bit more 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.620
 expensive old model can still be 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.740
 found in Brazil for about 1,500 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.900
 real but there is still forecasting 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.790
 reflexos 2 will reach the national market 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.040
 good folks this a source review 

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.260
 flex 2 I'm curious to know what 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.240
 Did you find the new screen device
