look so much wider and bigger and just

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.840 
look so much wider and bigger and just
make<00:04:56.960> sure<00:04:56.990> eyes<00:04:57.170> look<00:04:57.380> so<00:04:57.530> naturally<00:04:58.130> bright

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.500 
pencils can be too worn but this one is
just<00:05:42.490> perfect<00:05:43.490> and<00:05:43.790> it<00:05:43.910> just<00:05:44.090> helps<00:05:44.300> to<00:05:44.390> keep

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
just perfect and it just helps to keep

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:53.650 
just perfect and it just helps to keep
things<00:05:44.570> really<00:05:45.050> really<00:05:45.170> lovely<00:05:45.770> and<00:05:45.890> natural

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.490 

so<00:05:54.170> I'm<00:05:54.230> just<00:05:54.440> filling<00:05:54.650> in<00:05:54.890> at<00:05:55.130> the<00:05:55.280> underneath

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
so I'm just filling in at the underneath

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.200 
so I'm just filling in at the underneath
start<00:05:57.500> with<00:05:57.740> that<00:05:58.010> I<00:05:58.400> find<00:05:58.670> it<00:05:58.850> helps<00:05:59.090> to

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
start with that I find it helps to

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.120 
start with that I find it helps to
thicken<00:05:59.390> my<00:05:59.660> brows<00:05:59.840> up<00:06:00.080> so<00:06:00.320> much<00:06:00.590> just<00:06:00.980> by

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
thicken my brows up so much just by

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.470 
thicken my brows up so much just by
giving<00:06:01.280> the<00:06:01.550> underneath<00:06:01.970> of<00:06:02.120> the<00:06:02.240> browser

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
giving the underneath of the browser

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.900 
giving the underneath of the browser
attention<00:06:03.110> so<00:06:03.920> otherwise<00:06:04.280> they<00:06:04.490> tend<00:06:04.670> to<00:06:04.730> look

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
attention so otherwise they tend to look

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.970 
attention so otherwise they tend to look
like<00:06:05.030> upside<00:06:05.450> down<00:06:05.660> smiley<00:06:06.140> faces<00:06:06.440> which<00:06:06.830> I

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:06.980 
like upside down smiley faces which I

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:14.410 
like upside down smiley faces which I
don't<00:06:07.250> love<00:06:12.370> and<00:06:13.370> then<00:06:13.490> I<00:06:13.520> work<00:06:13.790> from<00:06:14.060> the<00:06:14.180> arch

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.420 
don't love and then I work from the arch

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:20.770 
don't love and then I work from the arch
to<00:06:14.780> the<00:06:14.900> end<00:06:15.940> like<00:06:16.940> that<00:06:19.270> and<00:06:20.270> then<00:06:20.360> I<00:06:20.450> probably

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
to the end like that and then I probably

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.230 
to the end like that and then I probably
going<00:06:20.990> I<00:06:21.200> fit<00:06:21.440> in<00:06:21.580> the<00:06:22.580> arch<00:06:22.730> you<00:06:23.000> could<00:06:23.150> have

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
going I fit in the arch you could have

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.550 
going I fit in the arch you could have
worked<00:06:23.420> my<00:06:23.540> way<00:06:23.690> back<00:06:23.720> to<00:06:24.320> the<00:06:25.130> front<00:06:26.440> and<00:06:27.440> the

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
worked my way back to the front and the

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.960 
worked my way back to the front and the
front<00:06:27.770> needs<00:06:27.920> a<00:06:28.010> little<00:06:28.160> bit<00:06:28.340> of<00:06:28.400> lovin<00:06:28.700> that

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
front needs a little bit of lovin that

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.850 
front needs a little bit of lovin that
the<00:06:29.180> gel<00:06:29.570> kind<00:06:29.810> of<00:06:29.930> takes<00:06:30.110> care<00:06:30.230> of<00:06:30.410> that<00:06:30.650> so

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
the gel kind of takes care of that so

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.470 
the gel kind of takes care of that so
it's<00:06:30.950> got<00:06:31.070> a<00:06:31.100> slight<00:06:31.460> tint<00:06:31.790> to<00:06:32.000> it<00:06:32.030> so<00:06:32.330> it<00:06:32.420> just

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:32.480 
it's got a slight tint to it so it just

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.570 
it's got a slight tint to it so it just
darkens<00:06:33.140> up<00:06:33.290> some<00:06:33.530> of<00:06:33.620> the<00:06:33.740> sparse<00:06:34.070> areas

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
darkens up some of the sparse areas

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.600 
darkens up some of the sparse areas
which<00:06:34.820> is<00:06:34.970> great<00:06:35.950> next<00:06:36.950> we've<00:06:37.130> gone<00:06:37.280> to<00:06:37.430> lips
