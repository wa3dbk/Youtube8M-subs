00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
get a kind of a scale of how big this

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.230 
get a kind of a scale of how big this
thing<00:00:21.900> actually<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.640> if<00:00:23.640> you've<00:00:23.820> seen<00:00:24.000> any<00:00:24.210> of

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
even rivaling the PSP in size you know

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.910 
even rivaling the PSP in size you know
the<00:01:34.619> PSP<00:01:35.100> has<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.310> pretty<00:01:36.030> large<00:01:36.270> screen<00:01:36.920> but

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the PSP has a pretty large screen but

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.590 
the PSP has a pretty large screen but
when<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.130> take<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> look<00:01:39.079> you<00:01:40.079> know<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
when you take a look you know the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.319 
when you take a look you know the
slightly<00:01:42.600> wider<00:01:42.960> than<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.350> XL<00:01:43.909> not<00:01:44.909> quite<00:01:45.180> as

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
slightly wider than the XL not quite as

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.340 
slightly wider than the XL not quite as
tall<00:01:46.520> but<00:01:47.520> then<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.060> know<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.869> XL<00:01:49.259> has

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
tall but then you know that the XL has

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.100 
tall but then you know that the XL has
got<00:01:49.500> two<00:01:50.159> screens<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.149> kind<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.020> a

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
got two screens so it's a kind of a

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.160 
got two screens so it's a kind of a
different<00:01:52.409> ballgame<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:54.020> but<00:01:55.020> it's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
different ballgame there but it's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.899 
different ballgame there but it's
definitely<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:56.119> much<00:01:57.119> larger<00:01:57.780> system<00:01:58.909> overall

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
definitely a much larger system overall

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.249 
definitely a much larger system overall
when<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.299> take<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> look<00:02:00.810> at<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:03.110> we<00:02:04.110> need<00:02:04.229> to

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
when you take a look at the we need to

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.109 
when you take a look at the we need to
take<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.560> take<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> look<00:02:05.219> at<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.399> XL<00:02:05.759> burst

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
take it to take a look at the XL burst

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.059 
take it to take a look at the XL burst
the<00:02:06.329> DSi<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.380> mean<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.390> a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
the DSi I mean it's a it is a

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.550 
the DSi I mean it's a it is a
a<00:02:11.099> massive<00:02:11.730> system<00:02:12.150> right<00:02:12.299> here<00:02:12.379> it<00:02:13.379> looks

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
a massive system right here it looks

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.670 
a massive system right here it looks
like<00:02:13.680> all<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:13.890> ports<00:02:14.219> in<00:02:15.439> essence<00:02:16.439> are<00:02:16.560> the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
like all the ports in essence are the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.390 
like all the ports in essence are the
same<00:02:16.920> it's<00:02:17.280> just<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:18.409> super-sized<00:02:19.409> version<00:02:20.280> if

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
same it's just a super-sized version if

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.849 
same it's just a super-sized version if
you<00:02:20.430> will<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:20.939> it<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.569> truly<00:02:21.810> an<00:02:22.019> excel

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
you will so it is it is truly an excel

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:27.140 
you will so it is it is truly an excel
version<00:02:24.109> of<00:02:25.109> the<00:02:25.859> DSi<00:02:26.340> which<00:02:26.579> is<00:02:26.730> kind<00:02:26.939> of<00:02:26.969> cool

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
version of the DSi which is kind of cool

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.920 
version of the DSi which is kind of cool
so<00:02:28.129> you<00:02:29.129> know<00:02:29.280> compared<00:02:29.849> to<00:02:29.909> your<00:02:30.060> PSP<00:02:30.359> which<00:02:30.780> I

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
always thought was a pretty large device

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.940
