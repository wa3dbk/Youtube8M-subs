00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
comparison with legends smoothly out for

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.810 
comparison with legends smoothly out for
this<00:01:15.090> prime<00:01:16.790> watch<00:01:17.790> fine<00:01:18.030> um<00:01:18.590> yes<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:20.580> guy's

this prime watch fine um yes this guy's
a<00:01:20.850> lot<00:01:21.119> bigger<00:01:21.330> um<00:01:24.080> transformation<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.229> very

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
a lot bigger um transformation is very

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.249 
a lot bigger um transformation is very
simple<00:01:26.420> ok<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> can<00:01:27.630> show<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.700> not<00:01:29.700> too<00:01:29.909> late<00:01:30.299> as

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
simple ok I can show it not too late as

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:41.109 
simple ok I can show it not too late as
time<00:01:36.979> ok<00:01:38.450> kind<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.509> works<00:01:39.689> not<00:01:40.170> really<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.530> um

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
time ok kind of works not really but um

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.149 
time ok kind of works not really but um
yeah<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.420> transform<00:01:43.020> him<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.470> flip<00:01:43.979> out

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
yeah so to transform him you flip out

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.700 
yeah so to transform him you flip out
the<00:01:44.369> arms<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.890> fold<00:01:46.890> them<00:01:47.070> down<00:01:47.450> mount

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
the arms like that fold them down mount

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:57.170 
the arms like that fold them down mount
you<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:49.979> slide<00:01:50.369> them<00:01:50.579> up<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:54.439> you<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:56.180> move

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
you just slide them up and you can move

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.139 
you just slide them up and you can move
up<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.540> smokestacks<00:01:58.140> if<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.439> want<00:01:59.149> optional

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
up the smokestacks if you want optional

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.999 
up the smokestacks if you want optional
you<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.750> also<00:02:00.960> take<00:02:01.200> them<00:02:01.350> off<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.740> use<00:02:01.860> them

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
you can also take them off and use them

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.499 
you can also take them off and use them
as<00:02:02.100> gun<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.549> touch<00:02:02.790> him<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.000> his<00:02:03.149> hand<00:02:03.329> so

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
as gun you can touch him to his hand so

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.690 
as gun you can touch him to his hand so
I'll<00:02:03.570> show<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.899> minute<00:02:04.170> but<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.860> whip<00:02:05.490> up

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
I'll show that a minute but you whip up

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.940 
I'll show that a minute but you whip up
that<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:06.299> he<00:02:06.420> has<00:02:06.509> feet<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.140> guess<00:02:07.320> observes

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
that so he has feet I guess observes

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.670 
that so he has feet I guess observes
feet<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.239> flip<00:02:09.810> up<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.080> head

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
feet and you just flip up the head

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.550 
feet and you just flip up the head
and<00:02:13.500> flip<00:02:14.500> out<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:15.040> hands<00:02:15.730> that<00:02:15.879> just<00:02:16.560> rotate

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
and flip out the hands that just rotate

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.289 
and flip out the hands that just rotate
out<00:02:17.769> of<00:02:17.950> here<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:22.950> there<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.099> have<00:02:24.299> mini

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
out of here and there you have mini

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.959 
out of here and there you have mini
Night<00:02:25.510> Watch<00:02:25.659> Prime<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:26.700> again<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:27.939> can

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:27.969 
Night Watch Prime and again you can

attach the smokestacks as guns to his

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.319 
attach the smokestacks as guns to his
hands<00:02:32.489> for<00:02:33.489> both<00:02:33.639> of<00:02:33.790> them<00:02:33.849> I<00:02:33.969> usually<00:02:34.299> just

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
hands for both of them I usually just

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.360 
hands for both of them I usually just
leave<00:02:34.599> them<00:02:34.719> on<00:02:34.780> here<00:02:35.040> not<00:02:36.040> really<00:02:36.250> much

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
leave them on here not really much
