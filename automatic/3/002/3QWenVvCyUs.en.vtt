00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.210
 But why do I'll eopjanahyo seeing five books so suspended bullseye on snow 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.160
 I have a book . X was a table. I have a dream through this book . 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.820
 Why are you here 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.779
 Now, to do this, you have to go to college. 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.529
 So when I studied, I got good grades. 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:28.529
 So it was that much of a sexual way 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:30.029
 We will play a Film jideoni just how stark the end of the movie theater quietly Cancer 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.510
 Do not yell 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.730
 Because there was something I wanted to pick up as a wall 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.559
 I studied and I was ready for this. 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.140
 That's how I studied, and I only had a piano stool in my living room. 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.739
 I heard you just drop me off. 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.000
 I was really angry at first because I was really in my mind 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.000
 This son has to die. 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.700
 I'm stubborn with music. 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:05.260
 So did the information fits literally but people instinctively live to party 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:11.530
 If you do not talk like this and come with Aria yeah 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:13.810
 I have stopped surprised even the whole multitude watching from the side, as I stopped eomuyi Pardo 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.869
 You show me and I break. 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.869
 uh 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:26.350
 But I insist burigo go all the way now along with the honor of the Central University for example, 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:31.150
 No, but the boom can stick to despite the opposition, 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.950
 I was in the junior high school. 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:38.920
 He gave a terrible word. 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:43.990
 Or are truly effective if parents are happy to see you, you can go back on air 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.560
 See what has gone filial regret the decision flies in here these words 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.850
 He is 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.680
 In this example 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.640
 My parents came to this party've let parents are so good to work hard on the job 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.360
 It was a success. 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:02:00.610
 Through that work, it will become a dream and become a joy in life 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:05.170
 It's okay , but all the time I'm doing this, 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.720
 If you have , you can not let your son live the life you want when you see your parents. 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:13.300
 Do not you have the right 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.860
 On the contrary, I lived hard on what I wanted , but it was not good. 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.790
 I am happy. 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:24.040
 And then you were like your parents when you were there. 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:28.180
 Did not it you'll be sorry least debt burden to a child 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.950
 So if you have the courage to say that I want to do, 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.370
 I applied to 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:37.060
 For some involvement in the region has a good word for what is involved 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:41.049
 So then you were stuck three times as a result 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:46.060
 Yonsei, you were very comfortable. 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:47.620
 If you are worried about what you have to say about business things like these novels 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.969
 Haeju is no deoraguyo me. 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:56.919
 Like its little friends than matna seona yoge then eventually probably right 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:59.319
 Well, without us, our children are not the way I want to, 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:04.950
 When do you want, and I care not had a dream 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:10.800
 If only I could enjoy it and enjoy it , where is the better place 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:15.780
 Oh, but it's really, really, really frustrating now. 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.190
 If my concern is that this child wants to do something 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.930
 You know the people . 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:26.330
 If you have a dream, if you have a dream, why worry about it. 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.330
 I really would like to have a really small son. 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.730
 Oh, we'll do it too . 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:38.780
 Ohno I've been to the most off-peak. 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.780
 Out did the spider out doing musicals do you know the child well-planned
