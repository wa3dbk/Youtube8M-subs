00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
you get this into a Vitamix but you guys

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.380 
you get this into a Vitamix but you guys
probably<00:00:23.369> didn't<00:00:23.609> even<00:00:23.760> think<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.090> could<00:00:24.150> put

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
probably didn't even think you could put

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.420 
probably didn't even think you could put
a<00:00:24.420> plan<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.869> Vitamix<00:00:25.260> huh<00:00:25.500> anyway<00:00:25.980> we've<00:00:26.279> been

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
a plan in Vitamix huh anyway we've been

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.950 
a plan in Vitamix huh anyway we've been
drying<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.849> for<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.060> last<00:00:27.210> week<00:00:27.510> or<00:00:27.660> two<00:00:27.689> so

drying this for the last week or two so

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.140 
drying this for the last week or two so
it's<00:00:28.109> pretty<00:00:28.289> brittle<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.859> pretty<00:00:29.130> dry<00:00:29.460> so

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
it's pretty brittle and pretty dry so

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.540 
it's pretty brittle and pretty dry so
what<00:00:30.330> I'm<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.599> do<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.189> great<00:00:32.399> idea

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
what I'm going to do is is a great idea

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.170 
what I'm going to do is is a great idea
is<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.120> get<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> pillow<00:00:33.809> case<00:00:34.850> for<00:00:35.850> really<00:00:36.059> big

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
is you get a pillow case for really big

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.400 
is you get a pillow case for really big
sucking<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.690> bed<00:00:36.930> sheet

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
sucking is a bed sheet

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.410 
sucking is a bed sheet
but<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.070> get<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> pillow<00:00:38.489> case<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.180> just

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
but you get a pillow case and you just

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:56.560 
but you get a pillow case and you just
stuff<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.899> stuff<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.350> there

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.599 

so<00:00:57.019> here<00:00:57.199> I<00:00:57.230> have<00:00:57.289> my<00:00:57.410> pillowcase<00:00:58.039> full<00:00:58.399> of

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
so here I have my pillowcase full of

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.450 
so here I have my pillowcase full of
this<00:00:59.230> dry<00:01:00.230> brittle<00:01:00.800> plant<00:01:01.570> and<00:01:02.570> then

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
this dry brittle plant and then

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.330 
this dry brittle plant and then
you<00:01:03.969> just<00:01:04.799> closed<00:01:05.799> it<00:01:06.010> up

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.580 

crunch<00:01:10.909> it

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.060 

that's

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
that's

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
that's
it's<00:01:18.520> real<00:01:18.700> easy<00:01:18.970> to<00:01:19.090> make<00:01:19.210> this<00:01:19.480> stuff<00:01:20.940> small

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.569 

all<00:01:31.659> right<00:01:31.840> so<00:01:32.020> I<00:01:32.049> got<00:01:32.229> my<00:01:32.350> bag<00:01:32.590> scrunched<00:01:33.460> up

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
all right so I got my bag scrunched up

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.370 
all right so I got my bag scrunched up
dried<00:01:34.119> twigs<00:01:34.960> and<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:37.030> my<00:01:37.119> Vitamix<00:01:37.600> I<00:01:37.840> have

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
dried twigs and for my Vitamix I have

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.170 
dried twigs and for my Vitamix I have
two<00:01:38.530> different<00:01:38.680> canisters<00:01:39.280> one<00:01:39.579> clean<00:01:40.149> one

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
two different canisters one clean one

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.450 
two different canisters one clean one
for<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.780> stuff<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.259> know<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.619> smoothies<00:01:42.130> and

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
for the stuff you know the smoothies and

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.539 
for the stuff you know the smoothies and
the<00:01:42.960> actual<00:01:43.960> food<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.799> I<00:01:44.890> have<00:01:45.009> an<00:01:45.100> older<00:01:45.220> one

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
the actual food and I have an older one

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.880 
the actual food and I have an older one
which<00:01:45.729> I<00:01:45.880> use<00:01:46.060> for<00:01:46.090> this<00:01:47.080> for<00:01:47.350> making<00:01:47.619> dried

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
which I use for this for making dried

00:01:47.890 --> 00:02:04.030 
which I use for this for making dried
herbs<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.399> powder<00:01:48.610> and<00:01:48.789> stuff

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.510 

you<00:02:05.040> might<00:02:05.220> have<00:02:05.400> some<00:02:05.780> twigs<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.080> things

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
you might have some twigs and things

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.190 
you might have some twigs and things
like<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:09.030> there<00:02:09.240> that's<00:02:09.600> okay

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
like this in there that's okay

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.170 
like this in there that's okay
actually<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.250> closer<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.790> get<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.000> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
actually the closer you get to the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.270 
actually the closer you get to the
ground<00:02:12.510> with<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> plant<00:02:13.140> more<00:02:13.440> powerful<00:02:14.010> the

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
ground with the plant more powerful the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.130 
ground with the plant more powerful the
stuff<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.790> that's<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.390> plant<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:15.930> the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
stuff is that's in the plant so the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.930 
stuff is that's in the plant so the
leaves<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.830> flowers<00:02:16.860> are<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.490> weakest

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
leaves and the flowers are the weakest

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.030 
leaves and the flowers are the weakest
the<00:02:18.290> branches<00:02:19.290> are<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.470> second-most

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
the branches are the second-most

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.410 
the branches are the second-most
strongest<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.820> roots<00:02:21.060> are<00:02:21.270> the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
strongest and the roots are the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.780 
strongest and the roots are the
strongest<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.200> it's<00:02:22.770> okay<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.160> use<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.550> stuff

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
strongest so it's okay to use this stuff

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.570 
strongest so it's okay to use this stuff
too<00:02:24.320> sometimes<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.710> branches<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.430> twigs

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
too sometimes the branches and twigs

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.220 
too sometimes the branches and twigs
have<00:02:26.970> different<00:02:27.390> properties<00:02:27.900> than<00:02:28.200> the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
have different properties than the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.440 
have different properties than the
leaves<00:02:28.500> but<00:02:28.830> overall<00:02:29.130> generally<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.240> closer

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
leaves but overall generally the closer

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.150 
leaves but overall generally the closer
you<00:02:30.660> get<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.990> ground<00:02:31.230> more<00:02:31.500> powerful<00:02:32.040> the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
you get to the ground more powerful the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160 
you get to the ground more powerful the
effect<00:02:32.460> is<00:02:32.670> some<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.660> these<00:02:33.720> plants<00:02:34.020> are

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
effect is some of these plants are

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.480 
effect is some of these plants are
