 Hello everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.750

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.580
 name is like always here with us and I want to 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.400
 tell you something very very very much 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:28.660
 important that we opened 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.660
 108 community site at 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.929
 www.quintiles.com i piazza is a site 

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:38.350
 where we will do reviews we will give news on 

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:41.539
 various games later we will also open 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.489
 of contests and tournaments to do 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.949
 directly on the site available only 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.120
 for the members of the site terroni miei 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:52.010
 live on the site there will be a chat of the site 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.920
 made especially for the live shows where we will have 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.269
 also a random system for bla nose gen 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.979
 it's something I absolutely wanted 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:03.739
 because I wanted to make it a little more 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:05.780
 how to say a little more just instead of 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.270
 let people enter at random enough 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.760
 enrolling me who I then 10 nominating 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.290
 maybe it will lengthen the time a little 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.610
 creation of the match but not even of 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.470
 anyway, I hope these changes 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.980

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.280
