have<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.120> do<00:00:51.239> stay<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.720> the<00:00:51.840> center<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
have to do stay in the center of the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.380 
have to do stay in the center of the
lane<00:00:52.440> let<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.160> car<00:00:53.370> do<00:00:53.579> its<00:00:53.760> thing<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.239> going

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
lane let the car do its thing it's going

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.150 
lane let the car do its thing it's going
to<00:00:54.480> push<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.960> from<00:00:55.140> side<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.559> side<00:00:55.590> but<00:00:56.010> that's

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
to push it from side to side but that's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.200 
to push it from side to side but that's
why<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.370> legs<00:00:56.640> are<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.790> lot

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
why the legs are a lot

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.910 
why the legs are a lot

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
so it's going to push it from side to

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.709 
so it's going to push it from side to
side<00:00:58.950> just<00:00:59.370> relaxing<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.270> let<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.540> drive

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
side just relaxing just let it drive

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.630 
side just relaxing just let it drive
never<00:01:01.350> over<00:01:01.710> correct<00:01:02.010> that's<00:01:02.190> one<00:01:02.399> thing<00:01:02.579> that

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
never over correct that's one thing that

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.079 
never over correct that's one thing that
a<00:01:02.790> lot<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:02.940> people<00:01:03.059> do

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
a lot of people do

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.599 
a lot of people do
correcting<00:01:04.869> their<00:01:05.019> driving<00:01:05.229> you<00:01:06.100> never<00:01:06.369> want

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:06.609 
correcting their driving you never want

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:08.370 
correcting their driving you never want
to<00:01:06.640> do<00:01:06.789> that<00:01:06.820> if<00:01:07.719> you<00:01:07.840> do<00:01:07.990> end<00:01:08.289> up

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
to do that if you do end up

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.690 
to do that if you do end up
overcorrecting<00:01:09.039> you<00:01:09.130> can<00:01:09.280> end<00:01:09.429> up<00:01:09.549> hitting

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
overcorrecting you can end up hitting

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.429 
overcorrecting you can end up hitting
card<00:01:10.060> next<00:01:10.240> C<00:01:10.450> or<00:01:10.570> someone<00:01:10.840> else<00:01:10.990> around<00:01:11.229> you

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
card next C or someone else around you

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.219 
card next C or someone else around you
so<00:01:11.649> my<00:01:12.579> best<00:01:12.819> advice<00:01:12.969> is<00:01:13.179> just<00:01:13.390> relax<00:01:13.899> and<00:01:14.170> let

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
so my best advice is just relax and let

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.190 
so my best advice is just relax and let
the<00:01:14.500> car<00:01:14.679> drive<00:01:14.920> itself<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:16.420> minor<00:01:16.689> correction

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
the car drive itself do minor correction

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.830 
the car drive itself do minor correction
very<00:01:17.350> small<00:01:17.850> what<00:01:18.850> I<00:01:18.880> notice<00:01:19.359> is<00:01:19.509> you<00:01:19.750> know
