move<00:02:27.170> safeguard<00:02:27.769> doesn't<00:02:28.040> seem<00:02:28.190> like<00:02:28.400> too

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
move safeguard doesn't seem like too

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.280 
move safeguard doesn't seem like too
much<00:02:28.730> trouble<00:02:29.239> but<00:02:29.360> if<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.570> uses<00:02:29.750> that<00:02:30.049> you

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
much trouble but if it uses that you

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.580 
much trouble but if it uses that you
can't<00:02:30.560> use<00:02:30.980> moves<00:02:31.250> like<00:02:31.489> hypnosis<00:02:32.350> stunts<00:02:33.350> for

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
can't use moves like hypnosis stunts for

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.560 
can't use moves like hypnosis stunts for
and<00:02:33.980> anything<00:02:34.459> like<00:02:34.700> that<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.180> can't<00:02:35.420> put

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
and anything like that so you can't put

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.479 
and anything like that so you can't put
status<00:02:36.019> on<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.290> that's<00:02:36.470> annoying<00:02:36.709> as<00:02:36.920> well<00:02:37.130> um

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
status on it that's annoying as well um

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.509 
status on it that's annoying as well um
and<00:02:38.360> also<00:02:38.510> psychic<00:02:39.230> is<00:02:39.380> extremely<00:02:40.010> powerful

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
and also psychic is extremely powerful

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:41.860 
and also psychic is extremely powerful
and<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.700> can<00:02:40.730> easily<00:02:41.120> sweep<00:02:41.420> through<00:02:41.720> your

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
and it can easily sweep through your

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.350 
and it can easily sweep through your
team<00:02:42.079> so<00:02:42.500> there's<00:02:43.220> really<00:02:43.430> no<00:02:43.670> easy<00:02:44.000> way<00:02:44.329> to

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
team so there's really no easy way to

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.850 
team so there's really no easy way to
catch<00:02:44.630> in<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:44.930> -<00:02:45.079> other<00:02:45.350> than<00:02:45.410> throwing<00:02:45.709> a

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
catch in you - other than throwing a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.729 
catch in you - other than throwing a
master<00:02:46.370> ball<00:02:46.549> but<00:02:47.269> I<00:02:47.299> will<00:02:47.630> say<00:02:47.930> do<00:02:48.200> not<00:02:48.410> throw

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
master ball but I will say do not throw

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.229 
master ball but I will say do not throw
your<00:02:48.890> master<00:02:49.310> ball<00:02:49.430> at<00:02:49.610> this<00:02:49.790> thing<00:02:49.970> alright

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
your master ball at this thing alright

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.780 
your master ball at this thing alright
there's<00:02:50.540> definitely<00:02:51.410> easier<00:02:51.890> ways<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.130> get<00:02:52.670> it

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
there's definitely easier ways to get it

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.699 
there's definitely easier ways to get it
and<00:02:53.090> you'll<00:02:53.720> want<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:53.930> save<00:02:54.079> your<00:02:54.230> master<00:02:54.560> ball

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
and you'll want to save your master ball

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.050 
and you'll want to save your master ball
for<00:02:54.890> later<00:02:55.130> so<00:02:55.489> I'm<00:02:55.579> going<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.760> start<00:02:56.000> off

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
for later so I'm going to start off

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.690 
for later so I'm going to start off
getting<00:02:56.360> it<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.510> sleep<00:02:56.750> which<00:02:56.900> is<00:02:56.930> good<00:02:57.290> I

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
getting it to sleep which is good I

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.860 
getting it to sleep which is good I
don't<00:02:58.700> know<00:02:58.790> how<00:02:58.940> long<00:02:59.180> we'll<00:02:59.390> have<00:02:59.420> it<00:02:59.600> asleep

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
don't know how long we'll have it asleep

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.300 
don't know how long we'll have it asleep
but<00:03:00.110> I<00:03:00.410> think<00:03:00.680> I'm<00:03:00.739> just<00:03:00.799> gonna<00:03:00.920> try<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.160> get

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
but I think I'm just gonna try to get

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.190 
but I think I'm just gonna try to get
some<00:03:01.489> damage<00:03:01.730> on<00:03:01.970> it<00:03:02.060> while<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.209> can

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
some damage on it while I can

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.479 
some damage on it while I can
here<00:03:05.110> so<00:03:06.110> yeah<00:03:06.349> me<00:03:06.650> too<00:03:06.830> is<00:03:06.950> definitely

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
here so yeah me too is definitely

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.220 
here so yeah me too is definitely
probably<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.180> hardest<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.630> catch<00:03:08.780> in<00:03:09.050> this

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
probably the hardest to catch in this

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.370 
probably the hardest to catch in this
game<00:03:10.150> I<00:03:11.150> don't<00:03:11.510> think<00:03:11.660> there's<00:03:11.780> really<00:03:11.989> much

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
game I don't think there's really much

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.960 
game I don't think there's really much
of<00:03:12.680> a<00:03:12.830> doubt<00:03:13.010> about<00:03:13.160> that<00:03:13.520> just<00:03:13.760> because<00:03:13.940> of

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
of a doubt about that just because of

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.640 
of a doubt about that just because of
the<00:03:14.120> fact<00:03:14.330> that<00:03:14.599> it<00:03:14.720> can<00:03:14.840> restore<00:03:15.020> its<00:03:15.440> health

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
the fact that it can restore its health

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.320 
the fact that it can restore its health
and<00:03:15.770> everything<00:03:16.220> and<00:03:16.430> it<00:03:16.550> already<00:03:16.760> woke<00:03:17.120> up

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
and everything and it already woke up

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.990 
and everything and it already woke up
Wow<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:18.349> it's<00:03:18.770> going<00:03:18.890> to<00:03:18.950> use<00:03:19.069> recover<00:03:19.459> so<00:03:19.940> you

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
Wow and it's going to use recover so you

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.330 
Wow and it's going to use recover so you
can<00:03:20.239> tell<00:03:20.420> us<00:03:20.540> it's<00:03:20.690> definitely<00:03:21.140> not<00:03:22.010> gonna<00:03:22.250> be

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
can tell us it's definitely not gonna be

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.559 
can tell us it's definitely not gonna be
easy<00:03:24.220> actually<00:03:25.220> be<00:03:25.459> nice<00:03:25.640> if<00:03:25.790> I<00:03:25.880> poison<00:03:26.150> it<00:03:26.480> or

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
easy actually be nice if I poison it or

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:27.729 
easy actually be nice if I poison it or
something<00:03:26.900> but<00:03:27.110> then<00:03:27.230> again<00:03:27.350> it<00:03:27.620> could

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
something but then again it could

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.050 
something but then again it could
probably<00:03:27.980> just<00:03:28.220> kill<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:28.489> in<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:28.670> long<00:03:28.819> run

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
probably just kill it in the long run

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.040 
probably just kill it in the long run
I'm<00:03:29.630> good

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
I'm good

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.949 
I'm good
Oh<00:03:30.790> safeguard<00:03:31.790> all<00:03:32.030> right<00:03:32.209> that<00:03:32.420> makes<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.870> so

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
Oh safeguard all right that makes it so

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.080 
Oh safeguard all right that makes it so
I<00:03:33.019> can't<00:03:33.410> use<00:03:33.590> sleep<00:03:33.890> powder<00:03:34.099> on<00:03:34.310> it<00:03:34.489> which

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
I can't use sleep powder on it which

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.910 
I can't use sleep powder on it which
means<00:03:35.360> I'm<00:03:35.630> pretty<00:03:35.870> much<00:03:36.019> screwed<00:03:36.440> because<00:03:36.890> I

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
means I'm pretty much screwed because I

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.100 
means I'm pretty much screwed because I
can't<00:03:37.250> put<00:03:37.430> any<00:03:37.580> stats<00:03:37.940> or<00:03:38.150> anything<00:03:38.300> so<00:03:38.840> I

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
can't put any stats or anything so I

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.650 
can't put any stats or anything so I
think<00:03:39.769> I'll<00:03:40.190> just<00:03:40.310> try<00:03:40.550> to<00:03:40.610> weaken<00:03:41.299> it<00:03:41.360> down

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
think I'll just try to weaken it down

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.420 
think I'll just try to weaken it down
and<00:03:42.170> eventually<00:03:42.950> he'll<00:03:43.040> kill<00:03:43.640> me<00:03:43.819> I<00:03:43.850> guess<00:03:45.430> or

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
and eventually he'll kill me I guess or

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.780 
and eventually he'll kill me I guess or
I<00:03:46.610> can<00:03:46.850> keep<00:03:47.030> using<00:03:47.239> recover<00:03:48.040> so<00:03:49.040> yeah<00:03:49.280> already

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
I can keep using recover so yeah already

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.400 
I can keep using recover so yeah already

uses<00:04:03.440> Swift<00:04:03.860> because<00:04:04.010> that's<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:04.310> sleaze

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
uses Swift because that's a sleaze

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.250 
uses Swift because that's a sleaze
powerful<00:04:05.030> move<00:04:05.209> but<00:04:05.480> coming<00:04:05.750> from<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:05.959> too

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260

powerful move but coming from you too
it's<00:04:06.440> still<00:04:06.739> very<00:04:06.980> powerful<00:04:07.870> so<00:04:08.870> I'm<00:04:09.019> gonna<00:04:09.140> go

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
it's still very powerful so I'm gonna go

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.840 
it's still very powerful so I'm gonna go
to<00:04:09.380> Nidoking<00:04:09.799> and<00:04:09.980> pray<00:04:10.250> that<00:04:10.459> doesn't<00:04:10.760> use

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.180 
psychic and i'm going to use mega horn
is<00:04:12.920> that<00:04:13.100> super<00:04:13.459> effective<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:14.890> swift<00:04:15.890> still

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
is that super effective and swift still

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.279 
is that super effective and swift still
did<00:04:16.340> like<00:04:16.549> half<00:04:16.820> a<00:04:16.970> damage

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
did like half a damage

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.230 
did like half a damage
right<00:04:20.289> so<00:04:20.769> yeah<00:04:21.160> it's<00:04:21.340> super<00:04:21.459> effective<00:04:21.910> and

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
right so yeah it's super effective and

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.790 
right so yeah it's super effective and
it<00:04:22.330> still<00:04:22.600> goes<00:04:22.720> like<00:04:22.900> a<00:04:22.930> third<00:04:23.259> and<00:04:23.530> it's

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
it still goes like a third and it's

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.939 
it still goes like a third and it's
gonna<00:04:23.919> use<00:04:24.190> recover<00:04:24.610> again<00:04:25.590> well<00:04:26.590> I<00:04:26.620> guess<00:04:26.860> I

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
gonna use recover again well I guess I

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.080 
gonna use recover again well I guess I
can't<00:04:27.160> complain<00:04:27.280> though<00:04:27.699> because<00:04:27.849> I<00:04:27.970> mean

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
can't complain though because I mean

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.719 
can't complain though because I mean
it's<00:04:28.210> 25<00:04:28.840> levels<00:04:29.080> ahead<00:04:29.349> of<00:04:29.620> me<00:04:29.770> so<00:04:29.800> I<00:04:30.370> mean<00:04:30.639> at

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
it's 25 levels ahead of me so I mean at

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.900 
it's 25 levels ahead of me so I mean at
least<00:04:30.759> I'm<00:04:31.000> doing<00:04:31.030> some<00:04:31.539> damage<00:04:31.960> to<00:04:31.990> it<00:04:32.910> so

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
least I'm doing some damage to it so

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.820 
least I'm doing some damage to it so
let's<00:04:34.060> see<00:04:34.150> a<00:04:34.180> critical<00:04:34.690> hit<00:04:34.900> would<00:04:35.590> have<00:04:35.680> been

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
let's see a critical hit would have been

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.490 
let's see a critical hit would have been
nice<00:04:36.039> I<00:04:36.310> guess<00:04:36.490> but<00:04:36.669> I'm<00:04:36.789> not<00:04:36.880> gonna<00:04:37.030> get<00:04:37.210> it

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
nice I guess but I'm not gonna get it

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.930 
nice I guess but I'm not gonna get it
all<00:04:38.500> right<00:04:38.620> there<00:04:38.830> goes<00:04:38.860> a<00:04:39.009> safeguard<00:04:39.400> but

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
all right there goes a safeguard but

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.589 
all right there goes a safeguard but
yeah<00:04:40.270> three<00:04:40.720> bells<00:04:40.930> already<00:04:41.259> dead<00:04:41.500> so<00:04:42.599> it's

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
yeah three bells already dead so it's

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.839 
yeah three bells already dead so it's
going<00:04:43.750> to<00:04:43.840> safeguard<00:04:44.289> again<00:04:44.590> I<00:04:44.949> don't<00:04:45.639> really

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
going to safeguard again I don't really

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:47.520 
going to safeguard again I don't really
have<00:04:46.000> any<00:04:46.180> other<00:04:46.210> Pokemon<00:04:46.690> to<00:04:46.750> put<00:04:46.900> satis<00:04:47.410> on

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
have any other Pokemon to put satis on
