00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.030
 since the big last arrived but 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:20.640
 the polfer 2 a game of 1747 th 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:23.100
 century because I have 227 million times 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.869

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.660
 I repeat for all those who maybe 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.429
 still don't know why I keep on 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.730

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.620
 v2 is the essence of computing then 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.450
 Today we're going to play this 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.020
 videogame with an asphalt class 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.969
 hoping not to find a home or 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.180
 when not to find a match 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.039
 clarified because unfortunately this game 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.320
 they are only drawn to those herons who are not there 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.930
 be our 100 online players in all 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.180
 the world, and luckily there are these 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.190
 to enable him to find a few games 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.960
 however we are here today to play 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.670
 because a game a bit like old style 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.829
 given that in the comments I sometimes see 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.350
 already stopped by the alone style on call of 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.240
 duty and so here it is ready to 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.700
 please all of us also because you 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.740
 I take advantage of it because it is naked and in fact 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.229
 my favorite call of duty and then 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.750
 I can only take advantage of it 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.009
 my mom I warmed up to put the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:24.159

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:27.909

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.630

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.020
 crazy type alarm stuck on 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.670
 screen that bothers me though we do 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.590
 pretend nothing and keep playing 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.170
 so much so that I'm still used to it 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.170
 when this type is missing at 50 they were one 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:53.140

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.269
 that the predator is yellow or can 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.170

 the weapon of the devasters unfortunately not yet 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.129
 the silencer because with the silencer 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.819
 it is just as devastating as launched targets 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:38.970

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.060
 at the time you are asked to drop six 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.569
