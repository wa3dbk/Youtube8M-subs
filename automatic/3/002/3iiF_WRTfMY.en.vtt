00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
compare when it comes to the GTA we can

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.689 
compare when it comes to the GTA we can
check<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.060> out<00:00:24.269> here<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:25.590> are<00:00:25.619> running<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.640> I

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
check it out here we are running so I

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.779 
check it out here we are running so I
drove<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.910> 410<00:00:27.539> with<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.080> Adreno<00:00:28.529> 306<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.550> think

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
drove a 410 with the Adreno 306 I think

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.790 
drove a 410 with the Adreno 306 I think
it<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.800> 1.5<00:00:31.800> gigs<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.790> ram<00:00:33.600> as<00:00:34.050> well<00:00:34.440> which<00:00:34.770> is

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
it is 1.5 gigs of ram as well which is

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.400 
it is 1.5 gigs of ram as well which is
neither<00:00:35.160> here<00:00:35.460> or<00:00:35.520> there

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
neither here or there

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
on about low but we will bump it up if

00:00:46.829 --> 00:01:02.709 
on about low but we will bump it up if
it<00:00:47.070> can<00:00:47.250> manage<00:00:47.610> that

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719

so let's just try and bump up the
graphics<00:03:15.219> a<00:03:15.340> little<00:03:15.549> bit<00:03:15.670> here<00:03:16.890> probably

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
graphics a little bit here probably

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:25.309 
graphics a little bit here probably
asking<00:03:18.189> for<00:03:18.370> trouble<00:03:19.500> but<00:03:21.090> we<00:03:22.090> can<00:03:22.269> try<00:03:22.540> it

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.789

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.990 

on<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:39.000> j5c<00:04:40.030> very<00:04:41.190> decent<00:04:42.190> weight<00:04:42.310> comes<00:04:42.610> to

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
on the j5c very decent weight comes to

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.840 
on the j5c very decent weight comes to
the<00:04:43.570> lower<00:04:43.900> settings<00:04:44.740> but<00:04:45.070> a<00:04:45.310> little<00:04:45.729> bit

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
the lower settings but a little bit

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.300 
the lower settings but a little bit
constrained<00:04:46.360> with<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:46.930> Adreno<00:04:47.650> here

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
constrained with the Adreno here

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.460 
constrained with the Adreno here
Holcombe<00:04:49.150> definitely<00:04:49.660> needs<00:04:49.870> to<00:04:49.990> do<00:04:50.289> better

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
Holcombe definitely needs to do better

Holcombe definitely needs to do better
for<00:04:50.979> its<00:04:51.870> kind<00:04:52.870> of<00:04:53.050> lower<00:04:53.590> end<00:04:53.830> handsets<00:04:54.430> I

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
for its kind of lower end handsets I

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.240 
for its kind of lower end handsets I
think<00:04:54.820> but<00:04:55.210> yeah<00:04:56.050> just<00:04:56.380> a<00:04:56.590> quick<00:04:56.770> video<00:04:57.009> here

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
think but yeah just a quick video here

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.420
