00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.600
 if I jerk off on the penal code is this 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.990
 that means that I violate the law 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.099
 this is the question of today's debate 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.410
 so today I will introduce you 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.599
 this new crane this magnificent 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.330
 Huge camera crane so more 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.730
 precisely for the f700 so the crane in 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.710
 either you see it measures in all 4 m 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.510
 so it's pretty huge 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.789
 it is actually made up of several 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.260
 aluminum tubes so here I have two 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.630
 first sections of two meters which 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.210
 are joined here by plates and 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.309
 holding screws to two more 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.680
 sections so a two meters above 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.000
 since it continues there and one of 2 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.149
 meters from a moon 1 meter below 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.480
 so these are 19.5 aluminum tubes 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.820
 by 35 5 mm super important is super 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.809
 practice here look it's not me who 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.489
 got the idea but frankly the guy has 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.050
 found that it's not stupid at all in fact 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.210
 it's a roulette like the one that has 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.770
 been wandered uphill we demonstrate the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.690
 roulette we turn that and it makes an axis 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.610
 so you can do your panning 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.140
 and make the tilt in both directions so 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.329
 it's really perfect as a method 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.160
 so I spot them in one place 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.170
 to have the second tube and that me 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.540
 not enough to have movement 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.220
 below I use a tripod that is 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.380
 supposed to be for a laser level 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.180
 lol xd mdr anyway because level 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.159
 laser it's 100 g there I got 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.540
 hanging on one so it's really 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.400
 beefy like foot in addition to the advantage 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.890
 is that there is a hole like that in full 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.830
 middle so we could put a screw in 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.750
 diameter 10 is tight with a nut 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.759
 as you wield it underneath I have a 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.290
 olic in combat give a game done 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.970
 still a little hello nicolas le belgian 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.470
 who sent me all this so I have a 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.970
 rod here that keeps all 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.579
 counterweight and he misses a little bit 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.490
 by the way so here in all I have five 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.290
 sets and still 2 9 kg counterweight here 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.750
 more at the back here you see I have 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.090
 put drawer rails to support 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.500
 more counterpoint actually to the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.549
 base the idea because that's it 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.520
 be balanced so that they 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.619
 have as much weight on this side of the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.210
 crane than on this side so actually the idea 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.619
 it was to be able to precisely adjust 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.049
 since more we back off and counterweight 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.460
 the more we add weight in fact it does 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.780
 the same effect as adding weights 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.549
 so it was to adjust precisely 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.990
 but these poor little things of 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.549
 drawers that are supposed to hold eight pounds 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.130
 each of whom he is not even 4 before 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.069
 to start 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.450
 folded so that's so I have a big 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.760
 part of the weights that are there and I adjust 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.080
 precisely with that and then it serves me 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.880
 also of handles actually with blow 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.319
 I can hold it there so I would put I 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.269
 would put other other wrist for 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.340
 hundred the most beefy so that's 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.750
 rather pretty like trick after that 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.000
 gigote a little bit unfortunately 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.870
 it's a trust or may but tg flat 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.599
 with a little white balance that's 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.849
 better then next here i have a cable of 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.410
 keeping in fact that prevents the crane 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.780
 but simply leans and she 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.959
 everything is wringing so I just have here a 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.400
 hook with thread leroy merlin sa 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.590
 fucking rosemary it's great what we 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.739
 there is therefore a hook with thread 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.530
 here which attached with so a cable more 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.930
 so a reinforcement a cable greenhouse 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.410
 if extended so far I just have a 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.620
 rod of 10 6 6 which is low screw is in 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.700
 eight years pretty high with the so 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.959
 regulator it's just hanging like that 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.870
 but there is no need for it 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.459
 the more the angle that, alas, is big - 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.020
 it will take strength because if you 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.040
 you end up with something that just 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.170
 stack like that he'll have to pile everything 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.730
 compensate for the weight but the more you go 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.870
 to have a small angle more he'll have to 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.110
 shoot hard so that's why I 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.680
 chose a height here neither too big nor 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.540
 too small 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.730
 then else, well, stupidly after 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.400
 I have reinforcements here that prevents that 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.500
 what both of these two stuff 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.540
 compresses and that it vibrates too much so I 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:34.150
 have 1 2 3 and 4 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.680
 here I have a square in fact the support 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.810
 for camera so I have a square that 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.400
 is on that side and after fucking this 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.769
 shit wind and after so all the 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.990
 tray that is there so it's a plate 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.690
 aluminum of 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.250
 2 mm thick or 1 mm 5 as it was 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.430
 flexible enough it has been reinforced with 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.720
 steel plates on both sides and then 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.330
 there over 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.410
 I put some foam for 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.270
 possibly not too stiff and the 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.490
 camera there too what I have is a 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.350
 cable actually who is going that serves me with 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.240
 carabiners that I use to hold the 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.000
 camera does that I task at the 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.260
 handle of the 700 and sam effect ensures that 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.490
 that she does not break the mouth end that 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.770
 if she breaks her mouth - he will remain 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.970
 hanging on that there is a front hook 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.230
 that that it is blocked there is no problem 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.610
 so there is tape everywhere it's just 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.870
 to avoid scratching it in fact it's 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.200
 to avoid making marks on the 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.110
 camera 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.220
 and so here I finished my blah 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.440
 boring I think we'll be able 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.740
 install the camera and see what that 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.750
 given 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.400
 and so that's once she has 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.930
 installed that gives that so I put 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.670
 only one fixing screw but I 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.290
 can put two games could even 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.990
 to be more if I want but one in fact that 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.270
 holds relatively well so here I have 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.650
 two cables that bend the hdmi for 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.480
 have the feedback on the monitor that is 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.270
 there and the cable from the remote 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.630
 who normally on the side of the sony 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.640
 which four in between or so here I have the 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.330
 live back video beast of what sees 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:54.210
 the camera see that if I move lol xd 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.830
 yes it moves that's cool that's it 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.330
 frankly fucking cool because 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.300
 to make a plan blindly it's not 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.820
 top with the magic arm so that is 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.100
 pinched the aop on the foot then I have the 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.260
 remote control cable from the handle 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.520
 side of the f700 that comes from the ski ci 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.530
 and there for now 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.060
 fucking we see that slab ah yes that's 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.510
 better with the busy these guys there sony 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.310
 still 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.900
 so here with the button that is there I 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.490
 can start or stop the video I have 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.310
 the zoom control if only there 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.690
 had a zoom on on this lens so 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.310
 I did everything from there I can 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.140
 start the video and watch what's going on 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.120
 pass is closed curious movement 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.130
 I forgot to point out there I had a 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.440
 little concern that is that you actually 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.790
 see that the two bindings are not 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.010
 perfectly straight 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.990
 finally not perfectly vertical blow 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.370
 it feels especially the parallelogram 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.840
 who is the crane in fact 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.220
 see that there it is not right no 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.140
 more it's not right either it's not 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.570
 right not happened here 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.030
 oh well the camera is looking slightly towards 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.280
 the top so I'll either put a 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.840
 tripod head to be able to do 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.910
 vary the orientation and in this case there 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.410
 kept an orientation that is fixed all 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.460
 throughout the movement be doing a 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.690
 system with hens 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.919
 or in this case I will have a handle to 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.419
 the other end I could myself 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.160
 orient the camera during the movement 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.449
 but that I know I'll see then 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.849
 now some quick tests 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.949
 since there I can not get it out ok so 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:10.080
 quick little test really just let go 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.940
 for you see that's so gives 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.319
 normally is supposed to really have the 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.430
 equal weight on both sides for either 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.720
 flexible but there as I do not have enough 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.220
 of counterweight here actually it takes 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.539
 that I push at once it makes 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.009
 movements a little less fluid 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.009
 but it's still not bad 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.640
 you are tired of moving 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.020
 to your favorite sports shop 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.280
 to buy back or nike then order 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:43.720
 right now your chinese at home 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.850
 today in search of investigation 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.870
 we will talk about drugs because 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.970
 that drugs are bad 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.530
 so it will improve at the level of 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.380
 counterweight that will have to be added 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.820
 and then else that's how I say 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:59.790
