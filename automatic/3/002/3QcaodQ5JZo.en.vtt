00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:40.629
 established unprecedented 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.569
 number of world records everyone considered 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.269
 first of all it was due to 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.659
 costumes which were later canceled 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.559

 in principle, after a year at the Olympics, if so 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:10.709
 it does not change much and becomes heavier 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.809
 but now studies if the moment is needed 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:14.479
