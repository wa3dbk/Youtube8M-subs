00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.340
 the food with color yellow 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.530
 the color red with green color all the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.790
 they are wonderful for our view of 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.230
 the arteries and the red eyes really 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.460
 we give vitamin supplements for 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.230
 some problems of the macula 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.939
 effectively and that comes very well all 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.130
 what are the carrots the tomatoes the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.259
 beet 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.800
 element does not make you look red but if 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.800
 in the drink 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.390
 perhaps dilates since alcohol is true 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.390
 that has red does many others 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.340
 the work he does in the eye 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.510
 it is an irritant just like the air 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.510
 conditioning when we put it 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.510
 directly to the eye or heating a 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.219
 yellow 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.079
 to yellow is the problem of the finger 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.670
 which is funny when you see the animals 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.070
 for example, he will only teach us 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.879
 our mate marta serrano 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.589
 He has evidently been with people who 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.210
 Make up your eyes because many times 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.700
 puts the powder inside and irritates you 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.470
 They are like sand and animals have 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.509
 the weirdest eye do not have the eye so 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.759
 white like us and then the iris 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.899
 clear but it will depend on the 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.580
 vascularization that each eye already has 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.740
 I say that some glasses in the eye are 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.080
 normal and above there is that 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.580
 conjunctiva and also gets to know 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.300
 how those animals that have brand not 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.300
 they have white eyes 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.920
 uy arturo prepares for his essays is 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.080
 juggler and illusionist the eyes are 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.670
 for him a fundamental tool of 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.800
 communication with your audience is that I have 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.990
 the painted stripe and a small shadow 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.320
 red that's precisely the effect that 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.700
 I seek is to expand the size of the eye if 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.800
 you go to a big area with the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.030
 lighting you know that light always 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.280
 pick up the facial features then 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.650
 you have to exaggerate a little more with 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.750
 the eyes express emotions and hook 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.180
 interlocutor humans are the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.670
 species with the sclera the white part 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.680
 larger the light color power the 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.800
 contrast with the iris and the skin 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.660
 surrounding that white part of the eyes 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.550
 that in the human being is much wider 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.560
 that in other species has evolved 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.750
 so according to anthropologists for 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.270
 communicate more easily to whom ua 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.540
 We are looking infections and 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.580
 traumatisms are your worst enemies and 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.010
 they result in the change of color and 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.430
 appearance of discomfort in the case of 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.890
 Teresa is evident 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.750
 conjunctivitis I had all month of 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.310
 March and then later yesterday I fell into a 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.780
 part more exposed because the eyelids 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.120
 they are open and then that part is 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.209
 exposed fits the cornea and is 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.409
 exposed on the spike and the conjunctiva 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.900
 so for that we need a good 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.700
 lubrication wrote fundamental part 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.670
 of the tear that what it does is that it 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.709
 aside always be wet and be 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.560
 always protected good this is 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:02.060
 superbly this has disappeared 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.599
 totally the redness no longer 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.180
 you have nothing of secretion this was just 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.010
 to go through conjunctivitis his eye and 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.139
 has recovered thanks to the treatment 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.840
 one morning I got up with my eyes 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:17.719
 stuck that had legaÃ±as itched 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.150
 a lot of eyes and had a lot of discomfort 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:23.120
 and also my eyelids were inflamed 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.730
 the wind the sun the dust or the pollen 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.980
 can affect the sclera glasses 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.349
 Sun are a good ally to protect it 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.290
 there are four categories in the gaza 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.269
 up to category 1 is a lens 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.129
 yellow orange are customers who do not 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.989
 lets go that lets a lot of 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.609
 The light is specific for days by 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.379
 example in there were cloudy in which the 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.000
 contrast has to be greater 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.739
 we have category 2 is one more lens 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.450
 degraded is a lens like the one 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.670
 we have here only that leaves us 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.340
 spend a lot of light but that 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.040
 is already a little darker the 3 is 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.859
 the most usual and the 4 the recommended 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.299
 to sport sports glasses is 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.859
 a goggle that is a very saddle 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.750
 Enveloping like the one we see here is a 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:03.950
 glasses that also have to mount us 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.200
 we have to absorb the impacts 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.639
 when we put ourselves in sport in 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.159
 any type of risk situation 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:13.959
 everything to protect the body part 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.959
 what else does it say about us
