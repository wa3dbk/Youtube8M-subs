00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:35.499 
use the right products so as I said it's

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:37.080 
use the right products so as I said it's
really<00:01:35.619> important<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.369> decondition<00:01:36.759> your

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
really important to decondition your

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.120 
really important to decondition your
hair<00:01:37.299> because<00:01:37.659> when<00:01:37.840> your<00:01:38.020> hair<00:01:38.200> is<00:01:38.229> relaxed

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
hair because when your hair is relaxed

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.069 
hair because when your hair is relaxed
what<00:01:39.640> you're<00:01:39.850> basically<00:01:40.179> doing<00:01:40.329> is<00:01:40.689> that<00:01:40.810> you

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
what you're basically doing is that you

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.840 
what you're basically doing is that you
are<00:01:41.350> adding<00:01:41.710> a<00:01:41.799> strong<00:01:42.039> base<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.490> your<00:01:42.579> hair

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
are adding a strong base to your hair

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.469 
are adding a strong base to your hair
that<00:01:43.030> alters<00:01:43.929> the<00:01:44.520> chemistry<00:01:45.520> of<00:01:45.999> your<00:01:46.270> hair

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
that alters the chemistry of your hair

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.819 
that alters the chemistry of your hair
so<00:01:47.079> you<00:01:47.170> do<00:01:47.499> need<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:48.009> add<00:01:48.719> some<00:01:49.719> kinds<00:01:50.499> of<00:01:50.649> a

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
so you do need to add some kinds of a

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
and for no particular reason I guess but

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.230 
and for no particular reason I guess but
this<00:04:29.419> is<00:04:29.780> not<00:04:30.650> only<00:04:30.919> argan<00:04:31.490> oil<00:04:31.699> based<00:04:31.970> but

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
this is not only argan oil based but

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.830 
this is not only argan oil based but
also<00:04:32.419> macadamia<00:04:33.020> oil<00:04:33.199> based<00:04:33.530> now<00:04:34.419> it's<00:04:35.419> just

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
also macadamia oil based now it's just

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.960 
also macadamia oil based now it's just
as<00:04:35.990> rich<00:04:36.290> makes<00:04:36.979> the<00:04:37.100> hair<00:04:37.280> just<00:04:37.639> too<00:04:37.760> soft

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
as rich makes the hair just too soft

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.110 
as rich makes the hair just too soft
just<00:04:38.449> as<00:04:38.630> shiny<00:04:38.960> but<00:04:39.770> it<00:04:40.460> doesn't<00:04:40.820> smell<00:04:40.970> as

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
just as shiny but it doesn't smell as

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.379 
just as shiny but it doesn't smell as
good<00:04:41.300> I<00:04:41.479> really<00:04:41.900> feel<00:04:42.139> that<00:04:42.280> no<00:04:43.280> scent<00:04:43.910> beats

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389

that<00:04:45.169> of<00:04:45.500> Moroccan<00:04:46.070> oil<00:04:46.130> but<00:04:46.430> that's<00:04:46.940> I<00:04:47.270> guess

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
that of Moroccan oil but that's I guess

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.230 
that of Moroccan oil but that's I guess
personal<00:04:47.930> preference<00:04:48.320> and<00:04:48.889> the<00:04:49.820> last<00:04:50.030> deep

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
than protein whereas this is the

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.810 
than protein whereas this is the
contrary<00:05:06.290> so<00:05:06.740> this<00:05:06.919> is<00:05:07.040> for<00:05:07.250> when<00:05:07.370> my<00:05:07.550> hair<00:05:07.790> I

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
when I experience breakage then I go

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.570

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
this as much but I do feel that it helps
