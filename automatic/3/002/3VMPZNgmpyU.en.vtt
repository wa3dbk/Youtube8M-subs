00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
me into my students and so I thought I'd

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.830 
me into my students and so I thought I'd
talk<00:00:40.590> about<00:00:40.860> some<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.219> things<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:42.180> see

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
talk about some of the things that I see

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.560 
talk about some of the things that I see
as<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> player<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.649> teacher<00:00:44.899> that<00:00:46.399> are<00:00:47.570> issues

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
as a player and teacher that are issues

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.770 
as a player and teacher that are issues
with<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.670> ambushers<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:53.059> may<00:00:54.059> cause<00:00:54.750> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
with the ambushers that may cause a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.849 
with the ambushers that may cause a
player<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.379> not<00:00:55.530> play<00:00:55.770> at<00:00:55.920> their<00:00:56.100> best<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:57.859> as

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
player to not play at their best and as

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.250 
player to not play at their best and as
soon<00:00:59.039> as<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.280> bring<00:00:59.520> up<00:00:59.670> something<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.930> I

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
soon as I bring up something that I

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.090 
soon as I bring up something that I
think<00:01:02.010> may<00:01:02.399> be<00:01:02.430> an<00:01:02.820> issue<00:01:02.969> with<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> player

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
think may be an issue with a player

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.890 
think may be an issue with a player
saying<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.339> maybe<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:05.909> should<00:01:06.119> shouldn't

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
saying that maybe they should shouldn't

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.350 
saying that maybe they should shouldn't
play<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.350> way<00:01:07.530> then<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.890> course<00:01:08.360> someone

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
play that way then of course someone

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
will walk into my studio and they'll

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.870 
will walk into my studio and they'll

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.520 
reminds me of a a line manny client had
when<00:01:18.000> people<00:01:18.540> will<00:01:18.659> say<00:01:18.840> would<00:01:19.080> come<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.409> him

and say oh you know what about Dizzy
Gillespie<00:01:22.200> yeah<00:01:22.409> when<00:01:22.680> he<00:01:22.799> puts<00:01:23.070> his<00:01:23.159> cheeks

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
Gillespie yeah when he puts his cheeks

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.570 
Gillespie yeah when he puts his cheeks
out<00:01:23.810> you<00:01:24.810> know<00:01:24.900> isn't<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.680> bad<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.250> and

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
out you know isn't that bad for you and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.969 
out you know isn't that bad for you and
then<00:01:27.330> many<00:01:27.900> client<00:01:28.350> would<00:01:28.470> have<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> great

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
then many client would have a great

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.710 
then many client would have a great
response<00:01:29.340> he<00:01:29.490> would<00:01:29.759> say<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.240> should<00:01:30.270> all<00:01:30.509> play

response he would say we should all play

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.740 
response he would say we should all play
so<00:01:30.780> bad<00:01:31.280> so<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.310> think<00:01:32.610> that's<00:01:32.970> something<00:01:33.570> good

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
so bad so I think that's something good

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.390 
so bad so I think that's something good
to<00:01:34.020> remember<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.590> there<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.189> not

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
to remember that there is not

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.980 
to remember that there is not
necessarily<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.150> one<00:01:36.360> way<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.600> play<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
necessarily just one way to play the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.649 
necessarily just one way to play the
trumpet<00:01:37.700> although<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.939> reminds<00:01:39.240> me<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.540> my

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
trumpet although that reminds me of my

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.260 
trumpet although that reminds me of my
first<00:01:39.840> lesson<00:01:40.110> with<00:01:40.380> clogged<00:01:40.619> Gordon<00:01:41.000> when<00:01:42.000> he

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
first lesson with clogged Gordon when he

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.270 
first lesson with clogged Gordon when he
would<00:01:42.479> say<00:01:42.689> indeed<00:01:43.170> there's<00:01:43.439> only<00:01:43.799> one<00:01:44.040> way<00:01:44.220> to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
would say indeed there's only one way to

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.469 
would say indeed there's only one way to
play<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.700> trumpet<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.030> that's<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> way<00:01:45.390> I'm

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479

by the wayside and just sort of listened

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.200 
by the wayside and just sort of listened
to<00:02:01.920> claude<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.310> practice<00:02:02.670> what<00:02:02.820> he<00:02:02.850> gave<00:02:03.030> me

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.580 
to claude and practice what he gave me
and<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.509> did<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.780> for<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.960> couple<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.200> years<00:02:04.290> and

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and I did it for a couple of years and

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.620 
and I did it for a couple of years and
it<00:02:04.649> proved<00:02:04.890> move<00:02:05.130> what<00:02:05.939> was<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.270> was<00:02:06.450> very

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
it proved move what was it was very

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.360 
it proved move what was it was very
helpful<00:02:08.119> but<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.569> had<00:02:10.289> also<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.890> was<00:02:11.099> old<00:02:11.280> enough

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
helpful but I had also I was old enough

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.890 
helpful but I had also I was old enough
to<00:02:11.790> know<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.150> had<00:02:12.239> studied<00:02:12.569> with<00:02:12.629> enough

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
to know and had studied with enough

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.229 
to know and had studied with enough
great<00:02:13.080> players<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.709> know<00:02:13.860> that<00:02:14.099> in<00:02:15.030> all

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
great players to know that in all

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.990 
great players to know that in all
likelihood<00:02:15.270> there<00:02:16.020> was<00:02:16.349> one<00:02:16.620> more<00:02:16.830> way<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.069> to

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
likelihood there was one more way to to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.410 
likelihood there was one more way to to
play<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.300> trumpet<00:02:18.629> then<00:02:19.280> then<00:02:20.280> met<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.390> eye

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
play the trumpet then then met the eye

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.960 
play the trumpet then then met the eye
and<00:02:21.900> some<00:02:22.860> people<00:02:23.160> puffed<00:02:23.400> her<00:02:23.489> cheeks<00:02:23.520> out

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
and some people puffed her cheeks out

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.589 
and some people puffed her cheeks out
and<00:02:24.239> some<00:02:24.750> people<00:02:25.110> don't<00:02:26.150> some<00:02:27.150> people<00:02:27.450> do

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
and some people don't some people do

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.270 
and some people don't some people do
this<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.080> some<00:02:28.260> people<00:02:28.530> do<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.830> other<00:02:28.950> thing

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
this and some people do the other thing

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.070 
this and some people do the other thing
so<00:02:29.720> I've<00:02:30.720> found<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.500> lot<00:02:31.650> easier<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:32.930> go<00:02:33.930> with

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
so I've found it a lot easier to go with

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.839 
so I've found it a lot easier to go with
the<00:02:34.170> flow<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.650> speak<00:02:34.920> if<00:02:35.160> if<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:35.640> works

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
the flow so to speak if if it works

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.240 
the flow so to speak if if it works
great<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.750> if<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:36.930> doesn't<00:02:37.170> work<00:02:37.200> see<00:02:37.890> what

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
great and if it doesn't work see what

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.050 
great and if it doesn't work see what
you<00:02:38.370> can<00:02:38.400> do<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.819> fix<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:40.849> some<00:02:41.849> of<00:02:41.970> the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
you can do to fix it and some of the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.369 
you can do to fix it and some of the
things<00:02:42.269> that<00:02:42.450> I've<00:02:42.569> noticed<00:02:42.810> in<00:02:43.140> my<00:02:43.260> own

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379

some of the things that I issues that I

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.920 
some of the things that I issues that I

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
see with trumpet players that keep them

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.320 
see with trumpet players that keep them
from<00:03:03.959> playing<00:03:04.319> their<00:03:04.470> best<00:03:04.500> our<00:03:05.060> first<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.180> all

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
from playing their best our first of all

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.780 
from playing their best our first of all
in<00:03:06.659> the<00:03:06.720> Farkas<00:03:07.680> book<00:03:07.860> he<00:03:08.010> talks<00:03:08.040> about<00:03:08.310> having

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
in the Farkas book he talks about having

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.270 
in the Farkas book he talks about having
this<00:03:08.879> kind<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.300> shape<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:10.860> muscular

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
this kind of a shape the muscular

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.690 
this kind of a shape the muscular
development<00:03:11.519> of<00:03:11.879> a<00:03:11.940> good<00:03:12.120> embouchure<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:13.700> to

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
development of a good embouchure is to

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.869 
development of a good embouchure is to
have<00:03:14.849> this<00:03:15.060> shape<00:03:15.330> here<00:03:15.599> and<00:03:16.640> indeed<00:03:17.640> that

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:17.879 
have this shape here and indeed that

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:23.000 
have this shape here and indeed that
seems<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.239> be<00:03:18.390> quite<00:03:19.349> a<00:03:19.879> universal<00:03:21.680> shape<00:03:22.680> for

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
seems to be quite a universal shape for

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.380 
seems to be quite a universal shape for
trumpet<00:03:23.430> player<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:23.879> you<00:03:23.940> can<00:03:24.090> puff<00:03:24.269> your

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
trumpet player so you can puff your

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.740 
trumpet player so you can puff your
cheeks<00:03:24.569> out<00:03:26.000> but<00:03:27.000> they'll<00:03:27.150> still<00:03:27.360> have<00:03:27.420> that

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
cheeks out but they'll still have that

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.280 
cheeks out but they'll still have that
shape<00:03:28.879> so<00:03:29.879> that's<00:03:30.480> one<00:03:30.629> of<00:03:30.659> the<00:03:30.810> things<00:03:30.840> I<00:03:31.170> look

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
shape so that's one of the things I look

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.089 
shape so that's one of the things I look
for<00:03:32.030> another<00:03:33.030> thing<00:03:33.420> is<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:34.560> try<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.799> make<00:03:35.040> sure

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
for another thing is to try to make sure

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.830 
for another thing is to try to make sure
that<00:03:35.459> as<00:03:35.580> you<00:03:35.730> play<00:03:35.970> higher<00:03:36.239> that<00:03:36.599> the<00:03:36.690> lower

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
that as you play higher that the lower

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.100 
that as you play higher that the lower
lip<00:03:37.080> doesn't<00:03:37.290> roll<00:03:37.560> in<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:38.540> that<00:03:39.540> happens<00:03:39.959> to

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
lip doesn't roll in and that happens to

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.690 
lip doesn't roll in and that happens to
me<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.500> do<00:03:40.620> a<00:03:40.650> lot<00:03:40.830> of<00:03:40.860> other<00:03:41.099> players<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.610> as

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
you buzz mm-hmm this lower lip a role in

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.940 
you buzz mm-hmm this lower lip a role in
and<00:03:45.510> cut<00:03:45.750> off<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.019> air<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.470> that's<00:03:46.650> not<00:03:46.830> very

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
and cut off the air so that's not very

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.600 
and cut off the air so that's not very
helpful<00:03:47.840> another<00:03:48.840> thing<00:03:49.110> I've<00:03:49.349> seen<00:03:49.860> a<00:03:50.250> lot<00:03:50.430> of

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
helpful another thing I've seen a lot of

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.220 
helpful another thing I've seen a lot of
players<00:03:50.879> as<00:03:51.180> they<00:03:51.209> play<00:03:51.569> on<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.840> red<00:03:52.019> of<00:03:52.049> the

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.110 
players as they play on the red of the
upper<00:03:52.500> lip<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:53.450> that<00:03:54.450> seems<00:03:54.689> to<00:03:54.780> me

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
upper lip and that seems to me

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.699 
upper lip and that seems to me
problematic<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.900> lot<00:03:58.019> of<00:03:58.140> players<00:03:58.349> and

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
problematic and a lot of players and

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.259 
problematic and a lot of players and
again<00:03:59.310> as<00:03:59.430> soon<00:03:59.549> as<00:03:59.700> I<00:03:59.760> say<00:03:59.939> that<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.150> know

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
again as soon as I say that I know

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.369 
again as soon as I say that I know
there's<00:04:00.510> going<00:04:00.629> to<00:04:00.689> be<00:04:00.750> somebody<00:04:01.110> out<00:04:01.140> there

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
there's going to be somebody out there

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:02.539 
there's going to be somebody out there
is<00:04:01.500> playing<00:04:01.739> out<00:04:01.830> of<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:01.980> rate<00:04:02.099> of<00:04:02.129> the<00:04:02.280> lip<00:04:02.400> in

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
is playing out of the rate of the lip in

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:08.360 
is playing out of the rate of the lip in
place<00:04:02.760> great<00:04:03.120> so<00:04:05.180> just<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.769> to<00:04:07.769> note<00:04:07.950> that<00:04:07.980> once

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
place great so just to to note that once

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.020 
place great so just to to note that once
again<00:04:08.640> that<00:04:08.970> these<00:04:09.959> are<00:04:10.140> only<00:04:10.290> your

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
again that these are only your

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.470 
again that these are only your
observations<00:04:12.030> but<00:04:12.209> not<00:04:12.450> gospel<00:04:13.099> so<00:04:14.480> playing

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
observations but not gospel so playing

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.390 
observations but not gospel so playing
on<00:04:15.599> the<00:04:15.689> rid<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.049> lip<00:04:16.259> seems<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.280> be

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
on the rid of the lip seems to be

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.720 
on the rid of the lip seems to be
problematic<00:04:18.150> it<00:04:18.329> has

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
problematic it has

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.520 
problematic it has
and<00:04:18.790> for<00:04:18.970> me<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:19.420> I've<00:04:19.990> had<00:04:20.170> to<00:04:20.260> figure<00:04:20.410> out

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
and for me and I've had to figure out

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.650 
and for me and I've had to figure out
ways<00:04:20.800> to<00:04:20.860> work<00:04:21.400> around<00:04:21.550> that<00:04:21.970> so<00:04:22.270> that<00:04:22.420> I<00:04:22.450> don't

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
ways to work around that so that I don't

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.240 
ways to work around that so that I don't
do<00:04:22.810> that<00:04:22.990> as<00:04:23.110> much<00:04:23.290> especially<00:04:23.650> as<00:04:24.040> they<00:04:24.130> go

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
do that as much especially as they go

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.860 
do that as much especially as they go
into<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.520> upper<00:04:24.730> register<00:04:25.150> because<00:04:25.480> I<00:04:25.690> think

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
into the upper register because I think

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.120 
into the upper register because I think
it<00:04:25.960> helps<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.230> have<00:04:26.290> more<00:04:26.500> live<00:04:26.710> in<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:26.920> upper

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
it helps to have more live in the upper

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.310 
it helps to have more live in the upper
register<00:04:27.550> if<00:04:27.670> you<00:04:27.790> go<00:04:27.940> higher<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.420> not<00:04:29.080> play

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
register if you go higher and not play

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.430 
register if you go higher and not play
on<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.560> tissue<00:04:29.740> but<00:04:30.100> on<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.340> muscle<00:04:30.840> so<00:04:31.840> those

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
on the tissue but on the muscle so those

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.550 
on the tissue but on the muscle so those
are<00:04:32.620> three<00:04:33.310> things<00:04:33.580> that<00:04:33.760> I<00:04:34.180> look<00:04:34.960> for<00:04:35.230> when<00:04:35.260> a

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
are three things that I look for when a

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.160 
are three things that I look for when a
player<00:04:35.920> comes<00:04:36.310> to<00:04:36.520> play<00:04:37.300> for<00:04:37.570> me<00:04:37.660> or<00:04:37.780> my<00:04:38.020> own

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
player comes to play for me or my own

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.740 
player comes to play for me or my own
plane<00:04:38.410> to<00:04:39.160> see<00:04:39.880> if<00:04:40.000> there<00:04:40.240> are<00:04:40.270> some<00:04:40.630> issues

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
plane to see if there are some issues

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.800 
plane to see if there are some issues
there<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.410> if<00:04:41.890> I<00:04:42.010> might<00:04:42.160> be<00:04:42.340> helpful<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:42.880> in

lighter trumpet talks well we'll get
into<00:04:47.350> more<00:04:47.500> depth<00:04:47.980> on<00:04:48.100> each<00:04:48.280> one<00:04:48.460> of<00:04:48.520> those<00:04:48.700> and

into more depth on each one of those and
hopefully<00:04:49.630> have<00:04:49.840> some<00:04:49.990> observations<00:04:50.680> and

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
hopefully have some observations and

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.580 
hopefully have some observations and
some<00:04:51.400> suggestions<00:04:51.970> on<00:04:52.150> what<00:04:52.330> to<00:04:52.390> do<00:04:52.630> should
