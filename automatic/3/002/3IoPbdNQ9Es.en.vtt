00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.459
 you people it's 90 I hope 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.230
 that you're fine so at day one 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.029
 new video on the channel a review 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.789
 exceptional review of cristiano 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.500
 ronaldo version regular not a version 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.870
 boost for the simple and good reason that 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.370
 about two weeks now its 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.780
 team of the year version that will be released 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.820
 so we will not go from the version 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.289
 regular to the totti version for 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.580
 the hÃ©rault view you have his stats 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.750
 first they are scrolling 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.980
 I invite you to pause 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.510
 or a master in art problems observed 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.699
 for what they bought credits 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.659
 onepoll.com 5% discount with code 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.289
 fatma credit should in the five 

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:40.730
 minutes 6 of the charter 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.399
 according to available stocks 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.839
 information in the description the 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.159
 cristiano ronaldo told me about his price 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:50.659
 directly a high price or too much 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.339
 too high it's true he never 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.659
 been so expensive in a fifa the same for 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.460
 my 6 years and the two most 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.370
 dear fifa I think we never 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.989
 seen regular also expensive about 3 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.249
 million credit about 3 million 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.109
 100 thousand credit in my name I make you 

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:04.760
 the review last year for this price 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.810
 there you had almost boost 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.470
 so it's true that it's still 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.450
 relatively high really need I 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.549
 think that to buy it really needs 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.469
 already have the credits and be when 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.119
 even rather fan of the player so that's 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:18.439
 true it is monstrous so if you 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.840
 Kiffes plays with very very big 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.920
 player you can take it but I think 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.420
 that you really need to be a fan of the player 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.820
 in that three million credit 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.049
 you make yourself a team of fools while 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.060
 there for three million there you make yourself 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.350
 just you just take a player with 3 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.369
 but no you make a team limit I 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.909
 can take two three legends in 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.369
 a team 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.350
 so it's true that it's relatively 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.340
 high after it is simply 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.920
 huge 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.030
 there's nothing to say about it we're going 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.770
 actually talked about these positives 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.689
 now because of the negative points 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.270
 there is no name already at the level of 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.070
 pluses the finish a right-handed 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.590
 on the left you come back you hit it's 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.630
 perfect with 95 in finish that's it 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.490
 simply monstrous then the long 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.020
 ch shock specified for long shock 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.479
 he has a very big wait for you cat 93 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.789
 years shock with 1.94 in power of 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.069
 hits the balloons really go really 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.960
 very well but oddly I do not have 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.280
 managed to go long chad my typing 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.210
 far away you'll see on the last 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.520
 clip it's on a free kick all 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.690
 just huge but it's true that 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.730
 the long cat I could not get in 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.830
 with him but they leave relatively 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.750
 very very well he has a good quality of 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.750
 pass 1.81 we pass on the map that can 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.320
 to be made for 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.290
 at 92.2 general but the little bit of 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.660
 successful assists is due to the fact 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.160
 that most beautiful pages in issue 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.990
 some because to show 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.160
 as quality spends most of 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.810
 beautiful passes of cristiano ronaldo 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.340
 not necessarily expected based 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.440
 attacks on lukasz 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.180
 on kondogbia so people we do not 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.160
 necessarily a very very good finish 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.380
 in front of the cages and suddenly the pass 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.420
 decisive will not turn into a pass 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.770
 turn into a miss but he is 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.140
 still capable of very very beautiful 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.060
 open on technically a treat 5 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.530
 stars technical gestures with 1.93 in 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.270
 dribble in game 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.090
 if you manage the skill there is really 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.770
 way to make you very very happy 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.510
 scoop t in and demented here you do 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.610
 Scooter ronaldo you in the kidneys 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.720
 all the senses and then, well, you're not 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.250
 limited in terms of technical gestures 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.580
 I can do all the gestures of the world 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.459
 after his headplay 86 years precision 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.320
 from the head with ak francs to 14 years to 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.390
 pages been pretty shocked actually when I 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.790
 have seen them tutu center if you happen to 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.900
 center on it that's usually purpose 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.180
 because it goes over all 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.290
 defenders what is michael jordan the 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.750
 deserves the way they show up in 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.010
 the air is just it's just abused me 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.780
 a real he has a monstrous relaxation 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.220
 but here in fifa it's the same 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.959
 you see worse the way you ride 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.670
 the kicks stopped then the 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.470
 set pieces 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.420
 79 in the matter of free kicks 88 in 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.040
 effect 94 in hitting power 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.540
 when I say stopped kick it's 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.820
 front and on the front 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.440
 corners the way he stands he is 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.549
 really very dangerous on corner if you 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.430
 got to put the ball on him 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.560
 head that makes either goals or has made a 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.709
 very very big opportunity but at the level 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.180
 free kicks here are his stats in coup 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.340
 franc he barely stats and normand 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.780
 accuracy of free kick but the 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.220
 cristiano ronaldo actually it's really 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.890
 firing in force you pull in force the 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.530
 free kicks are asked no questions 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.730
 and well they go really well 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.510
 the free kicks I think it's one 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.400
 the best free kickers 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.260
 that I played with 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.549
 yet it's not the guy at amr stats 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.860
 but all the free kick of cristiano 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.890
 ronaldo are dangerous after at the level 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.900
 of his physique 79 in strength for a 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.940
 winger is very good for a winger 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.130
 given low 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.540
 you are facing side backs and 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.430
 seppois the most physical players 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.840
 of the game after obviously contact 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.880
 sabrina the waiting aude applies to 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.740
 to transplant a lot in lax but he 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.150
 really is very very good about his 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.650
 legs have there at the moment I say that there 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.950
 falls but at the same time he gets 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.050
 cut out and so here it is at 1.63 in 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.760
 balance that poses absolutely no 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.040
 problem large players so 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.630
 weak stats in balance but when he 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.360
 generally falls low it's in the 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.340
 surface to get a penalty it's done 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.460
 a little life side without like zlatan 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.930
 ibrahimovic as suarez as robben 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.640
 like other players that I tested 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.420
 previously this year I sent 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.340
 you still feel like 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.380
 that they are a little bit smart and 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.120
 who are ready to do anything to get 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.320
 penaltys so here again 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.740
 illustration at the level of shots 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.910
 francs very very easy positioning to 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.040
 find it's really an ultra player 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.110
 offensive a strong offensive contribution 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.140
 weak defensive contribution it goes down 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.760
 he never stays in front so big bacon 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.930
 positive point what is it really a guy 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.730
 to score goals there you see 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.370
 again a goal and then it's going to be 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.090
 the last clip the free kick which I 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.650
 have spoken to you 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.880
 thirty six art masters I put a 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.790
 little screen on twitter and facebook 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.260
 here's wallers wade is this a free kick 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.520
 monstrous of pomegranate christ and more 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.140
 and early in the game you can see 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.970
 compared to the flap at the time that 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.550
 scroll down the abc to the little band 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.410
 which scrolls down and so it's on this 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.090
 beautiful free kick that ends 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.620
 the gameplay phases of being yourself 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.630
 So is the balance sheet of Cristiano Ronaldo 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.730
 which is displayed before your eyes so at 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.530
 level of positive points shots 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.720
 stones was it's going to be more the aspect 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.910
 free kick good penalty obviously and 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.260
 corner it is especially on the placement at 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.280
 level of the cornuck so he's really 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.760
 very interesting at the level of the shots 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.100
 foot stopped so strong effect 79 in force 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.290
 correct for a winger he close 85 so 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.840
 he wants to really by mouth people to 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.450
 the shoulder like mills he has a physical 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.620
 interesting steal his vision of the game as 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.000
 I said here she is able to do 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.500
 very very nice openings so that's 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.450
 it's also interesting for people 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.620
 that will play a little bit mode 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:20.990
 support agility vision finish 95 in 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.420
 finish it's just exceptional for 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.320
 a winger dribbles technically 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.980
 long struye shot his head game who 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.180
 invite him is monstrous when you 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.920
 sound on his head that's a goal 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.150
 usually the four bad stars 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.770
 foot he has both feet so that's 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.510
 really very interesting positioning 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.040
 very very easy to find by always 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.120
 at the edge of the offside for those who 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.950
 like to play in the depth I do 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.980
 a deep pass to ronaldo he's going 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.360
 I do not know how it is done but 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.590
 it is almost never I see the steps 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.820
 really all the time the limit so in 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.560
 lower for the face to face is just 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.540
 perfect its pass quality which is 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.990
 very good the five-star gesture 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.450
 technical 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.490
 obviously and his punching power he 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.310
 hits very very hard you see the 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:00.020
 record with 12 games 25 goals and two 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.000
 assists it's monstrous as 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.230
 balance sheet so that's all for the 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.120
 review by cristiano ronaldo i hope that
