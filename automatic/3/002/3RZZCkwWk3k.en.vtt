00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.410
 it sounds to you resides level truth then 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.240
 imagine your ideologist and director enjoying 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.980
 again of creative freedom for 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.280
 develop a survival horror of the most 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.590
 ambitious that's whiting a title of 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.120
 action adventures and terror that takes us 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.100
 hand in hand for some of the scenarios 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.650
 more bizarre we've seen in the 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.670
 last times prepared for a trip 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.670
 to the dark interior 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.559
 in the video game we are Sebastian 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:52.239
 Castilians a detective in charge of 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.670
 that seems like a mission of everything except 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.989
 Routine travels with his companions to a 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.899
 hospital to investigate a homicide 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.059
 multiple a true butcher shop that in 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.600
 reality hides something much bigger and 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.600
 Sinister 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.299
 and the best part of the game is to know the least 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.130
 possible of your argument and experience it 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.470
 by yourself but we can overtake 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.270
 without fear of causing spoilers that what 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.010
 let's live is a journey of strong 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.150
 psychological burden and full of 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.150
 unexplainable situations 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.780
 the campaign is the only playable offer 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.180
 of the program and it's divided into 15 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.860
 chapters that we linearly overcome the 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.630
 playable concept and its outline can 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.670
 be somewhat outdated for some 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.440
 but that does not stop being fun and 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.440
 stop with the heart in a fist 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.460
 there are some sections designed as 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.740
 large sands with several routes that 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.570
 choose to reach the same destination without 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.159
 However, although these parts work 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.290
 extraordinarily at the time of 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.820
 explore and find items what is true is 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.020
 that when they involve fighting the 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.020
 result is not so buoyant 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.640
 what is the problem the intelligence 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.920
 artificial of the opponents that is a 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.930
 true disaster when the rivals are 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.180
 they accumulate yes we are in trouble but 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.039
 otherwise the fighting is so slow 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.539
 and they are so clumsy that the body 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.709
 body is undoubtedly the worst part 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.709
 resolved of the game 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.310
 that yes all this does not mean that no 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.560
 there are difficult enemies especially 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.720
 the special adversaries and the bosses 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.640
 all of them are capable of 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.410
 unblinking kill us and 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.330
 causing some of the most deaths 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.200
 bloody and chilling that we've 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.200
 seen in a long time 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.800
 if we enjoy you and wisin at night 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.230
 with helmets can make us feel bad 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.300
 not only because their scenarios are 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.340
 sordid if they are full of unpleasant 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.379
 surprises but also because in some 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.510
 moments is a very challenging game and 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.510
 has maximum voltage sequences 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.840
 to deal with all of this we have a 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.580
 good arsenal of weapons whose ammunition 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.530
 even in some cases we can 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.720
 manufacture ourselves 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.420
 and do not forget to set fire to all 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.400
 fallen enemies that you can already you know by 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.500
 that of avoiding inopportune surprises 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.360
 the maps are full of ammunition and 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.530
 rewards that should be found if 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.530
 we want to get out alive 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.989
 Traps play a very important role 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.760
 important in all this because we can 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.890
 use them in our favor when 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.390
 we have problems but that yes that 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.489
 walk with a lot of eye because also 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.469
 we will find many that will act against 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.810
 we and there are very scoundrels 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:33.670
 any help will be little for some 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.209
 of the limit situations that we will have 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.209
 what to overcome 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.140
 However, the threats are not only 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.420
 flesh and bone 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.819
 or spectral clear there's also 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.440
 puzzle of many types but not 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.569
 wait for the typical puzzle that you can 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.910
 settle calmly and that is harmless 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.890
 here if you mess up or you do not notice well 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.890
 on the bye tracks 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.720
 besides the video game also includes a 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.220
 progression and saving system that 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.080
 It takes place in one of the few 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.120
 places of calm that we will have in the 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.190
 adventure apart from the check points that 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.200
 there are them we will travel to this haven of peace 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.819
 through mirrors and there we can 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.740
 save our progress and also 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.950
 invest in different improvements for the 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.950
 hero 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.599
 from the visual point of view the title 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.550
 does homework very effectively and 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.949
 achieves its goal to build an atmosphere 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.020
 oppressive and distressing that we fill the 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.759
 artistically there are some 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.560
 Fantastic designs and lines 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:34.189
 general the program presents a look 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.189
 fabulous 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.690
 technologically table within is something 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.760
 more discreet in the first place we have been 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.650
 deeply displeased the two bars 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.540
 blacks that are located above and below 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.520
 the image is about an inexplicable 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.860
 decision that obeys reasons of 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.080
 performance design subtracts something more from 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.880
 a quarter of the screen also 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.650
 there are some drops in the rate of 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.180
 images per second and except one 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.430
 bright lighting and effects 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.020
 punctual but extraordinary the certain 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.220
 is that it is not a visual waste either 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.220
 as if to justify it 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.870
 in the sound the news is better and 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.090
 the audio effects are gruesome the 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.710
 very appropriate soundtrack and the game 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.330
 arrives in our country located at 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.139
 our language with an interesting level 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.690
 of lobbies okay I'm not one of them and 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.580
 berwyn with his good and bad things is 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.830
 a great option for fans of 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.080
 survival horror your concept is something 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.759
 outdated yes and the handling a bit clumsy 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.409
 of the protagonist his problems of 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:34.539
 navigation and the camera are going to play 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:36.280
 some bad tricks but if we achieve 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:37.960
 overcome these obstacles we 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.490
 we will find a title that is winning 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.680
 as we go forward and 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.509
 submerging us in his proposal one that 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.849
 it becomes a terror shoot 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:48.490
 frankly recommended and loaded with 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:52.860
 casquerÃ­a that you dare to venture 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.860
 in the twisted brain of no criteria
