00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
like all right um you have the switch

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.759 
like all right um you have the switch
down<00:02:18.310> here<00:02:18.900> which<00:02:19.900> goes<00:02:20.230> through<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.590> wall

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
down here which goes through the wall

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.640 
down here which goes through the wall
leads<00:02:21.459> up<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.640> some<00:02:21.880> redstone<00:02:22.319> this<00:02:23.319> is<00:02:23.470> a

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
leads up to some redstone this is a

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.210 
leads up to some redstone this is a
basic<00:02:24.180> redstone<00:02:26.550> flash<00:02:27.840> repeater<00:02:29.010> it's<00:02:30.010> a

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
basic redstone flash repeater it's a

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.330 
basic redstone flash repeater it's a
really<00:02:30.760> sporadic<00:02:31.090> though<00:02:31.680> so<00:02:32.680> that<00:02:32.950> goes<00:02:33.130> into

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
really sporadic though so that goes into

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.380 
really sporadic though so that goes into
the<00:02:34.060> new<00:02:34.300> repeater<00:02:35.110> from<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.069> update<00:02:36.519> which

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
the new repeater from the update which

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.090 
the new repeater from the update which
goes<00:02:37.630> into<00:02:37.660> all<00:02:38.170> these<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:39.959> dispensers<00:02:40.959> now<00:02:41.799> in

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
goes into all these of dispensers now in

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.970 
goes into all these of dispensers now in
order<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:43.030> make<00:02:43.239> this<00:02:43.420> thing<00:02:43.690> fire<00:02:43.989> rapid<00:02:44.799> fire

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
order to make this thing fire rapid fire

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.090 
order to make this thing fire rapid fire
like<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.459> showed<00:02:45.670> in<00:02:45.850> my<00:02:46.260> fire<00:02:47.260> arrow<00:02:47.470> version<00:02:47.890> 2

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
like I showed in my fire arrow version 2

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.690 
like I showed in my fire arrow version 2
video<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:50.260> have<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.709> have<00:02:50.829> these<00:02:51.010> torches<00:02:51.400> on

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
video you have to have these torches on

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.750 
video you have to have these torches on
and<00:02:52.180> they<00:02:52.930> will<00:02:53.110> just<00:02:53.380> continuously<00:02:53.980> rain<00:02:54.430> out

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
and they will just continuously rain out

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.180 
and they will just continuously rain out
eggs<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.810> spawn<00:02:56.140> chickens<00:02:56.820> now<00:02:57.820> I<00:02:58.890> guess<00:02:59.890> I'll

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
eggs to spawn chickens now I guess I'll

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.789 
eggs to spawn chickens now I guess I'll
pretend<00:03:00.610> I'm<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.790> pig<00:03:01.239> even<00:03:01.750> though<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:01.900> have<00:03:02.260> way

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
pretend I'm a pig even though I have way

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.050

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
currently has the great chance of

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.649 
currently has the great chance of
creating<00:03:41.470> invincible<00:03:42.310> pigs

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
creating invincible pigs

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.220 
creating invincible pigs
which<00:03:44.659> I<00:03:45.069> have<00:03:46.209> seemed<00:03:47.209> to<00:03:47.360> do<00:03:47.540> which<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:47.989> seem

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
which I have seemed to do which I seem

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.720 
which I have seemed to do which I seem
to<00:03:48.349> do<00:03:48.500> on<00:03:49.190> a<00:03:49.670> regular<00:03:50.120> basis<00:03:50.750> so<00:03:51.549> these<00:03:52.549> are

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
to do on a regular basis so these are

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.119 
to do on a regular basis so these are
source<00:03:53.060> blocks<00:03:53.420> of<00:03:53.690> water<00:03:53.930> you<00:03:54.709> know<00:03:54.799> one<00:03:55.010> two

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:55.129 
source blocks of water you know one two

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.180 
source blocks of water you know one two
three<00:03:55.370> going<00:03:55.760> down<00:03:55.940> and<00:03:56.209> then<00:03:56.569> I<00:03:56.690> filled<00:03:57.190> right

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
three going down and then I filled right

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.330 
three going down and then I filled right
here<00:03:58.790> with<00:03:59.150> dirt<00:03:59.540> so<00:04:00.349> that<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.920> makes<00:04:01.129> this

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
here with dirt so that it makes this

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.380 
here with dirt so that it makes this
little<00:04:02.110> vertical<00:04:03.110> drop<00:04:03.620> off<00:04:03.860> of<00:04:04.190> water<00:04:04.700> going

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
little vertical drop off of water going

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.509 
little vertical drop off of water going
further<00:04:05.750> down<00:04:05.870> today<00:04:06.319> they're<00:04:06.530> going<00:04:06.650> to<00:04:06.829> drag

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
further down today they're going to drag

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.430 
further down today they're going to drag
down<00:04:07.549> there<00:04:08.000> if<00:04:08.450> they<00:04:08.750> can<00:04:08.900> jump<00:04:09.110> off<00:04:09.290> each

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
down there if they can jump off each

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.170 
down there if they can jump off each
other's<00:04:09.709> head<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.220> get<00:04:10.489> out<00:04:10.640> but<00:04:10.909> other<00:04:11.090> than

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
other's head and get out but other than

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.029 
other's head and get out but other than
that<00:04:11.269> there's<00:04:12.140> almost<00:04:12.260> no<00:04:12.530> way<00:04:12.560> out<00:04:14.769> now<00:04:15.769> since

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
that there's almost no way out now since

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.580 
that there's almost no way out now since
is<00:04:16.160> underground<00:04:16.630> obviously<00:04:17.630> you<00:04:18.350> have<00:04:18.500> to

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
is underground obviously you have to

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.099 
is underground obviously you have to
have<00:04:18.680> a<00:04:18.709> ladder<00:04:18.919> going<00:04:19.280> down<00:04:19.459> oh<00:04:19.669> my<00:04:20.570> god<00:04:20.720> it's

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
have a ladder going down oh my god it's

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.790 
have a ladder going down oh my god it's
true<00:04:21.289> to<00:04:21.919> try<00:04:22.130> that<00:04:22.340> again<00:04:23.050> um<00:04:26.410> so<00:04:27.410> this<00:04:27.680> is

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
true to try that again um so this is

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.350 
true to try that again um so this is
what<00:04:27.949> it<00:04:28.010> looks<00:04:28.130> like<00:04:28.220> from<00:04:28.340> this<00:04:28.520> side<00:04:28.729> all

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
what it looks like from this side all

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.010 
what it looks like from this side all
the<00:04:29.750> meat<00:04:29.960> gets<00:04:30.590> pushed<00:04:30.979> forward<00:04:31.570> or<00:04:32.570> some<00:04:32.930> of

the meat gets pushed forward or some of

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.170 
the meat gets pushed forward or some of
it<00:04:33.110> gets<00:04:33.199> burned<00:04:33.530> but<00:04:34.039> most<00:04:34.430> wickets<00:04:34.760> before

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
it gets burned but most wickets before

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.770 
it gets burned but most wickets before
and<00:04:35.419> you<00:04:35.510> just<00:04:35.660> collect<00:04:35.960> right<00:04:36.169> here<00:04:36.729> now<00:04:37.780> when

I'm when this thing gets flooded see
those<00:04:40.880> are<00:04:40.940> some<00:04:41.270> invincible<00:04:41.539> pigs<00:04:41.960> over

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
those are some invincible pigs over

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.260 
those are some invincible pigs over
there<00:04:42.350> by<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.620> way<00:04:42.850> when<00:04:43.850> this<00:04:43.940> thing<00:04:44.150> gets

flooded with uh with pigs I have this
button<00:04:51.190> which<00:04:52.190> just<00:04:52.580> shoots<00:04:52.940> a<00:04:53.030> bunch<00:04:53.210> of

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
button which just shoots a bunch of

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.290 
button which just shoots a bunch of
arrows<00:04:53.570> from<00:04:54.320> behind<00:04:54.919> the<00:04:55.220> water<00:04:55.460> into<00:04:56.210> the

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
arrows from behind the water into the

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.339 
arrows from behind the water into the
pigs<00:04:56.530> so<00:04:57.530> the<00:04:58.190> way<00:04:58.280> I<00:04:58.310> built<00:04:58.580> this<00:04:58.700> was<00:04:58.970> a

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
pigs so the way I built this was a

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:04.690 
pigs so the way I built this was a
button<00:05:00.349> up<00:05:00.440> there<00:05:00.650> a<00:05:03.039> redstone<00:05:04.039> coming<00:05:04.520> into<00:05:04.669> a

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
button up there a redstone coming into a

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.460 
button up there a redstone coming into a
regular<00:05:04.970> redstone<00:05:05.570> repeater<00:05:05.960> because<00:05:06.320> on

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
regular redstone repeater because on

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.310 
regular redstone repeater because on
this<00:05:06.680> on<00:05:07.010> a<00:05:07.070> server<00:05:07.430> right<00:05:07.610> now<00:05:07.789> the<00:05:08.510> arm<00:05:08.720> the

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
this on a server right now the arm the

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.700 
this on a server right now the arm the
ones<00:05:09.979> he<00:05:10.160> added<00:05:10.490> in<00:05:10.580> in<00:05:10.789> the<00:05:10.910> 1.3<00:05:11.599> beta<00:05:11.840> only

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
ones he added in in the 1.3 beta only

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.060 
ones he added in in the 1.3 beta only
point<00:05:13.099> to<00:05:13.340> true<00:05:13.849> north<00:05:13.880> and<00:05:14.419> this<00:05:15.229> is<00:05:15.410> I<00:05:15.590> don't

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
point to true north and this is I don't

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.040 
point to true north and this is I don't
need<00:05:16.190> it<00:05:16.340> to<00:05:16.490> it<00:05:16.729> won't<00:05:17.210> work<00:05:17.360> as<00:05:17.539> I<00:05:17.720> go<00:05:17.870> on<00:05:17.960> to

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
need it to it won't work as I go on to

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.529 
need it to it won't work as I go on to
your<00:05:18.169> north<00:05:18.349> so<00:05:19.060> because<00:05:20.060> this<00:05:20.240> year<00:05:20.389> you've
