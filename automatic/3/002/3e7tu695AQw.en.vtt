five I think here's can of 60 you can't

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.879 
five I think here's can of 60 you can't
beat<00:02:01.749> that<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.990> you<00:02:05.079> basically<00:02:05.229> just<00:02:05.439> take<00:02:05.740> off

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:05.889 
beat that so you basically just take off

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:09.469 
beat that so you basically just take off
the<00:02:06.009> lid

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:24.710

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
there's this mechanism over here that

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:37.890 
there's this mechanism over here that
locks<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.920> just<00:02:32.920> turn<00:02:33.159> it<00:02:33.280> on<00:02:33.400> go<00:02:36.900> one

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
locks it and just turn it on go one

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.930 
locks it and just turn it on go one
click<00:02:38.170> done<00:02:41.340> just<00:02:42.340> turn<00:02:42.489> it<00:02:42.519> off<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:42.730> you're
