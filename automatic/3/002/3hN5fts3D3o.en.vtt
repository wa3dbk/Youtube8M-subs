00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.250
 good evening to all windows readers 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.619
 but Italy today we look together gta 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.380
 san andreas a game released for windows 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:24.329
 phone 8 available from Monday 27 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.360
 January 2014 we try it on 19 25 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.000
 here it is we have to unlock then 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:33.120
 let's go to the bottom here is how you see already 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.989
 tile supports the two of the dimensions 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.899
 then medium small and wide and shows us 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.520
 the last mission played despite the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.489
 written both in Italian now we will see 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.249
 inside the game, however, it is English 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:52.140
 the obvious, of course, is played in landscape 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:55.350
 in this position 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.440
 horizontal game and loads a lot 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.249
 quickly we go to start it would be 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.249
 we are in volume 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.900
 then lumia 925 in band terminals 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.900
 high 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.520
 here the game is loaded let's see 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.640
 immediately that the graphics are very much 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.619
 so good despite the device 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.259
 precisely despite the fact that he is one 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.030
 smartphone and not a computer 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.550
 the graphic quality is really a lot 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.259
 very good commands obviously are 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.759
 optimized for touch and then 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.090
 we have the left side where it is 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.490
 apple movement rules here with these 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.410
 buttons we go to agira here we have 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.990
 this less easily accessible with 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.610
 the right hand then with the thumb in 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.410
 particular of which we can example 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.670
 get off the vehicle with this vehicle 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:52.890
 move we can punch or 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:58.560
 or use a weapon when we have it 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:03.149
 or run with this other button 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:08.149
 you go running to jump if you crush it 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.149
 instead first jump takes a vehicle 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:16.200
 here's how you see something with your foot 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:23.959
 on the accelerator we're going to do a 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:28.200
 turn the controls obviously being 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:30.540
 optimized for touch and are not not 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.790
 the same are the same with the computer 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.650
 to which we give this piece 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.530
 one of the biggest problems was 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.780
 game that is the loading of the gods 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.180
 3d models as you see in the distance 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.350
 now it happens here I fell we take 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.600
 a car that you can see a little better the 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.930
 game is the same star version splits 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.930
 the PC 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.739
 here we see some micro 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.239
 we slow down a little on the fly 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.040
 let's see some slowdowns 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.349
 micro lake occasionally this decline of 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.260
 framerate but we hope will come 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.579
 solved in the next game releases 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.000
 because obviously the first one came out today 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:11.879
 version but not necessarily then 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.659
 obviously neither the scans of the others 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:18.879
 let's go down for a moment as it is 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:20.739
 just the same game available for 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:24.840
 pc because we have for example the barber 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.840
 if I don't remember the gym I do n't know how to see 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.150
 the gym so we can go to 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.329
 we can go to perform all the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:40.709
 operations that can be performed 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:40.709
 normally on the pc is obviously not 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.980
 how to beat someone up to kill him 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.980
 as in this case 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:00.000
 let's try the same possibilities 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.000
 that we have on the PC 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:12.010
 let's see for a moment so we can go 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:15.699
 to steal cars and heart we can 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.680
 his we are going to perform the missions as 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:21.729
 sees however the texts are in this case in 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:25.139
 English there is still no version 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.139
 Italian translation into Italian 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.409
 so for example I here you see in 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.479
 remoteness and this problem that 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:37.000
 problem takes a while to 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:40.440
 load the various textures then the various ones 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:46.360
 3d buildings and consequently the textures 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:48.099
 obviously if the commands are not possible 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.449
 go and put them in the garage 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.449
 reverse the normal gear 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:05.430
 I can enter the buildings in the house 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:18.690
 for example in the cj and I can go 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:20.930
 classic I can go to save the 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.000
 menu events have been redesigned for 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.740
 touch and respect graphic interface 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.080
 the mouse and keyboard control that was there 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.599
 previously however on the pc the 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.009
 game is the same then sio type one 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:41.490
 mission here on I can go the r 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:45.810
 I can answer the mobile can 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:49.469
 both call i can go to 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:52.289
 enter this mission missions that 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:54.110
 they are the same as the computer 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:57.050
 therefore also on the pc version 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:00.169
 let's start with these missions as well as 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.280
 here for example here I have to follow this 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:12.000
 get in the car to get the pick 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:15.150
 up and go where you ask me or nothing 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.370
 of commands that after some of some 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.419
 let's say a few hours of play there 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.069
 get used 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:24.210
 obviously it's not like playing with a mouse 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:28.740
 and in short, however, we say that the keyboard 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:31.500
 game really deserves dunton i can 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.240
 go out in the south I go out I'll show you 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:37.009
 the options menu so I can 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:40.830
 change the control I can go to 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:48.029
 going to show the short increase 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:55.729
 or decrease the game parameters we see 

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:58.830
 if for example this way it takes a while 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:00.750
 I can go to lower then the 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.509
 statistics I can see an inter 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.949
 same statistics I see on the PC I can 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:09.069
 just go and see all those things 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:14.300
 very interesting or going out 

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:20.300
 get out of the game and in a moment I go out 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:23.479
 from the game play available for play 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:27.110
 available for windows phone 8 al 

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:29.090
 price of 6 euros and 49 a high price 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.310
 it is different from the games but for the real ones 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:34.030
 fans of the series really is 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.500
 in short, a treat not to be missed 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:39.800
 some problems that we have seen 

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.449
 first then some micro lag and some 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.759
 little problem to load the buildings in 

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:47.720
 the distance we hope will be put to 

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:49.729
 post with next updates 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:54.009
 so for now it's all a greeting from the Hon 

00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:54.009
 remember for windows blog italia
