 My father once told us that the water did not always burn, 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.600
 that it could be drunk when it was flying from above. 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.680
 / But it was long / before his birth, 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.200
 before the Earth took its last breath 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.520
 and she began to die with him. 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.800
 They say that sooner / later the sky has collapsed 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.880
 / and chaos prevailed then. 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.800
 / Despair was spreading faster than the heat spreading illnesses. 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.600
 / The best have become monsters, 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.600
 / and the worst demons. 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.280
 / My family shared, 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.720
 let us not devour each other. 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.000
 / Soon, gangs and clans / searching for water and supplies flooded the land. 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.600
 / They filled the days with bloodshed, 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.800
 / and the nights screams killed. 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.600
 But now there is only silence. 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.000
 There is nothing but silence. 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.200
 / Days are getting darker, 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.600
 / just like those who survived it. 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.080
 For 15 years I have been hiding / against the corruption of this world. 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.520
 He will discover me soon ... 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.520
 /again. 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.000
