if<00:03:08.489> I<00:03:09.030> do<00:03:09.090> then<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.750> could<00:03:10.140> get<00:03:10.379> copyright

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
if I do then I could get copyright

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.099 
if I do then I could get copyright
strikes<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.609> could<00:03:11.970> use<00:03:12.269> advanced<00:03:12.659> warfare

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109

gameplay but I could get copyright

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:16.759 
gameplay but I could get copyright
strikes<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:15.930> that's<00:03:16.079> why<00:03:16.200> there's<00:03:16.379> black<00:03:16.560> ops

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.830 
strikes so that's why there's black ops
2<00:03:16.950> in<00:03:17.099> the<00:03:17.159> background<00:03:17.609> but<00:03:17.819> that's<00:03:18.450> about<00:03:18.660> it

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
2 in the background but that's about it
