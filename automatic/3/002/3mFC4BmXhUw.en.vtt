00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
there but anyway let's skip the internet

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.810 
there but anyway let's skip the internet
test<00:01:22.950> just<00:01:23.670> go<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.970> another<00:01:25.430> test<00:01:26.430> which<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.790> a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
test just go to another test which is a

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.460 
test just go to another test which is a
camera<00:01:27.390> test<00:01:28.549> now<00:01:29.549> let's<00:01:29.820> take<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.000> picture<00:01:30.329> of

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
camera test now let's take a picture of

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:38.030 
camera test now let's take a picture of
a<00:01:31.470> pillow<00:01:34.850> okay

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.670 

so<00:01:40.470> Galaxy<00:01:41.470> Nexus<00:01:41.620> even<00:01:42.070> has<00:01:42.220> a<00:01:43.680> better

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
so Galaxy Nexus even has a better

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:53.370 
so Galaxy Nexus even has a better
picture<00:01:46.680> ok<00:01:47.680> let's<00:01:47.920> look<00:01:47.950> at<00:01:48.100> that<00:01:48.220> picture<00:01:52.380> ok

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
picture ok let's look at that picture ok

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.580 
picture ok let's look at that picture ok
this<00:01:53.950> is<00:01:54.130> this<00:01:54.340> then<00:01:55.350> let's<00:01:56.350> try<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.620> on<00:01:56.860> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
this is this then let's try it on the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:07.920 
this is this then let's try it on the
curve<00:02:03.840> which<00:02:04.840> looks<00:02:05.530> like<00:02:05.740> crap<00:02:06.840> think<00:02:07.840> of

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
curve which looks like crap think of

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.130 
curve which looks like crap think of
this<00:02:11.850> obviously<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.090> Galaxy<00:02:13.480> Nexus<00:02:13.630> must

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
this obviously the Galaxy Nexus must

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.100 
this obviously the Galaxy Nexus must
have<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.350> huge<00:02:14.980> advantage<00:02:15.150> considering<00:02:16.150> as<00:02:16.810> its

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
have a huge advantage considering as its

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.800 
have a huge advantage considering as its
Super<00:02:17.380> AMOLED<00:02:17.410> HD<00:02:17.770> screen<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:18.760> an<00:02:19.420> amazing

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
Super AMOLED HD screen and an amazing

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.290 
Super AMOLED HD screen and an amazing
camera<00:02:20.400> now<00:02:21.400> let's<00:02:21.730> move<00:02:21.850> on<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.030> something

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
camera now let's move on to something

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:32.010 
camera now let's move on to something
else<00:02:23.790> let's<00:02:24.790> go<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:28.320> hmm<00:02:29.320> what<00:02:29.620> else<00:02:30.990> what<00:02:31.990> else

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
else let's go to hmm what else what else

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.540 
else let's go to hmm what else what else
is<00:02:32.290> there<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.500> test<00:02:32.860> on<00:02:33.010> this<00:02:33.300> okay<00:02:34.300> um<00:02:34.540> let's

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
is there to test on this okay um let's

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.800 
is there to test on this okay um let's
test<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.670> games<00:02:36.880> how<00:02:37.209> fast<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.630> games<00:02:37.870> render

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
test the games how fast the games render

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.060 
test the games how fast the games render
mmm<00:02:40.810> if<00:02:41.019> we<00:02:41.920> were<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.370> go<00:02:42.900> on<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.320> most<00:02:44.530> simple

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
mmm if we were to go on the most simple

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.960 
mmm if we were to go on the most simple
game<00:02:45.310> on<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.380> blackberry<00:02:47.380> such<00:02:47.650> as<00:02:47.800> snake<00:02:48.250> and

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.330 

go<00:02:51.970> on<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:55.050> tank<00:02:56.050> hero<00:02:56.320> very<00:02:56.709> complicated

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
go on the tank hero very complicated

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:04.770 
go on the tank hero very complicated
game<00:02:59.430> on<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.610> Nexus<00:03:03.510> obviously<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.600> games

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
game on the Nexus obviously the games

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.810 
game on the Nexus obviously the games
won't<00:03:04.900> have<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.200> exact<00:03:05.500> same<00:03:05.530> thing<00:03:05.950> but

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.070 

let's<00:03:09.820> just<00:03:09.970> try<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.269> again<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.750> renders

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
let's just try it again that renders

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.020 
let's just try it again that renders
better<00:03:11.340> such<00:03:12.340> such<00:03:13.269> as<00:03:14.670> brickbreaker<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.910> has

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
better such such as brickbreaker it has

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.089 
better such such as brickbreaker it has
a<00:03:16.060> little<00:03:16.180> bit<00:03:16.299> of<00:03:16.390> rendering<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:19.860> okay

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
a little bit of rendering to it okay

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:29.360 
a little bit of rendering to it okay
so<00:03:23.099> in<00:03:23.459> both<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:23.969> them<00:03:27.409> if<00:03:28.409> I<00:03:28.560> were<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:28.890> go<00:03:29.099> on

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
so in both of them if I were to go on

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.789 
so in both of them if I were to go on
this<00:03:29.519> one<00:03:29.819> and<00:03:30.090> go<00:03:30.150> select<00:03:32.659> right<00:03:33.659> so<00:03:34.319> excuse
