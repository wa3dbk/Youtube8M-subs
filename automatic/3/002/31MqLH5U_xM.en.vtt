00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.919
 here is a clip for fastening car caste 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.630
 sawing for flared for lower flanging 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:16.670
 body that is homemade such an option 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.670
 I have 716 bolts here 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:36.329
 tape measure let's say about thickness 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:37.020
 rather, the width is 90 millimeters so myself 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.510
 metal 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:46.110
 thickness of the order there but 10 millimeters 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:50.910
 rasp is used here and pops up 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.809
 now show rasp settled there on 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.789
 four parts actually half 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.579
 made clamping jaws from rasp 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.910
 tree holds metal-metal very well 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:09.170
 don't slide off and so give you the likes 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:23.240
 bolts again m16 gadget the whole thing 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:28.290
 this one works here for us weaving 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:31.049
 100 millimeters here too 100 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:36.090
 millimeters 100 millimeters are made 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:39.810
 cuts for attaching to the floor so you can 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.630
 was it for these cuts there 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.549
 regulate it back and forth it in general 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.060
 touch up something like a car 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.060
 like this 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:24.300
 Looks good in total 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:28.810
 checked tested as per height 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.450
 approximately for car consumption cornfield 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:42.430
 chevrolet that is, let's say from floor to 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:44.320
 end point 37 38 38 centimeters then 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.060
 there is a car a little bit 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:58.390
 jacking jacking 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:03:01.360
 wind up here and clamped in the end 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:10.320
 eventually got such a clip for 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:19.840
 afterburner forcing 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:28.090
 62 505 so not so much thread here 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:30.989
 big so good 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:39.030
 I'll call the teeth 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:48.209
 damn the teeth in general there go such 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:53.590
 interesting and myself that lingering mechanisms 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:56.560
 that is, the more we do the tension 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:01.390
 the more into the mechanism 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:04.690
 tightens clamps metal already too 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.510
 everything is tested perfectly in work 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.260
 keeps does not slide off 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:17.109
 worth it we say there is 2150 rubles 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:20.919
 such a thing cool thing so right now hand 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:24.520
 free montage principle if 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:29.710
 fully unwind the tool this 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:33.700
 the clip will come out so he walks here now I 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:38.740
 I'll get him out even bills I'll turn it on quickly 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:41.979
 spins here so conical 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:47.130
 trick that is it turns out the more we 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.130
 we pull the more pinches tool 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:57.010
 so it was very cool overall 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.800
 happy with this thing so if 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.139
 had to 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.360
 Weld then grinder it all 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:08.410
 cut a lot of time would have gone 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:11.729
 And so all quickly took off 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.729
 took off set and ready 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:26.990
 also here is a clip to 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:32.490
 pull the body too 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:36.900
 sponges made of metal rasp 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:40.110
 Desyatochka themselves that is, lane 10 there 10 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:43.890
 there at 90 10 millimeters at 90 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:49.790
 millimeters, respectively, that's such 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:55.650
 the size of everything everyone does like him 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:06:01.020
 will come up we clamp the item 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:03.360
 twist and pull the only thing 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.960
 Of course you need to add stiffeners 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.780
 because all the same it is clear that desyatochka 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:14.300
 can not stand a little but not 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.300
 less never broke away from metal
