you how to make a cool custom brush in

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.580 
you how to make a cool custom brush in
Photoshop<00:00:11.550> it's<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.690> really<00:00:13.170> good<00:00:13.349> for

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
Photoshop it's a really good for

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.320 
Photoshop it's a really good for
sketching<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.250> blending<00:00:14.580> in<00:00:14.700> Photoshop<00:00:15.240> it's

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
sketching and blending in Photoshop it's

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.320 
sketching and blending in Photoshop it's
it's<00:00:18.330> got<00:00:18.480> like<00:00:18.859> angle<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.640> it's<00:00:20.910> not<00:00:21.090> so

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
it's got like angle to it so it's not so

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.390 
it's got like angle to it so it's not so
apparent<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.840> you're<00:00:22.020> using<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.470> round<00:00:22.920> just

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
apparent that you're using a round just

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.490 
apparent that you're using a round just
the<00:00:23.550> regular<00:00:23.699> hard<00:00:24.029> round<00:00:24.240> brush<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:25.260> when<00:00:25.439> you

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
the regular hard round brush is when you

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.620 
the regular hard round brush is when you
use<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.310> way<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:26.609> naturally<00:00:27.210> set<00:00:27.449> up

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
use that the way it's naturally set up

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.800 
use that the way it's naturally set up
is<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.250> like<00:00:29.250> if<00:00:29.490> you're<00:00:29.670> sketching<00:00:30.359> around

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
is so like if you're sketching around

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.590 
is so like if you're sketching around
you'll<00:00:31.590> see<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.250> circle<00:00:32.820> over<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.450> over

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
you'll see the circle over and over

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.010 
you'll see the circle over and over
again<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.110> just<00:00:34.320> will<00:00:34.649> look<00:00:34.920> really<00:00:35.340> digital

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
again and just will look really digital

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.170 
again and just will look really digital
so<00:00:37.020> with<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.770> one<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.250> get<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.610> nice<00:00:38.879> soft

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
so with this one you get the nice soft

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.690 
so with this one you get the nice soft
edge<00:00:39.420> with<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> hard<00:00:40.110> edge<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:43.040> yeah<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
edge with the hard edge and yeah the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.029 
edge with the hard edge and yeah the
work<00:00:45.390> comes<00:00:45.660> out<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> lot<00:00:46.020> better<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.710> anyways

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
work comes out a lot better so anyways

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.860 
work comes out a lot better so anyways
I'm<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.910> do<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> quick<00:00:48.300> sketch<00:00:48.539> for<00:00:48.840> you

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
I'm going to do a quick sketch for you

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.340 
I'm going to do a quick sketch for you
now

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
now

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.279 
now
just<00:00:50.280> showing<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.879> what<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.750> looks<00:00:51.899> like<00:00:52.110> when

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
just showing you what it looks like when

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.540 
just showing you what it looks like when
you're<00:00:52.379> using<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.770> because<00:00:52.920> when<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.219> go<00:00:53.370> in

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
you're using it because when you go in

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.880 
you're using it because when you go in
from<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> side<00:00:53.879> or<00:00:54.510> an<00:00:54.600> angle<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.710> get<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
from the side or an angle you get a

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.510 
from the side or an angle you get a
thinner<00:00:56.190> line<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.270> know<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:58.520> have

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
thinner line and you know you can have

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.189 
thinner line and you know you can have
really<00:00:59.879> good<00:01:00.000> edge<00:01:00.180> control<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.960> way<00:01:03.199> so

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
really good edge control that way so

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.560 
really good edge control that way so
here's<00:01:04.920> one<00:01:07.580> nothing<00:01:08.580> too<00:01:08.760> crazy<00:01:08.970> just

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
here's one nothing too crazy just

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.320 
here's one nothing too crazy just
showing<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.820> later<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.210> video

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
showing you and later on in the video

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.670 
showing you and later on in the video
I'll<00:01:12.630> show<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.869> what<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.290> difference

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
I'll show you what the difference

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:24.420 
I'll show you what the difference
between<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.159> two

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.670 

so<00:01:25.060> yeah<00:01:25.210> I<00:01:25.240> got<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.480> few<00:01:25.690> settings<00:01:26.200> turned<00:01:26.470> on

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
so yeah I got a few settings turned on

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.000 
so yeah I got a few settings turned on
this<00:01:28.890> makes<00:01:29.890> for<00:01:30.100> better<00:01:30.630> finding<00:01:31.630> it's

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
this makes for better finding it's

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.850 
this makes for better finding it's
smoother<00:01:33.010> and<00:01:34.170> spacings<00:01:35.170> all<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.500> way<00:01:35.620> down

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
smoother and spacings all the way down

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.770 
smoother and spacings all the way down
and<00:01:36.160> things<00:01:36.340> like<00:01:36.490> that<00:01:36.550> but<00:01:37.270> I'll<00:01:37.510> show<00:01:37.690> you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
and things like that but I'll show you

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:48.399 
and things like that but I'll show you
that<00:01:37.930> in<00:01:37.990> a<00:01:38.110> second

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:59.210 

you

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.610 

so<00:02:00.150> here<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.800> default<00:02:02.640> brush<00:02:03.290> while<00:02:04.290> sorry

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
so here is a default brush while sorry

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.500 
so here is a default brush while sorry
default<00:02:05.100> has<00:02:05.400> just<00:02:05.670> got<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.060> shape<00:02:06.300> dynamics

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
default has just got the shape dynamics

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.780 
default has just got the shape dynamics
other<00:02:07.170> dynamics<00:02:07.800> and<00:02:07.950> smoothing<00:02:08.369> turned<00:02:08.580> on

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
other dynamics and smoothing turned on

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.810 
other dynamics and smoothing turned on
and<00:02:09.150> as<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.450> can<00:02:09.570> see<00:02:09.630> when<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.170> use<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.700> sort<00:02:11.700> of

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
and as you can see when I use it sort of

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.640 
and as you can see when I use it sort of
has<00:02:12.000> just<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.630> ghost<00:02:12.900> shape<00:02:13.350> of<00:02:13.530> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
has just like the ghost shape of the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.590 
has just like the ghost shape of the
circle<00:02:13.920> like<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.520> keep<00:02:14.850> seeing<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.330> outline

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
circle like you keep seeing the outline

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.790 
circle like you keep seeing the outline
of<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.810> circle<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.200> you're<00:02:16.440> gonna<00:02:16.590> want<00:02:16.770> to

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
of the circle so you're gonna want to

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.310 
of the circle so you're gonna want to
take<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.070> spacing<00:02:17.640> all<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.060> way<00:02:18.180> down<00:02:18.420> and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
take the spacing all the way down and

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.690 
take the spacing all the way down and
what<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.650> will<00:02:19.770> do<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:19.980> it'll<00:02:20.280> blend<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:20.640> all

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
what that will do is it'll blend it all

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.120 
what that will do is it'll blend it all
together<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.420> uses<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.350> lot<00:02:22.620> more<00:02:22.830> RAM

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
together and that uses a lot more RAM

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.940 
together and that uses a lot more RAM
than<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.910> other<00:02:24.120> brush<00:02:24.330> but<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:25.110> definitely

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
than the other brush but it definitely

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.380 
than the other brush but it definitely
helps<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:27.110> mean<00:02:28.110> it's<00:02:28.410> pretty<00:02:28.770> much<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.090> must<00:02:30.090> if

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
helps I mean it's pretty much a must if

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.800 
helps I mean it's pretty much a must if
you're<00:02:30.480> gonna<00:02:30.600> be<00:02:30.810> painting<00:02:31.110> in<00:02:31.350> Photoshop

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
you're gonna be painting in Photoshop

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.410 
you're gonna be painting in Photoshop
anyways<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:34.320> take<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.620> angle<00:02:35.040> in<00:02:35.190> brush<00:02:36.150> tip

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
anyways you take the angle in brush tip

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.550 
anyways you take the angle in brush tip
shape<00:02:36.920> again<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:37.950> turn<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.460> like<00:02:38.700> 40<00:02:39.560> 45

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
shape again I turn it to like 40 45

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.480 
shape again I turn it to like 40 45
degrees<00:02:41.070> around<00:02:41.700> there<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.650> got<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:43.890> 47

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
degrees around there so I got it 47

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.010 
degrees around there so I got it 47
degrees<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:45.180> then<00:02:45.300> you're<00:02:45.540> gonna<00:02:45.660> want<00:02:45.930> to

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
degrees and then you're gonna want to

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.970 
degrees and then you're gonna want to
take<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.290> roundness<00:02:46.730> down<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:48.210> around<00:02:48.690> 50%<00:02:49.380> so

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
take the roundness down to around 50% so

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.120 
take the roundness down to around 50% so
I<00:02:50.040> got<00:02:50.160> 56<00:02:50.670> there<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.710> yeah<00:02:52.710> you<00:02:52.770> see<00:02:53.040> it's

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
I got 56 there and yeah you see it's

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.560 
I got 56 there and yeah you see it's
just<00:02:53.160> an<00:02:53.340> oval<00:02:53.640> shape<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:55.850> yep<00:02:56.850> either<00:02:57.300> again

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
just an oval shape and yep either again

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.320 
just an oval shape and yep either again
you<00:02:57.690> take<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.900> spacing<00:02:58.470> down<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.890> 1%<00:02:59.250> just<00:03:00.120> all

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
you take the spacing down to 1% just all

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.590 
you take the spacing down to 1% just all
the<00:03:00.420> way<00:03:00.450> down<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.730> you're<00:03:03.030> gonna<00:03:03.150> want<00:03:03.480> to

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
the way down and you're gonna want to

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.850 
the way down and you're gonna want to
have<00:03:04.020> other<00:03:04.380> dynamics<00:03:05.220> selected<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:07.620> have

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
have other dynamics selected and have

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.240 
have other dynamics selected and have
both<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.700> control<00:03:09.620> menus<00:03:10.620> set<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:11.070> pen

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
both of the control menus set to pen

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.570 
both of the control menus set to pen
pressure<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:13.260> shape<00:03:13.590> dynamics<00:03:13.890> you<00:03:14.430> gonna

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
pressure and shape dynamics you gonna

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.840 
pressure and shape dynamics you gonna
want<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.850> have<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:16.140> size<00:03:16.830> jitter<00:03:17.160> set<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.640> pen

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
want to have the size jitter set to pen

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.150 
want to have the size jitter set to pen
pressure<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.870> minimum<00:03:19.230> diameter<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.950> like

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
pressure the minimum diameter is like

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.150 
pressure the minimum diameter is like
70%<00:03:20.730> 75%<00:03:24.080> you<00:03:25.080> don't<00:03:25.290> want<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.590> have<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.830> angle

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
70% 75% you don't want to have the angle

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.940 
70% 75% you don't want to have the angle
jitter<00:03:26.280> on<00:03:26.459> cuz<00:03:26.940> I<00:03:26.970> don't<00:03:27.120> make<00:03:27.239> it<00:03:27.330> all<00:03:27.450> Wiggly

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
jitter on cuz I don't make it all Wiggly

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.690 
jitter on cuz I don't make it all Wiggly
then<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.010> gonna<00:03:29.130> want<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.430> turn<00:03:29.519> the

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
then you gonna want to turn the

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.030 
then you gonna want to turn the
roundness<00:03:30.090> jitter<00:03:30.209> onto<00:03:30.720> pen<00:03:30.930> pressure<00:03:31.230> and

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
roundness jitter onto pen pressure and

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.870 
roundness jitter onto pen pressure and
this<00:03:32.790> is<00:03:32.970> all<00:03:33.150> this<00:03:33.390> all<00:03:33.600> applies<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.320> using<00:03:34.650> a

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
this is all this all applies to using a

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.100 
this is all this all applies to using a
tablet<00:03:35.880> when<00:03:36.060> you're<00:03:36.180> painting<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.600> Photoshop

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
tablet when you're painting a Photoshop

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.380 
tablet when you're painting a Photoshop
which<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:38.370> should<00:03:38.640> be<00:03:38.820> if<00:03:38.970> you're<00:03:39.150> going<00:03:39.300> to

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
which you should be if you're going to

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.479 
which you should be if you're going to
be<00:03:39.510> doing<00:03:39.690> this<00:03:39.959> it's<00:03:40.260> really<00:03:40.920> hard<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.400> get

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
be doing this it's really hard to get

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.729 
be doing this it's really hard to get
the<00:03:41.610> same<00:03:41.790> results<00:03:42.330> with<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.510> mouse<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:43.590> have

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
the same results with a mouse you have

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:44.990 
the same results with a mouse you have
to<00:03:43.920> approach<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.370> with<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.489> whole<00:03:44.700> different

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
to approach it with a whole different

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.830 
to approach it with a whole different
technique<00:03:45.769> so<00:03:46.769> anyways<00:03:47.070> as<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.400> can<00:03:47.519> see<00:03:47.840> it's

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
technique so anyways as you can see it's

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.380 
technique so anyways as you can see it's
a<00:03:49.470> lot<00:03:50.190> different<00:03:50.370> than<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.820> circle<00:03:51.180> brush

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
a lot different than the circle brush

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.560 
a lot different than the circle brush
it's<00:03:51.630> nice<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.670> it<00:03:53.670> won't<00:03:53.880> leave<00:03:54.090> so<00:03:54.120> much<00:03:54.420> of

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
it's nice and it won't leave so much of

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.750 
it's nice and it won't leave so much of
a<00:03:54.660> mark<00:03:54.930> an<00:03:55.350> obvious<00:03:55.769> mark<00:03:56.100> and<00:03:56.489> you're<00:03:56.640> going

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
a mark an obvious mark and you're going

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:05.680 
a mark an obvious mark and you're going
to<00:03:56.790> want<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.000> have<00:03:57.090> smoothing<00:03:57.690> check<00:03:57.989> too

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.890 

so<00:04:06.690> yeah<00:04:07.040> there<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:08.100> go<00:04:08.420> you<00:04:09.420> want<00:04:09.600> to<00:04:09.660> click

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
so yeah there you go you want to click

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.540 
so yeah there you go you want to click
that<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:11.070> little<00:04:11.280> uh<00:04:12.200> square<00:04:13.370> next<00:04:14.370> to<00:04:14.460> the

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
that that little uh square next to the

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.180 
that that little uh square next to the
trash<00:04:14.850> can<00:04:14.880> with<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.510> corner<00:04:15.930> flipped<00:04:16.200> up<00:04:16.410> and

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
trash can with the corner flipped up and

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.410 
trash can with the corner flipped up and
you're<00:04:17.280> gonna<00:04:17.370> want<00:04:17.580> to<00:04:17.610> press<00:04:17.820> okay<00:04:18.210> and

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
you're gonna want to press okay and

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.020 
you're gonna want to press okay and
that'll<00:04:18.900> save<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.350> brush<00:04:19.560> so<00:04:20.490> you<00:04:20.550> can<00:04:20.730> use<00:04:20.880> it

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
that'll save the brush so you can use it

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.070 
that'll save the brush so you can use it
any<00:04:21.150> time<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:23.300> yeah<00:04:24.300> that's<00:04:24.630> pretty<00:04:24.720> much<00:04:24.930> it

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
any time and yeah that's pretty much it

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.640 
any time and yeah that's pretty much it
and<00:04:26.150> it<00:04:27.150> helped<00:04:27.630> me<00:04:27.690> a<00:04:27.780> lot<00:04:28.020> help<00:04:28.320> me<00:04:28.440> with<00:04:28.530> my

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
and it helped me a lot help me with my

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.890 
and it helped me a lot help me with my
blending<00:04:29.010> and<00:04:29.160> everything<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.900> it's

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
blending and everything and it's

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.950 
blending and everything and it's
definitely<00:04:31.350> cool<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.370> use<00:04:32.580> so<00:04:33.480> anyways<00:04:33.780> I'll

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
definitely cool to use so anyways I'll

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.500 
definitely cool to use so anyways I'll
show<00:04:34.140> you<00:04:34.200> both<00:04:34.920> the<00:04:35.100> brushes<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.760> this<00:04:36.270> one

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
show you both the brushes and this one

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:45.140 
show you both the brushes and this one
is<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:37.260> new<00:04:37.410> brush<00:04:37.650> we've<00:04:37.890> created

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.300 

there's<00:04:46.150> a<00:04:46.240> pretty<00:04:46.450> good<00:04:46.860> line<00:04:47.860> variation

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
there's a pretty good line variation

00:04:48.310 --> 00:05:02.800 
there's a pretty good line variation
there<00:04:48.880> and<00:04:49.420> what<00:04:49.570> you<00:04:49.690> can<00:04:49.870> do

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.930 

and<00:05:03.410> also<00:05:03.590> you<00:05:03.860> can<00:05:04.340> play<00:05:04.520> with<00:05:04.670> everything

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
and also you can play with everything

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.860 
and also you can play with everything
else<00:05:05.270> you<00:05:05.990> can<00:05:06.050> use<00:05:06.380> like<00:05:06.590> the<00:05:07.420> texture<00:05:08.420> tab<00:05:08.570> to

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
else you can use like the texture tab to

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.930 
else you can use like the texture tab to
apply<00:05:09.170> you<00:05:09.860> know<00:05:09.980> textures<00:05:10.400> you<00:05:10.550> find<00:05:10.760> on<00:05:10.880> the

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
apply you know textures you find on the

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.270 
apply you know textures you find on the
internet<00:05:11.270> like<00:05:11.480> site<00:05:12.290> I<00:05:12.320> linked<00:05:12.650> to<00:05:12.710> before<00:05:13.190> in

calm they have a bunch you can apply
those<00:05:18.770> to<00:05:19.100> your<00:05:19.250> brushes<00:05:19.970> to<00:05:20.389> make<00:05:20.570> it<00:05:20.720> cool

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
those to your brushes to make it cool

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.270 
those to your brushes to make it cool
and<00:05:21.470> texture<00:05:22.570> that'll<00:05:23.570> help<00:05:24.040> anyways<00:05:25.040> here's

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
and texture that'll help anyways here's

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.570 
and texture that'll help anyways here's
a<00:05:25.340> circle<00:05:25.580> brush<00:05:26.050> with<00:05:27.050> only<00:05:27.950> shape<00:05:28.370> dynamics

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
a circle brush with only shape dynamics

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.320 
a circle brush with only shape dynamics
and<00:05:29.210> then<00:05:29.450> with<00:05:29.660> other<00:05:29.900> dynamics<00:05:31.090> it's<00:05:32.090> just<00:05:32.270> a

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
and then with other dynamics it's just a

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.520 
and then with other dynamics it's just a
little<00:05:32.419> smooth<00:05:32.810> there<00:05:34.030> and<00:05:35.050> then<00:05:36.050> smoothing

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
little smooth there and then smoothing

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.790 
little smooth there and then smoothing
turned<00:05:36.800> on<00:05:37.060> but<00:05:38.060> it's<00:05:38.240> you<00:05:38.510> know<00:05:38.650> it's<00:05:39.650> not

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
turned on but it's you know it's not

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.670 
turned on but it's you know it's not
very<00:05:39.860> painterly<00:05:40.460> in<00:05:40.790> anyways<00:05:41.180> here's<00:05:41.930> a

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680
