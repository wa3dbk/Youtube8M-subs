held and today we have one of our NC
standard<00:00:14.840> machining<00:00:15.230> vices<00:00:15.650> it's<00:00:16.369> a<00:00:16.430> little

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610 
standard machining vices it's a little

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.830 
standard machining vices it's a little
different<00:00:16.790> than<00:00:17.029> your<00:00:17.150> standard<00:00:17.360> machining

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
different than your standard machining

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.210 
different than your standard machining
vice<00:00:17.990> and<00:00:18.260> that<00:00:18.380> this<00:00:18.500> is<00:00:18.560> a<00:00:18.710> hydraul

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220

vice and that this is a hydraul
mechanical<00:00:20.180> vice<00:00:20.390> so<00:00:21.349> as<00:00:21.500> you<00:00:21.529> tighten<00:00:22.279> down

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
mechanical vice so as you tighten down

mechanical vice so as you tighten down
the<00:00:22.939> Vice<00:00:23.180> on<00:00:23.360> your<00:00:23.540> part<00:00:23.779> you<00:00:24.020> actually<00:00:24.800> build

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
the Vice on your part you actually build

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.519 
the Vice on your part you actually build
up<00:00:25.640> hydraulic<00:00:26.300> pressure<00:00:26.570> that<00:00:27.140> does<00:00:27.350> the

clamping on the park with a couple

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.500 
clamping on the park with a couple
cranks<00:00:30.859> I've<00:00:31.130> built<00:00:31.310> it<00:00:31.460> up<00:00:31.550> to<00:00:31.730> 9,000<00:00:32.419> pounds

whereas with a standard mechanical vice

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.479 
whereas with a standard mechanical vice
you<00:00:39.019> would<00:00:39.170> need<00:00:39.350> to<00:00:39.500> put<00:00:39.710> about<00:00:39.920> 90<00:00:40.309> foot

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
you would need to put about 90 foot

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.119 
you would need to put about 90 foot
pounds<00:00:40.820> of<00:00:40.879> torque<00:00:40.940> on<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:41.809> crank<00:00:42.650> handle<00:00:43.010> to

pounds of torque on the crank handle to

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.890 
pounds of torque on the crank handle to
achieve<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:43.790> 9,000<00:00:44.330> pounds<00:00:44.420> of<00:00:44.629> clamping

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
achieve that 9,000 pounds of clamping

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.689 
achieve that 9,000 pounds of clamping
force<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:45.890> you<00:00:45.949> can<00:00:46.100> see<00:00:46.250> I<00:00:46.280> didn't<00:00:46.580> work

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
force and you can see I didn't work

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.860 
force and you can see I didn't work
anywhere<00:00:47.030> near<00:00:47.239> that<00:00:47.269> hard<00:00:47.920> and<00:00:49.720> one<00:00:50.720> of<00:00:50.809> the

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
just slide the power unit off and blow

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.779 
just slide the power unit off and blow
out<00:01:11.960> any<00:01:12.290> chips<00:01:12.650> that<00:01:12.799> accumulate<00:01:13.340> inside<00:01:13.490> the
