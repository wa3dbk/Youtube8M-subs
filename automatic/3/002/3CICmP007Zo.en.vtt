 welcome to rhythmix 1 l ji ne 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.019
 chance finals wieners which converge 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.150
 Europe team and Korea team literally 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.219
 in the first with this we are just waiting 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.619
 incredibly interesting action because 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.560
 Europe will again represent the first 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.900
 millennium further from korea is enough 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.900
 unexpectedly first rushes into battle 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.119
 team captain is the undisputed leader and of 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.880
 quantic yun today for you will 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.040
 work scenes and alex007 xan gives you 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.570
 wonderful picture i will 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.370
 accordingly, and I comment 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.860
 I hope that today everything will be in 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.800
 okay everything will be great for those 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.690
 who already managed to miss the national teams of the CIS 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.420
 I would like to remind you that the CIS team 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.370
 continues to fight the rhythm 1 1 and the chance 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.430
 but unfortunately it is in the grid 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.550
 losers and therefore she will wait for her 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.050
 opponent exactly based on this game 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.360
 loser of this match or national team 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.520
 Europe or the Korean team very soon 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.800
 will meet with the national team of the CIS and while Europe 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.290
 against measles and it starts right now 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.240
 millennium further quantic hun on the map 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.540
 Eros at the fornication of the old yudzh 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.420
 and right now we will appear on this map 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.250
 here's your attention now 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.840
 It is offered to her pictures 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.930
 which you see in the center along with 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.750
 logos rhythm rhythm and of course 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.720
 map maker sky of the galaxy team which 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.540
 created for us this card specifically 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.189
 branded for rhythmix 1 l and us 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.170
 it remains only to see what it is from 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.140
 represents itself because surely 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.729
 not everyone had time to meet enough 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.280
 the news has long been published 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.619
 the fact that on and Rusal will be cards made 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.840
 specifically for our tournament and can 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.640
 be someone already had time to forget that we 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.100
 prepared such interesting new ones 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.259
 cards but if you forget we'll see 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.090
 let's see right now and while we 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.670
 imagine of course the players on the left 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.070
 top captain and team leader 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.570
 korea who came out today to play with 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.070
 the first is of course quantic and he 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.020
 wonderful just mirror zero which 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.610
 remind is the reigning champion 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.290
 rhythm russell because it was he 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.300
 won our fourth season 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.520
 tournament and of course will take 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.410
 part all yourself next right below 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.640
 appeared 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.560
 promising promising french 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.930
 body which just great started 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.240
 match against cis for their 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.370
 teams winning three wins in a row 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.970
 millennium further and of course further 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.860
 I would like today to repeat the achievement 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.720
 previous match and also show yourself 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.670
 100 percent as i promised 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.090
 let's take a look at the map like this 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.100
 here the natural principle is enough 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.890
 standard calm enough for 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.600
 productions 2 locations further truth not 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.760
 venture openly in fourteen 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.730
 command center but we see that this one 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.530
 passage so i would even say isthmus and 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.540
 the widest which leads to naturals 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.190
 protect quite simply as possible 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.019
 protect it with tanks on 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.470
 highground posed here literally 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:02.380
 here but I don’t know how to proceed 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.959
 will play on the exit to 3 locations 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.720
 in this picture is very simple in principle 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.030
 the most reliable option here 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.150
 that is because it is very close to Mae Nam 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.640
 straight literally ridiculed descended if 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.500
 you ripper right here and got 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.239
 opportunity to put 3 locations here 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.799
 only protecting me is not very easy because 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.170
 that there is still a second pass which on 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.299
 third base goes besides passage 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.000
 of course that leads from natural and yes 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.410
 In general, the map is made in such a way that 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.150
 the third location is quite far away 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.769
 it is located from natural and look 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.230
 how much do you need to go on foot 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.600
 maybe something like a cloud 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.760
 kingdom but do not know in my opinion 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.560
 quite difficult third location 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.870
 your attention to what hun explored and 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.489
 he saw what his opponent did 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.320
 that he didn't have gas you are fine 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.570
 understands that this access bar and further 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.030
 everything will be delivered literally now 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.280
 the youngest this time was playing through wanted 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.620
 Of course, before the pool here it had no 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.590
 naturally I also put on him 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:03.489
 gas let's probably look at the map 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.920
 Further here is a potential option for 4 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.290
 location about a possible alternative for 3 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.910
 notice how it is located 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.850
 someone just from the straight walk 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.519
 just a little bit another thing that location 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.919
 open just the same from all sides here 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.229
 here leads as we see the rise from 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.270
 card center also from the center 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.370
 cards but it will be very convenient to harass 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.740
 any units that only 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.569
 has zerg and just eterna 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.780
 besides there is a very wide top 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:33.190
 the passage is basically this width already 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.810
 more than enough to 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.360
 create a p- problem but you can still 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.300
 smash destructible stones and then 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.970
 all locations will be in an open place from 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.460
 her way by the way here comes the path to 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.910
 the next base is already 5 which we are with you 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.639
 We looked and finally from 5 base goes 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.960
 rise accordingly to 6 you cards as you 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.900
 understand symmetrically about 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.500
 center so here's an alternative 6 base 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.479
 from which by the way to 3 base of another 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.090
 player quite literally within reach 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.069
 A card that can be fun to share 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.169
 horizontals and vertically 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:10.240
 that is, theoretically we can observe 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.830
 the picture is that the entire right side of the map 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.310
 along with this location that lives 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.560
 farther 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.090
 all the left along with this location also let 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.310
 him and maybe everything will be the opposite 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.789
 maybe he will take this location this 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.389
 this 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:24.039
 understandable central and then 2 upper and 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.960
 leave this way further 2 lower in 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.460
 including this location, that is, and 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.969
 the map is quite an interesting map in 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.560
 which is not so clear in terms of 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:35.110
 distribution in half in terms of there 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.820
 some other interesting features 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.560
 and therefore I hope that we will see 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.990
 here is an exceptionally interesting game 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.599
 meanwhile b enkven nests 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.150
 at the young he is going to post buy ling 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:49.180
 opponent who very boldly went to 3 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.639
 command centers immediately in general then not 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.909
 quite clear why he decided to go 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.949
 damn boske understand what he saw 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:59.409
 he saw a properly set ovir 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:01.690
 lord 3 command center that's what's up 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:04.449
 what does it mean to competently hang 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.789
 overlord in on the map and he's very nice 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.159
 flew just where needed 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:11.530
 and as we see further sees this 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:13.630
 Overlord on here do not want or can not 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.539
 Is there something to oppose him 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:19.110
 and the kitchen is already a lot of lingala 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:21.880
 Morphine Payne begins Ling 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.919
 in such an interesting miteru in which both 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.400
 rule they have a collectible 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:27.210
 versions 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.250
 as a rule more accurate in my always and what 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.840
 sends now he was already nba become 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.669
 opponent to start he tries with 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.310
 gnaw the bunker so as not to waste bane on 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:38.460
 Well, it turns out of course, but with a huge 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.770
 labor both will be spent here 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.050
 spent 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.759
 he has two nozzles and reactors and further judging by 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.050
 all is lost now simply 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:46.940
 first with these ions 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.280
 because there is really nothing to fight him 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.190
 yes there is 1 min to the second will soon appear 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.930
 this is true and with crayons handle and he 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.090
 it will not be very easy but look at how 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.129
 wisely he does everything just 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.560
 wonderful Korean played on the trawl 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:02.389
 still lives the bunker but to us and not he 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.340
 very well defused the nink and now 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:06.440
 Bane and just blows up the slaves on the trawl 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.349
 blows up a bunker last hope further 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.569
 and the Frenchman thus remains without 

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:14.389
 nothing again his only hope 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:16.340
 this is Minka but honestly I don’t believe it 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:18.349
 what I want it will fall hun just 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.419
 kills worked so that's inglorious 

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:23.270
 ends his way in this game 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:27.669
 millennium farther g10 in favor of quantic 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.669
 ions favor korea team give
