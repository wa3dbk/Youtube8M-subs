00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:08.400
 good friends of the forum we are going to see a 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:11.420
 little what would be the primus lighter 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.420
 primus power light 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.950
 it says 1300 degrees centigrade of 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:21.130
 resistance to the wind that is the flame 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.470
 Well that gives us 1300 degrees Celsius 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.000
 of wind resistance good what 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.190
 First 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.740
 the container of the lighter itself is 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.530
 a plastic container with a lid to 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.630
 Pressure 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.340
 and with a sponge like the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.790
 primus aires tiles 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.610
 I do not know if you have or have had any 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.070
 then a posteriori we give it a little 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.620
 a little bit and under what would be the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.340
 lighter the lighter comes without gas 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.190
 I agree that I have done 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:58.160
 I have filled it in according who 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.160
 receive you will receive it completely full voucher 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.330
 instructions 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.330
 that come in Swedish 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.450
 in English 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.450
 in Nordic languages 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.409
 in German in French reviewing well in 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.619
 Spanish in Italian 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:27.610
 well in Portuguese here and finally in 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:31.360
 Castilian touch the eggs good 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.980
 explains simply and exclusively that a 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.710
 little of the lighter as it works as 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.100
 fill in fill instructions for 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.180
 use it and the basic warnings 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.390
 because they do not leave 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.660
 Do not leave it within the reach of children and 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.660
 the rest 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.869
 a detail 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.329
 Do not expose to temperatures higher than 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.229
 50 degrees centigrade or direct light 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:01.600
 of the sun prolonged and not 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.750
 keep on for more than 10 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.530
 seconds 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.080
 and I received it because I read it whole not 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.440
 we do not need weird languages 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.280
 let's see simple exclusively method 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.990
 filling 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.160
 here we have what would be the valve 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.160
 it's here 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.840
 this is the filling valve 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.640
 the flame regulator 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.700
 in agreement 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.720
 we simply give what we 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.670
 it would be filling we can see it here 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.260
 of agreement here you will see what 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.700
 It is totally full 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.489
 Y 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.750
 we regulate the flame also around here 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.989
 maybe the only downside to this one I want 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.970
 is that the screwdriver to use has 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.030
 that be a bit specific then 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.490
 nothing 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:04.270
 look at it well because it's interesting the 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:06.730
 lighter comes with a gasket to put 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.030
 a linebacker that already comes as standard if 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.830
 we can remove if we do not want it worth 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.140
 rubber then good for 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.710
 Take it to the doll and other things will go 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.890
 all right 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.950
 protected with a rubber base the truth 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.120
 is that very resistant and that can be 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.069
 remove according 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.810
 here has this symbol of plus and minus 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.300
 is to tighten what would be the board of 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.860
 rubber in this is what the frame would be 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.620
 as for the lighter he has no more 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:40.080
 secret this is the push button and the flame 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.080
 come out here we are going to see it 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.330
 in agreement the flame has no more secret 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.069
 as I tell you it is regulated by this base of 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.069
 here or more or less 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.350
 it is already indicated more 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:00.270
 it's up - it's down and the two arrows 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.270
 of address if we want more 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.090
 from here to there if we want less 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.510
 from here to there there is no more 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.510
 secrets 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.250
 as you see 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.310
 is 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.030
 to medium mode 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.940
 a detail you have that correct despite 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.910
 from being a lighter 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.520
 It is a piece 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.800
 not delicate but that has to be used 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.050
 Well, with patience, we can not be 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:36.090
 giving him clac clac clac no or we give him 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.010
 gently and if we see that it does not catch the 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.950
 first then we give a second 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.230
 Sometimes it's like the lighters with which 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.910
 We defended butane before agreement 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.860
 that make a spark the spark to ignite 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.529
 gas and other sometimes if the jet 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.099
 gas is very strong because 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:54.719
 he turns it off turn off the spark then 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:57.439
 so let's have a little patience, 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:05:00.980
 I say that I do not even two seconds 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:03.560
 but let's do it then 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.900
 let's not start pam pam pam pam pam 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.610
 because if the first language is valid 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.490
 times to learn but we can 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:14.090
 charge us then so let's try what 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.160
 well because it's an element that is 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.380
 approved at 3,000 meters in height and 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.990
 works perfectly then then 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.630
 Well, it 's very interesting because of that detail 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.300
 the material if it is always one of the 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.030
 things that I emphasize if what 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.440
 we treat well that is if we give it the use 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.800
 for which it is conceived is going to 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:39.290
 hold and it goes and it will take us out of a 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:42.160
 I 'm always worried if we treat it badly and 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.080
 we click on it well 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.220
 like new when the truth is not 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.590
 it works then you hear that 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.990
 This lighter seems to me about 18 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.050
 euros, well, I think it's worth 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:58.170
 pity there are other variants other qualities 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.060
 and different prices and other brands this 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.340
 for me it is one of the best 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.490
 this in conjunction with the highlander 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.760
 He is one of the best and I think that his 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.000
 investment is more than justified 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.610
 Well, we've already seen it 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.120
 we have already seen how it works 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:19.940
 fill in and so on, let's move on to 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:22.400
 tests of this and the other products 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.200
 good to tell you that whoever wins this lot 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.530
 from my point of view they are lots very 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.530
 nice 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:34.740
 and from my opinion it is solved the 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.969
 fire theme quite a way 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.769
 definitively almost no 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:40.839
 obviously it is always better 

00:06:38.769 --> 00:06:44.529
 bring more useful to make fire but 

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:46.050
 we go in the point of view they take you out in 

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:48.840
 a bolus 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.900
 even more than other methods more 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.360
 popular but more difficult 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.550
 such as fine style 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.370
 or other kitchens 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.470
 I do not expect anything to be clear 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:03.560
 I hope you like the video and that 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:06.240
 you continue to see the tests because 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.780
 from the point of view the charities a 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.780
 hug friends
