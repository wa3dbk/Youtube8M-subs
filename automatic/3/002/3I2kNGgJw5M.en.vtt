00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.840
 todays 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:16.260
 First of all, very, very sorry that we 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.320
 Of course in the condition of winning it all for 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.859
 This made the first time we played better 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.640
 scored two goals a second half a little 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.020
 changed 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.780
 drawing almost wanted take 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.900
 so how to catch and we are very close to 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.040
 Tomatoes god whose gate did not hit 23 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.430
 effects ask no one 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:44.310
 bring but at the end 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:48.470
 Sorry missed his goal 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:51.140
 watering can results 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.260
 Not a word to be appointed earlier 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.860
 penalty is our gate and we are already against 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.790
 I lose at first I don't want anything 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.880
 say act we have a curtain 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:08.090
 means a penalty at our gate 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:11.930
 same moment fearless and therefore 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.360
 on there double fell 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.800
 standards 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:22.870
 the whole team keep track for its length here 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:26.820
 but none the less 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:30.670
 what deserved got can't be given 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:36.430
 shot to serve the ball all 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:39.880
 the gate area passed it give it that 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:46.720
 we got it for now 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:48.760
 capable of such a result question letters 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.440
 rick and tarot company your colleague now 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.510
 said that if they won it was 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.950
 it would not be a deserved victory 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:04.510
 deserved by swords 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:06.790
 your unique its why 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.010
 unfairly not if you lived 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.090
 playing or less minds penalty not 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:20.970
 beat this season only halvatus rump 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.970
 but you have three or four questions 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.430
 question question why people decide 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.580

 a miracle which 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.650
 decided nothing get played yes 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.290
 did everyone notice 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:42.540
 charge a high enough level one 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.540
 not guilty in the same penalty 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:55.530
 of course help him out in straight 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.530
 we need to make beans at once 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.650
 that moment seems very good 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:12.930
