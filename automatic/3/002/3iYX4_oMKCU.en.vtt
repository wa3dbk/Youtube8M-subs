 very often tries to feel any 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.219

 slender av out last of and other heresy 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.699
 because real horror scares 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.449
 the atmosphere they are so that the player is nothing

 game from the Ukrainian studio action forms 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.370
 which in our opinion had every chance 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.800
 become 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.960
 and the house has its time but somehow did not work out 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.480

 ship and his crew at the time of arrival 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.130
 the protagonist ship is pretty 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.560
 froze and on this hero all the time you need 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.020

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.920
 and watch out for each new

 good graphics and good stories 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.320
 Fourth place gets the game 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.540
 made to the work of horror genius 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.210
 howard lovecraft many have guessed 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.640
 what is this game and those who have not yet understood 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.740
 it's about call of cthulhu dark corner 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.500
 mdf game is just the perfect example 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.390
 present horror strange outlook 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.670
 tuning horror and fear 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.880
 the whole city is not that people have no fish and 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.530
 ominous silence of the street with mau besides 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.210
 The usual health in the game is such 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.729
 factor as a psychological state 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.290
 hero and if he is too long 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.580
 look at something terrible or 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.780
 causing panic 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.150
 then under certain circumstances 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.010
 may even commit suicide 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.709
 it doesn't sound too scary but you 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.840
 try to go through but discuss it afterwards 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.500
 does she deserve a place in our top 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.500
 or not 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.840
 bronze from us gets 1 part grandfather space 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.300
 a game that was and will be one of 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.730
 the scariest games where monsters are all 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.070
 only part of what scares and scares 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.020
 the atmosphere is strongest here 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.170
 doom and the realization that no one 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.580
 except you yourself will not help especially 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.250
 well in the game managed to realize 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.210
 feeling that somewhere on the ship is still 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.280
 have a life 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.160
 the hope that someone else survived and 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.720
 at the same time feeling lonely 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.290
 weapons of course helps to deal with 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.360
 monsters 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.700
 but sometimes it is not immediately input 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.430
 after the unexpected appearance of the monster and 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.920
 despite the fact that 2 more license numbers came out 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.050
 parts of the first can be called the most 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.050
 scary and fluid and series 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.540
 second place we give 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.760
 game amnesia dark descent game which 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.710
 set an example of how to do 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.380
 a horror in which an ordinary person 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.510
 afraid of monsters and running from them at you 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.700
 No gun is not to machine 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.190
 solve the problem in a quick flashlight only 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.740
 legs and doors behind which you can 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.750
 hide and precisely because this game 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.180
 was so let's say a pioneer in such 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.660
 type of horror we put it on the second 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.030
 a place 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.990
 penumbra amnesia's predecessors were 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.720
 by experiment 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.910
 amnezia, however, was bringing to mind the idea 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.400
 penumbra laid it allowed 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.920
 create something new scary and very 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.020
 quality well and then it went and went 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.280
 Now almost all horror such 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.280
 for which it is very insulting 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.500
 first place is gold or the worst 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.990
 series in our opinion silent hill of course 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.930
 we are talking about classic parts with 1 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.540
 4 is so good to scare as 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.040
 the japanese nobody can 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.720
 the atmosphere of all four parts is probably 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.030
 the worst thing in the world 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.610
 computer games and the second part became 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.620
 a masterpiece both from the plot point of view so 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.250
 and in terms of heightening fear and 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.380
 fly away 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.170
 remember your emotions when you first 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.360
 have gone through at least one of these parts and you 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.420
 agree that in the first place on the right 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.770
 Sits a series of silent hill masterpiece 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.770
 all-time horror
