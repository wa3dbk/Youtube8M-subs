00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
collection I'm going to be using the

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.230 
collection I'm going to be using the
bump<00:00:16.539> sassy<00:00:17.020> which<00:00:17.830> is<00:00:18.010> six<00:00:18.310> inches<00:00:18.640> long<00:00:18.910> and

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
bump sassy which is six inches long and

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.050 
bump sassy which is six inches long and
it's<00:00:19.689> a<00:00:19.779> perfect<00:00:20.289> length<00:00:20.500> so<00:00:21.460> I'm<00:00:21.669> going<00:00:22.029> to

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
it's a perfect length so I'm going to

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.749 
it's a perfect length so I'm going to
get<00:00:22.300> started<00:00:22.509> by<00:00:22.900> applying<00:00:23.199> a<00:00:23.679> few<00:00:24.009> tracks<00:00:24.460> at

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
get started by applying a few tracks at

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.540 
get started by applying a few tracks at
the<00:00:24.939> nape<00:00:25.119> area<00:00:25.619> at<00:00:26.619> this<00:00:26.769> time<00:00:26.829> I'm<00:00:27.249> going<00:00:27.279> to

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
the nape area at this time I'm going to

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.060 
the nape area at this time I'm going to
split<00:00:27.880> the<00:00:28.119> well<00:00:28.300> this<00:00:29.140> will<00:00:29.320> provide<00:00:29.619> even

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
split the well this will provide even

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.360 
split the well this will provide even
distribution<00:00:30.429> as<00:00:30.939> I<00:00:30.999> lay<00:00:31.390> the<00:00:31.569> wefts<00:00:31.779> in<00:00:32.050> I

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:32.370 
distribution as I lay the wefts in I

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.670 
distribution as I lay the wefts in I
simply<00:00:33.370> place<00:00:33.520> the<00:00:33.790> razor<00:00:34.000> between<00:00:34.810> the<00:00:35.020> two

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
simply place the razor between the two

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:46.110 
simply place the razor between the two
rows<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:37.030> I<00:00:37.120> just<00:00:37.300> pull<00:00:37.510> down<00:00:37.540> I<00:00:45.060> apply<00:00:46.060> the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
rows and I just pull down I apply the

00:00:46.120 --> 00:01:07.460 
rows and I just pull down I apply the
glue<00:00:46.540> to<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:46.870> west<00:00:47.110> serves

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.130 

so<00:01:08.470> I<00:01:08.530> continued<00:01:09.040> up<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.220> back<00:01:09.490> of<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:09.790> head

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
so I continued up the back of the head

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:20.420 
so I continued up the back of the head
plays<00:01:11.140> in<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.470> West<00:01:11.710> almost<00:01:12.250> an<00:01:12.460> inch<00:01:12.610> apart

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
so as I work my way up the back of the

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.980 
so as I work my way up the back of the
head<00:01:23.770> you<00:01:24.100> guys<00:01:24.580> can<00:01:24.910> see<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:25.330> natural<00:01:25.540> layers

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
head you guys can see the natural layers

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.400 
head you guys can see the natural layers
that<00:01:26.260> have<00:01:26.410> been<00:01:26.620> formed<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:28.600> is<00:01:28.810> absolutely

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410

that have been formed this is absolutely
beautiful<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:32.320> fifth<00:01:32.560> inch<00:01:32.800> length<00:01:33.130> is<00:01:33.340> a

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
beautiful the fifth inch length is a

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.180 
beautiful the fifth inch length is a
unique<00:01:34.000> length<00:01:34.360> most<00:01:35.290> companies<00:01:35.680> don't<00:01:36.040> have

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
unique length most companies don't have

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:52.620 
unique length most companies don't have
it<00:01:50.430> I'm<00:01:51.430> not<00:01:51.640> going<00:01:51.820> to<00:01:51.910> create<00:01:52.090> her<00:01:52.360> closure

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
it I'm not going to create her closure

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.380 
it I'm not going to create her closure
directly<00:01:53.560> in<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:53.770> middle<00:01:54.100> we're<00:01:54.940> gonna<00:01:55.090> do<00:01:55.270> it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
directly in the middle we're gonna do it

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.230 
directly in the middle we're gonna do it
off<00:01:55.509> to<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.869> sides<00:01:56.110> like<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.759> at<00:02:00.850> this<00:02:00.970> time

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
off to the sides like so at this time

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.450 
off to the sides like so at this time
you'll<00:02:01.450> see<00:02:01.690> me<00:02:01.869> apply<00:02:02.200> which<00:02:02.560> is<00:02:02.770> just<00:02:03.040> to<00:02:03.280> one

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
you'll see me apply which is just to one

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:22.540 
you'll see me apply which is just to one
side<00:02:03.700> in<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.090> horseshoe<00:02:04.479> pattern

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.720 

I<00:02:22.750> must<00:02:23.750> emphasize<00:02:23.990> just<00:02:24.350> how<00:02:24.950> much<00:02:25.310> hair<00:02:25.580> is

more than enough at this time I will
begin<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.460> go<00:02:40.610> around<00:02:40.850> in<00:02:41.000> a<00:02:41.090> circular<00:02:41.360> pattern

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
begin to go around in a circular pattern

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:59.380 
begin to go around in a circular pattern
because<00:02:42.860> this<00:02:43.070> is<00:02:43.220> my<00:02:43.370> closure<00:02:43.640> point<00:02:58.390> he

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
because this is my closure point he

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.060 
because this is my closure point he
wasn't<00:02:59.540> just<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.990> little<00:03:00.110> bit<00:03:00.350> of<00:03:00.440> spritz<00:03:00.830> to

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
wasn't just a little bit of spritz to

help<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.490> dry<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.760> glue<00:03:16.030> at<00:03:17.030> this<00:03:17.210> point<00:03:17.570> I'll

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
help to dry the glue at this point I'll

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.620 
help to dry the glue at this point I'll
make<00:03:18.170> sure<00:03:18.560> that<00:03:18.770> I<00:03:18.830> lay<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.340> wefts<00:03:19.580> very<00:03:20.030> very

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
make sure that I lay the wefts very very

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:36.240 
make sure that I lay the wefts very very
close<00:03:20.900> together<00:03:21.260> so<00:03:21.620> there's<00:03:21.980> no<00:03:22.190> space<00:03:32.020> I
