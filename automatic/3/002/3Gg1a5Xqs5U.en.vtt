00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.630 
tuned for that I decided to use a white
one<00:01:49.020> because<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.439> provides<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.860> nice<00:01:50.130> contrast

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640

but<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.329> would<00:01:54.479> have<00:01:54.539> been<00:01:54.630> much<00:01:54.960> nicer<00:01:55.020> if<00:01:55.649> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
but it would have been much nicer if the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.760 
but it would have been much nicer if the
phone<00:01:55.979> was<00:01:56.159> actually<00:01:56.460> white<00:01:56.640> itself<00:01:57.149> Oh
