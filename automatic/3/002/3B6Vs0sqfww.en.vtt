00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.460 
it's going to be like really interesting
games<00:00:29.670> like<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> lot<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.449> groups<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:30.929> strong

games like a lot of groups like strong

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.680 
games like a lot of groups like strong
teams<00:00:31.740> also<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:33.090> everybody<00:00:33.450> put<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.170 
I think that other teams with the
younger<00:00:39.989> player<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.469> going<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.739> give<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> big

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
younger player is going to give a big

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.000 
younger player is going to give a big

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
group and I think it's going to be like

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.320 
group and I think it's going to be like
for<00:01:15.200> first<00:01:16.200> first<00:01:16.830> three<00:01:17.009> teams<00:01:17.310> from<00:01:18.119> my

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
for first first three teams from my

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.359 
for first first three teams from my
opinion<00:01:18.689> they<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.140> same<00:01:19.380> points<00:01:20.189> and

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
opinion they have the same points and

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.870 
opinion they have the same points and
just<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.930> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.229> different<00:01:22.409> just

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
just it's going to be different just

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.310 
just it's going to be different just
with<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> points<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.479> game<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.869> mean<00:01:25.110> I

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
with the points in the game I mean I

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.960 
with the points in the game I mean I
think<00:01:25.979> there's<00:01:26.369> going<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.580> be<00:01:26.610> like<00:01:26.909> really

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
think there's going to be like really

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
think there's going to be like really
big<00:01:27.479> nest<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.650> think<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.549> spin<00:01:29.970> it's<00:01:30.780> been

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
big nest so I think that spin it's been

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.640 
big nest so I think that spin it's been
going<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.290> control<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.920> group<00:01:32.130> but<00:01:33.259> friends<00:01:34.259> a

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
going to control the group but friends a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.640 
going to control the group but friends a
really<00:01:35.460> good<00:01:35.610> team<00:01:35.820> between<00:01:36.240> e<00:01:36.270> also<00:01:36.869> i<00:01:37.110> think

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
really good team between e also i think

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.880 
really good team between e also i think
it's<00:01:38.040> spain<00:01:38.729> supposed<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.420> win<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:39.930> not<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> lot

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
it's spain supposed to win but not a lot

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.999 
it's spain supposed to win but not a lot
like<00:01:41.369> by<00:01:41.790> four<00:01:42.060> or<00:01:42.090> five<00:01:42.420> points<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:43.259> i<00:01:43.710> think

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
like by four or five points and i think

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.609 
like by four or five points and i think
that<00:01:44.189> they're<00:01:44.850> better<00:01:44.880> than<00:01:45.299> them<00:01:45.899> branch<00:01:46.200> but

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
that they're better than them branch but

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.310 
that they're better than them branch but
it<00:01:47.610> depends<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.240> know<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.229> the

group<00:02:30.920> is<00:02:31.069> for<00:02:31.510> my<00:02:32.510> opinions<00:02:32.930> when<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.290> not

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
group is for my opinions when you not

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.590 
group is for my opinions when you not
not<00:02:34.250> because<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.730> twain<00:02:34.940> on<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.360> queen<00:02:35.569> is

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
not because the twain on the queen is

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.740 
not because the twain on the queen is
there<00:02:36.049> but<00:02:36.350> I<00:02:37.180> think<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.239> it's<00:02:38.420> going<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.630> be

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
there but I think that it's going to be

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:52.750 
there but I think that it's going to be
like<00:02:38.930> really<00:02:39.170> real<00:02:39.860> nice<00:02:40.100> group<00:02:49.480> b<00:02:50.480> win
