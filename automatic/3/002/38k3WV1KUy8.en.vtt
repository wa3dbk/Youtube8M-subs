 gameplay videos these are not in

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.700
 already over an hour's material from the 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:32.730

 hard disk of your ps4 next to the 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.079
 it appeared that ps3 should be more 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.390
 However, content to be no 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.120
 In addition, the players may serve themselves 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.700
 japanese via a ps4 facebook friends 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.229
 and buddies are already collecting naughty dog 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.940
 ideas for performance than two 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.820
 at least the community strategy 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.680
 oliver jewel dubbing treuberg 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.720
 I do not know anything about that yet 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.560
 today 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.170
 We're helping everyone with that now 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.000
 uncleanties clarified or even 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.740
 the last player all the details 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.760
 from the intro footballer of time and 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.800
 also in this contribution there are 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.080
 news about a nordi village brand 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.790
 now it's about uncharted so 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.860
 not about the next game but about 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.780
 the film circulated for quite some time 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.540
 Rumors about a realverfilmung yet 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.740
 now on time 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.640
 Unfortunately, the project is still in 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.260
 the children's shoes 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.580
 that with the shooting but soon 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.230
 the insured is started 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.780
 responsible director of the film 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.480
 eschborn promised in an interview 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.650
 the kill the boss director 20:15 with 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.270
 to start the filming 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.270
 according to the latest news that even one 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.070
 on 10 june 20 16 is supposed to be the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.190
 uncharted stripes in theaters 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.580
 but there is a tiny problem 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.290
 there still 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.940
 still not sure who is in the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.590
 role of agent rake so that 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.369
 main protagonist of the video game series 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.140
 hatched 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.790
 My last conversation is Michael 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.120
 Fassbender and Mark Wahlberg have been 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.519
 his 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.170
 so you can choose between a magneto and a 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.610
 bad max payne 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.799
 The Borderlands series is already such a 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.540
 small phenomenon barely believing that 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.760
 I'm a shooter if we go now 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.620
 Again, graphics and so much roleplaying 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.930
 elements against things representative like 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.519
 claim call of duty or battlefield 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.170
 but the success could give it 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.640
 semi-rights and therefore assure the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.019
 developer that the release of the 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.090
 third partly safe like that 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.430
 random item in the box 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.260
 this assured executable user already 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.360
 again around opposite game informer with 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.239
 the words or lance reddick come 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.940
 provided the world does not sink 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.910
 it could be astrologers 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.829
 already claudia thorn but how do you see that 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.540
 you absolutely need a borderlands 3 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.700
 Or do you prefer bombast 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.930
 shooter rants call of duty for 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.790
 by the way, we have borderlands fans 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.500
 you can prepare a desired one 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.569
 namely among other gamescom tickets 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.859
 and the new borderlands tip risks 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.730

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:12.739

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.739

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.629
 the ea and bioware recently on the 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.549

 wanna let players do that 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.190
 perfect result with mix 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.169

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.329

 North American gamblers are allowed 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.569
 at least two days earlier 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.340
 Adventure travel is a reason to hope 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.530
 there is at least from the theory 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.940
 may be recent interview 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.769
 became with who namely on one 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.900
 multiplayer-part addressed and one 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.579
 there was no clear no about it 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.680
 Riis not too long ago 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.049
 he was then the social networks 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.500
 the publisher's topic basket in the eye too 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.269
 to keep 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.739
 now dragon age fans dare 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.209
 of course , whether we are on the 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.799
 gamescom new information on 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.220
 Multiplayer of the suspended game too 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.599
 expect 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.329
 Of course we'll keep you on that 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.530
 ongoing from a postponed 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.819
 blockbuster to the next battlefield 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.249
 is supposed to derive now 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:17.660
 not on the 21st of october on the market 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:19.579
 but sometime early 20 15 clock 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.410
 this fact should not be painful 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.550
 only for fans of the series are above all 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.990
 with the responsible behind 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.120
 battlefield hotline just helps 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.830
 be neat on gentle 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.539
 finally one wanted to be with ea 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.789
 annual perfection places 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:33.229
 but obviously needs puff cake 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.880
 the good piece much longer 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.740
 as expected after the quick 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.270
 release of the first beta 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.280
 Most players are confident that 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.090
 Newest ballack in the forest in her hands 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.039
 to be able to hold 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.250
 well as the benefits the game 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:48.020
 why me, patrick soderlund explained 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.370
 by the way, in a new interview that 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.500
 the coming of development 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:56.389
 Battlefield projects at three years 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.070
 do not raise the only one none 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.990
 month card talk to him 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.699
 I use it if they do not want to do it 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.990
 you again adjust the sound 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.370
 and to this technical patzer 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.050
 unbelievably sorry we hope that 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.639
 we still had fun on the show 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.830
 we are back from now on 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.599
 completely set to music for 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.710

 We are looking forward to your feedback 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.320
 in the hot weather, I'm sitting on the 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:20.479
 balcony and the game 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.979
 the tv is running like every day just shit 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.900
 because the German tv program nothing 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.669
 The hartz iv tv has better to offer 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.169
 why do not you have your own transmitter? 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.030
 then something would be alright in the 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.409
 television come thank you age we give 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.570

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.500
 Thank you 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:55.450
