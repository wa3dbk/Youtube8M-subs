 of the great travel enduro user 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.170
 the engine of the previous models david 170 cubic centimeters offered a 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.950
 excellent thrust in every travel condition and in all situations 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.150
 guide 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.560
 now the new engine that equips the r 1200 gs and r 1200 gs 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.700
 adventure raises the bar by offering more thrust at low rpm 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.080
 broader hours ctp rizzo greater extension is an overall improvement 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.880
 driving pleasure 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.890
 thanks to the 110 horsepower and the maximum operating speed extended in 500 laps

 the valve control takes place through very light and highly balanced rockers 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.849
 resistant and high regimes 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.259
 thanks to the radial configuration of the four valves 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:38.249
 it has been possible to realize a combustion chamber antaldi very sign 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:39.559
 compact 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.879

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:07.079
 the engine delivers a maximum power of 110 horsepower at 7750g per minute 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:12.439
 and a maximum torque of 120 newton meter at 6000 rpm 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.699
 thermal stability even in extreme conditions is ensured by a 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.749
 radiator for the origin 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:24.569
 and modifications bring more torque and power over the entire range of profits 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.239
 transmission is ensured by the 6-speed gearbox 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.810
 which had been revisited in the 2008 model year 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:37.840

 optional for the 9 girls 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:41.449
 the system intervenes on the preload to die of the shock absorbers adapting the 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.169
 suspension response to different operating conditions 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.770
 in polystyrene reducing the possibility 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.349
 that the suspension will dance at the end of the race
