condition<00:03:22.799> like<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.160> so<00:03:24.150> this<00:03:24.239> one<00:03:24.419> you<00:03:24.510> run

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
condition like that so this one you run

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.930 
condition like that so this one you run

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
bang bang back to gears but you just go

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.110 
bang bang back to gears but you just go
to<00:03:37.049> trial<00:03:37.349> the<00:03:37.560> break<00:03:37.799> is<00:03:38.010> you're<00:03:38.190> losing

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
to trial the break is you're losing

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.879 
to trial the break is you're losing

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
brake drive it change direction and up

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.830 
brake drive it change direction and up
back<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:43.889> second<00:03:44.250> again<00:03:44.459> for<00:03:45.209> this<00:03:45.359> side<00:03:45.599> this

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
back to second again for this side this

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.830 
back to second again for this side this
tight<00:03:46.079> left<00:03:46.760> there's<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.880> lot<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.269> spots<00:03:48.569> on

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
tight left there's a lot of spots on

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.250 
tight left there's a lot of spots on
this<00:03:49.049> circuit<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:50.069> are<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.519> similar<00:03:51.049> to<00:03:52.049> the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
this circuit that are so similar to the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.740 
this circuit that are so similar to the
old<00:03:52.410> Nurburgring<00:03:53.130> in<00:03:53.310> Germany<00:03:53.730> yeah<00:03:54.480> and

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
old Nurburgring in Germany yeah and

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.059 
old Nurburgring in Germany yeah and
there's<00:03:55.109> a<00:03:55.169> lot<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.410> spots<00:03:55.620> that<00:03:55.680> are<00:03:55.769> a<00:03:55.859> lot

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
there's a lot of spots that are a lot

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.430 
there's a lot of spots that are a lot
like<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.459> mole<00:03:56.669> yeah

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
like the mole yeah

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.980 
like the mole yeah
and<00:03:58.160> that<00:03:58.640> French<00:03:58.970> classics<00:03:59.540> got<00:03:59.720> some<00:03:59.900> of

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
and that French classics got some of

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.900 
and that French classics got some of
that<00:04:00.050> Road<00:04:00.320> course<00:04:00.680> section<00:04:01.130> on<00:04:01.250> yeah<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:01.670> mean

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
that Road course section on yeah I mean

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.600 
that Road course section on yeah I mean
again<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:03.260> level<00:04:03.590> of<00:04:03.680> commitment<00:04:04.010> when

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
again the level of commitment when

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.130 
again the level of commitment when
you've<00:04:04.760> got<00:04:04.970> nowhere<00:04:05.240> to<00:04:05.450> go

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
you've got nowhere to go

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.140 
you've got nowhere to go
it's<00:04:06.710> just<00:04:06.920> extraordinary<00:04:07.190> that<00:04:07.490> you<00:04:07.580> you

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
it's just extraordinary that you you

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.470 
it's just extraordinary that you you
can't<00:04:08.420> really<00:04:08.690> explain<00:04:09.130> how<00:04:10.130> much<00:04:10.480> that

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
can't really explain how much that

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.700 
can't really explain how much that
heightens<00:04:11.930> your<00:04:12.020> senses

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
heightens your senses

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.190 
heightens your senses
it<00:04:13.160> does<00:04:13.400> it<00:04:13.580> makes<00:04:13.790> you<00:04:13.970> it<00:04:14.270> makes<00:04:15.080> your

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
it does it makes you it makes your

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.140 
it does it makes you it makes your
judgments<00:04:15.740> so<00:04:15.950> sharp<00:04:16.310> doesn't<00:04:16.850> it's

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
judgments so sharp doesn't it's

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.820 
judgments so sharp doesn't it's
unbelievable<00:04:17.900> how<00:04:18.049> street<00:04:18.380> circuit<00:04:18.709> does

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
unbelievable how street circuit does

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.440 
unbelievable how street circuit does
that<00:04:19.040> and<00:04:20.110> yeah<00:04:21.110> it<00:04:21.470> really<00:04:22.130> really<00:04:22.370> does<00:04:22.550> sell

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
that and yeah it really really does sell

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.720 
that and yeah it really really does sell

do it better they want to do it faster
and<00:04:41.930> and<00:04:42.650> this<00:04:42.830> is<00:04:42.890> a<00:04:43.010> perfect<00:04:43.460> example<00:04:43.550> of

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
and and this is a perfect example of

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.320 
and and this is a perfect example of
that<00:04:45.280> and<00:04:46.280> I<00:04:46.340> think<00:04:46.400> it'd<00:04:46.640> be<00:04:46.760> a<00:04:46.850> shame<00:04:47.150> to<00:04:47.480> deny

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
that and I think it'd be a shame to deny

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.610 
that and I think it'd be a shame to deny
the<00:04:50.330> opportunity<00:04:50.840> to<00:04:50.930> do<00:04:51.050> these<00:04:51.230> things<00:04:51.440> in

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
the opportunity to do these things in

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.040 
the opportunity to do these things in
life<00:04:51.830> you<00:04:52.040> know<00:04:52.160> so<00:04:52.970> many<00:04:53.240> things<00:04:53.480> in<00:04:53.630> life<00:04:53.660> now
