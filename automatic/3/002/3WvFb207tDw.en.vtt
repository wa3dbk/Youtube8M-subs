it calling it the lightning connection
this<00:03:14.799> of<00:03:14.979> course<00:03:15.010> gives<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.579> iPhone<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.329> the

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
this of course gives the iPhone and the

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.170 
this of course gives the iPhone and the
cord<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.840> ability<00:03:17.319> to<00:03:17.560> be<00:03:17.769> slimmer<00:03:18.190> but<00:03:18.940> an

cord the ability to be slimmer but an

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.789 
cord the ability to be slimmer but an
important<00:03:19.569> point<00:03:19.750> this<00:03:19.989> is<00:03:20.139> not<00:03:20.319> yet

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
important point this is not yet

universal and thus if you lose the cable

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.110 
universal and thus if you lose the cable
it<00:03:23.500> might<00:03:23.680> be<00:03:23.859> hard<00:03:24.099> to<00:03:24.250> find<00:03:24.400> replacement

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
it might be hard to find replacement

it might be hard to find replacement
especially<00:03:25.479> if<00:03:25.540> you're<00:03:25.659> the<00:03:25.780> type<00:03:25.959> of<00:03:25.989> person

generic<00:03:28.449> cables<00:03:28.810> every<00:03:29.049> now<00:03:29.169> and<00:03:29.379> then<00:03:29.500> if<00:03:29.680> you

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 
generic cables every now and then if you

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:31.740 
generic cables every now and then if you
do<00:03:30.310> lose<00:03:30.579> your<00:03:30.760> cable<00:03:31.150> so<00:03:31.299> something<00:03:31.629> to<00:03:31.720> think

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
do lose your cable so something to think

phone<00:04:28.570> is<00:04:28.810> really<00:04:29.560> becoming<00:04:29.830> necessary<00:04:30.130> these

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
phone is really becoming necessary these

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.390

or<00:04:33.430> below<00:04:33.910> it<00:04:34.810> may<00:04:35.020> be<00:04:35.080> worth<00:04:35.380> looking<00:04:35.620> into<00:04:35.950> an

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
or below it may be worth looking into an

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.760 
or below it may be worth looking into an
upgrade<00:04:37.120> to<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.390> iphone<00:04:37.420> 5<00:04:38.050> just<00:04:38.320> because<00:04:38.650> of
