let's say with a double discs and they

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.300 
let's say with a double discs and they
also<00:01:16.470> call<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> cording<00:01:17.460> foot<00:01:19.100> then<00:01:20.100> we<00:01:20.189> have

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
also call it a cording foot then we have

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.410 
also call it a cording foot then we have
here<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.030> button<00:01:22.009> foot<00:01:23.009> here<00:01:23.670> that's

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
here this is the button foot here that's

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.580 
here this is the button foot here that's
use<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.659> conjunction<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.350> little

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
use in conjunction with this little

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.429 
use in conjunction with this little
plate<00:01:25.820> I<00:01:26.820> haven't<00:01:27.630> tried<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.840> out<00:01:27.990> yet<00:01:28.049> but

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
plate I haven't tried this out yet but

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.410 
plate I haven't tried this out yet but
there<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.920> apparently<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.310> button<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:30.060> goes

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
there is apparently a button that goes

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.390 
there is apparently a button that goes
between<00:01:30.600> here<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.079> holds<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.560> down<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.310> you

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
between here and holds it down and you

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.429 
between here and holds it down and you
adjust<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.880> width<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> zigzag<00:01:34.020> pattern

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
adjust the width like a zigzag pattern

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.399 
adjust the width like a zigzag pattern
so<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.829> actually<00:01:34.979> sew<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:36.119> two<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.229> holes

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
so it actually sew in two of the holes

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.230 
so it actually sew in two of the holes
of<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.560> button<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.400> saves<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.820> from<00:01:38.939> yes

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
of the button so it saves you from yes

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.569 
of the button so it saves you from yes
using<00:01:39.630> your<00:01:39.900> needle<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.259> thread<00:01:40.549> with<00:01:41.549> your
