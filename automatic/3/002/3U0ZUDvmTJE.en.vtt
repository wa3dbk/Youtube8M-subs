00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.920
 occasion is that they teach him to climb 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.980
 files to play 5 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.200
 and play singles a virtual hard drive 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.880
 that offers space of 5 gigabytes 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.359
 for storage 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.029
 and apart you can download applications for 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:27.019
 smartphones and tablets for 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.480
 download the data files from the same 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.240
 page 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.610
 in the advantage of having a hard drive 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.220
 virtual is that you can transport your 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.590
 files rather you can see your 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.960
 files from any computer without 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.410
 need to sell them carrying as a 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.800
 usb 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.140

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.110
 we get this 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.660
 well we're going down here where it says 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.100
 sign up for a free 5 account 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.900
 gigabytes click 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.900
 and we have to re-register 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.850
 well let's start again to live 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.850

 select mobile device 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.490
 because as a sign register 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.950
 okay 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.770
 is going to tell you to download this 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.300
 application and download it 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.300
 it's very light, basically 14 megabytes and 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.370
 fast download in my case a little bit 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.960
 less than a minute 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.090
 and we install 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.090
 I come back when the room is going 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.920
 well once the application down 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.940
 installed you will get this box of 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.860
 dialogue in it you are going to put 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.590
 in the email with which you registered and 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.040
 the password but prior to this you have 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.110
 that have 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.080
 has confirmed from your email 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.290
 electronic 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.290
 using the service 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.000
 yeah well go to your email if 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:00.030
 it does not appear in the main folder of 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.520
 emails looking for unwanted files 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.360
 and the valid ones to be able to use this 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.490
 service 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.110
 well once we have registered 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.300
 email in the link where 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.280
 we entered to appear is fine 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.890
 we record again our against 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.400
 she back to validate 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.959
 and we already have this, we do not close it because 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.330
 it will be helpful but if you want 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.980
 as well 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.980
 and minimize joel minimized 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:34.709
 I suppose you use 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.709
 jaraba hotmail.com 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.920
 and the password that we use the text 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.920
 and accept 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.129
 we wait for him to do what coghill 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.129
 we put him 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:56.510
 the name we want for the laptop 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.310
 or the cp1 and we select an icon to me 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.360
 I liked this the 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.360
 and we put next 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.260
 in this 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:12.109
 in this wizard we will select the 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.569
 desktop and we will look for the folder 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.970
 in my case but what I want to send is 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.139
 is 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.979
 we minimize 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:24.710
 as I have it the desk rather with 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.270
 this marker I open everything that is its 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.320
 desk and the folders that are in 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.760
 he selected this one 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.910
 and next 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.139
 skip view determine 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.630
 and finish again 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.670
 now 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.440
 this iconic 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.750
 you have to appear next to this 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.120
 folder that means it is 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.150
 synchronizing when finished it's going to 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.100
 appear this icon but a little 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.870
 side of the folder means that it is already 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.300
 synchronized well 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.050
 me while I go to the page to see which one 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.050
 it was synchronized already 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:07.330
 here on this page we go on the 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:10.170
 page where the log returned the login 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.170
 we go to files 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.130
 here disappears that is already 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.130
 synchronizing 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.670
 well we wait for him to carry a lot 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.740
 Charging time also depending on 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.420
 what you have but usually two 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.130
 a lot here is the folder 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.080
 if we click on her she is amazed 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.720
 now click and open 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.920
 here he tells me that there are two but they are 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.150
 loading the files 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:42.120
 perfect that does not mean that it is already 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.630
 uploaded to the archives her until she 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.630
 remove this 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.000
 well I 'm leaving and I come back when they have 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.000
 uploaded jumps 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.280
 all right 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:01.060
 in whom we click on this beautiful and 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.060
 will always be 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.560
 here we see that on this computer already 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.720
 rose this not necessarily from the 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.449
 editorial page we will see it but 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:13.930
 we see that it has already gone up 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:17.529
 to these images we can see even 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:20.770
 here from the same administrator what 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:22.810
 I recommend them is that if they want to see 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.360
 your files 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.880
 it takes to give it up on the page 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.280
 The server has already gone up but the page 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.320
 it takes me I recommend them if they want 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.020
 see your files faster in your other 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.780
 computer 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:40.290
 you download 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.120
 the same assistant but and it becomes 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.420
 analogy with this same with the same 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.830
 account 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:51.430
 and there is the computer 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:53.380
 she left the two files 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.160
 apart from a little bit more 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:07:01.009
 look for them from 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:03.589
 the other disinterest rather she 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:06.369
 that was all in this tutorial I hope that 

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:06.369
 have been helpful 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:13.249
 and well here on the page as we saw already 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.249
 the two files were uploaded 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:20.430
 well here they are only to be able to 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:23.630
 open we have here we click on in 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.940
 open and start downloading 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.940
 open with photo viewer in this 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.110
 case 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.110
 we wait for it to come down 

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:40.190
 and we can see it 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:42.740
 and there is no loss of data or anything this 

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.270
 that I like this service well I hope 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.960
 that you liked the tutorial and now 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.960
 yes, I say goodbye
