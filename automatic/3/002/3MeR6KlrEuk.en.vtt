00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
kind of cool to do this thing where you

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.329 
kind of cool to do this thing where you
bounce<00:00:34.309> off<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:34.760> g<00:00:34.970> string<00:00:35.150> a<00:00:35.300> little<00:00:35.510> bit

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:36.339 
bounce off the g string a little bit

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:47.469 
bounce off the g string a little bit
right<00:00:37.339> here<00:00:45.040> so<00:00:46.040> my<00:00:46.159> thumb<00:00:46.460> pics<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:46.970> G<00:00:47.210> and

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:47.479 
right here so my thumb pics the G and

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:53.020 
right here so my thumb pics the G and
then<00:00:48.290> I<00:00:48.409> immediately<00:00:48.589> pick<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.129> B<00:00:51.790> it's<00:00:52.790> more

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
then I immediately pick the B it's more

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.509 
then I immediately pick the B it's more
just<00:00:53.059> for<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.540> rhythmic<00:00:54.019> sound<00:00:54.830> and<00:00:55.129> the<00:00:55.220> you

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
just for the rhythmic sound and the you

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:06.280 
just for the rhythmic sound and the you
know<00:00:55.610> add<00:00:55.760> some<00:00:55.970> push<00:00:56.210> to<00:00:56.449> this<00:00:56.659> to<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.260> riff

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.410 

so<00:01:07.290> again<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.799> contrary<00:01:08.760> motion<00:01:08.940> up<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
so again that contrary motion up and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:26.490 
so again that contrary motion up and
down

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.900 

so<00:01:27.500> doing<00:01:27.770> often<00:01:28.130> would<00:01:28.190> just<00:01:28.400> stay<00:01:28.580> right<00:01:28.850> in

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
so doing often would just stay right in

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:39.100 
so doing often would just stay right in
that<00:01:29.150> position<00:01:36.940> it's<00:01:37.940> a<00:01:38.060> really<00:01:38.270> easy<00:01:38.390> thing

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
that position it's a really easy thing

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.440 
that position it's a really easy thing
to<00:01:39.260> do
