but<00:01:40.619> he<00:01:40.829> will<00:01:40.979> probably<00:01:41.009> be<00:01:41.790> able<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.570> castle

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
but he will probably be able to castle

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:51.469 
but he will probably be able to castle
short<00:01:49.130> that's<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.310> tricky<00:01:50.670> decision<00:01:50.790> okay<00:01:51.390> I'm

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
short that's a tricky decision okay I'm

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.590 
short that's a tricky decision okay I'm
going<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.899> keep<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.290> Queen's<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.600> that

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
going to keep the Queen's on but that

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.219 
going to keep the Queen's on but that
wasn't<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.640> simple<00:01:57.290> simple<00:01:58.290> decision<00:01:58.710> lets<00:01:58.920> him

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
wasn't a simple simple decision lets him

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.990 
wasn't a simple simple decision lets him
so<00:02:01.229> what<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.950> he<00:02:02.189> wants<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.579> play<00:02:02.759> Knight

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
so what is this he wants to play Knight

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.530 
so what is this he wants to play Knight
f4<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.750> am

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
f4 I am

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:12.400 
f4 I am
okay

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:21.190 

and<00:02:13.370> then<00:02:13.610> g3<00:02:18.370> yeah<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:20.390> makes<00:02:20.660> sense

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
and then g3 yeah that makes sense

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.040 
and then g3 yeah that makes sense
so<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.980> already<00:02:22.370> looks<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:23.090> little<00:02:23.270> bit<00:02:23.480> like<00:02:23.660> I

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
so it already looks a little bit like I

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.270 
so it already looks a little bit like I
should<00:02:24.920> have<00:02:25.040> played<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:25.910> Queen<00:02:26.300> trade<00:02:27.280> it's

should have played the Queen trade it's

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.030 
should have played the Queen trade it's
not<00:02:28.490> not<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.540> obvious<00:02:29.750> way<00:02:30.290> I'm<00:02:30.440> going<00:02:30.860> with

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
not not that obvious way I'm going with

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.380 
not not that obvious way I'm going with
the<00:02:31.220> Queen<00:02:32.560> she<00:02:33.560> page<00:02:33.740> six<00:02:34.130> Knight<00:02:34.430> f4<00:02:35.000> Queen

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
f6 yeah okay I should have traded and I

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.020 
f6 yeah okay I should have traded and I
should<00:02:53.360> have<00:02:53.480> really<00:02:53.930> thought<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:55.280> bit<00:02:55.640> more

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
should have really thought a bit more

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.960 
should have really thought a bit more
about<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.720> really<00:02:57.710> with<00:02:57.890> concrete<00:02:58.400> move<00:02:58.790> was

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
about it really with concrete move was

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.120 
about it really with concrete move was
not<00:02:59.180> just<00:02:59.420> some<00:02:59.660> gut<00:02:59.960> feeling<00:03:00.440> decision<00:03:00.950> I

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
not just some gut feeling decision I

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.280 
not just some gut feeling decision I
would<00:03:01.820> have<00:03:02.030> seen<00:03:02.240> knighted<00:03:02.690> -<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:02.930> would<00:03:03.200> have

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
would have seen knighted - I would have

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:24.740 
would have seen knighted - I would have

reason okay now let's let's have a look
there<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:22.510> see<00:05:23.510> the<00:05:23.690> engine<00:05:24.080> correlation<00:05:25.600> so

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
there and see the engine correlation so

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.290 
there and see the engine correlation so
it's<00:05:27.110> a<00:05:27.139> pretty<00:05:27.440> typical<00:05:27.590> mo<00:05:28.250> for<00:05:28.639> cheaters<00:05:29.090> to

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
it's a pretty typical mo for cheaters to

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.920 
it's a pretty typical mo for cheaters to
play<00:05:29.510> those<00:05:29.720> crab<00:05:30.020> openings<00:05:30.560> and<00:05:31.360> then<00:05:32.360> then

that's<00:05:40.400> really<00:05:40.700> the<00:05:40.940> China<00:05:41.150> moves<00:05:41.510> I<00:05:41.750> mean<00:05:41.900> I

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
that's really the China moves I mean I

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.870 
that's really the China moves I mean I
definitely<00:05:42.590> have<00:05:42.710> compensation<00:05:43.460> for<00:05:43.700> the

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
definitely have compensation for the

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.420 
definitely have compensation for the
pawn<00:05:44.150> in<00:05:44.389> terms<00:05:45.200> of<00:05:45.380> the<00:05:45.500> bishop<00:05:45.860> pay<00:05:46.070> I<00:05:46.100> always

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
pawn in terms of the bishop pay I always

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.790 
pawn in terms of the bishop pay I always
have<00:05:46.610> that<00:05:46.760> check<00:05:47.090> which<00:05:48.020> should<00:05:48.200> be<00:05:48.289> six<00:05:48.560> long

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
have that check which should be six long

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.680 
have that check which should be six long
castles<00:05:49.220> the<00:05:49.370> computer<00:05:49.789> even<00:05:49.940> gives<00:05:50.270> black<00:05:50.510> an

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
castles the computer even gives black an

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.150 
castles the computer even gives black an
advantage<00:05:51.400> so<00:05:52.400> this<00:05:52.850> is<00:05:53.030> no<00:05:53.210> problem<00:05:53.660> at<00:05:53.810> all

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
advantage so this is no problem at all

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.460 
advantage so this is no problem at all

course<00:06:13.900> and<00:06:14.900> this<00:06:15.289> should<00:06:15.470> be<00:06:15.500> 2<00:06:15.830> or<00:06:16.280> some

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
course and this should be 2 or some

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.990 
course and this should be 2 or some
computer<00:06:16.910> move<00:06:17.419> B<00:06:17.599> should<00:06:17.780> be<00:06:17.900> 6<00:06:18.460> king<00:06:19.460> v1<00:06:19.849> is

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
computer move B should be 6 king v1 is

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.070 
computer move B should be 6 king v1 is
also<00:06:20.360> given<00:06:20.630> by<00:06:20.660> the<00:06:20.840> comp<00:06:21.910> 9<00:06:22.910> c4<00:06:23.180> takes<00:06:23.780> takes

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
also given by the comp 9 c4 takes takes

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.610 
also given by the comp 9 c4 takes takes
me<00:06:24.349> and<00:06:24.950> then<00:06:25.160> g3<00:06:25.789> this<00:06:25.970> is<00:06:26.120> this<00:06:26.720> is<00:06:26.840> funny<00:06:27.080> g3

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
me and then g3 this is this is funny g3

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.219 
me and then g3 this is this is funny g3
is<00:06:27.680> also<00:06:28.099> the<00:06:28.220> engine<00:06:28.580> move<00:06:28.760> of<00:06:28.910> course<00:06:29.080> you<00:06:30.080> go

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
is also the engine move of course you go

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:33.330 
is also the engine move of course you go
b5<00:06:30.710> and<00:06:31.070> then<00:06:31.250> then<00:06:31.520> it<00:06:31.639> will<00:06:31.820> go<00:06:31.970> g4<00:06:32.479> probably

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
b5 and then then it will go g4 probably

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.409 
b5 and then then it will go g4 probably
g4<00:06:34.340> okay<00:06:35.860> before<00:06:36.860> which<00:06:37.310> is<00:06:37.340> which<00:06:37.669> is<00:06:37.700> bad<00:06:38.030> I
