00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:30.300
 first called me Andrei Kovalev my 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.640
 Comrade such a national team still Russia 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.400
 with whom we went to the tournament and 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.020
 but he's a little older when i'm just 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.040
 got a collection on Andrei already finished 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.500
 practically your career but still 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.360
 several tournaments we are with him 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.390
 together went to the company of course 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.180
 lukoil which is the main 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.260
 sponsor of the bell tournament founders 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.260
 Andrei agreed and 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.560
 often applied closed style of reference 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.409
 combat function hides behind protection and there 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.030
 throws out one two hits and thanks 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.930
 it wins the fight there in one or two 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.430
 hitting here i think that it doesn't go on 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.150
 boxing is not good 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.320
 entertainment but hope that the connection with 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.320
 speeches of new rules which 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.509
 come in June of this year when 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.130
 boxers amateurs will perform without 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.890
 helmets will be the new judging system and 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.660
 gloves will be a little others 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.310
 boxing entertainment will rise much with 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:43.070
 the moment when the Minister of Defense 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.910
 Russian Federation appointed Serdyukov 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:50.840
 certainly a big step back 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:54.560
 sport in the army in general 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.690
 military people and athletes are very big 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.490
 of hope 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.869
 laid on the new minister of defense 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.910
 to shoigu that he will return the principles for the guys 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:10.450
 can simultaneously serve to act 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.430
 conscripted into the army but rather 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.030
 how would not lose their practice 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.030
 sports 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.650
 This experience is very important. 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.480
 I hope that all the same 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.160
 the country's leadership is exactly 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.070
 the ministry of defense will understand this 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.710
 and return the old system when the army 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.710
 god of sport was the strongest of our country 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.330
 the most important thing is to be young 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.750
 the guy who came to boxing 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.850
 this is above all a big goal which he 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.500
 should put for himself why he 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.220
 came to this sport what he wants 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.950
 finish off and the second should not be very 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.020
 great great desire to achieve this 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.000
 goals and he should 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.000
 no matter what 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.640
 lose hands Kate will lose 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.860
 offensive 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:09.000
 often undeserved well and a lot of things 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:11.910
 it will just have to be ready for this and 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.980
 still aggressively go to set 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.980
 goals of which and these guys lived 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.050
 in martial arts this when created everything in 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.570
 any sport is present but in 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.680
 martial arts it manifests itself 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.090
 especially strongly probably and of course 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.340
 such sports in drums where 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.590
 danger of missing a big hit there 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.220
 danger of injury and so on 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.560
 it plays a big role and 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.720
 such high levels already high 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.900
 training world championships there 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.280
 olympic games very often plays 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.320
 factor who better tune into a fight who 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.150
 better able to overcome his excitement then 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.080
 there is a need for this infection golden 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.810
 middle of the excitement should not be very 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.450
 a lot and not to be at all 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.890
 to make it happen that is all is well 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:21.480
 in moderation how to approach this probably 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:25.280
 each has his own secret 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.280
 the approach to this was enough for me there 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.600
 of course I try 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.729
 long before the fight but the number 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.889
 somehow not think as much as possible wallpaper 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.320
 there we have a coach often walked there 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:41.650
 read books there somehow try somehow 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.990
 distract yourself and think directly 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.990
 what and where to box with whom 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.250
 how and what will you do already 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.270
 directly when coming to the arena where 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.430
 competitions are held 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.970
 finished two years ago my 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.289
 amateur career 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.870
 nowhere to move to no longer hide 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:02.289
 Lana didnâ€™t come back 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.699
 I want to work at the moment 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.539
 Omsk established the Olympic Center 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:11.469
 boxing training 2006 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.879
 where I worked as an instructor for athletes 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:16.809
 on after sports career completion 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:19.809
 switched to such functionary work 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:23.009
 now worked as a deputy director in 

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:27.849
 given center hope for coming back 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:30.440
 just find him who even 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:34.430
 and hit somewhere 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:37.230
 well , that's left or right 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.830
 very enough efficiency can 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.990
 show that you will somehow be a little bit 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:47.010
 lean right and yourself sharply 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.520
 come to the left people from there enough 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.520
 effectively
