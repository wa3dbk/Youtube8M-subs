00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
manufactured in Germany I read about

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.030 
manufactured in Germany I read about
that<00:03:47.250> they<00:03:48.239> do<00:03:48.390> a<00:03:48.420> few<00:03:48.690> parts<00:03:49.079> in<00:03:49.230> Taiwan<00:03:49.739> which

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
you know that's not so nice but most of

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.099 
you know that's not so nice but most of
it<00:03:52.890> and<00:03:54.049> it's<00:03:55.049> done<00:03:55.260> in<00:03:55.380> Germany<00:03:55.560> so<00:03:56.959> at<00:03:57.959> least

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
it and it's done in Germany so at least

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.910 
it and it's done in Germany so at least
I<00:03:58.290> can<00:03:58.440> support<00:03:58.709> my<00:03:59.630> country's<00:04:00.630> economy<00:04:01.530> with

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
that at least a I'm made to believe that

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.009 
that at least a I'm made to believe that
I<00:04:06.600> do<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:07.549> while<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.700> bike<00:04:08.880> is<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.989> best

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
I do and while the bike is the best

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.599 
I do and while the bike is the best
thing<00:04:13.350> I<00:04:13.470> could<00:04:13.620> do<00:04:13.739> is<00:04:13.889> Mount<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.220> camera

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
thing I could do is Mount the camera

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.870 
thing I could do is Mount the camera
here<00:04:14.880> and<00:04:15.620> race<00:04:16.620> around<00:04:16.799> with<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:17.190> bike<00:04:17.430> but<00:04:17.700> I

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
here and race around with a bike but I

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.969 
here and race around with a bike but I
don't<00:04:18.120> know<00:04:18.239> how<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:18.720> can<00:04:18.840> do<00:04:19.109> this<00:04:19.289> I<00:04:19.500> can

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
don't know how I can do this I can

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.520 
don't know how I can do this I can
accomplish<00:04:20.430> that<00:04:20.930> probably<00:04:21.930> would<00:04:22.109> ruin<00:04:22.320> the

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
accomplish that probably would ruin the

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.969 
accomplish that probably would ruin the
camera<00:04:23.840> because<00:04:24.840> of<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.050> vibrations<00:04:25.650> but

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
camera because of the vibrations but

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.230 
camera because of the vibrations but
yeah<00:04:26.639> it's<00:04:27.360> it's<00:04:27.840> really<00:04:28.139> nice<00:04:28.350> I<00:04:28.970> love<00:04:29.970> it<00:04:30.120> and

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
yeah it's it's really nice I love it and

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.029 
yeah it's it's really nice I love it and
this<00:04:30.840> is<00:04:30.960> probably<00:04:31.169> the<00:04:31.410> reason<00:04:31.710> why<00:04:31.889> you

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
this is probably the reason why you

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.810 
this is probably the reason why you
won't<00:04:32.639> see<00:04:33.600> me<00:04:33.780> so<00:04:34.050> often<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:35.039> now<00:04:35.190> not<00:04:35.789> just

won't see me so often and now not just
kidding<00:04:36.270> but<00:04:36.510> I'm<00:04:37.200> guess<00:04:37.440> I<00:04:37.650> guess<00:04:38.270> I'll<00:04:39.270> be

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
kidding but I'm guess I guess I'll be

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.510 
kidding but I'm guess I guess I'll be
more<00:04:39.810> outdoors<00:04:40.320> than<00:04:40.830> usually<00:04:42.710> yeah
