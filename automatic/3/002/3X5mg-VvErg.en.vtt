00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
couple of cool things came up so one

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.590 
couple of cool things came up so one
thing<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.579> sort<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.790> want<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.000> keep<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.420> back

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
thing I sort of want to keep in the back

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.090 
thing I sort of want to keep in the back
of<00:00:36.780> our<00:00:36.899> heads<00:00:37.170> when<00:00:37.350> we're<00:00:37.500> doing<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.860> is

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
of our heads when we're doing this is

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.130 
of our heads when we're doing this is
we're<00:00:38.489> working<00:00:38.760> with<00:00:38.910> an<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.239> minor<00:00:39.570> scale

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
we're working with an a minor scale

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.770 
we're working with an a minor scale
essentially<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.309> raised<00:00:41.910> or<00:00:42.210> major<00:00:42.450> six

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
essentially with a raised or major six

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.200 
essentially with a raised or major six
and<00:00:45.780> part<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.670> means<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.850> we're<00:00:47.969> seeing

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
and part of that means that we're seeing

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.139 
and part of that means that we're seeing
a<00:00:48.270> lot<00:00:48.480> more<00:00:48.510> f-sharp<00:00:49.370> in<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.520> scales<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.000> we

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
a lot more f-sharp in the scales that we

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.580 
a lot more f-sharp in the scales that we
would<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:51.570> playing<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:51.989> natural<00:00:52.410> minor

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
would have for playing in natural minor

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.189 
would have for playing in natural minor
or<00:00:52.890> alien<00:00:53.489> if<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.850> want<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> modal<00:00:55.050> this

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
or alien if you want to be a modal this

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.580 
or alien if you want to be a modal this
specific<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.129> want<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.430> start<00:00:56.670> off<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.590> was

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
specific so I want to start off I was

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.500 
specific so I want to start off I was
playing<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.070> minor<00:00:59.430> seven<00:00:59.789> flat<00:00:59.820> five<00:01:00.030> or<00:01:00.480> a

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
playing a minor seven flat five or a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.209 
playing a minor seven flat five or a
half<00:01:00.719> diminished<00:01:01.199> chord<00:01:01.320> we're<00:01:01.980> gonna<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.190> a

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
half diminished chord we're gonna have a

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.140 
half diminished chord we're gonna have a
look<00:01:02.370> at<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:03.830> an<00:01:04.830> arpeggio<00:01:05.369> based<00:01:05.640> off<00:01:05.880> that

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
look at this an arpeggio based off that

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.800 
look at this an arpeggio based off that
it<00:01:06.390> kind<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.750> looks<00:01:07.049> like<00:01:07.939> a<00:01:08.939> straight<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.510> minor

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
it kind of looks like a straight a minor

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.200 
it kind of looks like a straight a minor
one<00:01:10.049> three<00:01:10.320> five<00:01:10.530> arpeggio<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.939> included

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
one three five arpeggio I just included

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.560 
one three five arpeggio I just included
an<00:01:12.540> f-sharp<00:01:12.720> at<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> top<00:01:13.880> and<00:01:14.880> also<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
an f-sharp at the top and also on the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.120 
an f-sharp at the top and also on the
third<00:01:15.750> string<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.409> could<00:01:16.560> almost<00:01:16.680> argue

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
third string so you could almost argue

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.960 
third string so you could almost argue
that<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.119> an<00:01:18.270> A<00:01:18.420> -<00:01:18.450> 6<00:01:19.080> /<00:01:19.890> f<00:01:20.130> sharp<00:01:20.369> anyway<00:01:20.790> I'm

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
that it's an A - 6 / f sharp anyway I'm

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.510 
that it's an A - 6 / f sharp anyway I'm
betting<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:21.780> I'll<00:01:22.080> get<00:01:22.680> cracking<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
betting on I'll get cracking so the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.070 
betting on I'll get cracking so the
started<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.939> was<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> hammer<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.390> from<00:01:24.750> 9<00:01:24.930> to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
started that was a hammer on from 9 to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.560 
started that was a hammer on from 9 to
12<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> fifth<00:01:25.939> then<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.030> played<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.360> end<00:01:27.479> of

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
12 on the fifth then I played to end of

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.649 
12 on the fifth then I played to end of
the<00:01:27.689> 4th<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:29.460> then<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.790> want<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.030> play<00:01:30.150> 9<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.630> 11

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
the 4th and then I want to play 9 to 11

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.270 
the 4th and then I want to play 9 to 11
on<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> 3rd<00:01:33.020> okay<00:01:34.020> from<00:01:34.619> there<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.890> want<00:01:35.189> to

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
on the 3rd okay from there I want to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.069 
on the 3rd okay from there I want to
play<00:01:35.430> 10<00:01:35.700> at<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.909> 2nd<00:01:36.270> string<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.720> then<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.049> a

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.230 

hopefully<00:01:45.420> that's<00:01:45.600> all<00:01:45.689> making<00:01:45.990> sense<00:01:46.200> now<00:01:47.240> I

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
hopefully that's all making sense now I

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.040 
hopefully that's all making sense now I
want<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.509> slide<00:01:48.780> over

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
want to slide over

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.010 
want to slide over
what<00:01:51.560> I'm<00:01:51.650> doing<00:01:51.950> here<00:01:52.220> is<00:01:52.460> a<00:01:52.550> c-major<00:01:53.210> kind<00:01:53.960> of

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
what I'm doing here is a c-major kind of

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.230 
what I'm doing here is a c-major kind of
a<00:01:54.080> C<00:01:54.230> major<00:01:54.410> seventh<00:01:54.920> Eid<00:01:55.190> with<00:01:55.580> a<00:01:55.610> flat<00:01:55.910> five

or just to C major with a flat five

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.660 
or just to C major with a flat five
you<00:02:00.290> might<00:02:00.440> make<00:02:00.620> a<00:02:00.650> bit<00:02:00.890> more<00:02:00.920> sense<00:02:01.100> over

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
you might make a bit more sense over

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.730 
you might make a bit more sense over
here<00:02:01.960> so<00:02:02.960> we've<00:02:03.110> gone<00:02:03.230> from<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:03.590> half

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
here so we've gone from the half

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.480 
here so we've gone from the half
diminished<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:06.110> a<00:02:06.140> C<00:02:06.530> major<00:02:06.710> seven<00:02:07.190> flat<00:02:07.460> five

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
diminished to a C major seven flat five

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.590

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
a pull off from 15 to 14 and then I play

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.820 
a pull off from 15 to 14 and then I play
12<00:02:18.860> of<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.190> first<00:02:19.400> string<00:02:20.470> I'm<00:02:21.470> not<00:02:21.650> on<00:02:21.740> to

arpeggio but added in the sharp 6 which

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.840 
arpeggio but added in the sharp 6 which
was<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.870> F<00:02:54.140> sharp<00:02:54.170> or<00:02:54.710> if<00:02:55.250> you<00:02:55.459> want<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.700> talk

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
was the F sharp or if you want to talk

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.160 
was the F sharp or if you want to talk
of<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.030> think<00:02:56.209> about<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:56.510> another<00:02:56.660> way<00:02:56.870> as<00:02:57.020> the

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
major 6 so what I was doing is I was

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.240 
major 6 so what I was doing is I was
going<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.810> c<00:03:00.080> e<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:02.630> then<00:03:03.320> I<00:03:03.410> was<00:03:03.530> adding<00:03:03.830> in<00:03:04.010> the

going a c e and then I was adding in the

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.570 
going a c e and then I was adding in the
F<00:03:04.400> sharp<00:03:04.430> as<00:03:04.940> I'm<00:03:05.120> going<00:03:06.100> 1215<00:03:07.100> on<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.400> fifth

F sharp as I'm going 1215 on the fifth
string<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.660> then<00:03:09.650> I'm<00:03:09.739> playing<00:03:10.010> 14<00:03:10.340> of<00:03:10.700> the

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
4th and 11 of the 3rd I do exactly the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.580 
4th and 11 of the 3rd I do exactly the
same<00:03:15.680> thing<00:03:16.010> up<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.280> octave<00:03:17.350> so<00:03:18.350> what<00:03:18.500> I'm

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
same thing up the octave so what I'm

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.170 
same thing up the octave so what I'm
doing<00:03:18.620> here<00:03:18.860> is<00:03:19.100> I'm<00:03:19.250> hammering<00:03:19.670> from<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.000> 8th

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
doing here is I'm hammering from the 8th

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.240 
doing here is I'm hammering from the 8th
of<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.450> C<00:03:20.660> which<00:03:20.900> is<00:03:21.050> playing<00:03:21.290> 14<00:03:21.620> of<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.040> 3rd

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
of the C which is playing 14 of the 3rd

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.540 
of the C which is playing 14 of the 3rd
to<00:03:22.459> 17<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.180> 3rd<00:03:23.709> then<00:03:24.709> I<00:03:24.800> play<00:03:24.950> 17<00:03:25.430> at<00:03:25.520> the

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
to 17 of the 3rd then I play 17 at the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.690 
to 17 of the 3rd then I play 17 at the
2nd<00:03:25.970> string<00:03:26.209> and<00:03:27.200> then<00:03:27.770> I<00:03:27.800> want<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.040> play<00:03:28.160> 14<00:03:28.580> at

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
2nd string and then I want to play 14 at

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.460 
2nd string and then I want to play 14 at
the<00:03:28.790> 1st

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
the 1st

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.780 
the 1st
so<00:03:30.470> all<00:03:30.620> I'm<00:03:30.770> doing<00:03:31.010> is<00:03:31.070> I'm<00:03:31.160> going<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:31.610> you

so all I'm doing is I'm going and you
see<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.390> F<00:03:33.350> sharp<00:03:33.709> which<00:03:33.920> is<00:03:33.950> essentially

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
see the F sharp which is essentially

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.670 
see the F sharp which is essentially
going<00:03:34.760> 1<00:03:34.970> 3<00:03:35.360> 5<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:36.290> then<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.220> other<00:03:37.550> sharp<00:03:37.790> 6

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
going 1 3 5 and then the other sharp 6

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.750 
going 1 3 5 and then the other sharp 6
for<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.770> major<00:03:39.950> 6

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.649 

at<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.239> end<00:03:43.420> of<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:44.730> it's<00:03:45.730> almost<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.150> mind

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
at the end of that it's almost a mind

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.720 
at the end of that it's almost a mind
like<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:47.019> very<00:03:47.290> very<00:03:47.379> tiny<00:03:47.890> diamond<00:03:48.340> and<00:03:48.489> I<00:03:48.519> paid

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
like a very very tiny diamond and I paid

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.309 
like a very very tiny diamond and I paid
sure<00:03:48.879> but<00:03:49.060> anyway<00:03:49.150> I'm<00:03:49.540> doing<00:03:50.019> a<00:03:50.049> pull-off

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
sure but anyway I'm doing a pull-off

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.039 
sure but anyway I'm doing a pull-off
from<00:03:51.040> 15<00:03:51.459> to<00:03:51.640> 14<00:03:52.060> on<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.209> first<00:03:52.480> string

from 15 to 14 on the first string

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.580 
from 15 to 14 on the first string
I<00:03:53.099> play<00:03:54.099> 15<00:03:54.489> of<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.700> second<00:03:55.140> then<00:03:56.140> I<00:03:56.230> jump<00:03:56.470> to

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
I play 15 of the second then I jump to

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.809 
I play 15 of the second then I jump to
17<00:03:57.040> of<00:03:57.159> the<00:03:57.280> third<00:03:59.129> and<00:04:00.129> then<00:04:00.459> I<00:04:00.519> want<00:04:00.670> to<00:04:00.730> hit

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
17 of the third and then I want to hit

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.640 
17 of the third and then I want to hit
the<00:04:00.910> pinky<00:04:01.349> on<00:04:02.370> 17<00:04:03.370> of<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.549> first<00:04:03.760> string<00:04:04.650> so

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
the pinky on 17 of the first string so

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:16.770 
the pinky on 17 of the first string so
all<00:04:05.799> together<00:04:12.629> at<00:04:13.629> the<00:04:13.870> end<00:04:13.959> of<00:04:14.260> that<00:04:14.409> I<00:04:15.600> end<00:04:16.600> on
