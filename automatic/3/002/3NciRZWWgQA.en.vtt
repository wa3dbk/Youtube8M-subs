pretty<00:04:18.810> fresh<00:04:19.349> kind<00:04:19.680> of<00:04:19.799> makeup<00:04:20.009> now<00:04:20.579> I<00:04:20.609> use

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
pretty fresh kind of makeup now I use

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.999 
pretty fresh kind of makeup now I use
bronzer<00:04:21.660> instead<00:04:22.079> of<00:04:22.199> blush<00:04:22.470> because<00:04:22.740> I'm

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:23.009 
bronzer instead of blush because I'm

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:24.620 
bronzer instead of blush because I'm
more<00:04:23.220> of<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.370> bronzer<00:04:23.729> girl<00:04:23.970> but<00:04:24.180> if<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.449> don't

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
more of a bronzer girl but if you don't

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.600 
more of a bronzer girl but if you don't
like<00:04:24.780> bronzer<00:04:25.229> and<00:04:25.440> if<00:04:25.590> you're<00:04:25.770> way<00:04:25.949> more<00:04:25.979> into

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
like bronzer and if you're way more into

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.730 
like bronzer and if you're way more into
the<00:04:27.210> lush<00:04:27.389> then<00:04:27.780> definitely<00:04:28.289> go<00:04:28.410> for<00:04:28.440> that

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
the lush then definitely go for that

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.890 
the lush then definitely go for that
also<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.490> reason<00:04:29.729> why<00:04:29.759> I<00:04:29.880> use<00:04:29.910> bronzer<00:04:30.660> is

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
also the reason why I use bronzer is

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.920 
also the reason why I use bronzer is
because<00:04:31.259> my<00:04:31.530> body<00:04:31.880> always<00:04:32.880> tends<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.479> lot<00:04:33.690> more

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
because my body always tends a lot more

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.589 
because my body always tends a lot more
than<00:04:34.110> my<00:04:34.259> face<00:04:34.530> so<00:04:35.280> because<00:04:36.150> I<00:04:36.270> wear<00:04:36.419> a<00:04:36.449> lot

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
than my face so because I wear a lot

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.899 
than my face so because I wear a lot
higher<00:04:37.229> factor<00:04:37.620> sunscreen<00:04:38.250> on<00:04:38.340> my<00:04:38.460> face<00:04:38.699> and

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909 
higher factor sunscreen on my face and

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:41.300 
higher factor sunscreen on my face and
so<00:04:39.659> my<00:04:39.780> face<00:04:39.990> is<00:04:40.169> always<00:04:40.320> kind<00:04:40.590> of<00:04:40.620> whiter<00:04:40.949> than

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
so my face is always kind of whiter than

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.520 
so my face is always kind of whiter than
my<00:04:41.669> body<00:04:41.849> and<00:04:42.240> I<00:04:42.630> have<00:04:42.810> to<00:04:42.930> kind<00:04:43.110> of<00:04:43.139> match<00:04:43.320> it

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.770 
my body and I have to kind of match it
