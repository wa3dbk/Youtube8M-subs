00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.430 
work I was going to do when I got into
the<00:01:48.060> industry<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.660> had<00:01:48.750> kind<00:01:48.900> of<00:01:49.020> frankly

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
the industry and I had kind of frankly

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.840 
the industry and I had kind of frankly
done<00:01:49.710> some<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.160> stuff<00:01:50.340> already<00:01:50.670> at

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
done some of that stuff already at

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.280 
done some of that stuff already at
school<00:01:51.050> so<00:01:52.050> I<00:01:53.600> felt<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.810> could<00:01:54.960> go<00:01:55.080> on<00:01:55.110> a

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
school so I felt like I could go on a

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.680 
school so I felt like I could go on a
day<00:01:55.470> one<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.890> contribute<00:01:56.370> and<00:01:56.550> that's<00:01:57.479> one<00:01:57.660> of

day one and contribute and that's one of

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.180 
day one and contribute and that's one of
the<00:01:57.810> things<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.260> still<00:01:58.530> think<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:58.950> school

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
the things that I still think the school

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.800 
the things that I still think the school
is<00:01:59.250> really<00:01:59.580> strong<00:01:59.820> with<00:02:00.030> today<00:02:00.300> I<00:02:00.330> can<00:02:00.630> tell
