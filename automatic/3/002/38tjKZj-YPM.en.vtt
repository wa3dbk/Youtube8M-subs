00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
marquardt nooshin economy is actually a

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.550 
marquardt nooshin economy is actually a
pretty<00:00:28.349> interesting<00:00:28.740> matchup<00:00:29.400> stylistically

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
pretty interesting matchup stylistically

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.380 
pretty interesting matchup stylistically
pretty<00:00:31.560> similar<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.309> they<00:00:32.880> both<00:00:33.059> like<00:00:33.270> to

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
pretty similar in that they both like to

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.690 
pretty similar in that they both like to
keep<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.690> standing<00:00:34.160> Marquardt<00:00:35.160> with<00:00:35.430> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
keep it standing Marquardt with the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.600 
keep it standing Marquardt with the
pancreas<00:00:36.480> background<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.770> think<00:00:38.010> that's

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
pancreas background so I think that's

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.830 
pancreas background so I think that's
going<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.820> give<00:00:38.969> him<00:00:39.030> an<00:00:39.180> edge<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.570> flight

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
going to give him an edge in this flight

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.500 
going to give him an edge in this flight
ultimate<00:00:40.350> easy<00:00:40.649> yeah<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.309> think<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:42.059> they'll

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
ultimate easy yeah I think that they'll

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.420 
ultimate easy yeah I think that they'll
be<00:00:42.570> pretty<00:00:42.870> evenly<00:00:43.290> matched<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.860> feet<00:00:44.100> Oh

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
be pretty evenly matched on the feet Oh

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.000 
be pretty evenly matched on the feet Oh
commies<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> little<00:00:45.570> more<00:00:45.750> technical<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.649> two

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
commies a little more technical of two

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.920 
commies a little more technical of two
but<00:00:47.460> Nate<00:00:47.820> Marquardt<00:00:48.180> has<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> little<00:00:48.600> more<00:00:48.719> of

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
but Nate Marquardt has a little more of

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.830

of<00:01:01.260> nate<00:01:01.440> marquardt<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:02.010> think<00:01:02.219> if<00:01:02.340> he's<00:01:02.579> able

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
of nate marquardt I think if he's able

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.289 
of nate marquardt I think if he's able
to<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.840> clinch<00:01:04.140> up<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.530> control<00:01:05.299> okami

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
to to clinch up and control okami

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.060 
to to clinch up and control okami
against<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.170> fence<00:01:07.350> which<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.740> think<00:01:07.920> that

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
against the fence which I think that

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.490 
against the fence which I think that
he'll<00:01:08.189> be<00:01:08.310> able<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.960> those<00:01:09.960> knees<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.380> come

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
he'll be able to those knees can come

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.530 
he'll be able to those knees can come
into<00:01:10.619> play<00:01:10.710> as<00:01:10.979> well<00:01:11.159> yeah<00:01:12.060> if<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.360> can

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
into play as well yeah if you can

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.750 
into play as well yeah if you can
nullify<00:01:12.780> okami<00:01:13.590> stand<00:01:13.979> up<00:01:14.159> by<00:01:14.310> holding<00:01:14.670> up

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
nullify okami stand up by holding up

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.140 
nullify okami stand up by holding up
against<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.119> fence<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.990> majority<00:01:16.409> of

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
against the fence for the majority of

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.609 
against the fence for the majority of
two<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> rounds<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.840> he'll<00:01:19.320> be<00:01:19.439> able<00:01:19.530> to

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
two of the rounds I he'll be able to

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.859 
two of the rounds I he'll be able to
dominate<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.700> judges<00:01:21.030> scorecards<00:01:21.540> for

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
sure but ultimately I really don't think

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.899 
sure but ultimately I really don't think
this<00:01:25.860> fight<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.189> going<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.369> be<00:01:26.430> going<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.880> a
