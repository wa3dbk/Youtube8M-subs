00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.500
 Hello. 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.500
 I'm Cazabichos Frank ... 

00:00:02.534 --> 00:00:04.000
 ... and that's Frank from the Safari Zone. 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.601
 We are observing how these bugs ... called ... 

00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:10.734
 ... that ... 

00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:11.267
 Camera: Kangaskhan? 

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:13.234
 If you were ready, I already knew how they said ... 

00:00:13.467 --> 00:00:13.967
 ... to what was going ... 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.701
 I'm bugs, they are very, very protective of their young ... 

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:18.919
 So do not lie down in any way! 

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:23.267
 I'll show you the picha of this Nidorino. 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.800
 Frank ... 

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:25.701
 What do you want, fuck? 

00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:28.534
 Did not you say that you should not approach it under any circumstances? 

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:29.300
 Calla calla! 

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:30.701
 That we are already close to them, you. 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.868
 To see, to see, to see ... 

00:00:32.132 --> 00:00:32.632
 Record them 

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:33.467
 But focus me ... 

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:34.167
 But ... 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.800
 Collons! 

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:35.601
 Also to them! 

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:36.434
 Are you stupid? 

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:38.067
 Try to record us all! 

00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:38.701
 Sshhhh! 

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:41.234
 Well ... 

00:00:41.234 --> 00:00:41.801
 ... as I said ... 

00:00:41.968 --> 00:00:44.467
 The Kangaskhan are PokÃ©mon very difficult to capture. 

00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:46.667
 You already throw a stone or a bait ... 

00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:47.634
 ... they will always flee ... 

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:48.649
 Eh Frank, look ... 

00:00:48.701 --> 00:00:49.500
 Calla collons! 

00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:50.701
 No, look at this egg! 

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:51.868
 You, you, you, you, you ...! 

00:00:51.868 --> 00:00:52.719
 Watch, watch! 

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:53.587
 See what illusion! 

00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:56.234
 Let's see the birth of a Kangaskhan breeding! 

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:03.601
 Surrealism! 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.267
 Listen to Frank. 

00:01:05.434 --> 00:01:07.167
 What? 

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:08.701
 This is because the Kangaskhan are ... 

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:10.300
 ... the whores of the Safari Zone ... 

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:13.040
 Now I will approach you to show you how closely they are ... 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.308
 No, Frank, uncle ... 

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:15.133
 What if man ... 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.400
 Burn closely, fuck ... 

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:17.267
 What if he devours us? 

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:17.967
 Let me see ... 

00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.300
 I do not know ... 

00:01:19.634 --> 00:01:20.467
 What else do you give ... 

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:21.367
 Sorry i ... 

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:21.868
 ... I can not ... 

00:01:21.868 --> 00:01:22.368
 But ... 

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:23.133
 Fotre ... 

00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.200
 Let's see what happens to this little car now ... 

00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:27.167
 Well ... 

00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:30.590
 So ... 

00:01:30.767 --> 00:01:32.234
 We will continue recording at ... 

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:33.868
 What happens now ...? 

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.200
 Let my nose ... 

00:01:35.334 --> 00:01:36.430
 Well, clean the camera ... 

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:39.500
 I would not like that the Zubat approached your colleagues ... 

00:01:39.634 --> 00:01:41.367
 After the wafer you gave me ... 

00:01:43.434 --> 00:01:44.434
 Now I am going to show you how it is ... 

00:01:44.434 --> 00:01:45.434
 ... the picha of a Rhyhorn. 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.634
 Well 

00:01:46.634 --> 00:01:48.667
 Let's get closer to the Kangaskhan without disturbing ... 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.346
 But what are you doing! 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.500
 That's how the friendship of the Kangaskhan wins! 

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:57.500
 Ep! 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.620
 'These two buds are loaded with stone bumps to this one! 

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:00.267
 So ... 

00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:01.154
 He will have to escape! 

00:02:01.267 --> 00:02:02.389
 As we always do ... 

00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:03.901
 One moment ... 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.701
 Look good on them ... 

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:08.929
 Do not bring Safari Balls! 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:09.429
 Good 

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:11.801
 So we can kill them without worry! 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.968
 Frank, that hurts me ... 

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:15.468
 Shut up ... 

00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:16.134
 ... cagat ... 

00:02:16.434 --> 00:02:19.167
 And we continue to show our friendship by throwing more stones ... 

00:02:19.634 --> 00:02:21.634
 * RUGIT * 

00:02:23.334 --> 00:02:23.877
 * COP * 

00:02:24.267 --> 00:02:24.767
 The camera ... 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.847
 Get the camera Santiago ...! 

00:02:27.701 --> 00:02:28.400
 Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, anything ... 

00:02:28.534 --> 00:02:29.634
 You have to leave by legs, you ... 

00:02:29.634 --> 00:02:30.801
 Look what I told you! 

00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:33.167
 Who could like to throw stones? 

00:02:33.367 --> 00:02:34.601
 Calla collons! 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.026
 To finish ... 

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:40.627
 ... I will show you how the picha of a Metapod is. 

00:02:41.167 --> 00:02:42.300
 And also that of this Psyduck! 

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:43.801
 'Sai-ai-ai!
