00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.830 
drop the motor down and we should be
ready<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:24.980> start<00:02:25.100> turning<00:02:25.490> into<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.850> motor

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.490 

all<00:02:29.840> right<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.320> engine<00:02:30.620> is<00:02:30.740> out<00:02:32.290> how<00:02:33.290> are<00:02:33.350> you

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
all right the engine is out how are you

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.960 
all right the engine is out how are you
I'd<00:02:33.650> go<00:02:33.800> ahead<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.070> stuff<00:02:34.280> some<00:02:34.459> paper<00:02:34.670> towels

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
I'd go ahead and stuff some paper towels

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.400 
I'd go ahead and stuff some paper towels
down<00:02:35.120> in<00:02:35.420> here<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:36.110> here<00:02:36.590> an<00:02:36.770> intake<00:02:37.160> so<00:02:38.410> steps

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
down in here and here an intake so steps

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.010 
down in here and here an intake so steps
clean<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.970> I'll<00:02:41.870> start<00:02:42.140> taking<00:02:42.319> off<00:02:42.940> the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
clean and I'll start taking off the

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.790 
clean and I'll start taking off the
footside<00:02:45.080> first<00:02:46.750> my<00:02:47.750> engines<00:02:48.110> locking<00:02:48.470> up<00:02:48.650> the

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
footside first my engines locking up the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.380 
footside first my engines locking up the
gears<00:02:49.040> do<00:02:49.250> shift<00:02:49.610> so<00:02:49.910> I'm<00:02:50.000> not<00:02:50.120> quite<00:02:50.269> sure

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
gears do shift so I'm not quite sure

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.220 
gears do shift so I'm not quite sure
what's<00:02:50.720> wrong<00:02:50.870> with<00:02:51.050> it

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
what's wrong with it

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.630 
what's wrong with it
what<00:02:51.830> happens<00:02:52.100> when<00:02:52.190> you<00:02:52.250> let<00:02:52.340> your<00:02:52.489> buddy

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
what happens when you let your buddy

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.420 
what happens when you let your buddy
ride<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.260> pretty<00:02:54.260> sure<00:02:54.470> he<00:02:54.560> jumped<00:02:54.890> it<00:02:55.010> landed

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
ride it pretty sure he jumped it landed

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.330 
ride it pretty sure he jumped it landed
on<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.840> shifter<00:02:56.840> so<00:02:58.390> hopefully<00:02:59.390> I<00:02:59.420> think<00:02:59.630> the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
on the shifter so hopefully I think the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.770 
on the shifter so hopefully I think the
gears<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.550> stuff<00:03:01.790> inside<00:03:02.000> hopefully<00:03:02.660> it's

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
gears and stuff inside hopefully it's

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.050 
gears and stuff inside hopefully it's
the<00:03:02.810> clutch<00:03:03.580> probably<00:03:04.580> ain't<00:03:04.700> gonna<00:03:04.820> be<00:03:04.880> cheap

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
the clutch probably ain't gonna be cheap

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.920 
the clutch probably ain't gonna be cheap
whatever<00:03:05.420> it<00:03:05.540> is<00:03:05.630> but<00:03:06.410> anyway<00:03:07.750> I'm<00:03:08.750> gonna

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
whatever it is but anyway I'm gonna

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.380 
whatever it is but anyway I'm gonna
probably<00:03:09.140> need<00:03:09.350> a<00:03:09.760> impact<00:03:10.760> screwdriver<00:03:11.269> to

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
probably need a impact screwdriver to

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.100 
probably need a impact screwdriver to
get<00:03:11.480> these<00:03:11.690> off<00:03:11.980> plug<00:03:12.980> up<00:03:13.130> your<00:03:13.160> holes<00:03:14.110> with
