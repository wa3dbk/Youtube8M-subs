00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.230
 well as the title says we will make a 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.350
 criticism or rather an analysis to 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.300
 final fantasy 13-2 because to this game and 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.280
 not another because I can and I want 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.530
 make it stress that if you do not like what 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.660
 what are you going to see and hear do not say anything in the 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.780
 comments just put thumb down and 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.160
 close the window well we will begin 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.860
 we will start with a synopsis of the 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.710
 history our story begins three 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.449
 years after the final fantasy 13 in 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.190
 valhalla while lightning is 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.530
 fighting a war with an enemy 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.660
 mysterious in battle is a 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.539
 a boy called not the one who came from 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.250
 future through a portal line and what 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:18.140
 send through the time portal to 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.520
 your sister's house will be so that 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.830
 find a way to fight 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.929
 also this threat since the ainin does not 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.670
 can leave Valhalla for this war that 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:27.619
 she is fighting as they will 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.720
 imagined in this game you can travel 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.610
 in time so after the 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.170
 characters you know you start your 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.570
 adventure to find a lightning 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.090
 save time and defeat that 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.429
 Mysterious threat good with the gameplay 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.619
 out of battle you can tour the 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.970
 more for free clear mind only if the 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.160
 map is not only was 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.620
 since their trip in the 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.900
 time is to say if you go to a world whose 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.180
 elapsed time is 10 years 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.090
 You will see in one way but if you go to the same 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.940
 world and if instead of saying 10 months 5 or 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.890
 1 x means that you will have a small 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.720
 variant may be more enemies 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.970
 powerful in exchange for time or 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.860
 station to level up you'll have the 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.170
 use of the ariel um crystal in which 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.330
 You can spend your crystal points for 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.220
 climbing the level is not difficult just 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.590
 you have to press negotiate a tone 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.720
 degenerate and you will realize that if 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.120
 you are more powerful also during the 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.580
 history will be able to make decisions with 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.080
 a mechanics similar to mass effect and the 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.510
 game has different endings 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.209
 depending on what you have decided what 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.700
 which encourages you to play it again in 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.709
 how much combat once you find 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.050
 with an enemy the clock will activate 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.510
 mobile which allows you to choose if 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.060
 fight against the enemy or ignore it 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.790
 the clock has three phases the green phase 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.010
 the enemies will not know that you exist like this 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.290
 that while in this color the best 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.330
 is to attack or just run in the 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.910
 yellow phase the enemies 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.160
 what are you there if you attack them or touch them 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.910
 in this mode the combat will begin 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.160
 when it is in red the combat will start 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.440
 automatically the mobile watch is something 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.990
 useful if what you want is not to fight 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.630
 still if the enemies are weak already 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.430
 that would be a waste of time in the 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.800
 battle in the mechanics are very 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.110
 similar to the end 13 good the 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.480
 mechanicals of 13 were not bad so 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.760
 they just refined them, there's no reason to 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.190
 fix something that is not broken but it 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.470
 They added some cultured people and 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.840
 that they do not know what they are on the screen 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.940
 they tell you to do something with control 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.370
 of the console as quickly as possible 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.440
 these quick time events give you a lot 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.320
 variety to the gameplay you can also 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.110
 catch enemies in the pokemon style and 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.810
 use them as a third character that you 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.110
 will help in combat outside of this not 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.790
 there's nothing more to say about the gameplay 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.980
 following with the music will be heard 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.500
 sonatas similar to those of the past game 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.140
 and one or another heavy rock music 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.450
 is fine in summary in terms of sounds 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.400
 the swords are very realistic 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.860
 the 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.019
 2 the sounds of magic everything is 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.329
 excellent the voice performances are 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:07.060
 good do not happen to be excellent but 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:09.819
 they are credible after all 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.439
 graphics are a bit inconsistent already 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.930
 that only important people 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.389
 They are great in terms of design 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.000
 but generic citizens feel 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:22.060
 as if they did not have emotions outside of 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.400
 voice department nothing would save them and 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.139
 the characters will only give you a summary 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.990
 of the characters are only three 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.150
 important so it will be short 1 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.880
 lightning protagonist of the past game 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.949
 sister will be fight in valhalla against 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.660
 a mysterious enemy she is the one 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.760
 send noel to his sister's house 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.500
 to be able to help her in this war she 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.919
 carries a gun that can be converted 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.380
 in sword very useful and original x of 2 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.300
 will be lighting's sister she will 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.070
 find with noel who was sent by 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.500
 his sister to help him beat the 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.210
 enemy that attacked the she uses 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.670
 a bow that like the weapon of his 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.550
 sister becomes a sword 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:03.250
 3 not he comes from a desolate future 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.960
 being the only human existing in 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.090
 the planet returns to the past to 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.280
 fix everything and so the world does not 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.650
 that desolate is lightning in 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.600
 his trip and he sends it to his house 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.760
 sister to save the future and who does not 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.530
 be such a horrible place uses two 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.470
 swords that can be combined to 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.360
 become a spear to end the 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.790
 conclusion this game is recommended 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.250
 he has almost everything good and his good things 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.900
 far outweigh their bad things maybe 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.880
 fans of the saga sit 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.160
 disappointed since his story is not 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.050
 very complicated but if you can leave this 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.060
 happen and you give more importance to 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.400
 characters that are memorable to the 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.220
 music and the gameplay if you like the 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.290
 rpg buy it is worth it and is very 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.030
 cheap on the other hand if you do not like them 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.940
 you buy it I do not think he changes his mind 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.250
 magically with this we said goodbye 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.590
 I hope the video is to your liking and 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.700
 Have a good afternoon or evening and 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.700
 until the next video
