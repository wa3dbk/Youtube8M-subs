00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.589
 No people welcome to my month 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.150
 favorites my month favorites in may 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.320
 You may know that I am long 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.300
 looking for a perfect one 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.769
 eyebrow pencil was i meant him 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.049
 to have found by nothing 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.240
 eyebrow pencil, however, was about to 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.660
 creamy and therefore did not think so 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.740
 Long 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.930
 Now I have a wonderful one 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.930
 I also found something out of the drugstore 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.099
 very good is therefore also cheap and 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.170
 though, that's manhattan 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.849
 it has the perfect color and the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.219
 perfect consistency is easy 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.399
 difficult enough to carry him well 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.350
 but he is firm enough that he also holds 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.390
 really or smear in the course 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.190
 The day then I was a few for 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.750
 There are already new discoveries 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.910
 long in the market and at the very beginning 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.440
 not yet but then then for me 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.640
 had so small little group and 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.960
 I just could not do enough 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.820
 Got it and had to buy it for me 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.219
 However, I still buy myself so mini 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.350
 biggest and i think this size is 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.780
 perfect and that is it 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.260
 maybe he should fail by Victor 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.369
 &amp; rolf des florstÃ¤dter petite fleur 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:09.330
 weeks full of sweet like that and it is 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.130
 very very very very easy 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.090
 but I like that is such a real thing 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:19.110
 real nice was the veil and 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.670
 heavy so flowery but still light 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.830
 Enough to give them even now 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.830
 wear can I'm totally happy 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.020
 the fragrance and goes well with me 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.790
 responds quite well my skin knows her 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.200
 some fragrances just look different 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.119
 or simply do not fit very well 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.189
 if you like them they will not suit you 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.570
 but this one seems pretty good 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.549
 to suit me and I am very happy 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.229
 even the largest perfect to take away 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.510
 then I ultra liked to do this 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.100
 shower gel from 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.600
 how does that happen I have given 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.120
 get a girlfriend this is the 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.220
 Simon Simmons I can give you that 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.920
 block in the infobox the left of her 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.420
 In any case, he has me so exchange 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.210
 package and there it was in and 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.450
 I really like that so it smells so blue 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.180
 is looked with that is Moringer 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.670
 just a whole fresh, namely fresh 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.250
 wrong is a lot easier 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.840
 Flower scent really like some 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.480
 the flowers are on the street sometimes 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.250
 so smell the trees in the summer so what 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.490
 reminds me so it reminds me 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.420
 a little bit of jasmine in that direction 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.000
 absolutely beautiful so heartily and easy 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.830
 just such a lightness and the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.560
 fragrance stays on the 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.820
 so it smells like a shower after showering 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.900
 In any case, and I want to 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.420
 look what else is there from 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.220
 Maybe this one does not smell like this 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.420
 Imagine when the dredger water or something 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.560
 which is really still in any case 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.230
 interesting because the fragrance really 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.650
 is great there can also be simone then 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.730
 I have this brush for me 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.940
 redeployed, so to speak 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.420
 and it is nothing from realtech 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.840
 actually the brave of the industry for 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.930
 property damage 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.150
 but I do not have a long time now 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.670
 Talk to us and now I find him ideal 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.920
 For bronze so really great 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.280
 Size up easily and very nice fluffy 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.570
 This makes the brawns pretty good 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.890
 without applying too selective so it 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.350
 will be nice and even 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.810
 just blinded 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.300
 and yes perfect for that then I had one 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.100
 new favorite lips combination and 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.580
 though on these two you have you 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.870
 maybe even in my video too 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.330
 different make up looks for school 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.950
 seen since I have this so 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.880
 this combination worn I like 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.520
 I really like that only 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.320
 widget of patrice would last longer 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.730
 unfortunately he does not last long enough 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.730
 I'm definitely looking for a lip 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.110
 I keep playing very long 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.540
 with the thought maybe at 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.310
 benefits look the libdems in case they do 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.780
 with which you can write then writes 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.520
 like to comment or maybe 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.470
 would have any other ideas in any case 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.510
 I like to apply the first time 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.000
 and really nice rub on the 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.350
 lips and then this gloss over it 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.100
 to give that to it from mainhattan 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:06.030
 heal only in the color 53 l is one 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.310
 nice local pietsch with golden or 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.890
 not golden but much worse 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.690
 and more transparent, of course 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.090
 and very very glossy and the two 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.890
 Together I think it's too great 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.370
 Of course I can do music and music 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.489
 Not 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.980
 That's why I even have an album today 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.250
 tip by mariah carey looks like that 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.930
 that's why the album is known 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.480
 already many songs mix office full 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.100
 hashtag again before there was already 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.020
 Last year there was that in summer 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.320
 for me actually my summer song and 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.210
 now stop with theo myers advised so 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.040
 Great I love it when you are a bit 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.360
 going in the direction of dance suits me 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.610
 quite well reminds me as well as a 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.700
 old times when they are so morales 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.740
 has done something and yes I think so 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.300
 but really good, I have a lot 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.700
 Wait a long time for finally new ones 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.920
 to get music from her and I do 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.380
 me also very very long and 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.610
 That's why I buy myself 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.350
 actually not only is that what I am supposed to mean 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.200
 I hope so synonymous as cd bought because 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.270
 madonna and maja the only one of them 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.610
 I still buy cds otherwise it's enough for me 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.470
 even if I download that 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.070
 yes but that's my reference tip with 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.840
 theory 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.600
 that was already my favorite 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.760
 for may i enjoy the 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.180
