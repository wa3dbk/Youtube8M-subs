00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.289
 good very good afternoon 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.009
 I present you as one of the managers of 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.420
 virtual are in my name is Juan Pablo and 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.070
 I tell you because we created the brand of 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.230
 virtual are 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.320
 we created the virtual song brand and the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.329
 virtual name sun because 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.730
 we saw 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.250
 and virtual are they is the world of 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.409
 video games then considering that the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.329
 name says virtual are the world of 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.729
 video game 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.010
 now we are in all the technology and the 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:02.309
 world saw what we did since then 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.339
 how to create that name and also 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.070
 thinking in the future do our 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.320
 products and send to produce our 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.240
 products with the brand of our 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.240
 company that is virtual are 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.540
 the discount and us when we started 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.420
 our stores our store that 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.390
 we started first in a store we 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.980
 we call the hole of the play we 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.140
 we started to call the hole of the play 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.820
 because as it seems that it was in 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.100
 the sector the hole 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.979
 It is the center 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.750
 it was in a second floor that remained 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.930
 on some scales and there is a hole 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.270
 Well, as you say a little hole 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.490
 that we put the hole in the play and 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.619
 considering that we were opening more 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.080
 stores we were growing as I said 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.120
 now that here we wanted to like 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.740
 create our own brand and have 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.660
 our products with our own 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.640
 virtual brand are how they have their 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.820
 microsoft brands as it has its brands 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.570
 they are and then what we did as 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.320
 rather evolve more and see us as 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:16.290
 entrepreneurs and want to put virtual only 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.300
 then the hole of the play we leave it 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.640
 in one store because we 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.620
 we had we have five stores in 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.540
 video game instruments that 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.700
 they call virtual only then we wanted 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.360
 rather those stores that we have 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.080
 put them as we call them in these 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.930
 moments because the hole of the play is 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.880
 a store that of videogames but not 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.260
 as a company then we take the 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.260
 decision to change the name 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.100
 well as I said we have five venues 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.680
 of virtual sun 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.410
 at that time is one of the venues are 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.150
 in sanandresito principal we take the 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.410
 decision to mount a store 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.420
 video games in the success room 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.380
 main because in that mistress he quoted 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.520
 main is all the technology of 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.370
 many times of televisions and 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.820
 computers then I made the decision 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.720
 to ride virtual soul in the center 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:19.170

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.850
 the ones that we went 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.740
 growing up and we went as if 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.440
 making us know there because it's in 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.090

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.250
 stores that we have to offer them the 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.130

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.560
