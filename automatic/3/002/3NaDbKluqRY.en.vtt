00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.839
 I want to think up to train psd bist 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.250

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.710
 we'll get the package box where you can download it 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.469
 I have a great open reference and you 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.330
 leave in the description here is the form of pasta on 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.210
 currently the latest phase version 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.710
 vista 143 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.609
 can go see what's behind 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.480
 how to download something that's sad for a long time 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:29.519
 okay there just found empty well 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.660
 which for the link was not on from outer 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.660
 was here still wait a second here 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.450
 passes again other 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:44.120
 miss to you. clogged up again 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.460
 here passes by are killing medium 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.140
 time it is normal to pump this 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.820
 launcher goes like a pirate and why 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.750
 go through the license is the last 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:57.620
 version 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:59.840
 launcher 14 yourself 320 so that is not short 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.230
 important to 143 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.229
 The launcher is essentially different 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:10.040
 versions 1 7 are there often enough 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.440
 updated recently there was an update in 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.880
 how are there thefts Landin gu can anyone watched 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:20.450
 some kind of video on this assembly here 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:27.729
 know personally I just played passed the ending 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:32.479
 and how it damn forgot to go shorter 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:35.560
 so everything should open okay than 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.560
 open less than 1 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.610
 here is our ibis foundation downloaded this archive 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:46.009
 the file is now personally installed from 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.930
 unpack the archive, you can simply take 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.659
 just visit the desktop and you can just 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.659
 then throw the instruction here this 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.369
 will be here by principle everything is simple 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.070
 Kama area 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.070
 wanna walk okay no difference 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.710
 Here threw on the spitz without here can be 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.440
 transfer replacement but I do not need 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:14.330
 since i already have myself under bist and 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.010
 vector heavy husband can remove can 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.690
 leave i didn't read were so here 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.709
 open the bitch up syringe let's go through 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.650
 settings along the shore for so little time 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.390
 I just opened up lately 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.410
 windows and change often and campaign 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.450
 against performing even 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.209
 so the console opens 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.660
 don't close anything 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.090
 the form 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.010
 did not go update what there that you 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.400
 You can read all interesting so 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.800
 both if you know english not 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.400
 to pay attention 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.340
 So here we see here the folder for installation 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.450
 be sure to choose the c drive 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.360
 just drive c 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.180
 create a folder on the c drive over it 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.180
 vtb and just send there 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.160
 snuffed so maximum soups and 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.820
 maximum minimum of this 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.670
 demand 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.580
 Well, actually for my system you need 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.820
 want a half since pretty 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.880
 little for my memory 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.920
 so what about the type of game that's needed 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.110
 you can create a profile here 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.980
 any garbage write something profile name 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.110
 and you can even write a password 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.790
 what is your name it will not be your 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.850
 the game is still not he will not thread 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.790
 show up 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.790
 Okay, don't care so much and we see this argument 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.350
 Kirov on and mono download 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.380
 I personally have problems here yet 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.600
 as there was no well, there were some there 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.330
 sports and can not say that by virtue 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.390
 such here we see here all displayed 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.410
 Build mods are user friendly here 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.750
 for example mono 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:03.580
 Type start something happens as become itself 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:05.489
 loading laune launcher build and type 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.380
 the build will start after which 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.120
 here we see here and you can edit 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.820
 Type here are some mods to add 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.600
 some turn off therefore still 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.790
 add new fashions 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.600

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.090
 this 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.620
 passed not but in fact when you played 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.740
 Only here an update happened recently 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.860
