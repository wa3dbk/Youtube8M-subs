00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:03.810
 I updated the sales of ipodtouch so I would like to see it 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.570
 I think 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.780
 First of all this screen 1 is the best before buying 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.929
 If you want to change elive 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.559
 When it reaches the afternoon, the voice flat rate pull pull car is 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:16.529
 It is cute 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.339
 And Ichiro like this on the cheering slider 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.429
 Add an icon to your favorite position 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:23.539
 Bring 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.289
 And of course this lower part can be changed 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.689
 Take the calendar out 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.279
 It can be a mobile phone that loses or leaves music 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.760
 And lol this is 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.920
 You can also have such eyes 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.050
 It's something I've got in this way 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.030
 homeost will be kicked 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.400
 And so home screen belt 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.890
 Then I would like to see new features soon 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.080
 At first it is nap function 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.840
 When I tap the map, the screen I saw last like this comes out 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.620
 to come 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.600
 And like this 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.010
 In a pinch 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.360
 You can change the scale 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.380
 in this way 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.980
 I hear you 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.990
 And Egawano 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.750
 It is os in the lower right, for example, it only switches to mac 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.800
 can do 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.560
 Emmanacto for aerial photography only and for aerial photography and maps 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.700
 There are three kinds of ugly art 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.910
 And it is a search to be worried about, but already built 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.470
 Like this if there is something 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.600
 I will go in history 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.520
 Speaking of eta year I go to my own place by myself 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.609
 It is said that not now 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:41.390
 If the schedule for this season is also included 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.260
 This gem is shallow afterward 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.140
 That singer location can be 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.500
 This gps part is not usable because it is Japan 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.290
 Still a taste ps2 game 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.450
 According to the city of the kabuki relay, the search for city information does not have value 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.540
 So I want this to be announced properly 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.100
 Ne 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.159
 I want to see the transfer next to silent and send to the numeric keypad 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.730
 Weekly 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.440
 I'm pulling out from the bay because the situation is out, but the place 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.460
 To add this information button 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.169
 Because when you press it, a class comes out here 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.169
 Add Tokyo here 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.969
 If you make a land, you will be happy with the location 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.349
 Click this to strengthen the sound 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.869
 And if you look at it 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:29.429
 I am in Tokyo 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:33.749
 This will turn the page this way, just like oil 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:36.229
 Finished with London london 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.049
 7 It is cute 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.209
 I would like to see the stock price next time 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.749
 The stock price is thus named Apple by default 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.889
 Google Yahoo etc. are included, so select upload 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:52.449
 If you look at the data, the decollete is 3 to 3 months 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.089
 I have it and I want to switch to the case 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:58.189
 I change data to a meeting every time 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.139
 Latest information 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:01.609
 Private room 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.129
 And this too 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:03.960
 For example 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.520
 Involve in the performance when Anthony has momentum 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:11.119
 We can do prefecture search 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:16.819
 I just feel like there is no Tokyo deal on the same day 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.809
 But for example 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:20.929
 Because this does not attach to Sony 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:24.399
 It looked like it was here 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:26.489
 Looked and contributed to + 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.819
 This is true 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.549
 I would like to see the email, let's work together according to the taste 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:35.019

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.179
 Ayafana Others Freely Coppola 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:40.769
 Can be set 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.769
 In my case 20010- 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.829
 Now that you can download the latest information 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.999
 Depending on the access rules, there is some time for price increases 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.049
 It seems 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.049
 I will omit the country because it takes an edgy 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.610
 It is a zodiac sign Now a pre-coastar acquirer comes out to the Diet submission cat 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:05.139
 I will 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.049
 And my eyes 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.579
 I will 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.409
 The notes are + + one detective is renewed 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.159
 He is an artist 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:23.469
 It looks like this to make a note of it 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:27.999
 The United States seems to be arranged in the updated order, for example 

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:32.490
 The last thing I saw in the blog post 

00:04:32.489 --> 00:04:35.489
 Let's say we want to add an affected department costume 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.009
 Well that's it and I'm done, but I'm back and I say blog 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.650
 Will come to the top 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.659
 The country will be in the order in which the middle edition was updated before 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.380
 It is this time that new functions have been added like this 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:56.270
 Ipods 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.370
 It is very interesting to get close to pda 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.370
 It has become 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.760
 We did more than this and there was Kawai of this time
