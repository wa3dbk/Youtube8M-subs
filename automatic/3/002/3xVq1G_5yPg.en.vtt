00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
will be Donald made of the enemies and

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.440 
will be Donald made of the enemies and
in<00:01:31.899> this<00:01:32.020> case<00:01:32.259> there<00:01:32.590> are<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:34.000> enemies<00:01:34.420> are

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
in this case there are the enemies are

these<00:01:34.869> zombies<00:01:35.409> so<00:01:35.860> if<00:01:36.159> not<00:01:36.969> that<00:01:37.299> happened

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
these zombies so if not that happened

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.469 
these zombies so if not that happened
you<00:01:37.840> know<00:01:37.960> five<00:01:38.860> years<00:01:39.250> ago<00:01:39.369> they<00:01:40.149> probably

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
you know five years ago they probably

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.420 
you know five years ago they probably
will<00:01:40.719> have<00:01:40.899> made<00:01:41.140> up<00:01:41.289> a<00:01:41.409> line<00:01:41.619> so<00:01:41.979> kids<00:01:42.219> get

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
will have made up a line so kids get

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.160 
will have made up a line so kids get
play<00:01:42.670> you<00:01:42.729> know<00:01:42.880> here's<00:01:43.509> these<00:01:43.840> are<00:01:44.020> the

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
play you know here's these are the

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.260 
play you know here's these are the
actual<00:01:44.500> zombies<00:01:45.009> go<00:01:45.579> kill<00:01:45.850> them<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.210> they

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
actual zombies go kill them and they

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.870 
actual zombies go kill them and they
made<00:01:46.479> up<00:01:46.630> some<00:01:46.840> other<00:01:47.020> variations<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:48.039> as<00:01:48.490> in

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
made up some other variations to as in

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.580 
made up some other variations to as in
like<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.149> berry<00:01:49.390> which<00:01:49.689> is<00:01:49.840> how<00:01:49.960> she<00:01:50.020> formed

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
like the berry which is how she formed

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.499 
like the berry which is how she formed
her<00:01:50.680> storyline<00:01:51.070> so<00:01:51.399> I<00:01:51.430> think<00:01:51.579> the<00:01:51.939> dolls<00:01:52.210> is

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
her storyline so I think the dolls is

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.020 
her storyline so I think the dolls is
actually<00:01:52.899> pretty<00:01:53.259> plausible<00:01:53.590> that<00:01:54.070> it's<00:01:54.340> not

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
actually pretty plausible that it's not

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.539 
actually pretty plausible that it's not
the<00:01:55.210> dead<00:01:55.390> still<00:01:55.780> could<00:01:56.049> actually<00:01:56.380> exist<00:01:57.009> in

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
the dead still could actually exist in

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:58.830 
the dead still could actually exist in
real<00:01:57.759> life<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.270> that<00:01:58.390> have<00:01:58.509> already<00:01:58.689> happened

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
real life and that have already happened

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.349 
real life and that have already happened
and<00:01:59.289> represent<00:02:00.219> the<00:02:00.430> zombie<00:02:00.729> apocalypse<00:02:00.759> that

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
to try to find the source of the zombies

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.740 
to try to find the source of the zombies

then<00:03:34.080> now<00:03:34.350> I<00:03:34.560> think<00:03:34.890> that<00:03:35.010> makes<00:03:35.220> sense<00:03:35.459> i

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
then now I think that makes sense i

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.070 
then now I think that makes sense i

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
me know not i can do more clarification

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.449 
me know not i can do more clarification
but<00:03:40.260> yeah<00:03:40.799> just<00:03:41.010> let<00:03:41.130> me<00:03:41.220> know<00:03:41.340> in<00:03:41.430> the

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
but yeah just let me know in the

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.090 
but yeah just let me know in the
comments<00:03:42.000> that<00:03:42.299> i<00:03:42.570> think<00:03:43.110> i<00:03:43.500> would<00:03:43.799> rather

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
comments that i think i would rather

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.890 
comments that i think i would rather
have<00:03:44.430> them<00:03:44.610> art<00:03:44.820> crew<00:03:45.180> stay<00:03:45.450> together<00:03:45.600> it'd<00:03:45.810> be

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
have them art crew stay together it'd be

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.270 
have them art crew stay together it'd be
more<00:03:46.049> plausible<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.620> have<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.829> new<00:03:47.010> crew

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
more plausible to have the new crew

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.970 
more plausible to have the new crew
because<00:03:47.880> they're<00:03:48.120> all<00:03:48.239> like<00:03:48.600> it<00:03:49.380> there's<00:03:49.769> more

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
because they're all like it there's more

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.600 
because they're all like it there's more
of<00:03:50.100> like<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.540> real<00:03:51.540> scenario<00:03:52.110> story<00:03:52.709> behind

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
of like a real scenario story behind

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.240 
of like a real scenario story behind
them<00:03:54.060> as<00:03:54.329> whereas<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.989> old<00:03:55.410> crew<00:03:55.829> there<00:03:56.130> is

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
them as whereas the old crew there is

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.340 
them as whereas the old crew there is
sort<00:03:56.519> of<00:03:56.610> put<00:03:57.120> together<00:03:57.299> by<00:03:57.690> Edward<00:03:58.019> Richtofen

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
sort of put together by Edward Richtofen

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.350 
sort of put together by Edward Richtofen
and<00:03:58.620> that's<00:03:58.739> sort<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:59.070> like<00:03:59.209> thanks<00:04:00.209> so<00:04:00.299> I

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
and that's sort of like thanks so I

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.340 
and that's sort of like thanks so I
think<00:04:00.420> we'll<00:04:00.690> be<00:04:00.750> seeing<00:04:01.049> a<00:04:01.170> return<00:04:01.410> of<00:04:01.890> the

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
think we'll be seeing a return of the

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.340 
think we'll be seeing a return of the
true<00:04:02.940> personally<00:04:03.940> I<00:04:04.360> don't<00:04:04.750> think<00:04:05.080> that<00:04:05.230> the

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
true personally I don't think that the

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.930 
true personally I don't think that the
dolls<00:04:05.530> rule<00:04:05.920> any<00:04:06.100> of<00:04:06.250> that<00:04:06.340> out<00:04:06.400> I<00:04:06.550> hope<00:04:06.790> I've

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
dolls rule any of that out I hope I've

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.520 
dolls rule any of that out I hope I've
changed<00:04:07.300> some<00:04:07.630> of<00:04:07.660> your<00:04:07.840> guys's<00:04:08.050> thoughts

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
changed some of your guys's thoughts

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.920 
changed some of your guys's thoughts
because<00:04:08.980> I<00:04:09.010> think<00:04:09.540> it's<00:04:10.540> kind<00:04:10.750> of<00:04:10.840> a

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
because I think it's kind of a

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.590 
because I think it's kind of a
misconception<00:04:11.500> that<00:04:11.740> it's<00:04:12.670> all<00:04:13.000> just<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.570> game

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
misconception that it's all just a game

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.840 
misconception that it's all just a game
I<00:04:13.990> think<00:04:14.230> what<00:04:14.890> we've<00:04:15.040> played<00:04:15.280> so<00:04:15.490> far<00:04:15.520> as<00:04:15.820> a

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
I think what we've played so far as a

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.580 
I think what we've played so far as a
game<00:04:16.030> except<00:04:16.360> my<00:04:16.510> up<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.690> dead<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.110> wants<00:04:17.530> to
