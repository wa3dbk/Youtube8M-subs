00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
something like that then there is a way

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.380 
something like that then there is a way
to<00:02:15.500> get<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.130> unlocked<00:02:16.460> for<00:02:16.760> use<00:02:17.000> in<00:02:17.240> your

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:31.320 
country just coming back up here no take
just<00:02:21.350> another<00:02:21.590> second

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.060 

we'll<00:02:31.750> give<00:02:31.900> everything<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.410> second<00:02:32.740> to<00:02:32.860> load

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
we'll give everything a second to load

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:41.760 
we'll give everything a second to load
here

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.790 

okay<00:02:42.490> it's<00:02:42.940> probably<00:02:43.300> about<00:02:43.480> done<00:02:43.660> so<00:02:43.870> now

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
okay it's probably about done so now

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.830 
okay it's probably about done so now
that<00:02:45.190> I've<00:02:45.280> applied<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.820> modification<00:02:46.510> we<00:02:46.690> do

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
that I've applied the modification we do

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.680 
that I've applied the modification we do
not<00:02:47.080> have<00:02:47.500> that<00:02:47.860> invalid<00:02:48.610> SIM<00:02:48.850> notification

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
not have that invalid SIM notification

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.960 
not have that invalid SIM notification
anymore<00:02:50.200> on<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.620> lock<00:02:50.770> screen<00:02:50.800> so<00:02:51.580> it<00:02:51.700> is<00:02:51.820> now

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
anymore on the lock screen so it is now

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.330 
anymore on the lock screen so it is now
technically<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.900> phone<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.440> valid<00:02:54.130> SIM

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
technically to the phone a valid SIM

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.700 
technically to the phone a valid SIM
card<00:02:54.610> which<00:02:54.820> will<00:02:55.120> get<00:02:55.330> signal<00:02:55.750> it's<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.350> little

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
card which will get signal it's a little

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.440 
card which will get signal it's a little
bit<00:02:56.830> more<00:02:57.010> difficult<00:02:57.520> to<00:02:57.640> prove<00:02:57.850> here<00:02:58.240> in<00:02:58.330> the

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
bit more difficult to prove here in the

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.360 
bit more difficult to prove here in the
US<00:02:58.750> because<00:02:59.050> like<00:02:59.440> I<00:02:59.530> said<00:02:59.740> this<00:02:59.950> does<00:03:00.130> not

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
US because like I said this does not

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.760 
US because like I said this does not
unlock<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.850> phone<00:03:01.060> for<00:03:01.300> us<00:03:01.630> use<00:03:01.930> so<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.560> phone

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
unlock the phone for us use so the phone

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.250 
unlock the phone for us use so the phone
will<00:03:03.010> only<00:03:03.280> able<00:03:03.850> actually<00:03:04.270> be<00:03:04.690> able<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.080> get

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
will only able actually be able to get

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.050 
will only able actually be able to get
signal<00:03:05.740> and<00:03:05.920> work<00:03:06.160> if<00:03:06.370> it's<00:03:06.670> in<00:03:06.850> another

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
signal and work if it's in another

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.930 
signal and work if it's in another
country<00:03:07.540> but<00:03:08.250> there's<00:03:09.250> something<00:03:09.610> else<00:03:09.820> that

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
country but there's something else that

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.110 
country but there's something else that
we<00:03:10.150> can<00:03:10.270> take<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.510> peek<00:03:10.780> at<00:03:10.990> here<00:03:11.970> give<00:03:12.970> me<00:03:13.000> a

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
we can take a peek at here give me a

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:37.300 
we can take a peek at here give me a
second<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.540> pop<00:03:13.840> into<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.590> settings

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.250 

there<00:03:37.910> we<00:03:38.030> go<00:03:38.330> so<00:03:38.750> what<00:03:38.840> I<00:03:38.870> was<00:03:38.990> looking<00:03:39.230> for

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
there we go so what I was looking for

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.900 
there we go so what I was looking for
and<00:03:41.020> when<00:03:42.020> the<00:03:42.140> phone<00:03:42.380> is<00:03:42.410> unlocked<00:03:43.010> it<00:03:43.700> now

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
and when the phone is unlocked it now

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.660 
and when the phone is unlocked it now
registers<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:45.200> SIM<00:03:45.650> card<00:03:45.680> that<00:03:46.040> is<00:03:46.250> installed

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
registers the SIM card that is installed

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.449 
registers the SIM card that is installed
a<00:03:46.910> little<00:03:47.240> app<00:03:47.540> called<00:03:47.569> the<00:03:48.050> sim<00:03:48.500> toolkit

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
a little app called the sim toolkit

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.820 
a little app called the sim toolkit
loads<00:03:49.940> and<00:03:50.330> so<00:03:50.840> up<00:03:50.990> here<00:03:51.350> if<00:03:51.470> I<00:03:51.560> can<00:03:51.650> get<00:03:51.740> the

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
loads and so up here if I can get the

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.860 
loads and so up here if I can get the
phone<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.010> focus<00:03:52.490> there<00:03:52.760> we<00:03:52.880> go<00:03:53.030> we<00:03:53.510> can<00:03:53.720> see

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
phone to focus there we go we can see

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.449 
phone to focus there we go we can see
that<00:03:54.020> little<00:03:54.230> app<00:03:54.470> there<00:03:54.800> that<00:03:54.950> says<00:03:55.160> oh<00:03:55.340> -

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
that little app there that says oh -

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.360 
that little app there that says oh -
that's<00:03:56.420> a<00:03:56.569> sim<00:03:56.870> toolkit<00:03:57.500> which<00:03:57.920> includes

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
that's a sim toolkit which includes

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.890 
that's a sim toolkit which includes
information<00:03:58.550> about<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.270> SIM<00:03:59.480> card<00:03:59.510> that's

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
information about the SIM card that's

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.809 
information about the SIM card that's
inserted<00:04:00.500> so<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.890> sim<00:04:01.069> that<00:04:01.190> I<00:04:01.280> actually<00:04:01.430> have

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
inserted so the sim that I actually have

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.600 
inserted so the sim that I actually have
installed<00:04:02.239> again<00:04:03.140> from<00:04:03.350> that<00:04:03.380> UK<00:04:03.920> carrier<00:04:04.370> is

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
installed again from that UK carrier is

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.150 
installed again from that UK carrier is
the<00:04:05.060> carrier's<00:04:05.600> name<00:04:05.840> is<00:04:05.959> o2<00:04:06.200> they're<00:04:06.950> based

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
the carrier's name is o2 they're based

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.070 
the carrier's name is o2 they're based
in<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:07.430> UK<00:04:07.610> so<00:04:08.239> the<00:04:08.360> phone<00:04:08.569> now<00:04:08.750> does

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
in the UK so the phone now does

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.840 
in the UK so the phone now does
recognize<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.980> sim<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:10.280> loads<00:04:10.670> that

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
recognize the sim and loads that

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.970 
recognize the sim and loads that
application<00:04:11.600> whereas<00:04:11.900> before<00:04:12.380> it<00:04:12.650> wouldn't

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
application whereas before it wouldn't

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.220 
application whereas before it wouldn't
have<00:04:13.100> so<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:13.850> phone<00:04:14.030> is<00:04:14.300> now<00:04:14.540> fully<00:04:14.570> unlocked

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
have so the phone is now fully unlocked

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.440 
have so the phone is now fully unlocked
