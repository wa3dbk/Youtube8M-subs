if<00:00:08.200> you're<00:00:08.680> relatively<00:00:09.100> new<00:00:09.309> to<00:00:09.460> doubles<00:00:09.970> then

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750 
if you're relatively new to doubles then

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.490 
if you're relatively new to doubles then
here's<00:00:10.990> a<00:00:11.050> guide<00:00:11.290> to<00:00:11.590> basic<00:00:12.430> positioning

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
here's a guide to basic positioning

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.160 
here's a guide to basic positioning
we've<00:00:14.500> got<00:00:14.680> Fran<00:00:15.070> the<00:00:15.250> server<00:00:15.930> she's<00:00:16.930> going<00:00:17.110> to

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
we've got Fran the server she's going to

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.620 
we've got Fran the server she's going to
take<00:00:17.349> a<00:00:17.410> position<00:00:18.330> reasonably<00:00:19.330> well<00:00:19.510> out

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
take a position reasonably well out

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.300 
take a position reasonably well out
towards<00:00:19.990> the<00:00:20.080> tramlines<00:00:20.500> but<00:00:20.680> not<00:00:20.830> too<00:00:21.070> far

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
towards the tramlines but not too far

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.220 
towards the tramlines but not too far
that<00:00:21.550> means<00:00:22.000> that<00:00:22.180> she<00:00:22.330> can<00:00:22.540> cover<00:00:22.750> her<00:00:23.020> half

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
that means that she can cover her half

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.780 
that means that she can cover her half
of<00:00:23.380> the<00:00:23.439> court<00:00:23.739> after<00:00:23.950> she's<00:00:24.250> hit<00:00:24.400> the<00:00:24.520> serve

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:24.790 
of the court after she's hit the serve

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.350 
of the court after she's hit the serve
and<00:00:25.950> probably<00:00:26.950> on<00:00:27.070> that<00:00:27.099> side<00:00:27.579> hit<00:00:27.970> most<00:00:28.180> of

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
and probably on that side hit most of

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.080 
and probably on that side hit most of
the<00:00:28.450> balls<00:00:28.630> on<00:00:28.810> her<00:00:28.930> forehand<00:00:29.290> I<00:00:29.970> am<00:00:30.970> the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
the balls on her forehand I am the

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.850 
the balls on her forehand I am the
service<00:00:31.480> partner<00:00:31.960> I'm<00:00:32.290> going<00:00:32.590> to<00:00:32.649> take<00:00:32.829> a

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
service partner I'm going to take a

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.580 
service partner I'm going to take a
position<00:00:36.720> pretty<00:00:37.720> well<00:00:37.930> in<00:00:38.079> the<00:00:38.170> center<00:00:38.559> of

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
position pretty well in the center of

the service box so halfway between the

cover the ball down the tram lines and

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.569 
cover the ball down the tram lines and
it<00:00:52.929> gives<00:00:53.140> me<00:00:53.289> a<00:00:53.320> decent<00:00:53.800> chance<00:00:54.039> of<00:00:54.339> covering

stronger<00:01:11.020> than<00:01:11.140> you<00:01:11.290> think<00:01:11.320> you<00:01:12.040> could<00:01:12.250> take<00:01:12.399> a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
deeper position that's a good position

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.030 
deeper position that's a good position
for<00:01:27.280> advanced<00:01:27.640> players<00:01:28.060> because<00:01:29.020> if<00:01:29.409> I

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
for advanced players because if I

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
intercept the service return it means

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.080 
intercept the service return it means
that<00:01:34.149> Martin<00:01:34.509> a<00:01:34.659> has<00:01:35.140> a<00:01:35.170> better<00:01:35.439> chance<00:01:35.829> of

that Martin a has a better chance of

defending<00:01:37.090> against<00:01:37.329> that<00:01:37.570> volley<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:38.049> B<00:01:38.649> is

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
defending against that volley and B is

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.830 
defending against that volley and B is
less<00:01:39.430> likely<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:39.909> get<00:01:40.119> a<00:01:40.149> ball<00:01:40.390> in<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.630> face

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
less likely to get a ball in the face

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.100 
less likely to get a ball in the face
which<00:01:41.170> is<00:01:41.200> very<00:01:41.380> important
