00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.520
 this man has really big goal of 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.230
 mats hummels in brazil he wants 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.129
 against the best in the world at the wm 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.070
 push through 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.140
 That's why the Dortmunder 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.520
 Defensive specialist in things 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.520
 world championship really offensive 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.080
 we just have to look that we 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.699
 our best performance of the square 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.410
 bring and then is just the chance 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.900
 also great to be world champion is 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.350
 I think that what we have in mind 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.170
 have to 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.239
 mats hummels 25 years old born in 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.430
 bergisch gladbach as a teenager 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.370
 were shaped fc bavaria munich but 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.400
 since 2008 one of the big stars at 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.500
 bvb although him the word star ever 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.269
 do not like 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.500
 it is somehow suspect and I feel 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.350
 me myself not so so I am 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.340
 the last person I believe that me 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.260
 something there I feel am 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.660
 most lovely or painter most comfortable 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.059
 me if I just mean mine 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.850
 Boys just in Munich for the faith 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.530
 90 percent of students are social 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.000
 could subordinate that, too 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.250
 student life then lead what you have 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.600
 and that's why I see myself there 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.910
 Not like that, but I know that 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.800
 others measure a kicker with contours 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.000
 The biggest pressure I make myself 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.920
 he says 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.979
 the desire for success is his motivation 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.740
 for each coach one a life saver 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:28.959
 teamplayer tactically disciplined though 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.399
 never without sacrificing your own line 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:32.720
 I see no advantage in this way 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.630
 say when you say what others hear 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.550
 but want the only way 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.869
 known his own opinion is by 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.880
 you say you have no problem 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.950
 if you have this criticism 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.270
 for saying that because I know 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.819
 just as fast as good stuff 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.340
 go away he also disappears 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.880
 this critical thought again from the 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.459
 behead 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.679
 mats hummels had long been a fixture 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:57.590
 dortmund and the national team 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.920
 Brazil is his first wm there 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.399
 Pokal to win the goal and dream 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.959
 at the same time there is no better feeling 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.690
 as a dream come true too 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:10.849
 to become master was one 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.400
 Cup winner with with the bvb just at 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.379
 one that could already have been feelings 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.170
 You really can not replace anything with anything 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:20.780
 because it is something of which only since 20 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.209
 at least dreamed that and that 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.560
 It's hard to imagine what's in one 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.660
 If you do that at one 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.060
 wm should create double German 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.829
 champion cup winner has won mats 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.780
 Hummels already has a lot in his career 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.239
 but maybe this will 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.349
 winner types in this summer even one 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.400
