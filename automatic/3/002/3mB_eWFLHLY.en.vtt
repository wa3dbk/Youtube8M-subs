little cord on so here's the basic

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.490 
little cord on so here's the basic
method<00:00:45.420> I've<00:00:45.539> got<00:00:45.690> 8<00:00:45.870> strands<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.350> yarn

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
method I've got 8 strands of yarn

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.380 
method I've got 8 strands of yarn
they're<00:00:47.129> all<00:00:47.250> cut<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.610> about<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.969> same<00:00:48.180> length

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
they're all cut to about the same length

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.240 
they're all cut to about the same length
we'll<00:00:48.719> talk<00:00:48.870> about<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.350> minute<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:50.190> I

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
we'll talk about that in a minute and I

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.310 
we'll talk about that in a minute and I
put<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> little<00:00:50.640> loop<00:00:50.850> onto<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> end<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.719> end<00:00:52.050> of

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
put a little loop onto the end of end of

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.170 
put a little loop onto the end of end of
my<00:00:52.440> cords<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.309> reason<00:00:53.579> for<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.149> that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
my cords the reason for that is so that

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.090 
my cords the reason for that is so that
I<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.420> slip<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.960> over<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.649> I've<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:55.800> got<00:00:56.070> a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
I can slip it over just I've just got a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.290 
I can slip it over just I've just got a
little<00:00:56.219> clamp<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> edge<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.030> my<00:00:57.149> table

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
little clamp on the edge of my table

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.970 
little clamp on the edge of my table
here<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.809> could<00:00:57.899> be<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> doorknob<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.859> could

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
here but it could be a doorknob it could

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.950 
here but it could be a doorknob it could
be<00:00:59.100> any<00:00:59.579> kind<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.940> fixed<00:01:00.239> point<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.809> can

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
be any kind of fixed point that you can

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.020 
be any kind of fixed point that you can
sort<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.199> pull<00:01:01.500> against<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.070> little<00:01:02.280> bit<00:01:02.399> now

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
sort of pull against a little bit now

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.910 
sort of pull against a little bit now
I'm<00:01:03.120> holding<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.510> taut<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.439> then<00:01:04.619> I'm<00:01:04.769> just

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
I'm holding it taut and then I'm just

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.830 
I'm holding it taut and then I'm just
going<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.070> lay<00:01:05.309> all<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.150> strands<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.659> palm

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
going to lay all the strands in the palm

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.539 
going to lay all the strands in the palm
of<00:01:06.960> my<00:01:07.049> hand<00:01:07.290> then<00:01:07.740> I'm<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.220> rub<00:01:08.400> my

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
of my hand then I'm just going to rub my

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.770 
of my hand then I'm just going to rub my
palms<00:01:08.820> together<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.510> order<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.840> spin<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.890> cord

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
palms together in order to spin the cord

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.600 
palms together in order to spin the cord
now<00:01:12.780> I'm<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.409> going<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.590> continue<00:01:13.799> spinning

now I'm just going to continue spinning

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.050 
now I'm just going to continue spinning
until<00:01:15.680> when<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.950> little<00:01:17.220> bit<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> slack<00:01:17.700> is

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
until when a little bit of the slack is

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.880 
until when a little bit of the slack is
taken<00:01:18.420> out<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.689> cord<00:01:18.960> kind<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.290> kinks<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:19.710> on

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
taken out the cord kind of kinks up on

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.260 
taken out the cord kind of kinks up on
itself<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.340> little<00:01:20.490> bit<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:20.939> are<00:01:21.060> putting

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
itself a little bit so we are putting

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.690 
itself a little bit so we are putting
quite<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> bit<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.200> twist<00:01:22.500> into<00:01:22.830> those<00:01:23.549> cords

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
quite a bit of twist into those cords

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.859 
quite a bit of twist into those cords
we're<00:01:26.700> not<00:01:26.820> quite<00:01:27.119> there<00:01:27.180> but<00:01:29.720> we're<00:01:30.720> there

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
we're not quite there but we're there

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.780 
we're not quite there but we're there
now<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.439> can<00:01:31.590> definitely<00:01:31.829> see<00:01:32.250> how<00:01:32.280> much<00:01:32.579> that

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
now you can definitely see how much that

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.910 
now you can definitely see how much that
cord<00:01:33.090> wants<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.450> kink<00:01:33.689> on<00:01:33.810> itself<00:01:34.079> now<00:01:34.740> we're

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
cord wants to kink on itself now we're

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.310 
cord wants to kink on itself now we're
going<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.130> use<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.759> by<00:01:36.270> putting<00:01:36.540> one<00:01:36.900> finger

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
going to use that by putting one finger

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.020 
going to use that by putting one finger
at<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.710> approximate<00:01:37.979> midpoint<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.939> I'm

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
at the approximate midpoint and I'm

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.460 
at the approximate midpoint and I'm
actually<00:01:39.119> going<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.420> use<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.630> hand<00:01:39.869> at<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
actually going to use this hand at the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.679 
actually going to use this hand at the
approximate<00:01:40.740> midpoint<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> cord<00:01:42.000> now<00:01:42.600> I'm

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
approximate midpoint of the cord now I'm

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.139 
approximate midpoint of the cord now I'm
going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.869> double<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.259> back<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.649> itself<00:01:44.149> slip

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
going to double it back on itself slip

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.200 
going to double it back on itself slip
it<00:01:45.299> off<00:01:45.420> whatever<00:01:45.899> my<00:01:46.110> anchor<00:01:46.500> was<00:01:47.090> now<00:01:48.090> I'm

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it off whatever my anchor was now I'm

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.490 
it off whatever my anchor was now I'm
going<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.390> kind<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.689> start<00:01:48.930> twisting<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
going to kind of start twisting in the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.560 
going to kind of start twisting in the
opposite<00:01:49.950> direction<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:51.030> mostly<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.509> can

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
opposite direction but mostly you can

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.139 
opposite direction but mostly you can
just<00:01:51.780> let<00:01:51.960> go<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.409> let<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> spin<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.820> cord

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
just let go and let the spin in the cord

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.030 
just let go and let the spin in the cord
do<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> work<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.409> kind<00:01:55.950> of

do the work for you and kind of

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.160 
do the work for you and kind of
straighten<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.520> out<00:01:56.610> with<00:01:57.390> your<00:01:57.540> hands<00:01:57.960> even

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
straighten it out with your hands even

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.620 
straighten it out with your hands even
out<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.619> kinks<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.340> you've<00:01:59.880> got<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.210> really

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
out the kinks and you've got this really

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.050 
out the kinks and you've got this really
pretty<00:02:01.290> cord<00:02:01.799> you're<00:02:02.040> basically<00:02:02.579> spinning

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
pretty cord you're basically spinning

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.420 
pretty cord you're basically spinning
this<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.110> what<00:02:04.259> spinners<00:02:04.649> do<00:02:04.860> when<00:02:05.070> they<00:02:05.159> spin

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
this is what spinners do when they spin

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.069 
this is what spinners do when they spin
the<00:02:05.549> yarn<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.880> one<00:02:06.060> direction<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.630> make<00:02:06.719> apply

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
the yarn in one direction to make apply

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.020 
the yarn in one direction to make apply
and<00:02:07.409> then<00:02:07.500> ply<00:02:07.770> them<00:02:08.009> back<00:02:08.220> together<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.789> make

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
and then ply them back together to make

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.449 
and then ply them back together to make
a<00:02:09.060> larger<00:02:09.450> cord<00:02:09.720> now<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.410> finish<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:10.979> all<00:02:11.310> we

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
a larger cord now to finish this all we

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.420 
a larger cord now to finish this all we
need<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.670> do<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.090> not<00:02:12.270> off<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.690> ends

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.170 

and<00:02:17.840> then<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:19.380> trim<00:02:19.590> them<00:02:19.770> now<00:02:20.610> you'll

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
and then just trim them now you'll

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.030 
and then just trim them now you'll
notice<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.720> we<00:02:22.170> doubled<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.710> yarn<00:02:22.920> on

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
notice that we doubled the yarn on

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.010 
notice that we doubled the yarn on
itself<00:02:23.370> obviously<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.240> we<00:02:24.360> lost<00:02:24.540> half<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
itself obviously so we lost half the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.780 
itself obviously so we lost half the
length<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.590> then<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.830> twist<00:02:26.100> itself<00:02:26.460> takes

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
length and then the twist itself takes

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.600 
length and then the twist itself takes
up<00:02:26.940> quite<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.180> bit<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.480> length<00:02:27.600> as<00:02:27.840> well<00:02:28.550> so<00:02:29.550> you

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
up quite a bit of length as well so you

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.820 
up quite a bit of length as well so you
want<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:29.910> plan<00:02:30.120> for<00:02:30.510> at<00:02:30.780> least<00:02:31.020> twice<00:02:31.440> as<00:02:31.680> long

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
want to plan for at least twice as long

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.860 
want to plan for at least twice as long
as<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.130> want<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.370> record<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.790> be<00:02:32.940> now<00:02:33.510> here's<00:02:33.810> a

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
as you want to record to be now here's a

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.720 
as you want to record to be now here's a
way<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.560> could<00:02:34.740> make<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:35.100> cord<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.610> was

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
way that you could make a cord that was

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.000 
way that you could make a cord that was
two<00:02:36.000> colors<00:02:36.510> two<00:02:36.960> different<00:02:37.380> colored<00:02:37.740> plies

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
two colors two different colored plies

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.820 
two colors two different colored plies
within<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.960> across<00:02:39.960> here<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.350> can<00:02:40.530> see

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
within it and across here you can see

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.830 
within it and across here you can see
the<00:02:41.580> whole<00:02:41.760> array<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.090> cords<00:02:42.450> from<00:02:42.570> very

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
the whole array of cords from very

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.430 
the whole array of cords from very
delicate<00:02:43.350> all<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.710> way<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.860> really<00:02:44.220> chunky
