 share this thing with you 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.250
 let's start talking about the plot right away 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.770
 this book like all the others of 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.170
 glenn cooper speaks of a mystery a 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.399
 mystery that this time is hidden 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.680
 within the pages of a 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.469
 manuscript the particular written one 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.690
 that has been hidden for so many years 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.510
 in a country house and early 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.549
 of the novel due to a fire skips 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.990
 out sum comes to light this 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.640
 ancient volume found within 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.390
 this abbey turns out to have been 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.040
 written by monk in the 13th century is a 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.110
 particular book because written 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.890
 entirely in code and then written 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.990
 from various designs of strange plants is 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.330
 written all in code in the first 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.479
 part that written in Latin and I read 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.460
 textually there is written I barthomieu 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.650
 monk of the abbey of ruac ho 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.159
 two hundred and twenty years and this is mine 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.220
 history and understand that from here to there the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.930
 fancy I from there excited not 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.750
 I was looking forward to moving forward and to 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.670
 find out what 220 years are 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.329
 those because he believes it turns out there is 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.549
 as a person who wrote it 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.310
 lived for 220 years this time 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.229
 the house is France and also here 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.850
 as in the other previous books by 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.680
 glenn cooper make themselves a whole series of 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.320
 time jumps 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.630
 if I'm not mistaken you travel inside 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.280
 three different times in which they come to us 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.340
 tell the story of this manuscript 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.830
 which apparently holds a secret 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.100
 white that will bring us much world 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.480
 a long way back in time indeed the 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.940
 manuscript that was found is 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.320
 dating back to the Middle Ages but the history of 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.260
 Destiny map starts even earlier 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.410
 in fact we will be catapulted no poop 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.660
 exactly less than in prehistory exactly 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.610
 in the area where it will later rise 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.410
 the abbey where this will be found 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.980
 this book this strange manuscript 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.720
 in which there is a strange cave one 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.650
 particular cave that has been hidden 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.720
 in the eyes of the world for many years 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.610
 which is covered by a whole series of 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.660
 graffiti but who is the protagonist of 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.910
 this story 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.830
 then the protagonist of this book is 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.720
 a beautiful charming archaeologist from 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.110
 name look that is thanks to the 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.690
 finding of this manuscript 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.700
 will come to discover this cave 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.610
 so all these will bring light 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.020
 beautiful cave paintings that 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.280
 depict varicose from bison 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.940
 then even a series of hands 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.950
 of the fronds of hands to representations of 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.750
 strange plants that he doesn't 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.170
 he had never seen the cave so always 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.180
 some way connected to the manuscript e 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.239
 to top it all you cannot miss 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.100
 absolutely the love story he has 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.890
 as protagonist our liu that will be 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.290
 she will also be a scholar is a former of 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.930
 he and they will be able to meet 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.340
 precisely to work within 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.320
 this cave to bring to light 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.370
 allows mail to then do it 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.620
 see to the whole world 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.120
 the fact is that just this group of 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.670
 archaeologists and scholars and begins a 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.320
 work inside this cave 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.550
 very strange facts are beginning to fall 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:55.390
 very dramatic or strange fires 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:58.250
 strange strange accidents disappearances 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.080
 strange deaths 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.560
 in short, it seems that everything around 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.540
 this cave is in the country of ruac 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.030
 a curse 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.220
 but it will be a question mark 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.610
 not to mention the fact that he later 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.400
 habitat and ruac do not seem to see of 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.859
 good eye strangers and it seems short 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.260
 that they also hide something 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.300
 recapitulating then we have this 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.020
 strange book that seems to hide a 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.629
 secret that was written by a monk 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.810
 he says he is over 200 then 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:34.449
 we find this cave with these strange ones 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.169
 cave paintings that look like this 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.889
 connected the book then a whole series 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:45.490
 of disappearances of strange incidents of 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:47.560
 murderers do not know what this is 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.750
 our look that is in the middle and must 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.449
 solve all this ambaradan here 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.460
 I hope I've intrigued you a little 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.530
 I will say only part because I love glenn 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.930
 cooper but really fine if it isn't there 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.280
 was a book of his that disappointed me 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.289
 so I feel absolutely at 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.539
 advise you I also tell you one 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.159
 little word so to tease a little 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:09.599
 even more the desire to read it 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:12.069
 that is, in the long life span 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.599
 but what else to say 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.699
 I can say that prose is very easy 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:18.250
 indeed the reading is really 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.469
 slide reads to me in a moment 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.590
 personally kept it glued 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:26.229
 right from the first to the last page is 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.569
 full of twists and then just the 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:31.360
 fact that it makes these various temporal jumps 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:33.009
 various different periods are investigated and 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.190
 so let's jump into history 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:38.380
 I personally really like it if 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.719
 just find a flaw I can say that 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.460
 maybe I say maybe it is not up to the 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:44.229
 its previous equilibria or the 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.169
 Library of the book of the dead 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:50.289
 anime but I liked it anyway 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.789
 badges involves a lot and therefore 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.310
 nothing I can do but 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:56.650
 recommend it here if you want the book 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:00.699
 of the articulated plot full of mysteries 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:03.159
 and compelling you read this here is mine 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:05.349
 finished video I hope I enjoyed it 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:08.219
 thanks for looking at it and a kiss a 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:08.219
 all bye
