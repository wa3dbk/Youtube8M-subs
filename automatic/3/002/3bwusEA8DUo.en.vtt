appreciate and the first thing that I

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.379 
appreciate and the first thing that I
wanted<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:06.960> talk<00:00:07.140> about<00:00:07.170> is<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:08.280> mini-map<00:00:08.760> so

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
wanted to talk about is the mini-map so

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.240 
wanted to talk about is the mini-map so
apparently<00:00:09.809> they<00:00:09.990> are<00:00:10.019> going<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.440> me<00:00:10.950> making

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
apparently they are going to me making

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.339 
apparently they are going to me making
the<00:00:11.429> mini-map<00:00:11.700> much<00:00:11.940> more<00:00:12.150> clear<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.719> a

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
the mini-map much more clear and a

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.230 
the mini-map much more clear and a
user-friendly<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:14.280> guess<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.940> they're<00:00:15.089> also

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
user-friendly I guess and they're also

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.000 
user-friendly I guess and they're also
going<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.630> make<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.049> if<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:16.410> fire<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> weapon

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
going to make it so if you fire a weapon

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.980 
going to make it so if you fire a weapon
with<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.760> unsilenced<00:00:18.359> you're<00:00:18.810> also

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
with that is unsilenced you're also

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.929 
with that is unsilenced you're also
going<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.260> show<00:00:19.500> up<00:00:19.619> on<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.859> map<00:00:19.890> for<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> short

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
going to show up on the map for a short

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.790 
going to show up on the map for a short
duration<00:00:21.119> much<00:00:22.020> like<00:00:22.199> in<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.350> call<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.590> duty

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
duration much like in the call of duty

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.980 
duration much like in the call of duty
series<00:00:23.150> you're<00:00:24.150> not<00:00:24.300> actually<00:00:24.449> going<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.869> be

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
series you're not actually going to be

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.570 
series you're not actually going to be
spotted<00:00:25.350> but<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.740> are<00:00:25.920> going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.189> show<00:00:26.279> up<00:00:26.400> as

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
spotted but you are going to show up as

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.370 
spotted but you are going to show up as
a<00:00:26.609> triangle<00:00:27.300> or<00:00:27.449> something<00:00:27.810> on<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.140> mini-map

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
a triangle or something on the mini-map

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.220 
a triangle or something on the mini-map
so<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.160> enemy<00:00:29.310> has<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> general<00:00:30.480> idea<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.840> where

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
so the enemy has a general idea of where

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.170 
so the enemy has a general idea of where
you<00:00:31.410> are<00:00:31.650> like<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.640> said<00:00:32.700> you're<00:00:32.910> not<00:00:32.969> going<00:00:33.030> to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
you are like I said you're not going to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.250 
you are like I said you're not going to
be<00:00:33.239> spotted<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:33.780> not<00:00:33.930> going<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.110> follow

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
be spotted so it's not going to follow

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.139 
be spotted so it's not going to follow
you<00:00:34.440> around<00:00:34.829> like<00:00:35.160> if<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.520> were<00:00:35.670> spotted<00:00:36.030> or

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
you around like if you were spotted or

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.000 
you around like if you were spotted or
have<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> triangle<00:00:36.840> over<00:00:36.930> your<00:00:37.050> head<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.920> is

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
have a triangle over your head but it is

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.350 
have a triangle over your head but it is
going<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.219> give<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.489> enemy<00:00:38.879> some<00:00:39.120> sort<00:00:39.300> of

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
going to give you the enemy some sort of

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.150 
going to give you the enemy some sort of
indication<00:00:39.690> as<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.050> where<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.559> might<00:00:40.739> be<00:00:40.770> I

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
indication as to where you might be I

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.950 
indication as to where you might be I
think<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> good<00:00:42.149> change<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.690> going

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
think this is a good change it's going

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.470 
think this is a good change it's going
to<00:00:43.110> make<00:00:43.520> you<00:00:44.520> know<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:45.030> going<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.239> blurring

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
to make you know it's going to blurring

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.220 
to make you know it's going to blurring
another<00:00:45.809> layer<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.050> strategy<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.950> also

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
another layer to strategy and also

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.090 
another layer to strategy and also
customization<00:00:49.230> you're<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> think<00:00:49.860> you

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
customization you're going to think you

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.040 
customization you're going to think you
know<00:00:50.129> am<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.430> going<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:51.050> situations

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
know am I going to be in situations

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.330 
know am I going to be in situations
where<00:00:52.289> it's<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.829> close<00:00:53.039> quarter

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
where it's going to be close quarter

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.910 
where it's going to be close quarter
combat<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.879> will<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.719> able<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.930> use<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
combat and will I be able to use the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.130 
combat and will I be able to use the
silencer<00:00:56.550> effectively<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.020> more

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
silencer effectively or is it more

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.020 
silencer effectively or is it more
long-range<00:00:58.500> combat<00:00:59.070> where<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> silencer

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
long-range combat where a silencer

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.520 
long-range combat where a silencer
really<00:01:00.239> isn't<00:01:00.390> going<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.570> be<00:01:00.629> effective<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.140> I

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
really isn't going to be effective so I

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.860 
really isn't going to be effective so I
really<00:01:02.129> do<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.670> change<00:01:02.940> here<00:01:03.239> because<00:01:03.600> I

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
really do like the change here because I

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.270 
really do like the change here because I
just<00:01:03.930> feel<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.439> brings<00:01:04.589> another<00:01:04.830> aspect

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
just feel like it brings another aspect

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.039 
just feel like it brings another aspect
of<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.489> game<00:01:05.519> that's<00:01:05.820> going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.299> make<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.960> more

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
of the game that's going to make it more

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.620 
of the game that's going to make it more
enjoyable<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.729> apparently<00:01:08.970> there<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.479> going

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
enjoyable so apparently there is going

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.570 
enjoyable so apparently there is going
to<00:01:09.780> be<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.990> patch<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.650> first<00:01:10.920> day<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
to be a patch on the first day that the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.340 
to be a patch on the first day that the
game<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.850> released<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.570> reasoning

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
game is released and the reasoning

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.770 
game is released and the reasoning
behind<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.860> because<00:01:14.220> EA<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.299> dice<00:01:15.330> had

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
behind this is because EA and dice had

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.080 
behind this is because EA and dice had
to<00:01:16.049> ship<00:01:16.470> out<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.950> know<00:01:17.070> see<00:01:17.520> these<00:01:17.700> two

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
to ship out you know see these two

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.149 
to ship out you know see these two
stores<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.110> they're<00:01:19.380> not<00:01:19.470> able<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.860> make

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
stores and they're not able to make

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.620 
stores and they're not able to make
changes<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.580> those<00:01:20.729> cds<00:01:20.939> because<00:01:21.360> they<00:01:21.479> no

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
changes to those cds because they no

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.560 
changes to those cds because they no
longer<00:01:21.750> possess<00:01:22.200> them<00:01:22.610> but<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.850> patch<00:01:24.390> I'm

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
longer possess them but so the patch I'm

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.210 
longer possess them but so the patch I'm
assuming<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.170> going<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.439> make<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:26.009> game

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
assuming is just going to make the game

the description if you haven't already

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.150 
the description if you haven't already
checked<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.810> out<00:02:27.930> it's<00:02:28.530> all<00:02:28.770> multiplayer

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
checked it out it's all multiplayer

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.370 
checked it out it's all multiplayer
footage<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.880> there<00:02:30.480> are<00:02:30.600> some<00:02:30.780> really<00:02:31.080> cool

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
footage and there are some really cool

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.650 
footage and there are some really cool
aspects<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.100> I<00:02:32.220> wanted<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.520> go<00:02:32.610> over

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
aspects of it that I wanted to go over

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.820 
aspects of it that I wanted to go over
so<00:02:33.660> something<00:02:33.960> I<00:02:34.020> thought<00:02:34.170> was<00:02:34.320> really<00:02:34.560> cool

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
so something I thought was really cool

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.830 
so something I thought was really cool
is<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.130> we<00:02:35.730> do<00:02:35.940> get<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.180> glimpse<00:02:36.450> at<00:02:36.600> base

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
is that we do get a glimpse at base

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.120 
is that we do get a glimpse at base
jumping<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.440> I've<00:02:37.470> mentioned<00:02:37.740> this<00:02:37.920> in<00:02:37.980> a

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
jumping and I've mentioned this in a

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.400 
jumping and I've mentioned this in a
previous<00:02:38.160> video<00:02:38.660> but<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.690> was<00:02:39.840> kind<00:02:40.020> of<00:02:40.080> worried

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
previous video but I was kind of worried

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.670 
previous video but I was kind of worried
if<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.770> animation<00:02:41.280> wasn't<00:02:41.760> going<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.030> be<00:02:42.150> very

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
if the animation wasn't going to be very

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.450 
if the animation wasn't going to be very
realistic<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:43.860> kind<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.160> thought<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.340> was

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
realistic so I kind of thought I was

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.920 
realistic so I kind of thought I was
going<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.640> be<00:02:44.700> much<00:02:44.910> like<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.300> bad<00:02:45.510> company

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
going to be much like the bad company

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.780 
going to be much like the bad company
series<00:02:46.230> where<00:02:46.440> if<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.680> jumped<00:02:47.010> out<00:02:47.130> of<00:02:47.190> a

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
series where if you jumped out of a

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.310 
series where if you jumped out of a
helicopter<00:02:48.120> something<00:02:48.810> like<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.020> you<00:02:49.170> would

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
helicopter something like that you would

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.020 
helicopter something like that you would
just<00:02:49.410> go<00:02:49.590> straight<00:02:49.890> down<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.430> just<00:02:50.460> look<00:02:51.000> like

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
just go straight down it just look like

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.970 
just go straight down it just look like
your<00:02:51.360> character<00:02:51.630> was<00:02:51.990> standing<00:02:52.410> but<00:02:52.590> falling

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
your character was standing but falling

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.710 
your character was standing but falling
kind<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.430> thing<00:02:53.610> but<00:02:54.300> that's<00:02:54.480> not<00:02:54.540> actually

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
kind of thing but that's not actually

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.170 
kind of thing but that's not actually
the<00:02:54.870> case<00:02:54.960> it<00:02:55.380> does<00:02:55.620> have<00:02:55.830> an<00:02:55.980> animation<00:02:56.340> where

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
the case it does have an animation where

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.270 
the case it does have an animation where
it<00:02:57.450> does<00:02:57.630> look<00:02:57.840> like<00:02:57.870> your<00:02:58.200> character<00:02:59.040> is

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
it does look like your character is

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.460 
it does look like your character is
sprawled<00:02:59.790> out<00:02:59.970> like<00:03:00.300> he<00:03:00.510> would<00:03:00.780> actually<00:03:00.960> be

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
sprawled out like he would actually be

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.140 
sprawled out like he would actually be
if<00:03:01.680> he<00:03:02.100> was<00:03:02.130> skydiving<00:03:02.490> so<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:02.970> thought<00:03:03.090> that

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
if he was skydiving so I thought that

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.970 
if he was skydiving so I thought that
was<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.390> very<00:03:03.600> nice<00:03:03.900> touch<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.410> really<00:03:04.710> like<00:03:04.860> to

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
was a very nice touch I really like to

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.830 
was a very nice touch I really like to
see<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:06.000> notice<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.420> small<00:03:06.780> things

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
see that you notice the small things

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.920 
see that you notice the small things
that<00:03:07.410> add<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.800> overall<00:03:08.630> just<00:03:09.630> you<00:03:09.810> know

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
that add the overall just you know

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.530 
that add the overall just you know
awesomeness<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.890> game<00:03:11.120> we<00:03:12.120> also<00:03:12.270> get<00:03:12.510> a

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
awesomeness of the game we also get a

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.300 
awesomeness of the game we also get a
glimpse<00:03:12.810> at<00:03:13.020> some<00:03:13.050> boat<00:03:13.530> action<00:03:13.950> where<00:03:14.130> two

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
glimpse at some boat action where two

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.310 
glimpse at some boat action where two
boats<00:03:14.550> are<00:03:14.760> duking<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.060> out<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:15.510> behind<00:03:16.140> them

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
boats are duking it out and behind them

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.680 
boats are duking it out and behind them
is<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> gigantic<00:03:17.040> aircraft<00:03:17.610> carrier<00:03:18.000> which<00:03:18.540> I'm

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
is a gigantic aircraft carrier which I'm

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.270 
is a gigantic aircraft carrier which I'm
assuming<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.380> base<00:03:19.620> for<00:03:19.650> one<00:03:20.100> of<00:03:20.190> the

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
assuming is the base for one of the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.280 
assuming is the base for one of the
factions<00:03:20.520> and<00:03:20.970> we<00:03:21.630> actually<00:03:21.930> don't<00:03:22.020> get<00:03:22.200> to

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
factions and we actually don't get to

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.870 
factions and we actually don't get to
see<00:03:22.440> any<00:03:22.590> land<00:03:22.920> around<00:03:23.250> them<00:03:23.490> so<00:03:23.520> I'm<00:03:23.700> not<00:03:23.820> sure

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
see any land around them so I'm not sure

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.480 
see any land around them so I'm not sure
if<00:03:24.090> it's<00:03:24.390> going<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.690> be<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.900> very<00:03:25.230> water<00:03:25.950> heavy

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
if it's going to be a very water heavy

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.340 
if it's going to be a very water heavy
map<00:03:26.820> where<00:03:27.480> there's<00:03:27.780> only<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:28.020> couple<00:03:28.080> of

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
map where there's only a couple of

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.660 
map where there's only a couple of
islands<00:03:28.830> I<00:03:28.920> think<00:03:29.100> that<00:03:29.220> would<00:03:29.280> be<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.430> very

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
islands I think that would be a very

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.780 
islands I think that would be a very
cool<00:03:30.000> aspect<00:03:30.510> or<00:03:30.660> very<00:03:30.840> cool<00:03:31.110> map<00:03:32.070> design<00:03:32.310> but

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
cool aspect or very cool map design but

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.890 
cool aspect or very cool map design but
I'm<00:03:32.880> not<00:03:32.970> really<00:03:33.060> sure<00:03:33.180> how<00:03:33.480> it's<00:03:33.660> going<00:03:33.870> to

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
I'm not really sure how it's going to

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.510 
I'm not really sure how it's going to
work<00:03:33.990> out<00:03:34.320> if<00:03:34.530> there's<00:03:34.740> going<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:35.010> be<00:03:35.040> I'm

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
work out if there's going to be I'm

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.470 
work out if there's going to be I'm
assuming<00:03:35.880> there's<00:03:36.000> going<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.180> be<00:03:36.210> a<00:03:36.300> lot<00:03:36.450> of

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
assuming there's going to be a lot of

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.570 
assuming there's going to be a lot of
jet<00:03:36.750> gameplay<00:03:36.960> since<00:03:37.350> there<00:03:37.560> is<00:03:37.740> a<00:03:38.070> aircraft

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
jet gameplay since there is a aircraft

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.690 
jet gameplay since there is a aircraft
carrier<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.810> also<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.110> know<00:03:40.520> helicopters<00:03:41.520> as

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
carrier and also you know helicopters as

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.670 
carrier and also you know helicopters as
well<00:03:41.850> but<00:03:42.420> I<00:03:42.750> would<00:03:42.990> I'm<00:03:43.260> really<00:03:43.470> interested

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
well but I would I'm really interested

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.650 
well but I would I'm really interested
to<00:03:43.890> see<00:03:44.100> what<00:03:44.760> is<00:03:44.850> going<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.090> be<00:03:45.210> revealed<00:03:45.450> on

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
to see what is going to be revealed on

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.940 
to see what is going to be revealed on
that<00:03:45.840> map<00:03:46.080> it<00:03:46.320> looks<00:03:46.350> like<00:03:46.590> it's<00:03:46.710> gonna<00:03:46.770> be<00:03:46.920> a

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
that map it looks like it's gonna be a

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.410 
that map it looks like it's gonna be a
lot<00:03:47.070> of<00:03:47.130> fun<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.640> can't<00:03:47.700> wait<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:48.030> see<00:03:48.270> more

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
lot of fun and I can't wait to see more

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.660 
lot of fun and I can't wait to see more
about<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:48.890> so<00:03:49.890> another<00:03:50.040> part<00:03:50.280> of<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.370> trailer

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
about it so another part of the trailer

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.860 
about it so another part of the trailer
that<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.850> thought<00:03:51.030> was<00:03:51.180> very<00:03:51.480> cool<00:03:51.840> and

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
that the thought was very cool and

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.840 
that the thought was very cool and
really<00:03:52.200> interesting<00:03:52.770> was<00:03:53.010> that<00:03:53.040> at<00:03:53.490> one<00:03:53.820> point

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
really interesting was that at one point

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.250 
really interesting was that at one point
in<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.240> trailer<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.660> appears<00:03:55.020> that<00:03:55.110> a

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
in the trailer it appears that a

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.230 
in the trailer it appears that a
helicopter<00:03:55.560> is<00:03:56.100> inside<00:03:56.490> of<00:03:56.640> a<00:03:56.700> tunnel<00:03:57.000> and

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
helicopter is inside of a tunnel and

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.990 
helicopter is inside of a tunnel and
it's<00:03:57.690> flying<00:03:58.380> inside<00:03:58.710> of<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:58.890> tunnel<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.370> a

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
it's flying inside of the tunnel and a

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.670 
it's flying inside of the tunnel and a
tank<00:04:00.510> is<00:04:00.630> shooting<00:04:00.870> at<00:04:00.960> it<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:01.200> shooting<00:04:01.560> back

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
tank is shooting at it and shooting back

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.020 
tank is shooting at it and shooting back
at<00:04:01.710> the<00:04:01.890> tank<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.610> thought<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:02.850> is<00:04:02.910> really

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
at the tank and I thought this is really

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.940 
at the tank and I thought this is really
cool<00:04:03.510> i'm<00:04:03.720> not<00:04:03.840> really<00:04:03.960> sure<00:04:04.080> if<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.500> spawns<00:04:04.800> in

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
cool i'm not really sure if it spawns in

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.500 
cool i'm not really sure if it spawns in
there<00:04:05.130> i<00:04:05.160> kind<00:04:05.490> of<00:04:05.550> doubt<00:04:05.730> it<00:04:05.910> i'm<00:04:06.180> assuming

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
there i kind of doubt it i'm assuming

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.960 
there i kind of doubt it i'm assuming
the<00:04:06.750> pilot<00:04:07.080> just<00:04:07.290> got<00:04:07.470> in<00:04:07.620> there<00:04:07.830> and<00:04:08.070> just<00:04:08.700> was

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
the pilot just got in there and just was

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.000 
the pilot just got in there and just was
trying<00:04:09.150> to<00:04:09.300> defend<00:04:09.600> their<00:04:09.720> points<00:04:10.110> from<00:04:10.830> that

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
trying to defend their points from that

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.790 
trying to defend their points from that
location<00:04:11.190> I<00:04:12.140> mean<00:04:13.140> it<00:04:13.290> really<00:04:13.410> doesn't<00:04:13.740> have

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
location I mean it really doesn't have

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.020 
location I mean it really doesn't have
anything<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.160> do<00:04:14.310> with<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.520> news<00:04:14.760> or<00:04:14.940> anything

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
anything to do with the news or anything

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.370 
anything to do with the news or anything
but<00:04:15.390> I<00:04:15.450> just<00:04:15.660> thought<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:15.840> was<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:15.960> really<00:04:16.020> cool

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
but I just thought it was a really cool

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.260 
but I just thought it was a really cool
aspect<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:16.920> very<00:04:17.100> cinematic<00:04:17.580> part<00:04:18.060> of<00:04:18.180> the

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
aspect a very cinematic part of the

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.330 
aspect a very cinematic part of the
trailer<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.810> thought<00:04:18.900> was<00:04:19.020> amazing<00:04:19.620> that

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
trailer that I thought was amazing that

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.680 
trailer that I thought was amazing that
I<00:04:20.370> thought<00:04:20.520> if<00:04:20.669> you<00:04:20.730> haven't<00:04:21.090> if<00:04:21.270> you<00:04:21.450> haven't

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
I thought if you haven't if you haven't

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.270 
I thought if you haven't if you haven't
noticed<00:04:21.840> that<00:04:22.410> I<00:04:22.530> would<00:04:22.710> go<00:04:22.830> back<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:23.040> the

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
noticed that I would go back to the

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.950 
noticed that I would go back to the
trailer<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:23.790> get<00:04:24.390> to<00:04:24.540> that<00:04:24.600> point<00:04:24.750> I<00:04:24.900> think

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
trailer and get to that point I think

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.550 
trailer and get to that point I think
it's<00:04:25.140> around<00:04:25.200> like

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
it's around like

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.400 
it's around like
40-second<00:04:26.400> mark<00:04:26.430> or<00:04:26.730> something<00:04:26.910> like<00:04:26.970> that<00:04:27.030> so

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
40-second mark or something like that so

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.330 
40-second mark or something like that so
at<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.500> end<00:04:28.530> of<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.740> trailer<00:04:29.040> we<00:04:29.160> get<00:04:29.310> a

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
at the end of the trailer we get a

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.340 
at the end of the trailer we get a
little<00:04:29.580> glimpse<00:04:29.970> at<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.240> back<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.960> karkand

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
little glimpse at the back to karkand

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.020 
little glimpse at the back to karkand
expansion<00:04:31.770> pack<00:04:31.950> we<00:04:32.190> haven't<00:04:32.580> really<00:04:32.790> seen

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
are available we already know what

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.870

they're<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:37.980> know<00:04:38.070> what<00:04:38.190> they're<00:04:38.280> called<00:04:38.490> and

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
they're you know what they're called and

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.040 
they're you know what they're called and
what<00:04:39.000> they're<00:04:39.120> generally<00:04:39.389> going<00:04:39.600> to<00:04:39.750> be<00:04:39.840> like

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
what they're generally going to be like

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.510 
what they're generally going to be like
because<00:04:40.230> they<00:04:40.470> were<00:04:40.530> event<00:04:40.800> battlefield<00:04:41.310> 2

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
because they were event battlefield 2

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.909 
because they were event battlefield 2
but<00:04:42.090> we<00:04:42.180> haven't<00:04:42.389> actually<00:04:42.630> seen<00:04:43.230> any<00:04:43.620> in-game

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
but we haven't actually seen any in-game

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.370 
but we haven't actually seen any in-game
footage<00:04:44.340> and<00:04:44.730> so<00:04:45.000> this<00:04:45.300> is<00:04:45.510> I<00:04:45.540> think<00:04:45.660> maybe<00:04:46.290> I

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
footage and so this is I think maybe I

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.620 
footage and so this is I think maybe I
think<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.740> first<00:04:46.919> time<00:04:47.250> we<00:04:47.880> get<00:04:48.030> a<00:04:48.060> check<00:04:48.300> we

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
think the first time we get a check we

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.110 
think the first time we get a check we
gonna<00:04:48.780> check<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.080> out<00:04:49.200> so<00:04:49.530> it<00:04:50.400> is<00:04:50.639> looking<00:04:51.090> very

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
gonna check it out so it is looking very

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.300 
gonna check it out so it is looking very
nice<00:04:51.570> the<00:04:52.110> footage<00:04:52.320> that<00:04:52.530> we<00:04:52.650> did<00:04:52.830> get<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:53.010> seat

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310
