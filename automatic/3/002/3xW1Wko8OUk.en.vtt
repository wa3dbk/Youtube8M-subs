last season there's gonna be I think his

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.569 
last season there's gonna be I think his
reputations<00:00:30.390> probably<00:00:30.810> been<00:00:31.189> tarnished<00:00:32.189> to

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
reputations probably been tarnished to

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.830 
reputations probably been tarnished to
some<00:00:32.730> extent<00:00:33.030> mainly<00:00:33.210> because<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.450> don't<00:00:33.719> think

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
some extent mainly because I don't think

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.299 
some extent mainly because I don't think
he<00:00:33.899> played<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.260> football<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.890> when<00:00:34.980> he<00:00:35.040> did

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
he played in a football and when he did

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.799 
he played in a football and when he did
I<00:00:35.340> don't<00:00:35.579> think<00:00:35.700> he<00:00:35.880> had<00:00:35.969> enough<00:00:36.000> opportunity

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
I don't think he had enough opportunity

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.270 
I don't think he had enough opportunity
from<00:00:37.110> not<00:00:37.410> having<00:00:37.590> played<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.190> much

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
from not having played that much

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.310 
from not having played that much
football<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.850> really<00:00:39.149> play<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.989> best<00:00:40.140> of

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
football to really play to the best of

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.690 
football to really play to the best of
his<00:00:40.410> ability<00:00:40.890> shall<00:00:41.040> we<00:00:41.129> didn't<00:00:41.340> see<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> great

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
his ability shall we didn't see a great

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.819 
his ability shall we didn't see a great
deal<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.059> goal<00:00:42.270> return<00:00:42.480> from<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.710> don't

deal of a goal return from I just don't

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.290 
deal of a goal return from I just don't
think<00:00:44.070> he<00:00:44.129> fitted<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:44.850> Liverpool's

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
think he fitted in with Liverpool's

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.569 
think he fitted in with Liverpool's
style<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.989> play<00:00:46.140> he's<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> big<00:00:46.770> man<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.399> people

style of play he's a big man so people

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.970 
style of play he's a big man so people
immediately<00:00:47.850> think<00:00:48.120> target<00:00:48.960> man<00:00:49.260> great<00:00:49.620> slump

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
immediately think target man great slump

adopt<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.280> little<00:00:50.520> stick<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.030> think<00:00:51.510> he<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.870> do

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
adopt a little stick I think he can do

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.830 
adopt a little stick I think he can do
that<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.530> don't<00:00:52.829> think<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.910> way

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
that but I don't think that is the way

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.350 
that but I don't think that is the way
they<00:00:54.989> genuinely<00:00:55.590> plays<00:00:55.800> football<00:00:56.149> he's<00:00:57.149> not

they genuinely plays football he's not

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.709 
they genuinely plays football he's not
like<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:58.579> handicap<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.850> think<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> simple<00:01:00.600> as

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
like a handicap I think is the simple as

like a handicap I think is the simple as
simple<00:01:00.989> as<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.350> simplest<00:01:01.649> way<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.770> sort<00:01:02.010> of

know Rickie Lambert he's more like a
Peter<00:01:06.210> Crouch<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:07.020> by<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.380> mean<00:01:07.439> he's

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
Peter Crouch and by that I mean he's

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.920 
Peter Crouch and by that I mean he's
just<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.430> good<00:01:08.640> footballer<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.479> think<00:01:09.840> he

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
just a good footballer I think he

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.740 
just a good footballer I think he

getting into getting into the box I

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.910 
getting into getting into the box I

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
think he does a lot of his bachelor's

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.160

outside the boxing on 44 Liverpool we

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.990 
outside the boxing on 44 Liverpool we
didn't<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.530> enough<00:01:19.560> enough<00:01:20.130> pace<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.670> the

well<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.150> he's<00:01:36.270> got<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> great<00:01:36.600> shot<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.079> so

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
well and he's got a great shot and I so

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.719 
well and he's got a great shot and I so
I<00:01:37.229> think<00:01:37.290> he<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> very<00:01:37.799> useful<00:01:37.950> i've<00:01:38.490> set

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
I think he can be a very useful i've set

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.490 
I think he can be a very useful i've set
and<00:01:39.000> when<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.450> consider<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.990> know<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.259> lot<00:01:40.470> of

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
and when you consider you know a lot of

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.590 
and when you consider you know a lot of
people<00:01:40.560> go<00:01:40.860> with<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.280> big<00:01:41.970> man<00:01:42.119> little<00:01:42.329> might

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
people go with the big man little might

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.620 
people go with the big man little might
approach<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.290> think<00:01:43.729> he's<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:44.880> traditionally

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
approach I think he's not traditionally

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.749 
approach I think he's not traditionally
in<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.869> mobile<00:01:46.290> he<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.470> more<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.890> cultured

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
in that mobile he is more of a cultured

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.760 
in that mobile he is more of a cultured
approach<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.329> type<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.600> thing<00:01:48.899> will<00:01:49.680> he

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
approach to that type of thing will he

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.830 
approach to that type of thing will he

what I percenter forward you looking for
but<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.049> still<00:01:55.290> think<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.740> was<00:01:55.860> still<00:01:56.040> stand

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
but I still think and I was still stand

by Ricky Lam message is good enough to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.080 
by Ricky Lam message is good enough to
play<00:01:58.290> football<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.460> Premier<00:01:59.850> League<00:01:59.880> and

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
play football in the Premier League and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.520 
play football in the Premier League and
I<00:02:00.210> think<00:02:00.390> if<00:02:00.479> you'd<00:02:00.600> actually<00:02:00.719> gone<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.320> club

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
I think if you'd actually gone to a club

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.050 
I think if you'd actually gone to a club
that<00:02:01.560> was<00:02:01.770> gonna<00:02:01.950> play<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.579> his<00:02:02.759> strengths

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
that was gonna play to his strengths

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.249 
that was gonna play to his strengths
last<00:02:03.270> season<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.689> think<00:02:03.869> he<00:02:03.990> would<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.170> been

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
last season I think he would have been

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.319 
last season I think he would have been
able<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.590> carry<00:02:04.829> on<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.820> seasoning<00:02:06.270> out

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
able to carry on the seasoning out

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.789 
able to carry on the seasoning out
before<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:06.840> know<00:02:06.899> he's<00:02:07.079> got<00:02:07.140> double<00:02:07.530> figures

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
before you know he's got double figures

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.440 
before you know he's got double figures

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099

his own ability you know he's dragged

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.150 
his own ability you know he's dragged
himself<00:02:36.810> up<00:02:37.140> he's<00:02:37.290> been<00:02:37.440> through<00:02:37.709> literally
