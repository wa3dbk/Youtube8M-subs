00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
most out of her healthcare is actually

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.240 
most out of her healthcare is actually
to<00:01:21.509> be<00:01:21.540> honest<00:01:22.049> with<00:01:22.259> us<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.650> think<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.070> lot<00:01:23.220> of

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
to be honest with us I think a lot of

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.399 
to be honest with us I think a lot of
times<00:01:23.580> people<00:01:23.850> when<00:01:24.450> they're<00:01:24.659> confronted

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
times people when they're confronted

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.710 
times people when they're confronted
with<00:01:25.560> certain<00:01:25.710> questions<00:01:26.340> feel<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.509> they

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
with certain questions feel like they

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.149 
with certain questions feel like they
have<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.900> give<00:01:28.140> us<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.320> answer<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.799> we<00:01:29.130> want

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
have to give us the answer that we want

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.760 
have to give us the answer that we want
to<00:01:29.549> hear<00:01:29.850> but<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.390> really<00:01:30.720> want<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.350> answer

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
to hear but we really want the answer

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.950 
to hear but we really want the answer
that's<00:01:32.040> that's<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.820> real<00:01:32.970> answer<00:01:33.240> we<00:01:33.720> can't

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
that's that's the real answer we can't

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.990 
that's that's the real answer we can't
help<00:01:34.200> people<00:01:34.320> if<00:01:34.829> they're<00:01:34.979> not<00:01:35.009> giving<00:01:35.579> us<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
help people if they're not giving us the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.960 
help people if they're not giving us the
appropriate<00:01:36.930> information<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.369> think<00:01:38.850> it's

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
appropriate information so I think it's

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.969 
appropriate information so I think it's
important<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.450> people<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.869> be<00:01:39.990> realistic<00:01:40.860> for

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
important for people to be realistic for

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.910 
important for people to be realistic for
themselves<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.700> realistic<00:01:41.970> with<00:01:42.299> us<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.720> that

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
themselves and realistic with us so that

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.530 
themselves and realistic with us so that
so<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:43.950> we<00:01:44.189> can<00:01:44.460> come<00:01:44.759> up<00:01:44.790> with<00:01:44.909> solutions

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
so that we can come up with solutions

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.730 
so that we can come up with solutions
that<00:01:45.659> will<00:01:45.899> work<00:01:46.079> together<00:01:47.030> my<00:01:48.030> husband<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.570> I

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740
