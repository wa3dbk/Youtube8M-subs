00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.380
 we were born to live changes the gas is 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.690
 cheap in ecuador because he was 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.299
 subsidized 90 percent of its cost 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.910
 total so every year was spent 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:17.760
 approximately 700 million dollars 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.460
 in this subsidy because 80 percent 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.040
 of that gas is imported being able with that 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.710
 money having built 175 schools 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.110
 from the millennium to the year and that is lost in 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.870
 our gas tank at a dollar 60 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.730
 cents electricity is a resource 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.270
 renewable that comes from rivers 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.980
 pollutes and is now 100% Ecuadorian if 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.870
 we invest the electric energy what 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.160
 We spend on gas and we stop losing 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.780
 those millions of dollars in 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.550
 imports and subsidies 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.800
 we will have electricity to supply 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.290
 It's all over the country and even for 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.630
 export the same for those who prefer the 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.230
 This gas will continue to exist without 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.570
 subsidy 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.640
 the difference between a gas stove 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.100
 a traditional electric and that of 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.380
 induction is the following gas 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.910
 heated with the classic blue flame and the 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.280
 traditional electric heats with 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.960
 resistance while that of induction 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.179
 it works by applying a principle 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.630
 electromagnetic and so just heats the 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:11.850
 metal 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.250
 the pot that also saves us up to a 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.590
 50 percent of the energy that is 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.360
 wasted in the air that's why 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.149
 the new kitchens need pots 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.740
 Suitable for induction to recognize 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.409
 a proper pot you just have to 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.000
 approaching leoni badly if the magnet sticks to 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.590
 the pot works 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.569
 make sure that all the pots that 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.250
 uses in your new kitchen have the base 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.200
 flat to take better advantage of 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.049
 surface and make it more efficient 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.720
 It also does not change the taste of the food 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.579
 you can cook whatever you want these 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.560
 Induction cookers are already used with great 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.560
 success around the world because they are 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.209
 modern safe and aesthetic 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.220
 Ecuador is the program of 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:53.670
 cooking energy efficiency by 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.380
 induction we were born to live changes and 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.899
 today the world found a new way 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.479
 of cooking caring for the planet saving 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.530
 energy and money welcome to ecuador to 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.530
 this new era
