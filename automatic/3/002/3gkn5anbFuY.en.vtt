00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.970
 people accompany me for about 15 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.580
 people are neighbors of the neighborhood my 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.990
 brothers who help me in the 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.880
 workshop because I have an industrial stalk 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.070
 and the skinheads that come every year 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.400
 to collaborate I usually are 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.080
 working around 18 20 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.500
 people among painters welder 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.630
 the boys who stick the paper 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.760
 me more or less we are about 18 or 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.760
 20 people from Monday to Sunday 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.820
 we carry the carnival in our 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.480
 veins the carnival is something that is part 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.480
 of our lives 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.840
 and that's basically what it is that 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.050
 It impels us artisans 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.300
 pleasure is to look at the people who applaud 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.470
 that they like work and one that's 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.470
 all 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.090
 that is the emotion that people 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.090
 like an elaborate 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.560
 Y 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.530
 and what of the workshop courses that have been 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.360
 done in this year it seems very 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.710
 interesting and very important is very 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.810
 good anyway 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.190
 we also need a lot 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.260
 training not in my case I what 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.870
 I need like now that we are here 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.450
 about to finish the job about to 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.869
 culminate that you feel a satisfaction 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.630
 and the more I believe that the achievement that one 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.600
 The most you can get is to see her happy at 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.630
 public see that feeling see that the 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.350
 people like that they give that offers the 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.350
 work and one 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.610
 with the help of family and peers 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.890
 who have always accompanied us 20 years ago 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.660
 we are with them and they have been faithful 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.540
 in this work and we go as I say 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.550
 doing our best for him to 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.610
 present a good job so that the 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.349
 people will not delight in the figures 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.180
 that we are doing what we want 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.489
 this year is also to let them know 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.359

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.150

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:45.579
