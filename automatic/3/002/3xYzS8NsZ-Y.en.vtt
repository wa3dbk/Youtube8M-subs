00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
trimmed here so let's go to the next

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.630 
trimmed here so let's go to the next
step<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.879> is<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.690> remove<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:41.070> backbone

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
step and that is to remove the backbone

and you can see I've got there's a
triangle-shaped<00:00:44.430> bone<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.180> can<00:00:45.390> feel

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
triangle-shaped bone that I can feel

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.350 
triangle-shaped bone that I can feel
with<00:00:45.809> my<00:00:45.870> fingers<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.770> I'm<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.850> take<00:00:48.120> my

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
with my fingers and I'm going to take my

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.540 
with my fingers and I'm going to take my
knife<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.960> I'm<00:00:49.440> actually<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.070> slide<00:00:50.370> it

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
knife and I'm actually going to slide it

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.360 
knife and I'm actually going to slide it
under<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:52.160> start<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.340> cut<00:00:53.579> away<00:00:55.370> this

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
under and start to cut away this

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.510 
under and start to cut away this
triangle-shaped<00:00:57.210> bone<00:00:57.510> from<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:59.309> meat

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
triangle-shaped bone from the meat

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.799 
triangle-shaped bone from the meat
underneath<00:00:59.930> I'm<00:01:00.930> going<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.140> pull<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.500> open<00:01:02.809> so

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
underneath I'm going to pull it open so

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.130 
underneath I'm going to pull it open so
you<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:04.199> see<00:01:04.970> scrape<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.150> little<00:01:06.299> bit<00:01:06.540> more<00:01:06.840> and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
you can see scrape a little bit more and

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.580 
you can see scrape a little bit more and
now<00:01:07.830> I'm<00:01:08.280> actually<00:01:08.670> going<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.299> cut<00:01:10.140> all<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
now I'm actually going to cut all the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.399 
now I'm actually going to cut all the
way<00:01:10.710> through

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
way through

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.460 
way through
like<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:14.509> so<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.630> removes<00:01:15.960> part<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
like that so that removes part of the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.390 
like that so that removes part of the
backbone<00:01:16.680> I'm<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.640> stand<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.270> up<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
backbone I'm going to stand it up and

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.399 
backbone I'm going to stand it up and
cut<00:01:20.400> down<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:21.030> remove<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.780> rest<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
cut down to remove the rest of the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.249 
cut down to remove the rest of the
backbone<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.360> just<00:01:24.360> want<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.600> make<00:01:24.689> sure<00:01:24.750> that

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
backbone I just want to make sure that

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.069 
backbone I just want to make sure that
I'm<00:01:25.409> not<00:01:25.650> cutting<00:01:26.070> through<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> bone<00:01:26.670> itself

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.740 

which<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.259> looks<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.619> I've<00:01:31.920> got<00:01:32.570> alright<00:01:33.570> I'm

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
which it looks like I've got alright I'm

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.600 
which it looks like I've got alright I'm
just<00:01:33.780> going<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> sometimes<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.159> helps<00:01:35.310> to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
just going to sometimes it helps to

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.940 
just going to sometimes it helps to
actually<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:36.150> break<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.900> there<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.740> see

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
actually just break it there you can see

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.920 
actually just break it there you can see
where<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.250> come<00:01:38.430> loose<00:01:38.610> from<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.000> bone<00:01:39.689> and

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
where it's come loose from the bone and

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.460 
where it's come loose from the bone and
then<00:01:40.710> take<00:01:41.159> your<00:01:41.310> knife<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.670> cut<00:01:41.729> through<00:01:42.470> so

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
then take your knife and cut through so

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.980 
then take your knife and cut through so
that's<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.799> backbone<00:01:44.040> removed<00:01:44.990> sometimes

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
that's the backbone removed sometimes

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.929 
that's the backbone removed sometimes
you'll<00:01:46.229> see<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.680> little<00:01:46.979> extra<00:01:47.430> bone<00:01:47.640> right

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
you'll see a little extra bone right

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.749 
you'll see a little extra bone right
here<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.710> just<00:01:49.710> make<00:01:49.860> sure<00:01:49.890> sometimes<00:01:50.579> it'll

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
here and just make sure sometimes it'll

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.249 
here and just make sure sometimes it'll
come<00:01:50.909> off<00:01:50.939> with<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.299> backbone<00:01:51.720> sometimes

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
come off with the backbone sometimes

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.530 
come off with the backbone sometimes
it's<00:01:52.500> separate<00:01:52.979> all<00:01:53.640> right<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.210> that's<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
it's separate all right so that's the

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.749 
it's separate all right so that's the
backbone<00:01:55.079> now<00:01:55.530> I'm<00:01:55.829> going<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.070> start<00:01:56.340> with<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
backbone now I'm going to start with the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.510 
backbone now I'm going to start with the
drumstick<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:58.710> do<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.040> I'm<00:01:59.159> going<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.369> pick

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
drumstick to do that I'm going to pick

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.490 
drumstick to do that I'm going to pick
the<00:01:59.640> drumstick<00:02:00.149> up<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.509> I'm<00:02:00.960> going<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.200> run<00:02:01.469> my

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
the drumstick up and I'm going to run my

and I can feel there's that little bone
that<00:04:26.740> I<00:04:26.800> was<00:04:26.920> talking<00:04:27.310> about<00:04:27.370> earlier<00:04:27.520> and

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
that I was talking about earlier and

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.590 
that I was talking about earlier and
let's<00:04:28.870> just<00:04:29.200> scrape<00:04:30.010> that<00:04:30.360> because<00:04:31.360> if<00:04:31.480> you're

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
let's just scrape that because if you're

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.210 
let's just scrape that because if you're
really<00:04:31.840> lucky<00:04:31.990> it's<00:04:32.680> going<00:04:32.890> to<00:04:32.950> come<00:04:33.130> out

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
really lucky it's going to come out

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.200 
really lucky it's going to come out
right<00:04:33.550> with<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.330> rest<00:04:34.540> of<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:36.060> with<00:04:37.060> the

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
right with the rest of the with the

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.380 
right with the rest of the with the
thigh<00:04:37.450> bone<00:04:38.760> there<00:04:39.760> we<00:04:39.910> go

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
thigh bone there we go

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.420 
thigh bone there we go
scrape<00:04:40.870> that<00:04:40.900> there<00:04:41.470> that's<00:04:41.770> that<00:04:41.890> little

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
scrape that there that's that little

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.280 
scrape that there that's that little
narrow<00:04:42.670> bone<00:04:43.030> that<00:04:43.390> little<00:04:43.600> pointy<00:04:43.930> one<00:04:44.110> and
