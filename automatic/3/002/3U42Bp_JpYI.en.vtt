00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
close I feel that it's a little bit too

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.390 
close I feel that it's a little bit too
much<00:03:25.329> it's<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.690> little<00:03:25.720> bit<00:03:26.019> too<00:03:26.230> goofy<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:27.040> I

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
much it's a little bit too goofy and I

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.640 
much it's a little bit too goofy and I
think<00:03:27.700> really<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.269> perfect<00:03:28.540> proximity<00:03:29.230> is<00:03:29.380> is

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
think really the perfect proximity is is

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.520 
think really the perfect proximity is is
about<00:03:29.799> seven<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.489> nine<00:03:30.519> inches<00:03:31.120> away<00:03:31.470> it's<00:03:32.470> a

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
about seven to nine inches away it's a

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.140 
about seven to nine inches away it's a
little<00:03:32.739> bit<00:03:32.859> overwhelming<00:03:33.430> in<00:03:33.579> the<00:03:33.670> bass<00:03:33.880> end

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
little bit overwhelming in the bass end

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.670 
little bit overwhelming in the bass end
of<00:03:34.269> things<00:03:34.480> if<00:03:34.660> you're<00:03:35.049> any<00:03:35.170> closer<00:03:35.440> than

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
of things if you're any closer than

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.129 
of things if you're any closer than
about<00:03:35.859> four<00:03:36.160> inches<00:03:36.609> now<00:03:37.420> I<00:03:37.450> want<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:37.930> talk

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
about four inches now I want to talk

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.750 
about four inches now I want to talk
about<00:03:38.319> the<00:03:38.620> capsule<00:03:39.130> and<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.310> is<00:03:39.489> where<00:03:39.639> this

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
about the capsule and this is where this

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.670 
about the capsule and this is where this
thing<00:03:40.000> gets<00:03:40.269> that<00:03:40.630> gets<00:03:41.139> pretty<00:03:41.350> cool<00:03:41.530> the

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
thing gets that gets pretty cool the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.490 
thing gets that gets pretty cool the
element<00:03:42.130> here<00:03:42.250> rotates<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:43.870> can<00:03:44.019> rotate<00:03:44.230> it

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
element here rotates you can rotate it

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.650 
element here rotates you can rotate it
upwards<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.700> change<00:03:46.000> from<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.359> floor

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
upwards to change from the floor

upwards to change from the floor
refraction<00:03:47.290> to<00:03:47.500> sealian<00:03:48.040> refraction<00:03:48.459> and

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
refraction to sealian refraction and

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.280 
refraction to sealian refraction and
again<00:03:48.790> is<00:03:48.940> you<00:03:49.030> can<00:03:49.180> hear<00:03:49.630> a<00:03:49.660> changes<00:03:50.170> that

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
again is you can hear a changes that

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.620 
again is you can hear a changes that
sound<00:03:50.470> drastically<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:52.120> it<00:03:52.299> really<00:03:52.540> is

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
sound drastically and it really is

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.629 
sound drastically and it really is
preferential<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.440> what<00:03:53.680> kind<00:03:54.010> of<00:03:54.100> recording

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
preferential to what kind of recording

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.520 
preferential to what kind of recording
you're<00:03:54.790> doing<00:03:55.120> this<00:03:55.750> is<00:03:55.870> kind<00:03:56.079> of<00:03:56.139> a<00:03:56.200> little

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
you're doing this is kind of a little

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.900 
you're doing this is kind of a little
bit<00:03:56.620> of<00:03:56.769> distance<00:03:57.099> a<00:03:57.250> little<00:03:57.340> bit<00:03:57.579> of<00:03:57.700> space

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
bit of distance a little bit of space

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.640 
bit of distance a little bit of space
between<00:03:58.120> me<00:03:58.480> and<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:58.690> microphone<00:03:59.079> itself<00:03:59.380> and

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
between me and the microphone itself and

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.740 
between me and the microphone itself and
when<00:04:00.430> you<00:04:00.519> turn<00:04:00.730> the<00:04:00.819> capsule<00:04:01.150> below<00:04:01.450> you<00:04:01.510> can

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
when you turn the capsule below you can

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.039 
when you turn the capsule below you can
actually<00:04:02.170> rotate<00:04:02.380> it<00:04:02.739> or<00:04:03.209> you<00:04:04.209> know<00:04:04.299> refract

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
actually rotate it or you know refract

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:07.440 
actually rotate it or you know refract
it<00:04:05.200> off<00:04:05.290> the<00:04:05.470> floor<00:04:05.799> and<00:04:06.579> again<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:07.030> changes

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
it off the floor and again that changes

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.199 
it off the floor and again that changes
the<00:04:07.569> sound<00:04:07.750> pretty<00:04:08.290> drastically<00:04:09.209> this

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
the sound pretty drastically this

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.240 
the sound pretty drastically this
capsule<00:04:10.630> has<00:04:10.780> surprisingly<00:04:11.380> little<00:04:11.709> handling

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
capsule has surprisingly little handling

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.759 
capsule has surprisingly little handling
noise<00:04:12.690> you<00:04:13.690> can<00:04:13.870> hear<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.169> but<00:04:14.260> it's<00:04:14.440> very<00:04:14.500> very

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
noise you can hear it but it's very very

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.409 
noise you can hear it but it's very very
minimal<00:04:15.280> so<00:04:15.459> you<00:04:15.519> can't<00:04:15.790> change<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.269> while

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
minimal so you can't change it while

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.150 
minimal so you can't change it while
you're<00:04:16.660> recording<00:04:16.959> especially<00:04:17.950> if<00:04:18.039> you're

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
you're recording especially if you're

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.000 
you're recording especially if you're
talking<00:04:18.489> over<00:04:18.700> the<00:04:18.880> top<00:04:19.090> of<00:04:19.120> it<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:20.620> reason<00:04:20.799> I

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
talking over the top of it the reason I

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.260 
talking over the top of it the reason I
love<00:04:21.160> this<00:04:21.370> microphone<00:04:21.789> and<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.000> reason

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
love this microphone and the reason

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.969 
love this microphone and the reason
people<00:04:22.450> are<00:04:22.599> going<00:04:22.840> so<00:04:23.020> crazy<00:04:23.229> about<00:04:23.590> it<00:04:23.830> is

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
people are going so crazy about it is

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.100 
people are going so crazy about it is
because<00:04:24.190> of<00:04:24.580> this<00:04:24.700> sweet<00:04:24.970> exaggerated<00:04:25.930> low

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110

2012 two years ago there was the blue

transformer in it and it really is a

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.809 
transformer in it and it really is a

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:51.819 
nice transformer and you know there's a

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:53.159 
nice transformer and you know there's a
big<00:04:52.030> difference<00:04:52.210> between<00:04:52.539> a<00:04:52.810> crappy

the blue Mouse does a surprisingly good
job<00:05:05.639> unlike<00:05:06.639> ma<00:05:06.879> unlike<00:05:07.539> mics<00:05:07.750> that<00:05:07.870> drop<00:05:08.259> off

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:08.469 
job unlike ma unlike mics that drop off

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:12.390 
job unlike ma unlike mics that drop off
around<00:05:08.919> 70<00:05:09.520> Hertz<00:05:09.669> the<00:05:10.629> blue<00:05:10.930> Mouse<00:05:11.860> really

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
around 70 Hertz the blue Mouse really

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.029 
around 70 Hertz the blue Mouse really
holds<00:05:12.699> on<00:05:12.819> it<00:05:13.270> does<00:05:13.509> drop<00:05:13.750> off<00:05:13.960> eventually<00:05:14.500> but

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
holds on it does drop off eventually but

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.700 
holds on it does drop off eventually but
I<00:05:15.099> found<00:05:15.430> it<00:05:15.669> to<00:05:15.789> hold<00:05:16.030> on<00:05:16.210> a<00:05:16.389> lot<00:05:16.780> better<00:05:17.110> than

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
I found it to hold on a lot better than

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.610 
I found it to hold on a lot better than
and<00:05:18.400> to<00:05:18.729> you<00:05:19.060> know<00:05:19.180> lose<00:05:19.599> it<00:05:19.840> lose<00:05:20.409> its

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
and to you know lose it lose its

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.559 
and to you know lose it lose its
frequency<00:05:21.069> response<00:05:21.550> a<00:05:21.639> lot<00:05:21.789> slower<00:05:22.210> and<00:05:22.389> a

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
frequency response a lot slower and a

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.540 
frequency response a lot slower and a
lot<00:05:22.719> more<00:05:22.750> gradually<00:05:23.379> than<00:05:23.560> some<00:05:24.159> microphones

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
lot more gradually than some microphones

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.309 
lot more gradually than some microphones
which<00:05:24.879> have<00:05:25.060> that<00:05:25.150> kind<00:05:25.449> of<00:05:25.509> low<00:05:25.689> frequency

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 
which have that kind of low frequency

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.100 
which have that kind of low frequency
drop<00:05:26.590> off<00:05:26.830> so<00:05:27.550> because<00:05:28.120> of<00:05:28.300> that<00:05:28.330> you<00:05:28.990> would

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
drop off so because of that you would

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.740 
drop off so because of that you would
expect<00:05:29.500> to<00:05:29.529> get<00:05:29.770> some<00:05:30.069> some<00:05:30.370> low-end<00:05:30.580> noise<00:05:30.940> as

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
expect to get some some low-end noise as

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.990 
expect to get some some low-end noise as
some<00:05:31.990> rumbling<00:05:32.440> and<00:05:32.680> ground<00:05:33.610> noises

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
some rumbling and ground noises

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.119 
some rumbling and ground noises
surprisingly<00:05:34.539> minimal<00:05:34.960> it<00:05:35.349> is<00:05:35.500> there<00:05:35.710> it<00:05:36.069> is

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:36.129 
surprisingly minimal it is there it is

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:38.700 
surprisingly minimal it is there it is
existent<00:05:36.759> and<00:05:36.940> you<00:05:37.840> can<00:05:38.020> use<00:05:38.169> software<00:05:38.440> to

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
existent and you can use software to

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.320 
existent and you can use software to
kind<00:05:38.979> of<00:05:39.009> get<00:05:39.219> rid<00:05:39.250> of<00:05:39.400> it<00:05:39.550> or<00:05:39.639> hardware<00:05:40.060> I<00:05:40.090> mean

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
kind of get rid of it or hardware I mean

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.820 
kind of get rid of it or hardware I mean
the<00:05:40.960> hardware<00:05:41.259> is<00:05:41.319> probably<00:05:41.620> the<00:05:41.710> better

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
the hardware is probably the better

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.740 
the hardware is probably the better
option<00:05:42.279> but<00:05:42.430> for<00:05:42.610> people<00:05:43.180> that<00:05:43.330> don't<00:05:43.509> have<00:05:43.659> an

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
option but for people that don't have an

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.629 
option but for people that don't have an
insanely<00:05:44.080> nice<00:05:44.379> setup<00:05:44.710> you<00:05:45.129> know<00:05:45.219> software

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
insanely nice setup you know software

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:48.420 
insanely nice setup you know software
will<00:05:45.789> do<00:05:45.879> the<00:05:46.029> job<00:05:46.240> but<00:05:47.139> the<00:05:47.949> ground<00:05:48.129> waste<00:05:48.310> is

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
will do the job but the ground waste is

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.070 
will do the job but the ground waste is
surprisingly<00:05:48.940> low<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:49.360> I<00:05:49.419> found<00:05:49.690> that<00:05:49.900> even

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
surprisingly low and I found that even

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.050 
surprisingly low and I found that even
sometimes<00:05:50.560> I<00:05:50.650> don't<00:05:50.710> even<00:05:50.860> have<00:05:51.069> to<00:05:51.219> mess<00:05:52.029> with

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
sometimes I don't even have to mess with

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.339 
sometimes I don't even have to mess with
this<00:05:52.360> out<00:05:52.539> at<00:05:52.690> all<00:05:52.779> because<00:05:52.930> it<00:05:53.139> sounds

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
this out at all because it sounds

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:55.640 
this out at all because it sounds
perfect<00:05:53.770> right<00:05:54.520> from<00:05:54.729> the<00:05:54.849> recording

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
perfect right from the recording

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.990 
perfect right from the recording
additionally<00:05:56.650> handling<00:05:57.159> is<00:05:57.310> surprisingly

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
additionally handling is surprisingly

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
additionally handling is surprisingly
quiet<00:05:58.300> as<00:05:58.449> well<00:05:58.680> my<00:06:00.210> my<00:06:01.210> boom<00:06:01.449> here<00:06:01.659> is<00:06:01.750> getting

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
quiet as well my my boom here is getting

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.570 
quiet as well my my boom here is getting
really<00:06:02.379> pretty<00:06:02.589> squeaky<00:06:03.069> but<00:06:03.219> I<00:06:03.250> mean<00:06:03.460> this

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
really pretty squeaky but I mean this

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.709 
really pretty squeaky but I mean this
moves<00:06:03.969> with<00:06:05.129> very<00:06:06.129> little<00:06:06.460> noise<00:06:06.719> especially

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:07.719 
moves with very little noise especially

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:10.200 
moves with very little noise especially
when<00:06:08.110> you<00:06:08.229> shake<00:06:09.009> the<00:06:09.219> microphone<00:06:09.610> itself<00:06:09.909> I'm

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
when you shake the microphone itself I'm

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.510 
when you shake the microphone itself I'm
here<00:06:10.449> on<00:06:10.599> the<00:06:11.349> spider<00:06:11.800> mountain<00:06:12.219> which<00:06:12.370> is

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
here on the spider mountain which is

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.579 
here on the spider mountain which is
included<00:06:13.029> with<00:06:13.150> the<00:06:13.300> mic<00:06:13.509> and<00:06:14.080> if<00:06:14.229> you<00:06:14.319> shake

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:14.589 
included with the mic and if you shake

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:17.939 
included with the mic and if you shake
this<00:06:15.120> you<00:06:16.120> can<00:06:16.270> see<00:06:16.419> them<00:06:16.569> out<00:06:16.779> that<00:06:17.319> mic<00:06:17.469> tends

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
this you can see them out that mic tends

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:20.969 
this you can see them out that mic tends
to<00:06:18.069> move<00:06:18.219> quite<00:06:18.460> a<00:06:18.490> bit<00:06:18.729> and<00:06:19.690> you<00:06:20.529> can<00:06:20.710> hear

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
to move quite a bit and you can hear

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:23.129 
to move quite a bit and you can hear
that<00:06:21.009> rumbling<00:06:21.400> but<00:06:21.729> it<00:06:21.789> really<00:06:22.120> is<00:06:22.240> not<00:06:22.419> as

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:23.139 
that rumbling but it really is not as

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.879 
that rumbling but it really is not as
substantial<00:06:23.469> as<00:06:24.039> many<00:06:24.370> would<00:06:24.580> think<00:06:25.650> this<00:06:26.650> has

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:26.889 
substantial as many would think this has

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.890 
substantial as many would think this has
a<00:06:26.919> really<00:06:27.190> tight<00:06:27.310> cardioid<00:06:28.120> pattern<00:06:28.270> as<00:06:28.599> well

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
a really tight cardioid pattern as well

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.409 
a really tight cardioid pattern as well
so<00:06:29.139> if<00:06:29.349> I<00:06:29.650> turn<00:06:29.949> this<00:06:30.129> around<00:06:30.190> you<00:06:31.089> can<00:06:31.270> see

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
so if I turn this around you can see

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:33.480 
so if I turn this around you can see
that<00:06:31.569> the<00:06:31.659> backwards<00:06:32.110> rejection

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
that the backwards rejection

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.330 
that the backwards rejection
pretty<00:06:34.419> much<00:06:34.599> eliminates<00:06:35.259> that<00:06:35.410> that<00:06:35.949> type<00:06:36.190> of

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
pretty much eliminates that that type of

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.499 
pretty much eliminates that that type of
interference<00:06:36.669> and<00:06:36.910> that<00:06:37.000> type<00:06:37.150> of<00:06:37.180> sound

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:37.509 
interference and that type of sound

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:38.939 
interference and that type of sound
which<00:06:37.660> is<00:06:37.690> really<00:06:38.229> great<00:06:38.440> because<00:06:38.590> if<00:06:38.830> you're

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:38.949 
which is really great because if you're

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:41.610 
which is really great because if you're
doing<00:06:39.069> studio<00:06:39.520> work<00:06:39.789> you<00:06:40.509> do<00:06:40.750> want<00:06:40.990> that

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
doing studio work you do want that

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.620 
doing studio work you do want that
really<00:06:42.069> narrow<00:06:42.400> cardioid<00:06:42.940> pattern<00:06:43.060> and<00:06:43.479> that

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:43.630 
really narrow cardioid pattern and that

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.850 
really narrow cardioid pattern and that
tight<00:06:43.900> pattern<00:06:44.139> so<00:06:44.410> that<00:06:44.530> you<00:06:44.620> can<00:06:44.770> get

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
tight pattern so that you can get

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.170 
tight pattern so that you can get
yourself<00:06:45.280> but<00:06:45.460> not<00:06:45.580> really<00:06:45.819> things

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
yourself but not really things

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.839 
yourself but not really things
surrounding<00:06:46.690> you<00:06:47.069> this<00:06:48.069> is<00:06:48.220> an<00:06:48.310> amazing<00:06:48.669> mic

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:48.849 
surrounding you this is an amazing mic

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:50.879 
surrounding you this is an amazing mic
and<00:06:49.090> I<00:06:49.150> love<00:06:49.419> it<00:06:49.569> again<00:06:50.080> you<00:06:50.289> do<00:06:50.530> need<00:06:50.740> the

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 
and I love it again you do need the

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:52.170 
and I love it again you do need the
hardware<00:06:51.099> to<00:06:51.280> back<00:06:51.460> it<00:06:51.610> up<00:06:51.669> you<00:06:51.849> can't<00:06:52.030> just

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180 
hardware to back it up you can't just

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.580
