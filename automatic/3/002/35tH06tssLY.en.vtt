00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
another 3 run to kawana doesn't know

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:55.850 
another 3 run to kawana doesn't know
like<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.020> connected<00:01:55.470> look<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.830> got

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
like that connected look like it got

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.100 
like that connected look like it got

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
resistors at switch over this is is he

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.870 
resistors at switch over this is is he
seems<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.500> be<00:01:58.620> somewhat<00:01:59.040> under<00:01:59.340> pressure<00:01:59.610> is

going to be back onto kawana takes a

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.320 
going to be back onto kawana takes a
little<00:02:01.860> bit<00:02:02.010> of<00:02:02.070> damage<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.550> kawana<00:02:02.880> went<00:02:03.210> all

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
little bit of damage in kawana went all

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.780 
little bit of damage in kawana went all
the<00:02:03.480> way<00:02:03.510> down<00:02:03.930> although<00:02:04.680> sir<00:02:04.980> to<00:02:05.220> death<00:02:05.520> there

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
the way down although sir to death there

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.370 
the way down although sir to death there
in<00:02:05.910> that<00:02:06.000> situation<00:02:06.360> but<00:02:06.750> eventually<00:02:07.050> got

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
in that situation but eventually got

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.490 
in that situation but eventually got
away<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:07.950> nice<00:02:08.879> he'll<00:02:09.509> up<00:02:09.720> right<00:02:10.020> at<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.289> end

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
away so nice he'll up right at the end

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.229 
away so nice he'll up right at the end
this<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:10.950> going<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.340> back<00:02:11.579> on<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:12.090> his

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
this is going to get back on to his

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.270 
this is going to get back on to his
target<00:02:12.659> which<00:02:12.780> will<00:02:12.930> be<00:02:13.079> kawana<00:02:13.469> yep<00:02:14.099> I
