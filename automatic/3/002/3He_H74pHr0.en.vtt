00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
fumble by the kick return team will we

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.830 
fumble by the kick return team will we
still<00:03:50.280> have<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.610> same<00:03:50.850> returner<00:03:51.390> when<00:03:51.720> they

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
still have the same returner when they

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.809 
still have the same returner when they
come<00:03:52.080> back<00:03:52.110> out<00:03:52.530> in<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.709> field<00:03:52.770> I<00:03:53.220> don't<00:03:53.760> think

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
come back out in the field I don't think

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.150

so<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.480> was<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:54.660> big<00:03:54.900> mistake<00:03:55.080> I<00:03:55.560> think<00:03:56.069> they

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
so that was a big mistake I think they

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.820 
so that was a big mistake I think they
need<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.340> replacement<00:03:56.959> this<00:03:57.959> play<00:03:58.290> will<00:03:58.590> hold

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830
