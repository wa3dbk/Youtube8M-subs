00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.530
 as you will have observed in the photographs 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.000
 this time I'm going to teach you 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.610
 to elaborate 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.890
 spheres made with seeds and grains 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.960
 and they are some of those to be observed in 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.960
 the photographs that appear at the beginning of 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.000
 this video 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.579
 this time I'm going to teach you 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.280
 elaborate this which is a sphere made in 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.280
 whole with sunflower seeds 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.490
 I hope you like it and it serves you 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.450
 the materials that we are going to need 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.870
 to elaborate this is a sphere of my 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.710
 be 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.810
 and I recommend that you start with a 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.150
 small sphere that is not very large 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.520
 so you do not feel frustrated if you do not 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.899
 it comes to you first 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:33.060
 this size ends up like this because of the size of 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.060
 the seeds grew pretty 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.149
 sunflower seeds 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.609
 and for this size you need around 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.289
 of 200 grams but obviously the 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.780
 how much you need is depends on the 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.090
 size of this sphere and a pistol 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.320
 silicone 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.820
 enough silicone bars and 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.180
 Well let's start 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.760
 The first thing you should do is verify 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.820
 the quality of the seeds that you bought 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.800
 or even better when you go to buy the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.830
 check that the seeds are not too 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.740
 broken as for example seeds like 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.260
 is 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.260
 They will not serve you because they are broken 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.860
 and you should check the ones that are not broken 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.550
 as for example 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.620
 chopped as 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.280
 I do not know if you appreciate that you have a small 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.610
 hole then this can you go 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.950
 doing also while you're hitting 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.610
 the in your 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.610
 I hope 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:47.260
 takes its unicel sphere and so 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:50.819
 regular the spheres have a fringe and 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.400
 you will try to locate the center 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:57.580
 these have a few dots here and it's going to 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:01.440
 be the point from where you're going to start 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.440
 to start to paste the seeds 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:22.340
 you are going to place the first stop and 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.340
 then the others around him 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:33.060
 silicone is too hot what 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.720
 will happen is that you your seeds this 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.610
 maybe they are going to be 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.610
 I'm reading a crashing 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.440
 It is very hot then 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.750
 If you already have a good time working with 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.300
 It starts to get hot because you 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.300
 I recommend pairs or change epistolary 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.540
 with return is already winter and silicone 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.420
 it dries 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.099
 very fast good cool very fast 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.400
 rather we have what you have that 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:07.130
 problem to the contrary 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.569
 I recommend you do not put this much 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.290
 silicone 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:17.489
 because if it gets cold you're not going to 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.109
 be able to place the rest of the seeds and 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.870
 what will stay is going to be there is a 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.870
 half nasty plasta 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:33.230
 you will repeat this process with everything 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.900
 the rest of your sphere 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.210
 as they move forward placing the 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:42.900
 seeds you will realize 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:46.560
 what you need to do is just go 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:51.169
 placing the seeds as close to 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.169
 which you already put of the previous round 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.180
 a homogeneous size 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:31.660
 standard or not 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.580
 well in the end they are not the same this is not you 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.910
 there will be a perfect circle in this 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.910
 area 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.090
 but what you 're going to do is go try 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.090
 accommodate 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:48.319
 that you have the circle 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.350
 if at any moment you feel that some 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.720
 of these seeds was left loose 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.610
 because the silicon was already hard or something 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:18.009
 so he just takes it out 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.800
 take it out and put silicone in 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:22.870
 this part 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.550
 in the part where it was stuck 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.910
 and since we put where 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.910
 I was 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:36.120
 and ready good this is the wait of the day 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.580
 from today 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:42.590
 in the next video I'll teach you to 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.590
 do the extras with 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:49.660
 and that 's the part of seeing yourself more 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:54.530
 that they also look pretty 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:56.460
 aromatic therefore the material 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:00.240
 with which they are made 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:03.210
 in total you spend on making a sphere 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.300
 of these around 10 3 or you can see 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:09.110
 the size 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:12.110
 quite good size and then nothing 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:15.349
 thank you very much for watching this video and for 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.340
 give me time today good luck and we 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:18.699
 see you soon 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.699
 bye
