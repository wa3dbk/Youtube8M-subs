the<00:00:39.780> advantage<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.530> course<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.890> if

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the advantage of that of course is if

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.010 
the advantage of that of course is if
this<00:00:41.190> isn't<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.520> DJ<00:00:41.910> box<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.480> can<00:00:42.660> have<00:00:42.809> your

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
this isn't a DJ box you can have your

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.090 
this isn't a DJ box you can have your
controller<00:00:43.789> above<00:00:44.809> the<00:00:45.809> existing<00:00:46.289> gear<00:00:46.469> and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
controller above the existing gear and

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.459 
controller above the existing gear and
then<00:00:47.370> your<00:00:47.489> laptop<00:00:47.850> above<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.870> all<00:00:49.170> of

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
then your laptop above that so all of

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.930 
then your laptop above that so all of
your<00:00:49.590> gear<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.980> kept<00:00:50.190> out<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> way<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.820> as

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
your gear is kept out of the way and as

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.639 
your gear is kept out of the way and as
long<00:00:51.090> as<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.420> swap<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.899> unit<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.379> at<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
long as you can swap this unit in at the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.889 
long as you can swap this unit in at the
back<00:00:52.860> then<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.879> going<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.120> work<00:00:54.239> nicely<00:00:54.480> for

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
back then it's going to work nicely for

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:55.189 
back then it's going to work nicely for
you

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
you

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.410 
you
the<00:00:55.980> disadvantage<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.789> course<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.270> it's

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
the disadvantage of course is that it's

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.450 
the disadvantage of course is that it's
more<00:00:57.600> complicated<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.320> set<00:00:58.590> up<00:00:58.770> it's<00:00:59.010> heavier

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
more complicated to set up it's heavier

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.090 
more complicated to set up it's heavier
and<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.780> indeed<00:01:01.079> being<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.620> cap

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
and so on and indeed being the cap

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.130 
and so on and indeed being the cap
handed<00:01:02.640> kind<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.149> guy<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.300> am<00:01:03.629> except<00:01:03.989> we're

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
handed kind of guy I am except we're

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.740 
handed kind of guy I am except we're
good<00:01:04.460> 45<00:01:05.460> minutes<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:06.030> get<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.270> set<00:01:06.510> up<00:01:06.540> I

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
good 45 minutes to get this set up I

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.810 
good 45 minutes to get this set up I
wanted<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.260> I'll<00:01:08.040> talk<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.369> through<00:01:08.520> the

wanted it I'll talk you through the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.649 
wanted it I'll talk you through the
sound<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.150> little<00:01:09.240> bit<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.659> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
sound a little bit so it is the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.690 
sound a little bit so it is the
platforms<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.290> top<00:01:13.530> covered<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.250> rubber

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
platforms on the top covered in rubber

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.660 
platforms on the top covered in rubber
this<00:01:15.299> kind<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.600> rubberized<00:01:15.900> phone<00:01:16.490> stick<00:01:17.490> on

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
this kind of rubberized phone stick on

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.600 
this kind of rubberized phone stick on
stuff<00:01:17.939> which<00:01:18.600> means<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.500> get<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.740> soft

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
stuff which means that you get a soft

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.170 
stuff which means that you get a soft
landing<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.049> control<00:01:22.409> up

here these screw on and they have little

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.050 
here these screw on and they have little
sections<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.860> be<00:01:31.979> removed<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.549> one<00:01:32.759> two

three four five on each side was three
on<00:01:36.960> each<00:01:37.079> side<00:01:37.110> at<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.500> moment<00:01:37.530> however<00:01:38.189> I've

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
on each side at the moment however I've

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.609 
on each side at the moment however I've
taken<00:01:38.970> I've<00:01:39.420> taken<00:01:39.659> two<00:01:39.900> off<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.290> make<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
taken I've taken two off to make it a

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.469 
taken I've taken two off to make it a
little<00:01:40.770> bit<00:01:40.950> narrower<00:01:41.250> because<00:01:41.970> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
little bit narrower because the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.510 
little bit narrower because the
controller<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:43.049> want<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.350> use<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.649> with<00:01:43.829> isn't

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
controller I want to use it with isn't

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.999 
controller I want to use it with isn't
the<00:01:44.759> widest<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.450> take<00:01:45.710> because<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.890> that

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
the widest it can take because of that

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.960 
the widest it can take because of that
you<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.729> adjust<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.450> mean<00:01:48.540> this

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
you can you can adjust this I mean this

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.920 
you can you can adjust this I mean this
there's<00:01:49.180> still<00:01:49.330> quite<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.630> few<00:01:49.690> of<00:01:49.870> these

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
there's still quite a few of these

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.870 
there's still quite a few of these
things<00:01:50.140> left<00:01:50.440> so<00:01:50.770> you<00:01:51.070> can<00:01:51.220> adjust<00:01:51.520> this<00:01:51.700> in

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
things left so you can adjust this in

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.730 
things left so you can adjust this in
and<00:01:52.120> out<00:01:52.240> quite<00:01:52.570> a<00:01:52.630> lot<00:01:52.870> to<00:01:53.200> suit<00:01:53.410> your<00:01:53.680> own

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
and out quite a lot to suit your own

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.040 
and out quite a lot to suit your own
needs<00:01:53.980> which<00:01:54.850> is<00:01:55.000> a<00:01:55.030> really<00:01:55.330> nice<00:01:55.480> touch<00:01:55.780> but

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
needs which is a really nice touch but

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.630 
needs which is a really nice touch but
you<00:01:56.080> shouldn't<00:01:56.380> customize<00:01:56.920> it<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.430> that's

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
you shouldn't customize it and that's

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.420 
you shouldn't customize it and that's
doubly<00:01:58.030> important<00:01:58.540> because<00:01:58.660> on<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:59.020> front

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
doubly important because on the front

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.610 
doubly important because on the front
these<00:02:00.430> tabs<00:02:00.820> here<00:02:00.970> on<00:02:01.480> the<00:02:02.200> front<00:02:02.470> of<00:02:02.530> the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
these tabs here on the front of the

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.930 
these tabs here on the front of the
typical<00:02:03.070> controller<00:02:03.460> there's<00:02:03.730> going<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:03.880> be

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
typical controller there's going to be

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.520 
typical controller there's going to be
buttons<00:02:04.360> and<00:02:04.600> knobs<00:02:04.780> and<00:02:05.020> so<00:02:05.170> on<00:02:05.320> and<00:02:05.440> you<00:02:05.470> can

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
buttons and knobs and so on and you can

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.380 
buttons and knobs and so on and you can
adjust<00:02:05.980> it<00:02:06.190> so<00:02:06.220> it's<00:02:06.550> perfectly<00:02:07.060> on<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.270> edge

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
adjust it so it's perfectly on the edge

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.330 
adjust it so it's perfectly on the edge
and<00:02:07.600> it's<00:02:07.720> not<00:02:07.930> clashing<00:02:08.619> or<00:02:08.830> you're<00:02:08.950> not

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
and it's not clashing or you're not

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.650 
and it's not clashing or you're not
for<00:02:09.520> instance<00:02:09.820> on<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:09.970> tractor<00:02:10.240> control

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
for instance on a tractor control

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.150 
for instance on a tractor control
therefore<00:02:13.020> there's<00:02:14.020> buttons<00:02:14.470> are<00:02:14.740> not<00:02:14.860> here

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
therefore there's buttons are not here

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.350 
therefore there's buttons are not here
so<00:02:15.430> you're<00:02:15.550> going<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.700> want<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:15.880> make<00:02:16.000> sure<00:02:16.060> you

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
so you're going to want to make sure you

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.600 
so you're going to want to make sure you
avoid<00:02:16.450> those<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:20.470> when<00:02:20.650> you've<00:02:20.800> got<00:02:21.400> all<00:02:21.520> this

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
avoid those so when you've got all this

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.750 
avoid those so when you've got all this
set<00:02:21.820> up<00:02:22.560> you've<00:02:23.560> got<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:23.950> look<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:24.310> want<00:02:24.459> and

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
set up you've got the look you want and

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.600 
set up you've got the look you want and
you've<00:02:25.300> got<00:02:25.510> over<00:02:25.600> these<00:02:25.750> screwed<00:02:26.020> together

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
you've got over these screwed together

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.430 
you've got over these screwed together
you're<00:02:27.610> then<00:02:27.940> in<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.180> position<00:02:28.209> to<00:02:28.750> put<00:02:29.260> your

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
you're then in a position to put your

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.010 
you're then in a position to put your
gear<00:02:29.890> onto<00:02:30.250> it<00:02:30.550> so<00:02:30.730> I've<00:02:31.270> got<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:31.660> chat<00:02:31.870> to

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
gear onto it so I've got that chat to

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.660 
gear onto it so I've got that chat to
control<00:02:32.320> this<00:02:32.440> for<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:32.890> let's<00:02:33.070> get<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.340> on<00:02:33.490> to

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
control this for so let's get that on to

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.060 
control this for so let's get that on to
it<00:02:36.270> actually<00:02:37.270> for<00:02:37.540> this<00:02:37.660> controller<00:02:38.110> you'll

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
it actually for this controller you'll

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.650 
it actually for this controller you'll
see<00:02:39.310> open<00:02:39.550> up<00:02:39.640> just<00:02:39.820> about<00:02:40.030> right<00:02:40.300> because

this<00:03:11.260> is<00:03:11.320> going<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.620> become<00:03:11.709> the<00:03:11.980> stand<00:03:12.220> that

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
this is going to become the stand that

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.370 
this is going to become the stand that
we<00:03:12.459> use<00:03:12.640> now<00:03:12.880> for<00:03:13.090> all<00:03:13.239> our<00:03:13.330> demos<00:03:13.630> basically

the<00:03:21.280> disadvantages<00:03:22.030> as<00:03:22.269> I<00:03:22.390> mentioned<00:03:22.810> it's

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
the disadvantages as I mentioned it's

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.600 
the disadvantages as I mentioned it's
heavy<00:03:23.200> takes<00:03:23.709> a<00:03:23.799> little<00:03:23.950> bit<00:03:24.130> of<00:03:24.250> setting<00:03:24.430> up

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
heavy takes a little bit of setting up

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.370 
heavy takes a little bit of setting up
there's<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:24.940> little<00:03:25.360> bit<00:03:25.480> of<00:03:25.570> side<00:03:25.900> but<00:03:26.260> it's

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
there's a little bit of side but it's

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.170 
there's a little bit of side but it's
wobbling<00:03:26.739> now<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.040> reason<00:03:27.489> for<00:03:27.519> that<00:03:27.700> is<00:03:28.030> that

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
wobbling now the reason for that is that

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.330 
wobbling now the reason for that is that
the<00:03:28.330> feet<00:03:28.660> at<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.930> back<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.680> weights<00:03:29.920> kind<00:03:30.250> of

forward now I'm not helping that fine
I've<00:03:32.920> got<00:03:33.430> this<00:03:33.580> set<00:03:33.820> up<00:03:34.060> see<00:03:34.570> these<00:03:34.750> two<00:03:34.900> holes

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
I've got this set up see these two holes

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.690 
I've got this set up see these two holes
a<00:03:35.290> little<00:03:35.500> bit<00:03:35.590> lower<00:03:35.709> down<00:03:35.980> you<00:03:36.400> can<00:03:36.580> have

a little bit lower down you can have

a little bit lower down you can have
this<00:03:36.850> set<00:03:37.090> up

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
this set up

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.860 
this set up
everything<00:03:37.909> is<00:03:38.000> lower<00:03:38.150> but<00:03:38.360> I<00:03:38.480> want<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:38.780> to

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
everything is lower but I want it to

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.449 
everything is lower but I want it to
have<00:03:38.989> a<00:03:39.019> really<00:03:39.290> decent<00:03:39.500> amount<00:03:39.980> clearance

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
have a really decent amount clearance

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.100 
have a really decent amount clearance
between<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.849> front<00:03:41.150> and<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.360> controller<00:03:41.750> and

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
between the front and the controller and

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.550 
between the front and the controller and
the<00:03:42.500> controls<00:03:42.950> on<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.360> other<00:03:44.360> equipment<00:03:45.049> the

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
the controls on the other equipment the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.320 
the controls on the other equipment the
easy<00:03:45.860> way<00:03:46.129> around<00:03:46.159> that<00:03:46.640> is<00:03:46.819> to<00:03:46.849> drill<00:03:47.209> a<00:03:47.239> hole

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
easy way around that is to drill a hole

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.410 
easy way around that is to drill a hole
at<00:03:48.230> the<00:03:48.260> back<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:48.860> screw<00:03:49.220> flat<00:03:49.549> it'd<00:03:50.120> make<00:03:50.360> a

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
at the back and screw flat it'd make a

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.009 
at the back and screw flat it'd make a
great<00:03:50.720> installation<00:03:51.379> stand<00:03:52.159> because<00:03:52.849> it<00:03:53.209> is<00:03:53.750> a

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
great installation stand because it is a

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.619 
great installation stand because it is a
little<00:03:54.500> bit<00:03:54.620> bulkier<00:03:55.099> the<00:03:55.819> spy<00:03:56.090> was<00:03:56.269> actually

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
little bit bulkier the spy was actually

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.149 
little bit bulkier the spy was actually
using<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:57.049> gear<00:03:57.260> this<00:03:57.440> one<00:03:57.620> it's<00:03:57.829> concern

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
using the gear this one it's concern

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.979 
using the gear this one it's concern
it's<00:03:58.430> really<00:03:58.970> safe<00:03:59.239> and<00:03:59.269> I<00:03:59.480> know<00:03:59.540> I<00:03:59.659> said<00:03:59.870> it

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
it's really safe and I know I said it

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.399 
it's really safe and I know I said it
wobbled<00:04:00.260> a<00:04:00.290> bit<00:04:00.500> but<00:04:00.909> you<00:04:01.909> know<00:04:02.030> this<00:04:02.299> Vic<00:04:02.569> is

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:03.409 
wobbled a bit but you know this Vic is

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.250 
wobbled a bit but you know this Vic is
very<00:04:03.829> salable<00:04:04.430> it's<00:04:04.790> not<00:04:05.120> don't<00:04:05.450> giving<00:04:05.810> it<00:04:05.959> so

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
very salable it's not don't giving it so

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.289 
very salable it's not don't giving it so
you<00:04:06.620> certainly<00:04:06.860> feel<00:04:07.159> very<00:04:07.519> very<00:04:07.760> confident

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
you certainly feel very very confident

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.180 
you certainly feel very very confident
using<00:04:08.870> it<00:04:08.959> there's<00:04:09.530> no<00:04:09.650> problem<00:04:10.010> with<00:04:10.040> the

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
using it there's no problem with the

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.979 
using it there's no problem with the
performance<00:04:10.670> side<00:04:10.819> of<00:04:10.940> it<00:04:11.060> it's<00:04:11.420> just<00:04:11.720> that<00:04:11.870> if

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
performance side of it it's just that if

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.360 
performance side of it it's just that if
you<00:04:12.170> were<00:04:12.290> using<00:04:12.319> it<00:04:12.650> in<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.859> same<00:04:13.069> place

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
you were using it in the same place

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.819 
you were using it in the same place
forever<00:04:14.180> it<00:04:14.840> would<00:04:15.019> certainly<00:04:15.349> be<00:04:15.560> worth

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
forever it would certainly be worth

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.199 
forever it would certainly be worth
fixing<00:04:16.130> it<00:04:16.370> down<00:04:16.579> because<00:04:16.910> there's<00:04:17.060> going<00:04:17.150> to

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
fixing it down because there's going to

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.689 
fixing it down because there's going to
be<00:04:17.269> a<00:04:17.329> lot<00:04:17.449> of<00:04:17.510> heavy<00:04:17.660> stuff<00:04:17.959> up<00:04:18.139> here<00:04:18.699> the

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
be a lot of heavy stuff up here the

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:21.159 
be a lot of heavy stuff up here the
actual<00:04:20.090> appearance<00:04:20.299> of<00:04:20.600> it<00:04:20.750> as<00:04:20.870> you<00:04:20.989> can<00:04:21.109> see

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
actual appearance of it as you can see

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.950 
actual appearance of it as you can see

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
nice magma logo on it it looks really

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.480 
nice magma logo on it it looks really
professional<00:04:26.979> underneath<00:04:27.979> here<00:04:28.250> there's
