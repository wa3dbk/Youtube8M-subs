move this a little bit like that should
be<00:02:08.599> plenty<00:02:08.989> alpha<00:02:09.590> testing<00:02:09.950> typically<00:02:10.369> oh

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
be plenty alpha testing typically oh

shifters you all right now it's unscrew

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.690 
shifters you all right now it's unscrew
its<00:02:20.480> reverse-thread<00:02:20.840> there<00:02:21.349> it<00:02:21.410> goes<00:02:21.700> so

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
its reverse-thread there it goes so

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.670 
its reverse-thread there it goes so
that's<00:02:22.910> in<00:02:25.569> I'll<00:02:26.569> get<00:02:26.750> this<00:02:26.930> guy<00:02:27.140> started

probably<00:02:41.549> a<00:02:41.579> little<00:02:41.700> more<00:02:41.939> even<00:02:42.299> I<00:02:42.709> would<00:02:43.709> get

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
probably a little more even I would get

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.220 
probably a little more even I would get
I'd<00:02:44.430> go<00:02:44.610> even<00:02:44.730> as<00:02:44.939> leaving<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.659> go<00:02:45.900> one<00:02:46.049> more

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
I'd go even as leaving it I go one more

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.920 
I'd go even as leaving it I go one more
I<00:02:46.500> can<00:02:47.040> move<00:02:47.159> that<00:02:47.310> one<00:02:47.549> more<00:02:47.730> cog<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.659> then<00:02:48.840> it

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
I can move that one more cog and then it

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.569 
I can move that one more cog and then it
gives<00:02:49.079> you<00:02:49.170> lots<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.680> time<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.069> play<00:02:50.250> away<00:02:50.430> they
