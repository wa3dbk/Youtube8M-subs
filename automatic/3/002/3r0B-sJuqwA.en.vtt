00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.479 

approximately<00:00:36.350> 50<00:00:36.739> minutes<00:00:37.070> after<00:00:37.340> launch

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
approximately 50 minutes after launch

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.340 
approximately 50 minutes after launch
the<00:00:37.879> spacecraft<00:00:38.180> separates<00:00:38.930> from<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.110> upper

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
the spacecraft separates from the upper

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.950 
the spacecraft separates from the upper
stage<00:00:39.649> of<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:39.920> launch<00:00:40.129> vehicle<00:00:40.750> six<00:00:41.750> minutes

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
stage of the launch vehicle six minutes

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.799 
stage of the launch vehicle six minutes
after<00:00:42.320> that<00:00:42.519> the<00:00:43.519> spacecraft<00:00:43.970> transmitter

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
after that the spacecraft transmitter

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.900 
after that the spacecraft transmitter
sends<00:00:45.140> a<00:00:45.170> signal<00:00:45.350> back<00:00:46.010> to<00:00:46.040> earth<00:00:46.309> which<00:00:46.879> is

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
sends a signal back to earth which is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.840 
sends a signal back to earth which is
received<00:00:47.360> by<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.510> tracking<00:00:47.930> stations<00:00:48.850> once

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.970 
received by the tracking stations once
we<00:00:50.570> receive<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:50.870> signal<00:00:51.379> we're<00:00:51.589> ready<00:00:51.829> to

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
we receive the signal we're ready to

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.439 
we receive the signal we're ready to
send<00:00:52.159> our<00:00:52.280> first<00:00:52.699> command<00:00:53.030> up<00:00:53.239> to<00:00:53.390> the

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
send our first command up to the

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.810 
send our first command up to the
spacecraft<00:00:53.989> and<00:00:54.140> that<00:00:54.739> actually<00:00:55.129> marks<00:00:55.489> the

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
spacecraft and that actually marks the

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.200 
spacecraft and that actually marks the
beginning<00:00:55.940> of<00:00:56.210> their<00:00:56.360> Crusades<00:01:01.120> there<00:01:02.120> are

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
beginning of their Crusades there are

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.670 
beginning of their Crusades there are
some<00:01:02.360> incredible<00:01:02.479> challenges<00:01:03.199> on<00:01:03.409> the<00:01:03.530> way<00:01:03.620> to

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
some incredible challenges on the way to

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.649 
some incredible challenges on the way to
Mars<00:01:03.920> one<00:01:04.729> of<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:04.940> things<00:01:05.089> is<00:01:05.300> there<00:01:05.509> always

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
Mars one of the things is there always

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.240 
Mars one of the things is there always
anomalies<00:01:06.380> they're<00:01:06.590> always<00:01:06.710> things<00:01:07.009> that<00:01:07.100> are

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
anomalies they're always things that are

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.200 
anomalies they're always things that are
going<00:01:07.369> to<00:01:07.429> go<00:01:07.520> wrong<00:01:07.670> that<00:01:07.970> you<00:01:08.060> never

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
going to go wrong that you never

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.210 
going to go wrong that you never
expected<00:01:08.300> you<00:01:08.960> have<00:01:09.110> a<00:01:09.140> baby<00:01:09.619> spacecraft<00:01:10.190> that

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
expected you have a baby spacecraft that

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.859 
expected you have a baby spacecraft that
is<00:01:10.399> not<00:01:10.520> on<00:01:10.640> its<00:01:10.789> way<00:01:10.880> to<00:01:10.940> Mars<00:01:11.149> and<00:01:11.450> it's

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
is not on its way to Mars and it's

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.060 
is not on its way to Mars and it's
seeing<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.229> space<00:01:12.380> environment<00:01:12.619> for<00:01:12.979> the

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
seeing the space environment for the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.200 
seeing the space environment for the
first<00:01:13.280> time<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:13.789> it's<00:01:13.910> going<00:01:14.000> to<00:01:14.060> see

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
first time so it's going to see

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.300 
first time so it's going to see
temperature<00:01:14.630> ranges<00:01:14.990> from<00:01:15.170> minus<00:01:15.770> 250

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
temperature ranges from minus 250

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.370 
temperature ranges from minus 250
degrees<00:01:16.759> Fahrenheit<00:01:16.970> to<00:01:17.390> plus<00:01:17.570> 250<00:01:18.020> degrees

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
degrees Fahrenheit to plus 250 degrees

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.590 
degrees Fahrenheit to plus 250 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:18.560> you've<00:01:19.490> got<00:01:19.700> instruments<00:01:20.509> all

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
Fahrenheit you've got instruments all

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.760 
Fahrenheit you've got instruments all
over<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.899> spacecraft<00:01:21.440> you've<00:01:21.619> got

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
over the spacecraft you've got

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.320 
over the spacecraft you've got
propellant<00:01:22.460> lines<00:01:22.490> that<00:01:22.880> you<00:01:22.910> can't<00:01:23.149> let

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
propellant lines that you can't let

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.240 
propellant lines that you can't let
freeze<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:24.080> so<00:01:24.619> there's<00:01:24.800> always<00:01:25.100> this

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
freeze and so there's always this

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.889 
freeze and so there's always this
challenge<00:01:25.910> of<00:01:26.179> keeping<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:26.600> entire

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
challenge of keeping the entire

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.960 
challenge of keeping the entire
spacecraft<00:01:27.200> tuned<00:01:27.649> thermally<00:01:28.340> some<00:01:28.789> of<00:01:28.909> the

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
spacecraft tuned thermally some of the

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:29.560 
spacecraft tuned thermally some of the
things<00:01:29.149> that<00:01:29.179> were<00:01:29.300> going<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.450> be<00:01:29.509> doing

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
things that were going to be doing

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.300 
things that were going to be doing
during<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.170> cruise<00:01:30.409> phase<00:01:30.649> are<00:01:30.979> some

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
during the cruise phase are some

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.160 
during the cruise phase are some
trajectory<00:01:31.880> correction<00:01:32.030> maneuvers<00:01:32.750> which

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
trajectory correction maneuvers which

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.020 
trajectory correction maneuvers which
are<00:01:33.319> basically<00:01:33.490> pushing<00:01:34.490> us<00:01:34.610> along<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.909> path

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
are basically pushing us along the path

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.510 
are basically pushing us along the path
of<00:01:35.539> where<00:01:36.259> we<00:01:36.409> want<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:36.679> end<00:01:36.800> up<00:01:36.950> when<00:01:37.399> we

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
of where we want to end up when we

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.700 
of where we want to end up when we
arrive<00:01:37.789> in<00:01:37.819> Mars<00:01:38.179> the<00:01:38.630> launch<00:01:38.840> vehicles<00:01:39.229> puts

arrive in Mars the launch vehicles puts

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.440 
arrive in Mars the launch vehicles puts
us<00:01:39.860> at<00:01:39.979> a<00:01:40.009> specific<00:01:40.399> path<00:01:40.939> on<00:01:41.180> a<00:01:41.210> trajectory

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
us at a specific path on a trajectory

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.200 
us at a specific path on a trajectory
and<00:01:42.189> along<00:01:43.189> the<00:01:43.340> way<00:01:43.369> from<00:01:43.640> here<00:01:43.759> to<00:01:43.850> Mars<00:01:44.060> over

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
and along the way from here to Mars over

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.520 
and along the way from here to Mars over
the<00:01:44.329> nine<00:01:44.509> months<00:01:44.840> that<00:01:44.990> were<00:01:45.079> to<00:01:45.170> be<00:01:45.290> flying

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
the nine months that were to be flying

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.410 
the nine months that were to be flying
there<00:01:45.829> we<00:01:46.250> need<00:01:46.369> to<00:01:46.460> make<00:01:46.549> small<00:01:46.909> corrections

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
there we need to make small corrections

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.890 
there we need to make small corrections
to<00:01:47.509> that

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.870 

if<00:01:51.470> you<00:01:51.710> were<00:01:51.950> trying<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.460> shoot<00:01:52.670> a<00:01:52.760> bow<00:01:52.850> and

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
if you were trying to shoot a bow and

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.690 
if you were trying to shoot a bow and
arrow<00:01:53.090> at<00:01:53.510> it<00:01:53.720> edibles<00:01:54.200> I<00:01:54.350> at<00:01:54.650> a<00:01:54.680> target<00:01:54.950> and

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
arrow at it edibles I at a target and

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.700 
arrow at it edibles I at a target and
you<00:01:56.000> had<00:01:56.240> taken<00:01:56.450> you<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.050> drum<00:01:57.290> back<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.590> bow

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
you had taken you a drum back the bow

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.920 
you had taken you a drum back the bow
and<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:58.220> would<00:01:58.370> shut<00:01:58.550> off<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.850> arrow<00:01:59.030> and<00:01:59.600> you

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
and you would shut off the arrow and you

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.210 
and you would shut off the arrow and you
realized<00:02:00.230> all<00:02:00.380> of<00:02:00.470> a<00:02:00.530> sudden<00:02:00.770> that<00:02:00.860> it<00:02:00.950> wasn't

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
realized all of a sudden that it wasn't

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.560 
realized all of a sudden that it wasn't
actually<00:02:01.280> going<00:02:01.460> to<00:02:01.610> hit<00:02:01.730> the<00:02:01.820> target<00:02:02.000> how

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
actually going to hit the target how

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.180 
actually going to hit the target how
great<00:02:02.810> would<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:03.020> be<00:02:03.110> if<00:02:03.230> you<00:02:03.470> could<00:02:03.560> pause<00:02:03.980> in

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
great would it be if you could pause in

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.040 
great would it be if you could pause in
the<00:02:04.220> middle<00:02:04.310> make<00:02:05.150> a<00:02:05.210> slight<00:02:05.450> adjustment<00:02:05.960> to

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
the middle make a slight adjustment to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.400 
the middle make a slight adjustment to
the<00:02:06.110> arrow<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.710> watch<00:02:07.220> it<00:02:07.400> hit<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.700> target<00:02:08.410> we

the arrow and watch it hit the target we

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.680 
the arrow and watch it hit the target we
have<00:02:09.710> given<00:02:10.100> ourselves<00:02:10.310> six<00:02:10.880> opportunities

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
have given ourselves six opportunities

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.620 
have given ourselves six opportunities
to<00:02:12.410> make<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.830> trajectory<00:02:13.160> correction<00:02:13.820> maneuver

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
to make a trajectory correction maneuver

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.350 
to make a trajectory correction maneuver
and<00:02:14.810> each<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:15.770> those<00:02:15.950> correction<00:02:16.880> maneuvers

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
and each of those correction maneuvers

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.440 
and each of those correction maneuvers
is<00:02:18.100> uses<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.310> thrusters<00:02:19.880> on<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.210> spacecraft

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
is uses the thrusters on the spacecraft

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.650 
is uses the thrusters on the spacecraft
to<00:02:21.260> give<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:22.010> little<00:02:22.310> push<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:23.000> spacecraft

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
to give a little push to the spacecraft

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.540 
to give a little push to the spacecraft
to<00:02:23.810> correct<00:02:24.170> its<00:02:24.380> trajectory<00:02:24.590> one<00:02:25.340> of<00:02:25.459> the

to correct its trajectory one of the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.010 
to correct its trajectory one of the
things<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:25.760> makes<00:02:26.090> landing<00:02:26.630> on<00:02:26.750> another

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
things that makes landing on another

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.360 
things that makes landing on another
planet<00:02:27.230> so<00:02:27.500> difficult<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:28.100> that<00:02:28.130> we're

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
planet so difficult is that we're

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.470 
planet so difficult is that we're
essentially<00:02:28.580> trying<00:02:28.820> to<00:02:28.940> hit<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.150> moving

planet<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.480> we<00:02:35.630> can't<00:02:35.810> just<00:02:35.959> aim<00:02:36.110> for<00:02:36.140> where

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
but we have to aim for where we think

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.110 
but we have to aim for where we think
the<00:02:39.530> plan<00:02:39.740> is<00:02:39.800> going<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.130> be<00:02:40.340> by<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.760> time<00:02:40.850> that
