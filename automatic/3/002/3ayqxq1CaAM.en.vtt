00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
it or arm vibrato and I prefer the arm

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.600 
it or arm vibrato and I prefer the arm
vibrato<00:00:48.870> because<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.649> stays<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> same

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610

on<00:01:08.100> there<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.789> this<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.270> controversial

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
on there and this is a controversial

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.339 
on there and this is a controversial
issue<00:01:10.550> because<00:01:11.550> I<00:01:11.700> say<00:01:11.910> that<00:01:12.119> if<00:01:12.959> you<00:01:13.110> don't

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:13.349 
issue because I say that if you don't

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:15.499 
issue because I say that if you don't
vibrate<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.819> play<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.090> tune<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.479> you

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
vibrate and you play in tune that you

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.960 
vibrate and you play in tune that you
are<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.050> center<00:01:16.610> from<00:01:17.610> there<00:01:17.819> you

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
are in that center from there you

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.300 
are in that center from there you
release<00:01:18.300> the<00:01:18.539> tension<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.560> go<00:01:19.770> back<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.160> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
release the tension and go back to the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.089 
release the tension and go back to the
dead<00:01:20.459> center<00:01:20.849> nicely<00:01:22.220> but<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.660> press

00:01:25.089 --> 00:01:25.099 
dead center nicely but you you you press

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:27.440 
dead center nicely but you you you press
the<00:01:26.099> no<00:01:26.220> don't<00:01:26.490> get<00:01:26.610> up<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.759> grotto<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.300> then

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
the no don't get up in grotto and then

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.219 
the no don't get up in grotto and then
you<00:01:27.539> release<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.080> go<00:01:28.619> back<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.390> see<00:01:30.390> yeah<00:01:30.810> so

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
you release and go back I see yeah so

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.859 
you release and go back I see yeah so
it's<00:01:31.349> a<00:01:31.709> release<00:01:32.250> function<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.060> according<00:01:33.750> to

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
it's a release function and according to

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.440 
it's a release function and according to
Paul<00:01:34.080> Roland<00:01:34.560> who<00:01:34.709> supposedly<00:01:35.450> measured

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
Paul Roland who supposedly measured

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.300 
Paul Roland who supposedly measured
might<00:01:36.690> be<00:01:36.899> breath<00:01:37.110> or<00:01:37.319> something<00:01:37.709> said<00:01:38.160> that

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
might be breath or something said that

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.570 
might be breath or something said that
I'm<00:01:38.459> going<00:01:38.640> above<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:40.020> I'm<00:01:40.229> going<00:01:40.500> above<00:01:40.860> then

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
I'm going above if I'm going above then

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.609 
I'm going above if I'm going above then
how<00:01:41.789> far<00:01:41.819> above<00:01:42.360> am<00:01:42.569> I<00:01:42.720> going<00:01:42.929> because<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.500> is

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
how far above am I going because it is

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.219 
how far above am I going because it is
too<00:01:43.800> wide<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.220> becomes<00:01:44.550> almost<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.479> half<00:01:45.599> step

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
too wide and becomes almost a half step

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.290 
too wide and becomes almost a half step
oh<00:01:46.470> no<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.800> think<00:01:46.979> there's<00:01:47.310> been<00:01:47.520> tests<00:01:48.000> now

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
oh no I think there's been tests now

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.779 
oh no I think there's been tests now
that<00:01:48.690> you<00:01:48.959> the<00:01:49.470> pitch<00:01:49.739> Center<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.280> perceived

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
that you the pitch Center is perceived

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.270 
that you the pitch Center is perceived
at<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.209> top<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.899> oscillation<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.160> it

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
at the top of the oscillation so it

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.680 
at the top of the oscillation so it
proves<00:01:53.550> my<00:01:53.759> point<00:01:53.789> at<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.479> heart<00:01:55.110> there<00:01:55.649> was<00:01:55.739> a

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
proves my point at the heart there was a

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.900 
proves my point at the heart there was a
few<00:01:57.690> months<00:01:58.280> correspondence<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.429> argument

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
few months correspondence of argument

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.580 
few months correspondence of argument
with<00:02:00.090> Paul<00:02:00.330> roll<00:02:00.539> under<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.989> plan<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.410> they

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
with Paul roll under to plan that they

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.430 
with Paul roll under to plan that they
said<00:02:02.160> that<00:02:02.310> he<00:02:02.429> chose<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.910> the<00:02:03.869> measurement

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
said that he chose the the measurement

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.499 
said that he chose the the measurement
that<00:02:04.619> I'm<00:02:05.129> going<00:02:05.429> above<00:02:05.789> the<00:02:05.849> root<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.300> I

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
that I'm going above the root and I

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.419 
that I'm going above the root and I
don't<00:02:06.810> think<00:02:06.989> so<00:02:07.140> because<00:02:07.259> I'm<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.250> middle

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
don't think so because I'm in the middle

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.919 
don't think so because I'm in the middle
of<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.670> low<00:02:08.789> tenth<00:02:09.030> released<00:02:09.390> from<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.629> and

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
of the low tenth released from that and

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.530 
of the low tenth released from that and
go<00:02:10.050> back<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:11.160> tension<00:02:11.550> release<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.270> it

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
go back and that tension release is it

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.430 
go back and that tension release is it
won't<00:02:12.810> be<00:02:12.989> broto

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
won't be broto

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.940 
won't be broto
actually<00:02:13.980> that's<00:02:14.099> new<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.459> me<00:02:14.489> I<00:02:15.830> asked<00:02:16.830> them

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
actually that's new to me I asked them

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.650 
actually that's new to me I asked them
of<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.850> do<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.510> vom<00:02:18.690> Deborah<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.230> action

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
of to do the vom Deborah to action

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.860 
of to do the vom Deborah to action
and<00:02:19.930> also<00:02:20.710> dear<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.730> flexing<00:02:22.240> action<00:02:22.660> this

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
and also dear the flexing action this

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.600 
and also dear the flexing action this
one<00:02:23.080> because<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.620> tension<00:02:24.340> release

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
one because this is tension release

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.580 
one because this is tension release
tension<00:02:25.060> release<00:02:25.300> centuries<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.050> it's<00:02:26.380> one

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
tension release centuries and it's one

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.280 
tension release centuries and it's one
big<00:02:26.740> broto

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
big broto

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.160 
big broto
sure<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.800> that's<00:02:30.310> their<00:02:30.580> home<00:02:31.210> it's<00:02:31.840> what<00:02:32.020> I'm

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
sure and that's their home it's what I'm

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.080 
sure and that's their home it's what I'm
real<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.710> I<00:02:32.740> never<00:02:33.100> had<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.460> described<00:02:33.850> that

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
real that I never had it described that

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.300 
real that I never had it described that
way<00:02:34.300> in<00:02:34.600> its<00:02:34.780> that's<00:02:35.110> when<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:35.800> are<00:02:35.830> playing<00:02:36.130> a

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
way in its that's when you are playing a

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.000 
way in its that's when you are playing a
fast<00:02:36.520> passage<00:02:37.030> like<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:38.080> didn't<00:02:38.230> consider<00:02:38.620> that

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
fast passage like I didn't consider that

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.890 
fast passage like I didn't consider that
it<00:02:39.280> is<00:02:39.310> that<00:02:39.640> are<00:02:39.820> they<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.000> coder<00:02:40.450> or<00:02:40.480> something

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
it is that are they a coder or something

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.990 
it is that are they a coder or something
then<00:02:41.470> if<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:41.800> don't<00:02:41.980> use<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.580> tension

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
then if you don't use the tension

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.790 
then if you don't use the tension
release<00:02:43.240> function<00:02:43.540> then<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.320> sounds<00:02:44.590> dead

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
release function then it sounds dead

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.790 
release function then it sounds dead
right<00:02:45.660> but<00:02:46.660> you're<00:02:46.810> not<00:02:46.870> really<00:02:47.110> vibrating

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
right but you're not really vibrating

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.590 
right but you're not really vibrating
those<00:02:47.980> notes<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:48.460> you're<00:02:48.580> just<00:02:48.700> attacking<00:02:49.330> a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
those notes so you're just attacking a

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.510 
those notes so you're just attacking a
deletion<00:02:49.900> you're<00:02:50.230> technically<00:02:50.560> listen<00:02:50.980> yeah

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
deletion you're technically listen yeah

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.840 
deletion you're technically listen yeah
so<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.000> feel<00:02:52.360> that<00:02:52.560> same<00:02:53.560> attack<00:02:54.490> release

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
so you feel that same attack release

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.510 
so you feel that same attack release
when<00:02:55.210> you<00:02:55.390> strike<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.810> finger<00:02:56.230> yeah<00:02:56.590> optically

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
when you strike a finger yeah optically

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.670 
when you strike a finger yeah optically
that<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.450> explanation<00:02:58.750> there<00:02:59.290> is<00:02:59.440> that

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
that so the explanation there is that

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.890 
that so the explanation there is that
are<00:03:00.660> when<00:03:01.660> you<00:03:01.750> press<00:03:01.960> down<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.320> strength

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
are when you press down the strength

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.440 
are when you press down the strength
sufficient<00:03:04.900> is<00:03:05.380> all<00:03:05.560> it<00:03:05.950> makes<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.340> sum<00:03:06.580> you

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
sufficient is all it makes a sum you

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.840 
sufficient is all it makes a sum you
have<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.720> release<00:03:07.990> it<00:03:08.020> because<00:03:09.010> it's<00:03:09.220> the

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
have to release it because it's the

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.790 
have to release it because it's the
string<00:03:10.120> is<00:03:10.270> flexible<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.380> have<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.590> fill

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
string is flexible and you have to fill

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.680 
string is flexible and you have to fill
in<00:03:11.830> that<00:03:12.100> finger<00:03:12.520> to<00:03:12.820> flexibility<00:03:13.420> of<00:03:13.600> the

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
in that finger to flexibility of the

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.840 
in that finger to flexibility of the
string<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.740> also<00:03:15.040> if<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.190> hit<00:03:15.400> an<00:03:15.520> you<00:03:15.610> hold

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
string and also if you hit an you hold

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.690 
string and also if you hit an you hold
then<00:03:16.720> you're<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.920> then<00:03:18.250> you're<00:03:18.430> a<00:03:18.460> dead<00:03:18.670> duck

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
then you're and then you're a dead duck

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.170 
then you're and then you're a dead duck
dead<00:03:19.330> duck<00:03:19.570> F<00:03:19.780> but<00:03:20.400> unfortunately<00:03:21.400> that's<00:03:21.880> one

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
dead duck F but unfortunately that's one

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.060 
dead duck F but unfortunately that's one
of<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.390> most<00:03:22.720> frequent<00:03:23.260> problems<00:03:23.320> with<00:03:23.950> the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
of the most frequent problems with the

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.470 
of the most frequent problems with the
players<00:03:24.310> who<00:03:25.000> keep

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
players who keep

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.600 
players who keep
cramping<00:03:26.050> and<00:03:26.260> then<00:03:26.860> they<00:03:26.980> surprise<00:03:27.400> that

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
cramping and then they surprise that

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.360 
cramping and then they surprise that
that<00:03:27.640> it<00:03:28.030> doesn't<00:03:28.420> sound<00:03:28.570> brilliant<00:03:29.500> right<00:03:30.040> it

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
that it doesn't sound brilliant right it

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.850 
that it doesn't sound brilliant right it
may<00:03:30.940> sound<00:03:31.150> in<00:03:31.360> tune<00:03:31.570> or<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:32.170> merely<00:03:32.410> the
