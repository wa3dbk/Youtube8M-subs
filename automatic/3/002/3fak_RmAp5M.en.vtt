out so this time I will try and do

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.810 
out so this time I will try and do
without<00:01:24.120> it<00:01:24.270> running<00:01:25.190> all<00:01:26.190> right<00:01:26.250> looks<00:01:26.729> like

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
without it running all right looks like

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.250 
without it running all right looks like
we're<00:01:27.120> going<00:01:27.270> get<00:01:27.479> ready<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.810> change<00:01:27.840> this

chromium from the ball bearings but I

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.080 
chromium from the ball bearings but I
don't<00:01:58.710> think<00:01:58.950> that's<00:01:59.159> enough<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.760> I<00:01:59.790> need<00:01:59.880> to

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.719 
worry about mmm now you could always
recycle<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> good<00:02:04.979> salad<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.580> some

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
recycle that on a good salad with some

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.580 
recycle that on a good salad with some
nice<00:02:05.880> vinegar<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:07.080> give<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.680> try

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.130
