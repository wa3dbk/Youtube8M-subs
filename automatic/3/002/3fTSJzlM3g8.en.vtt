00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.349 
shawl we are aiming for a total of nine
stitches<00:00:18.240> three<00:00:19.170> for<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.160> bottom<00:00:20.550> three<00:00:21.330> for

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
stitches three for the bottom three for

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.269 
stitches three for the bottom three for
the<00:00:21.600> top<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.109> three<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.590> side<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
the top and three on the side the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.429 
the top and three on the side the
instructions<00:00:23.820> will<00:00:24.060> usually<00:00:24.630> tell<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.050> how

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
instructions will usually tell you how

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.230 
instructions will usually tell you how
many<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.769> cast<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.519> it's<00:00:26.640> usually<00:00:26.820> two<00:00:27.210> or

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
many to cast on and it's usually two or

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.740 
many to cast on and it's usually two or
three<00:00:27.439> so<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.740> cast<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.220> three<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.000> then

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
three so I have cast on three and then

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.630 
three so I have cast on three and then
the<00:00:31.199> instructions<00:00:31.769> will<00:00:31.980> usually<00:00:32.160> tell<00:00:32.579> you

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
the instructions will usually tell you

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.290 
the instructions will usually tell you
in<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.329> case<00:00:33.630> since<00:00:34.050> we<00:00:34.320> want<00:00:35.300> three

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
in this case since we want three

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.690 
in this case since we want three
stitches<00:00:36.600> picked<00:00:36.960> up<00:00:37.200> along<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.649> edge<00:00:37.890> that

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
stitches picked up along this edge that

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.880 
stitches picked up along this edge that
we<00:00:38.879> should<00:00:39.120> knit<00:00:39.390> three<00:00:40.230> ridges<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.649> would

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
we should knit three ridges that would

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.240 
we should knit three ridges that would
be<00:00:41.010> six<00:00:41.250> rows<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:42.020> think<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.140> get<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.500> couple<00:00:44.100> extra

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
be six rows I think I get a couple extra

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.279 
be six rows I think I get a couple extra
rows<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.120> there<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.270> usually<00:00:45.570> do<00:00:45.930> because<00:00:46.110> I

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
rows in there I usually do because I

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.920 
rows in there I usually do because I
don't<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.250> pick<00:00:47.430> up<00:00:47.640> too<00:00:48.149> close<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.780> this

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
don't like to pick up too close to this

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.040 
don't like to pick up too close to this
right<00:00:49.590> here<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.059> next<00:00:51.270> step<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.840> turn

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
right here so the next step is to turn

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.000 
right here so the next step is to turn
the<00:00:52.260> work<00:00:52.440> 90<00:00:53.280> degrees<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.010> then

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the work 90 degrees like this and then

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.599 
the work 90 degrees like this and then
pick<00:00:56.730> up<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.210> stitches<00:00:57.530> along<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:59.280> edge

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
pick up the stitches along this edge

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.950 
pick up the stitches along this edge
right<00:01:00.390> here

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
right here

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.410 
right here
so<00:01:01.140> I'm<00:01:01.260> going<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> pick<00:01:01.530> up<00:01:01.680> three<00:01:02.420> because

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
so I'm going to pick up three because

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.820 
so I'm going to pick up three because
that's<00:01:03.719> what<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> instructions<00:01:04.710> my<00:01:06.830> actually

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
that's what the instructions my actually

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.190 
that's what the instructions my actually
my<00:01:08.119> imaginary<00:01:09.119> instructions<00:01:09.689> are<00:01:09.840> telling<00:01:10.170> me

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
my imaginary instructions are telling me

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.320 
my imaginary instructions are telling me
I'm<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.159> hypothetical<00:01:11.400> case<00:01:11.970> and

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
I'm this is just a hypothetical case and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
I'm this is just a hypothetical case and
then<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.560> need<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.860> pick<00:01:14.010> up<00:01:14.159> three<00:01:14.430> stitches<00:01:14.760> on

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
then I need to pick up three stitches on

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.310 
then I need to pick up three stitches on
the<00:01:16.350> cast<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.860> now<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.970> lot<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.320> instructions

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the cast on now a lot of instructions

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.260 
the cast on now a lot of instructions
will<00:01:19.710> tell<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.100> cast<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.549> provisionally

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
will tell you to cast on provisionally

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.390 
will tell you to cast on provisionally
here<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.780> don't<00:01:22.080> do<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.439> usually<00:01:22.770> because

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
here I don't do that usually because

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.070 
here I don't do that usually because
I've<00:01:23.580> done<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.880> both<00:01:24.000> ways<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.689> don't<00:01:24.869> like

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
I've done it both ways and I don't like

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.289 
I've done it both ways and I don't like
to<00:01:25.200> fiddle<00:01:25.380> I'm<00:01:26.189> really<00:01:26.490> not<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.909> fond<00:01:27.180> of

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
to fiddle I'm really not that fond of

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.179 
to fiddle I'm really not that fond of
provisional<00:01:27.810> cast<00:01:28.049> on<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.409> be<00:01:28.530> quite<00:01:28.740> honest<00:01:29.070> I

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
provisional cast on to be quite honest I

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.649 
provisional cast on to be quite honest I
mean<00:01:29.310> sometimes<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.509> you

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
mean sometimes you have to do it but you

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.950 
mean sometimes you have to do it but you
don't<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.380> why<00:01:31.619> do<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.759> now<00:01:33.540> I

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
don't have to do it why do it so now I

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.810 
don't have to do it why do it so now I
already<00:01:34.290> have<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> live<00:01:34.710> stitches<00:01:35.009> here<00:01:35.610> and

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
already have the live stitches here and

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.330 
already have the live stitches here and
I<00:01:36.659> am<00:01:36.900> going<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.320> knit<00:01:37.439> these<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.220> I'm

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
I am going to knit these this one I'm

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.830 
I am going to knit these this one I'm
going<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.610> knit<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:38.970> back<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.420> stitch

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
going to knit in the back of that stitch

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.270 
going to knit in the back of that stitch
because<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.290> think<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.530> put<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.799> on<00:01:40.890> there<00:01:41.040> wrong

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
because I think I put it on there wrong

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.789 
because I think I put it on there wrong
so<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.329> did<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.750> one<00:01:42.899> too<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.409> that's<00:01:43.649> your

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
so I did that one too but that's your

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.280 
so I did that one too but that's your
prerogative<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.520> then<00:01:45.210> I've<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:45.930> now

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
prerogative and then I've just now

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.490 
prerogative and then I've just now
knitted<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.740> stitches<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.780> side<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.229> now

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
knitted the stitches on the side and now

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.880 
knitted the stitches on the side and now
these<00:01:49.770> are<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.100> cast<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.909> stitches<00:01:51.680> that<00:01:52.680> I'm

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
these are the cast on stitches that I'm

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.270 
these are the cast on stitches that I'm
knitting

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
knitting

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.310 
knitting
so<00:01:53.549> there's<00:01:54.210> actually<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.200> little

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
so there's actually that little

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.459
