a leap forward but I'm not sure it's as

so<00:05:00.479> that<00:05:00.690> was<00:05:00.840> a<00:05:00.960> pretty<00:05:01.560> positive<00:05:01.919> report

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550

this new version of the artsy but I was
a<00:05:12.720> big<00:05:13.080> fan<00:05:13.350> of<00:05:13.380> the<00:05:13.590> old<00:05:13.620> one<00:05:13.979> this<00:05:14.280> one<00:05:14.490> can

a big fan of the old one this one can
only<00:05:14.759> be<00:05:14.970> better<00:05:15.180> let's<00:05:15.690> go<00:05:15.840> through<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.110> good

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
only be better let's go through the good

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:18.650 
only be better let's go through the good
points<00:05:16.560> first<00:05:16.740> what<00:05:16.889> really<00:05:17.039> stands<00:05:17.880> out<00:05:18.090> look

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
I mean it's the same engine as in the

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.740 
I mean it's the same engine as in the
new<00:05:20.070> GS<00:05:20.400> so<00:05:20.669> it's<00:05:20.789> a<00:05:20.820> liquid-cooled<00:05:21.120> motor<00:05:21.479> it

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
new GS so it's a liquid-cooled motor it

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.170 
new GS so it's a liquid-cooled motor it
is<00:05:21.930> very<00:05:22.500> smooth<00:05:22.949> it's<00:05:23.220> got<00:05:23.400> lots<00:05:23.699> of<00:05:23.880> punch

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.100 
fantastic I believe is it in this quick
quick<00:05:35.820> shift<00:05:36.030> attack<00:05:36.330> yeah<00:05:36.600> they<00:05:36.750> call<00:05:36.930> it

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
quick shift attack yeah they call it

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.469 
quick shift attack yeah they call it
gearshift<00:05:37.919> assist<00:05:38.430> Pro<00:05:38.789> or<00:05:38.970> something<00:05:39.360> which

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
gearshift assist Pro or something which

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.210 
gearshift assist Pro or something which
actually<00:05:39.750> it<00:05:40.169> works<00:05:40.440> very<00:05:40.680> well<00:05:40.830> it's<00:05:41.039> not

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
actually it works very well it's not

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.740 
actually it works very well it's not
good<00:05:41.490> from<00:05:41.639> first<00:05:41.910> to<00:05:42.000> second<00:05:42.389> it's<00:05:42.539> a<00:05:42.600> bit

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
good from first to second it's a bit

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.170 
good from first to second it's a bit
jerky<00:05:43.139> but<00:05:43.500> from<00:05:44.100> then<00:05:44.280> up<00:05:44.430> it's<00:05:44.699> just<00:05:44.850> as

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
jerky but from then up it's just as

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.760 
jerky but from then up it's just as
smooth<00:05:45.449> as<00:05:45.600> butter<00:05:45.630> going<00:05:46.020> through<00:05:46.260> and<00:05:46.500> even

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
smooth as butter going through and even

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.560 
smooth as butter going through and even
down<00:05:46.979> shifting<00:05:47.430> as<00:05:47.580> well<00:05:47.760> or<00:05:48.270> though<00:05:48.419> you<00:05:48.479> have

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
down shifting as well or though you have

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.330 
down shifting as well or though you have
to<00:05:48.660> give<00:05:48.780> it<00:05:48.870> quite<00:05:49.050> a<00:05:49.080> stomp<00:05:49.500> to<00:05:49.710> sort<00:05:49.889> of<00:05:49.919> kick

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
to give it quite a stomp to sort of kick

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.129 
to give it quite a stomp to sort of kick
it<00:05:50.460> through<00:05:50.490> the<00:05:50.820> gear<00:05:51.000> but<00:05:51.419> it<00:05:51.510> does<00:05:51.660> work<00:05:51.870> and

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
it through the gear but it does work and

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.110 
it through the gear but it does work and
it<00:05:52.229> does<00:05:52.410> make<00:05:52.620> if<00:05:53.340> you've<00:05:53.490> got<00:05:53.580> a<00:05:53.610> pillion<00:05:54.000> on

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
it does make if you've got a pillion on

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.839 
it does make if you've got a pillion on
makes<00:05:54.690> it<00:05:54.840> very<00:05:55.110> smooth<00:05:55.470> ride<00:05:55.710> for<00:05:55.740> them<00:05:56.070> ok<00:05:56.789> so

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
makes it very smooth ride for them ok so

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:59.029 
makes it very smooth ride for them ok so
that's<00:05:57.090> all<00:05:57.240> good<00:05:57.509> but<00:05:57.570> why<00:05:57.960> do<00:05:58.020> I<00:05:58.410> get<00:05:58.620> the

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
that's all good but why do I get the

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:01.370 
that's all good but why do I get the
sense<00:05:59.280> that<00:05:59.539> you<00:06:00.539> know<00:06:00.660> it's<00:06:00.780> not<00:06:00.900> quite<00:06:01.110> what

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
sense that you know it's not quite what

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.770 
sense that you know it's not quite what
you<00:06:01.440> thought<00:06:01.650> it<00:06:01.800> would<00:06:01.889> be<00:06:02.150> if<00:06:03.150> I'm<00:06:03.419> brutally

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
you thought it would be if I'm brutally

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.070 
you thought it would be if I'm brutally
honest<00:06:04.740> I<00:06:05.010> find<00:06:05.639> that<00:06:06.330> there's<00:06:06.599> a<00:06:06.660> bit<00:06:06.870> too

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
honest I find that there's a bit too

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.010 
honest I find that there's a bit too
much<00:06:07.229> plastic<00:06:07.680> on<00:06:08.550> the<00:06:08.910> bike<00:06:09.090> it's<00:06:09.510> and<00:06:09.930> it

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
much plastic on the bike it's and it

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.110 
much plastic on the bike it's and it
doesn't<00:06:10.410> feel<00:06:10.680> like<00:06:10.740> the<00:06:11.010> thickest<00:06:11.490> heaviest

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
doesn't feel like the thickest heaviest

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.330 
doesn't feel like the thickest heaviest
best<00:06:12.510> quality<00:06:12.960> plastic<00:06:13.409> it<00:06:13.889> probably<00:06:14.220> will

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
best quality plastic it probably will

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.089 
best quality plastic it probably will
survive<00:06:14.699> is<00:06:14.940> to<00:06:14.970> B&amp;W<00:06:15.330> after<00:06:15.630> all<00:06:15.750> but<00:06:15.990> it<00:06:16.590> just

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 
survive is to B&amp;W after all but it just

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.420 
survive is to B&amp;W after all but it just
lacks<00:06:18.030> that<00:06:18.440> essence<00:06:19.440> of<00:06:19.590> quality<00:06:20.220> which

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
lacks that essence of quality which

is<00:06:42.930> a<00:06:42.960> spectacularly<00:06:43.949> good<00:06:44.220> bike

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:45.760

equipment<00:06:46.760> levels<00:06:47.030> are<00:06:47.180> very<00:06:47.389> similar<00:06:47.660> to<00:06:47.810> the

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
equipment levels are very similar to the

beer there's nothing really to choose
from<00:06:49.639> him<00:06:49.760> so<00:06:49.940> I<00:06:49.970> think<00:06:50.210> you<00:06:50.300> would<00:06:50.450> be<00:06:50.570> going

from him so I think you would be going

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.080 
from him so I think you would be going
on<00:06:50.870> brand<00:06:51.169> loyalty<00:06:51.560> and<00:06:52.010> whether<00:06:52.700> you<00:06:52.820> prefer

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090
