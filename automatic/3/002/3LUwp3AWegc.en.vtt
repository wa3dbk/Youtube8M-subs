00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:08.650
 [Music] 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.650
 [Applause] 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.950
 [Music] 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.240
 and hello to all how are you 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.529
 give me that go today we get 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.490
 found for a new video for 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.320
 to show you a little bit how we are doing 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.939
 a little improved his laptop 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.340
 so why did I put laptop in the 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:31.490
 title then simply a question 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.689
 of 6.1 on youtube or no I try to 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.470
 do things on youtube that there is 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.670
 not in the background it's tips that 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.420
 you can do too I see pc 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.760
 fixed but here it is simply 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.449
 simple enough ac tips that modifies 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.090
 not over the system that a laptop 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.640
 could not necessarily support 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.780
 so we're going to do the trick already 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.859
 take three hours to open you go 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.780
 take a swim on your desk 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.690
 graphic property it's surely a 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.519
 other way to do it but there I see 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.380
 not so tell you to do it like that 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.110
 so that's at least that but three hours 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.220
 every time open to the passage I 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.920
 can you thank you because we are 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.050
 soon to 900 subscribers need to know 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.970
 that at the thousand subscribers I will make a 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.920
 small a little video maybe a 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:24.979
 contest I do not know we'll see 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:28.340
 good then my advanced have done ok that's it 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.380
 so then here you go m actually 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.709
 everything depends how do you want to do it if you 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.750
 just want to really have 

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:38.390
 that it's not just about the performance I 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.729
 really tell you how to maximize 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.720
 his pc so there in the pallets you 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.569
 go put 16 bits 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.209
 if you can do a frequency of 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:50.349
 update by no to 30 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:50.349
 hertz you can do it too 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:02:00.100
 So here you go in 3d 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:05.030
 you'll slide it all to the left or 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:10.789
 here you can put performance and if 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:13.880
 you put nothing to leave yourself like that 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.440
 and like that or so otherwise under the steps 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.790
 to piss or do you like that 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.590
 apply then I think it's up to 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.190
 pretty much every level of digitization 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.020
 you put maximum performance and 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.270
 in support options normally 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.880
 that's it for the controls of the 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.990
 keyboard we do not need it 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.340
 then you will do for example 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:41.350
 [Music] 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:45.340
 windows excuse me windows r cmd or 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.750
 then you will type system of me I 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.840
 will do right click execute as 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.110
 that admin I do not know if it's something 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.140
 better thing then had to make say 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.380
 slash s entries and where are you going 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.850
 clean your hard drive make sure 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.560
 that the files do not do by 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.830
 example of detours before being opened 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.830
 etc. 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:12.170
 so that's total list files and 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.540
 see 13000 so still that's when 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.330
 even a lot of stuff 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:23.120
 then a last little tip or 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:26.390
 does windows rms config and you can 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.680
 here say what you want at startup 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.080
 slow me for example I removed said 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.489
 jean because it's boring and that's it 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.970
 so the jelly sus you go because 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.830
 that right now I'm downloading gta and I 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.310
 do not think I would have finished 20 of all 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.170
 I restart 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.690
 see if you put restart what 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.660
 you are finally doing so 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.160
 you do nothing and leave without 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.769
 restart if I did not want to start again 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.060
 immediately just 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.560
 so that's it for this little girl 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.870
 video it will last about four 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.129
 minutes with my intro do we like too much 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.849
 I say thank you for watching the 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:00.970
 video and ciao everybody was going a 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.319

 So I'll go to court tomorrow it 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.660
 gets drunk a little bit supportive 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.130
 [Music]

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:19.410
