00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
American car you have these problems

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.610 
American car you have these problems
fixed<00:00:38.489> up<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.879> dude<00:00:39.090> had<00:00:39.900> all<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> interior

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.650 
fixed up the dude had all the interior
taken<00:00:41.040> out<00:00:41.190> rust<00:00:41.460> proofed<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.000> check<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
taken out rust proofed and check the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.340 
taken out rust proofed and check the
small<00:00:42.900> plates<00:00:43.230> put<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.910> actual<00:00:45.269> motor<00:00:45.989> is

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
small plates put in the actual motor is

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.049 
small plates put in the actual motor is
a<00:00:46.979> 390<00:00:51.559> and<00:00:52.559> that's<00:00:52.830> the<00:00:52.920> concourse<00:00:53.489> condition

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
a 390 and that's the concourse condition

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.240 
a 390 and that's the concourse condition
so<00:00:54.330> that's<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.780> colors<00:00:55.140> exactly<00:00:55.890> how<00:00:56.070> it's

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
so that's the colors exactly how it's

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.240 
so that's the colors exactly how it's
set<00:00:56.460> up<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.610> be<00:00:57.680> except<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.830> battery

in<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.390> States<00:01:09.690> I've<00:01:10.500> added<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.040> bullet

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
in the States I've added the bullet

actually<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> kelsey<00:01:15.930> hayes<00:01:16.110> replica<00:01:17.060> but

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
actually a kelsey hayes replica but

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.490 
actually a kelsey hayes replica but
they're<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> lot<00:01:18.330> safer<00:01:18.600> than<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.079> original

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
they're a lot safer than the original

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.459 
they're a lot safer than the original
ones<00:01:19.680> which<00:01:19.920> had<00:01:20.100> less<00:01:20.310> spokes<00:01:21.170> they<00:01:22.170> want<00:01:22.380> to

ones which had less spokes they want to

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.800

had from Ford in those days the only
thing<00:02:07.770> here<00:02:08.100> is<00:02:08.250> it's<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.520> cloth<00:02:08.759> finish<00:02:09.300> where

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
thing here is it's a cloth finish where

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.350 
thing here is it's a cloth finish where
it<00:02:09.630> should<00:02:09.810> be<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.960> viable<00:02:10.259> finish<00:02:11.030> roof<00:02:12.030> and

hydraulics and all that sort of thing so

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.190 
hydraulics and all that sort of thing so
it's<00:02:28.000> fairly<00:02:29.000> unique<00:02:29.390> for<00:02:29.600> its<00:02:29.630> time<00:02:29.960> and
