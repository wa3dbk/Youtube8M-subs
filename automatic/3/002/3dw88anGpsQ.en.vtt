our brief one on meiosis owned by
request<00:00:08.290> there's<00:00:09.290> not<00:00:09.440> really<00:00:09.710> too<00:00:09.860> much<00:00:10.190> -

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
request there's not really too much -

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.560 
request there's not really too much -
you<00:00:10.610> don't<00:00:10.730> need<00:00:10.940> to<00:00:11.000> know<00:00:11.210> a<00:00:11.240> lot<00:00:11.389> it's

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
you don't need to know a lot it's

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.830 
you don't need to know a lot it's
usually<00:00:11.809> asked<00:00:12.260> about<00:00:12.469> in<00:00:12.709> comparison<00:00:13.580> to

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
usually asked about in comparison to

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.720 
usually asked about in comparison to
mitosis<00:00:14.840> so<00:00:15.139> perhaps<00:00:15.770> the<00:00:16.010> best<00:00:16.250> way<00:00:16.400> to<00:00:16.430> do

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
mitosis so perhaps the best way to do

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.090 
mitosis so perhaps the best way to do
this<00:00:16.940> is<00:00:17.150> just<00:00:17.390> as<00:00:17.690> a<00:00:17.720> table<00:00:18.260> first<00:00:18.470> of<00:00:18.710> all<00:00:18.830> and

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
this is just as a table first of all and

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.310 
this is just as a table first of all and
then<00:00:19.580> take<00:00:20.210> out<00:00:20.390> any<00:00:20.570> of<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:20.810> little<00:00:21.080> bits

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
then take out any of the little bits

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.640 
then take out any of the little bits
that<00:00:21.980> need<00:00:22.880> to<00:00:22.970> do<00:00:23.539> notice<00:00:23.779> the<00:00:24.080> spelling<00:00:24.349> by

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
that need to do notice the spelling by

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.470 
that need to do notice the spelling by
the<00:00:24.710> way<00:00:24.949> it<00:00:25.490> is<00:00:25.669> one<00:00:25.849> of<00:00:25.939> the<00:00:26.029> times<00:00:26.300> that

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
the way it is one of the times that

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.540 
the way it is one of the times that
spelling<00:00:26.960> is<00:00:27.109> really<00:00:27.499> important<00:00:28.009> because<00:00:28.160> the

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
spelling is really important because the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.640 
spelling is really important because the
two<00:00:28.789> things<00:00:29.150> you<00:00:29.869> know<00:00:29.960> you<00:00:30.079> could<00:00:30.289> sort<00:00:30.589> of

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
two things you know you could sort of

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.230 
two things you know you could sort of
slip<00:00:30.919> an<00:00:31.039> extra<00:00:31.369> T<00:00:31.579> in<00:00:31.640> there<00:00:31.910> and<00:00:32.060> make<00:00:32.210> it

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.240 
slip an extra T in there and make it

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.240 
slip an extra T in there and make it
look<00:00:32.599> a<00:00:32.780> bit<00:00:32.990> like<00:00:33.140> mitosis<00:00:33.500> you'd<00:00:34.160> be

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
look a bit like mitosis you'd be

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.630 
look a bit like mitosis you'd be
confused<00:00:34.790> -<00:00:35.920> examiners<00:00:36.920> are<00:00:36.980> aware<00:00:37.280> of<00:00:37.340> this

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
confused - examiners are aware of this

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.430 
confused - examiners are aware of this
so<00:00:37.940> they<00:00:38.059> will<00:00:38.239> really<00:00:38.510> look<00:00:38.809> for<00:00:39.020> this<00:00:39.140> word

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
so they will really look for this word

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.790 
so they will really look for this word
if<00:00:39.949> you<00:00:40.129> talk<00:00:40.309> about<00:00:40.430> mitosis<00:00:41.350> matrix<00:00:42.350> potahto

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
if you talk about mitosis matrix potahto

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.650 
if you talk about mitosis matrix potahto
by<00:00:43.100> meiosis<00:00:43.280> make<00:00:43.910> sure<00:00:44.030> you<00:00:44.120> spell<00:00:44.390> it<00:00:44.420> that

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
by meiosis make sure you spell it that

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.069 
by meiosis make sure you spell it that
the<00:00:45.350> crap<00:00:45.710> with<00:00:45.859> it<00:00:46.160> is<00:00:46.309> quite<00:00:46.550> point<00:00:46.789> so<00:00:47.780> if

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
the crap with it is quite point so if

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.479 
the crap with it is quite point so if
we're<00:00:48.199> going<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:48.379> compare<00:00:48.829> two<00:00:49.039> things<00:00:49.309> if

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
we're going to compare two things if

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.580 
we're going to compare two things if
you're<00:00:49.609> asked<00:00:49.820> a<00:00:49.879> question<00:00:49.910> on<00:00:50.329> this<00:00:50.590> make

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
you're asked a question on this make

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.529 
you're asked a question on this make
sure<00:00:51.620> you<00:00:51.920> put<00:00:52.190> both<00:00:52.430> sides<00:00:52.850> of<00:00:53.030> it<00:00:53.120> so<00:00:53.180> for

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
sure you put both sides of it so for

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:59.799 
sure you put both sides of it so for
example<00:00:54.460> in<00:00:55.460> mitosis<00:00:55.760> you<00:00:56.600> make<00:00:56.899> two<00:00:57.460> cells<00:00:58.809> t2

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
example in mitosis you make two cells t2

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.669 
example in mitosis you make two cells t2
okay<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:00.859> meiosis<00:01:01.579> you<00:01:01.609> make<00:01:02.050> four<00:01:03.050> cells<00:01:03.440> so

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:03.679 
okay and meiosis you make four cells so

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.140 
okay and meiosis you make four cells so
there's<00:01:03.859> a<00:01:03.920> difference<00:01:04.460> that's<00:01:04.670> one

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
there's a difference that's one

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.180 
there's a difference that's one
difference<00:01:05.449> mitosis<00:01:06.320> is<00:01:06.410> to<00:01:06.560> mitosis<00:01:06.800> what

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
difference mitosis is to mitosis what

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.290 
difference mitosis is to mitosis what
you'd<00:01:07.340> have<00:01:07.490> to<00:01:07.550> include<00:01:07.940> both<00:01:08.180> things

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
you'd have to include both things

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.770 
you'd have to include both things
mitosis<00:01:11.300> the<00:01:11.480> cells<00:01:11.810> are<00:01:12.110> identical<00:01:13.480> or<00:01:14.480> as<00:01:14.630> in

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
mitosis the cells are identical or as in

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.560 
mitosis the cells are identical or as in
meiosis<00:01:15.290> then<00:01:16.010> non<00:01:16.370> identical<00:01:16.550> we'll<00:01:17.240> see<00:01:17.420> why

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
meiosis then non identical we'll see why

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.150 
meiosis then non identical we'll see why
that<00:01:17.600> matters<00:01:17.870> in<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.230> second<00:01:18.940> in<00:01:20.230> mitosis<00:01:21.230> you

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
that matters in a second in mitosis you

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.690 
that matters in a second in mitosis you
have<00:01:23.650> the<00:01:24.650> full<00:01:25.100> set<00:01:25.790> of<00:01:25.970> chromosomes<00:01:27.700> I'll

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
have the full set of chromosomes I'll

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.020 
have the full set of chromosomes I'll
explain<00:01:29.120> that<00:01:29.360> in<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.540> second<00:01:29.960> in<00:01:30.490> meiosis<00:01:31.490> you

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
explain that in a second in meiosis you

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.380 
explain that in a second in meiosis you
only<00:01:32.540> have<00:01:32.870> half<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.590> number<00:01:33.620> of<00:01:33.860> chromosomes

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
only have half the number of chromosomes

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.050 
only have half the number of chromosomes
so<00:01:35.390> in<00:01:35.660> a<00:01:35.690> human<00:01:38.680> in<00:01:39.680> a<00:01:39.830> human<00:01:40.250> they<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.760> full

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
so in a human in a human they the full

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.500 
so in a human in a human they the full
set<00:01:41.330> of<00:01:41.360> chromosomes<00:01:42.010> 46<00:01:43.180> that's<00:01:44.180> sometimes

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
set of chromosomes 46 that's sometimes

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.060 
set of chromosomes 46 that's sometimes
called<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.080> diploid<00:01:45.560> number<00:01:45.800> if<00:01:46.010> you're

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
called the diploid number if you're

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.610 
called the diploid number if you're
going<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.280> be<00:01:46.340> very<00:01:46.520> posh<00:01:46.810> and<00:01:47.810> it's<00:01:47.960> getting<00:01:48.590> a

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
going to be very posh and it's getting a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.890 
going to be very posh and it's getting a
bit<00:01:48.650> too<00:01:48.920> a<00:01:48.950> little<00:01:49.340> spotted<00:01:49.580> it's<00:01:50.420> given<00:01:50.780> them

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
bit too a little spotted it's given them

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.170 
bit too a little spotted it's given them
the<00:01:51.380> simple<00:01:51.770> 2n<00:01:53.530> if<00:01:54.610> you've<00:01:55.610> only<00:01:55.700> got<00:01:55.850> half

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
the simple 2n if you've only got half

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.630 
the simple 2n if you've only got half
the<00:01:56.390> number<00:01:56.630> 23<00:01:57.080> that's<00:01:58.040> called<00:01:58.430> being

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
the number 23 that's called being

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.280 
the number 23 that's called being
haploid<00:01:59.570> and<00:01:59.900> that's<00:02:00.440> just<00:02:00.590> given<00:02:00.860> n<00:02:01.160> okay<00:02:02.290> why

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
haploid and that's just given n okay why

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.610 
haploid and that's just given n okay why
is<00:02:03.350> that

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
is that

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.280 
is that
n<00:02:03.770> 2n<00:02:04.310> rather<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:04.880> in<00:02:05.390> half<00:02:05.600> another<00:02:05.870> I<00:02:05.960> just

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
n 2n rather and in half another I just

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.440 
n 2n rather and in half another I just
is<00:02:06.440> all<00:02:06.650> right<00:02:06.740> don't<00:02:06.890> worry<00:02:07.070> over<00:02:08.440> so<00:02:09.440> diploid

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
is all right don't worry over so diploid

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.770 
is all right don't worry over so diploid
for<00:02:11.450> humans<00:02:11.780> is<00:02:11.870> 46<00:02:12.379> haploid<00:02:12.769> 23<00:02:13.370> so<00:02:13.909> most<00:02:14.629> of

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
for humans is 46 haploid 23 so most of

what's mitosis used for growth and

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.600 
what's mitosis used for growth and
preparing<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.600> organism<00:03:05.310> if<00:03:06.310> you're<00:03:06.520> going

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
preparing the organism if you're going

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.510 
preparing the organism if you're going
to<00:03:06.700> grow<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:06.970> make<00:03:07.330> more<00:03:07.570> cells<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:08.310> if<00:03:09.310> you

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
to grow you make more cells and if you

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.070 
to grow you make more cells and if you
need<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.790> repair<00:03:10.060> your<00:03:10.239> body<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:10.810> need<00:03:10.989> to

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
need to repair your body you need to

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.540 
need to repair your body you need to
make<00:03:11.230> more<00:03:11.380> social<00:03:11.800> too<00:03:11.920> much<00:03:12.100> that's<00:03:12.280> what<00:03:12.400> it

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
make more social too much that's what it

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.370 
make more social too much that's what it
does<00:03:12.760> okay<00:03:12.910> so<00:03:13.120> that's<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.540> two<00:03:13.720> differences

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
does okay so that's the two differences

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.620 
does okay so that's the two differences
the<00:03:14.860> key<00:03:15.190> really<00:03:15.489> I<00:03:15.640> suppose<00:03:15.790> is<00:03:16.150> this<00:03:16.360> bit

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
the key really I suppose is this bit

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.850 
the key really I suppose is this bit
meiosis<00:03:17.320> is<00:03:17.440> all<00:03:17.560> about<00:03:17.739> making<00:03:17.980> gametes<00:03:18.489> so

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
meiosis is all about making gametes so

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.410 
meiosis is all about making gametes so
one<00:03:20.860> cell<00:03:22.500> on<00:03:23.500> original<00:03:24.310> cell<00:03:24.640> would<00:03:25.060> undergo

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
one cell on original cell would undergo

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.420 
one cell on original cell would undergo
meiosis<00:03:25.780> like<00:03:26.320> your<00:03:26.470> sperm<00:03:26.830> cells<00:03:27.190> because

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
meiosis like your sperm cells because

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.400 
meiosis like your sperm cells because
they're<00:03:27.580> easy<00:03:27.760> so<00:03:28.030> they<00:03:28.360> kind<00:03:28.570> of<00:03:28.660> visualize

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
they're easy so they kind of visualize

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.729 
they're easy so they kind of visualize
okay<00:03:30.250> we<00:03:30.790> make<00:03:30.970> four<00:03:31.390> cells<00:03:31.720> they're<00:03:32.500> all

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
okay we make four cells they're all

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.640 
okay we make four cells they're all
different<00:03:33.660> they've<00:03:34.660> got<00:03:34.870> half<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.380> number<00:03:35.620> of

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
different they've got half the number of

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.530 
different they've got half the number of
chromosomes<00:03:36.100> in<00:03:36.519> why<00:03:36.820> they<00:03:37.060> got<00:03:37.209> half<00:03:37.420> a

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
chromosomes in why they got half a

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.410

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
number because this sperm cell may

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.840 
number because this sperm cell may
eventually<00:03:40.750> not<00:03:41.380> on<00:03:41.530> this<00:03:41.680> this<00:03:41.769> girl<00:03:42.010> meets
