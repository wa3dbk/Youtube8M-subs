00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
questions and finding different ways of

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.120 
questions and finding different ways of
expressing<00:00:32.180> answers<00:00:32.660> to<00:00:32.840> those<00:00:32.960> questions<00:00:33.130> so

I like to start with music because I

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.500 
I like to start with music because I
think<00:00:37.220> that<00:00:37.460> it<00:00:37.640> kicks<00:00:37.850> off<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:38.270> mood

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
think that it kicks off the mood

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.319 
think that it kicks off the mood
especially<00:00:39.230> for<00:00:39.410> young<00:00:39.590> women<00:00:39.920> it<00:00:40.700> kind<00:00:41.180> of

probably<00:00:52.910> one<00:00:53.600> of<00:00:53.630> the<00:00:54.020> best<00:00:54.410> tactics<00:00:55.310> for

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
probably one of the best tactics for

why do you think that how does this make

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:12.819 
why do you think that how does this make
you<00:01:10.310> feel<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:11.090> so<00:01:11.299> you<00:01:11.359> have<00:01:11.630> all<00:01:12.079> of<00:01:12.200> these

00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:24.319 
one of the things that I think is really

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:26.199 
one of the things that I think is really
important<00:01:25.009> is<00:01:25.069> to<00:01:25.130> have<00:01:25.280> all<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:25.909> supplies
