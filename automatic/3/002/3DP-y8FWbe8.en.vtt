we're<00:00:13.050> back<00:00:13.290> for<00:00:13.350> another<00:00:13.559> seed<00:00:14.130> showcase

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:14.520 
we're back for another seed showcase

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.960 
we're back for another seed showcase
this<00:00:15.330> seed<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:16.590> pretty<00:00:17.010> awesome<00:00:17.220> i<00:00:17.520> called<00:00:17.820> the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
this seed is pretty awesome i called the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.230 
this seed is pretty awesome i called the
extreme<00:00:18.570> seed<00:00:18.869> pretty<00:00:19.200> much<00:00:19.380> because<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.640> map

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
extreme seed pretty much because the map

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.420 
extreme seed pretty much because the map
is<00:00:21.480> just<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:22.050> can<00:00:22.260> really<00:00:22.470> consists<00:00:22.950> of<00:00:23.070> three

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
is just it can really consists of three

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.190 
is just it can really consists of three
biomes<00:00:23.790> and<00:00:23.939> they're<00:00:24.090> just<00:00:24.330> massive<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.020> have

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
biomes and they're just massive you have

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.189 
biomes and they're just massive you have
the<00:00:25.380> giant<00:00:26.310> really<00:00:26.940> dense<00:00:27.240> force<00:00:27.660> up<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.110> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
the giant really dense force up in the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.320 
the giant really dense force up in the
top<00:00:28.500> right-hand<00:00:28.740> corner<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.850> have<00:00:29.940> a<00:00:30.029> fairly

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
top right-hand corner you have a fairly

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.330 
top right-hand corner you have a fairly
big<00:00:30.720> sand<00:00:31.140> by<00:00:31.380> them<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.800> then<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.070> have<00:00:32.220> this

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
big sand by them and then you have this

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.990 
big sand by them and then you have this
massive<00:00:32.730> plains<00:00:33.570> area<00:00:34.160> with<00:00:35.160> these<00:00:35.309> extreme

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
massive plains area with these extreme

right corner one of the largest swamp
ions<00:00:44.940> I've<00:00:45.120> ever<00:00:45.330> seen<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.780> takes<00:00:45.960> up<00:00:46.080> a<00:00:46.170> huge

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:46.409 
ions I've ever seen it takes up a huge

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:48.170 
ions I've ever seen it takes up a huge
chunk<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.949> that<00:00:47.100> top<00:00:47.400> left<00:00:47.640> corner<00:00:47.879> pretty

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
chunk of that top left corner pretty

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.240 
chunk of that top left corner pretty
much<00:00:48.360> all<00:00:48.570> those<00:00:49.080> little<00:00:49.290> small<00:00:49.650> islands<00:00:50.100> are

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
much all those little small islands are

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.460 
much all those little small islands are
those<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:51.000> then<00:00:51.150> also<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.750> also<00:00:51.930> really

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
great about this is that they're too

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.149 
great about this is that they're too

pumpkins<00:00:59.040> here<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.580> go<00:00:59.670> down<00:00:59.820> there<00:01:00.030> and

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
pumpkins here you can go down there and

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.410 
pumpkins here you can go down there and
find<00:01:00.239> them<00:01:00.600> or<00:01:01.500> also<00:01:02.220> if<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.610> go<00:01:02.790> into<00:01:03.269> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
spawner one is behind ones over here

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.690 
spawner one is behind ones over here
that<00:01:14.969> I<00:01:15.439> kind<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.829> like<00:01:17.039> break

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
that I kind of just can like break

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.029 
that I kind of just can like break
yourself<00:01:17.880> into<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.840> then<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.079> explore<00:01:19.740> down

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
yourself into and then I explore down

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.599 
yourself into and then I explore down
there<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.609> there's<00:01:21.180> also<00:01:21.479> another<00:01:21.869> one<00:01:22.609> right

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:23.609 
there and there's also another one right

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:28.219 
there and there's also another one right
back<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:23.969> and<00:01:24.920> this<00:01:25.920> one<00:01:26.189> also<00:01:26.369> goes<00:01:26.789> a<00:01:27.229> bunch

but if you want to make an awesome like

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.120 
but if you want to make an awesome like
village<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.749> the<00:01:45.840> flat<00:01:46.170> relatively<00:01:46.859> flat

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
village and the flat relatively flat

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.819 
village and the flat relatively flat
surface<00:01:47.670> area<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.630> pretty<00:01:48.990> cool<00:01:49.259> island

surface area on a pretty cool island

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.770 
surface area on a pretty cool island
that<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.219> can<00:01:50.460> do<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.880> at<00:01:50.999> spawn<00:01:51.299> there's<00:01:51.630> also

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
that you can do so at spawn there's also

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.260 
that you can do so at spawn there's also
some<00:01:52.079> other<00:01:52.280> stuff<00:01:53.280> around<00:01:53.729> here<00:01:54.090> so

some other stuff around here so

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.580 
some other stuff around here so
definitely<00:01:54.630> check<00:01:54.719> out<00:01:54.929> the<00:01:54.990> seed<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:55.499> you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
definitely check out the seed if you

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.989 
definitely check out the seed if you
have<00:01:55.710> some<00:01:55.890> free<00:01:56.069> time<00:01:56.159> or<00:01:56.609> if<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.789> want<00:01:56.939> to
