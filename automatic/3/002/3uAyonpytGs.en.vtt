00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 cedar came to the exhibition mvc 2015 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.799
 thanks to our friends intel companies 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.799
 asus and often away and comp 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.820
 alka sang in 2015 introduced two models 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.890
 models van touch ah yes 3 this is 5 5 inch 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.539
 and 4 7 inch here such smartphones on 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.820
 In fact, somewhere such a gradation I already 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.920
 saw and the main feature of these smartphones 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.070
 need some trick to lure people 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.050
 on the stand is the location of the speakers 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.239
 just all on the front panel 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.949
 it is symmetrical that is what you are so 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.170
 Look at the smartphone if you stick it 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.600
 the camera is black but with scotch so what 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.119
 it's very hard to make out which side you are 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.820
 They took and Althotel says that this is done 

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:57.150
 so that you can talk 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.860
 by phone and so and so that is all 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.799
 no matter which side you bring down 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.820
 why such a thing is necessary I will tell you 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:08.189
 honestly i don't know but she is and it's like 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.570
 would be an additional use 2 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.369
 dynamics because on the front 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.830
 side on the sides 5 5 inch display 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.320
 here are two stereo speakers as you are looking for 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.299
 sip and they were developed together with 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.479
 gilbal therefore they sound enough 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.870
 well also here speak about the interface 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.100
 which is flipped over and 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.900
 depending on how you hold 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.410
 phone we have already seen such a thing in 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.940
 iped yes and samsung recently already permit 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.920
 there was such a thing that is basically 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.870
 it is not for water what is named what is 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.940
 You can talk as you like well, 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.250
 probably someone will be comfortable I remember on 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.390
 nexus s i had such a problem due 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.190
 In order that it on the front side 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.170
 there was nothing at all and he was completely 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.280
 symmetric 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.110
 sometimes you take it and wrong 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.240
 wrong that is accounted for this 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.500
 also get used may find his 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.780
 consumer such functionality 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.910
 speaking about everything else is the flagship of 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.910
 manufacturer but since the manufacturer 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.880
 not spinning in the circle of the very top of 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.830
 the processor here is a bit weaker 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.020
 Well, rather not tell the right dishes 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.920
 just made a flagship in order to 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.470
 be more accessible here snapdragon 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.560
 615 2 gigabytes of RAM and 16 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.230
 or 32 built-in there is a slot like this 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.950
 Here is the shell of the pancake that is turned off 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.500
 unreal here android 50 but on top 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.110
 it has my proprietary interface installed 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.000
 all rolled but note that not at all 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.030
 strongly that you donâ€™t spoil android 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.700
 principle android 502 version is the freshest 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.180
 why I say do not spoil because yes 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.110
 enough already I understood I understood yes because 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.360
 besides this animation here it is 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.970
 done a little buggy and in 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.070
 any mode it works like that and i icons 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.020
 more here I did not find customization even 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.810
 top curtain it looks like this 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.489
 normal android is, in principle, but Plus 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.260
 talk about what will arrive here 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.870
 the freshest update i'm probably not 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.850
 I'll take the main camera on 13 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.700
 megapixels front by as much as 8 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.319
 megapixels that's cool there 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.000
 the diode alerts basically enough 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.760
 all well done more if 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.560
 earlier she drove off complained because 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.360
 the corps they were not the most quality then 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.879
 here the body is very much on sprue such 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.170
 despite being completely plastic 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.959
 back side even so stylized 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.060
 a little sweeping but he's practical 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.920
 prints leaving no remain 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.200
 the only thing I do not know about that 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.000
 this one of this edging brilliant 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.190
 may begin to climb well of course 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.319
 judge it we will not we younger 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.690
 the model here the counter was looking for 4 7 inch 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.220
 hd display a bit simpler processor 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.130
 but also the principle of characteristics as a whole 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.299
 exactly the same thing is symmetrical 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.400
 the smartphone here can be the height of it 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.660
 talk and so and so but in this 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.299
 case for what characteristics 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.220
 simpler I would probably choose 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.440
 the big model is such an alcatel one 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.170
 touch idol when the kinder came on 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.019
 NDC 2015 thanks to our 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.709
 friends of intel asus and often 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.220
 away 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.220
 icons
