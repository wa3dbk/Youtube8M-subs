Hi, everyone, I’m Artem Sofronov, the coach of St. Petersburg Parkour Academy. Our today’s tutorial is about “Cash”. Let me show it to you first.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.500
Cash consists of two other movements: Monkey and Dash.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.900
Tutorials for them are available at Parkour Academy’s website.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.620
When you learn how to do these two movements it will be much easier to perform Cash.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:47.440
This movement is one of the best options to overcome high and wide obstacles. I’ll tell you why a little bit later. And now we’ll study Cash in a more detailed way.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.480
After you run-up start doing Monkey.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:58.600
When the obstacle is too high it’s better to use a short split step to direct your momentum upwards.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:06.360
At the same time push off from the obstacle with your hands, which will also help you to get higher.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:14.740
When you start to get over the obstacle transfer your movement into Dash. This means you should lean backwards and tuck yourself transferring your legs forward.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.120
Then throw your legs forward sharply. The arms look downwards and bent a little.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.320
Use them to push off forward and overcome the obstacle.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.760
The movement ends with one of the landing techniques. When the obstacle is too high the safest way is to do landing or roll.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.000
So why is Dash so suitable for high and wide obstacles?

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.940
The Monkey movement is great for saving your run-up momentum and gathering enough height.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.540
But this momentum can still be not enough to overcome completely a high obstacle.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.880
Here the Dash technique helps us.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.840
Throwing our legs forward and pushing off from the obstacle we gather more forward momentum.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.840
This is how we overcome our obstacle completely.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.080
So this is the end of our lesson. Good luck, see you!
