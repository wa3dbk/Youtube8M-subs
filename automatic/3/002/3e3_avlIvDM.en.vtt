00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:17.400
 if we so this motor will all come 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:20.490
 repeat truth okay this is the motor 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.320
 the motor that is built into this heart 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.460
 generators we will demonstrate it 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.650
 more than different from this motor from 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.840
 conventional development even with huge 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.110
 loads i'm going to try it now 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.149
 hold here more than 8 amps it doesn't 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.570
 develops more than 10 amps 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.329
 although will be there at 4035 newton meter it 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.260
 crazy craving but i'm looking at you 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.590
 70 newton meter is our lada kalina 70 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.829
 years and here is this mat Arishka boy he 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.239
 developing this 35-40 is not a subject this 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.239
 very high torque 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.300
 now he shows 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.140
 but 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.040
 whole 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.040
 i am 10 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.260
 he jumps current is nothing terrible 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.840
 to people 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.119
 code on and here it is 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:34.780
 hold note 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:34.780
 device 30 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.730
 yes here and they showed you the same Caprino 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.090
 greasy experiences because he's quite a few 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:02.170
 power turnout what is even 10 multiply 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:08.679
 as many as 360 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:10.030
 and now I'll show you how this motor 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:29.800
 rotates a generator 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:31.450
 there, too, under heavy loads, all 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.010
 it starts to free you 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.010
 it is necessary and now we will demonstrate it 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.780
 look here this little motor which 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.780
 now only shows embedded 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.090
 here inside the outside of the foot policy 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.880
 not somewhere between 600-700 hertz 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.060
 frequency is quite a big leg 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.269
 pole generator constantly charging 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.900
 these powerful batteries from these powerful ones 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.450
 battery will turn on a sine called 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.049
 pure sine does it Novosibirsk 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:12.310
 some cities 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:15.250
 it converts these 24 volts 200 24 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.440
 kilowatt 6 kilowatt have appliances 8 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.370
 kilowatt and so on that is if you here 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:29.519
 in the country to put here such 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:29.519
 motor generator if then almost not 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.780
 charging 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.220
 and here, too, here is 9, 910 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.409
 will also decrease because here 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.470
 charge current and it turns out that for cricket 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:46.629
 Nobel lacks only 1 amp is 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.480
 ok to make feedback and 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.890
 one amp is enough but for that you need 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.409
 draw up solar panels 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.300
 only 60 centimeters per meter 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:58.510
 it will be necessary to supplement 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.730
 and its like a repch on a couch 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.630
 have your own power station which is not 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:08.600
 no answer there and zeno 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.120
 motor polls powered by their 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.880
 cards and a huge resource because 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.600
 what here can only have about errors 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:24.950
 and soon 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:27.920
 if 2 what do you think he's a two-piston 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.140
 so phase 2 they are this error we 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.210
 also erases it is sure to do not 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.330
 less than three gone i did two 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.490
 only 22 runners differ from these 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.030
 solenoids that's why he runs it 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:44.060
 today would a3 today show has gradually 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:52.450
 could this clue that 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:52.450
 self reliance look here i am 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.370
 engine 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.350
 from here 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.770
 I'm starting to slow down 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.650
 apartment 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.970
 usually all networks 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:50.310
 it simplifies and 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:50.310
 you can now finger. 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:08.860
 the torque you've experienced is 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.600
 expert opinion is very good 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.150
 Alexey but something can say this thing 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:19.610
 pull the generator is more powerful than required 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:23.390
 On, motor of course can this actually 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:25.520
 element element of the same 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:28.390
 What is all the speech of this part I do not think that 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.400
 each house had this element 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:33.980
 Vassil Vassilich confess well, because 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.530
 sperm say the tests showed 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.110
 separately here we measured newtons per meter 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:43.280
 Motors Moscow energy and 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:45.520
 Now they thought there is a mathematical 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:50.680
 the model that we worked well 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:53.510
 does this model prove that if 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.460
 competently on good details they are on 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.190
 waste items that we select and 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.900
 Slovaks make motor generator 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.870
 separately it will not be necessary 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:06.440
 compensate for this missing 11 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:08.930
 so far it is not that it is not beauty we can 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.200
 make or flowers on self reliance 

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:15.290
 motor generator that will give 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:18.200
 light or this energy of pictures of jesters 

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.630
 to victims of greenhouses to use that is 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.900
 practically I need 

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.940
 the wind is not solar energy is not gasoline and 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:28.530
 in order to spin on the engine 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.530
 internal combustion separate generator
