00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
healthy state I would not recommend

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.050 
healthy state I would not recommend
getting<00:04:12.430> color<00:04:12.880> or<00:04:13.570> a<00:04:13.630> lighter<00:04:14.049> color<00:04:14.200> until

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
you know your hair is in a pretty you

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.390 
you know your hair is in a pretty you
know<00:04:18.130> healthy<00:04:18.579> state<00:04:19.000> and<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:20.440> you<00:04:21.190> know<00:04:21.250> you

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
know healthy state and I you know you

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.279 
know healthy state and I you know you
need<00:04:21.579> to<00:04:21.669> have<00:04:21.820> a<00:04:21.850> consistent<00:04:22.270> regimen<00:04:22.990> before

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
need to have a consistent regimen before

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.860 
need to have a consistent regimen before
you<00:04:23.380> do<00:04:23.530> that<00:04:23.560> and

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
you do that and

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.620 
you do that and
I<00:04:24.960> think<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.770> key<00:04:26.070> things<00:04:26.430> to<00:04:27.120> take<00:04:27.270> care<00:04:27.330> of

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
I think the key things to take care of

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.629 
I think the key things to take care of
color<00:04:27.990> is<00:04:28.949> to<00:04:29.100> make<00:04:29.250> sure<00:04:29.280> that<00:04:29.550> you

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
color is to make sure that you

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.390 
color is to make sure that you
moisturize<00:04:30.180> your<00:04:30.210> hair<00:04:30.449> often<00:04:31.070> and<00:04:32.070> to<00:04:32.220> make

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
moisturize your hair often and to make

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.210 
moisturize your hair often and to make
sure<00:04:32.460> that<00:04:32.820> you<00:04:32.880> deep<00:04:33.090> condition<00:04:33.570> your<00:04:33.690> hair<00:04:33.720> I

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
sure that you deep condition your hair I

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.830 
sure that you deep condition your hair I
explain<00:04:35.220> my<00:04:35.340> regimen<00:04:35.729> in<00:04:35.820> another<00:04:36.150> video<00:04:36.389> and

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
explain my regimen in another video and

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.379 
explain my regimen in another video and
I<00:04:36.930> deep<00:04:37.139> condition<00:04:37.530> my<00:04:37.560> hair<00:04:37.680> often<00:04:38.360> to<00:04:39.360> help

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
I deep condition my hair often to help

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.260 
I deep condition my hair often to help
it<00:04:39.750> stay<00:04:39.960> shiny<00:04:40.320> and<00:04:40.860> to<00:04:41.400> prevent<00:04:41.729> breakage

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
it stay shiny and to prevent breakage

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.990 
it stay shiny and to prevent breakage
and<00:04:43.139> because<00:04:43.949> you<00:04:44.070> know<00:04:44.220> curly<00:04:44.639> hair<00:04:44.820> needs

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
and because you know curly hair needs

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.170 
and because you know curly hair needs
moisture<00:04:45.440> that's<00:04:46.440> just<00:04:46.770> whether<00:04:47.580> whether<00:04:48.060> you

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
moisture that's just whether whether you

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.020 
moisture that's just whether whether you
have<00:04:48.270> color<00:04:48.510> not<00:04:48.810> any<00:04:49.050> moisture<00:04:49.560> so<00:04:50.340> I<00:04:50.820> mean

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
have color not any moisture so I mean

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.840 
have color not any moisture so I mean
those<00:04:51.240> are<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:51.419> key<00:04:52.020> things<00:04:52.050> I<00:04:52.860> think<00:04:53.669> the

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
those are the key things I think the

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.150 
those are the key things I think the
basic<00:04:54.000> things<00:04:54.479> when<00:04:55.260> it<00:04:55.560> comes<00:04:55.680> to<00:04:55.949> taking

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
basic things when it comes to taking

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.340 
basic things when it comes to taking
care<00:04:56.460> of<00:04:56.520> color<00:04:56.820> is<00:04:57.120> deep<00:04:57.600> conditioning<00:04:58.139> and

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
care of color is deep conditioning and

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.290 
care of color is deep conditioning and
moisture<00:04:58.830> using<00:04:59.729> a<00:04:59.820> great<00:05:00.060> leave-in

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
moisture using a great leave-in

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.570 
moisture using a great leave-in
conditioner<00:05:00.990> it<00:05:01.770> somebody<00:05:02.039> asking<00:05:02.340> me<00:05:02.430> if<00:05:02.490> I

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
conditioner it somebody asking me if I

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.980 
conditioner it somebody asking me if I

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
the only difference I've seen in my hair

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.930 
the only difference I've seen in my hair
I<00:05:39.419> think<00:05:39.960> that's<00:05:40.710> getting<00:05:41.039> so<00:05:41.400> many<00:05:41.520> color

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
I think that's getting so many color

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.180 
I think that's getting so many color
changes<00:05:42.270> that<00:05:42.389> I<00:05:42.450> got<00:05:42.630> was<00:05:43.410> that<00:05:43.440> three<00:05:43.950> color

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
changes that I got was that three color

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.830 
changes that I got was that three color
changes<00:05:44.669> last<00:05:45.240> year<00:05:45.479> 2013<00:05:46.380> which<00:05:47.160> is<00:05:47.340> a<00:05:47.370> lot

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
changes last year 2013 which is a lot

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.270 
changes last year 2013 which is a lot
the<00:05:48.840> only<00:05:49.050> difference<00:05:49.229> is<00:05:49.530> my<00:05:49.710> hair<00:05:49.979> is<00:05:50.250> a

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
the only difference is my hair is a

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.279 
the only difference is my hair is a
little<00:05:50.580> bit<00:05:50.910> it's<00:05:51.180> not<00:05:51.300> as<00:05:51.479> thick<00:05:51.810> as<00:05:51.990> it<00:05:52.080> used

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
little bit it's not as thick as it used

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.100 
little bit it's not as thick as it used
to<00:05:52.380> be<00:05:52.560> I<00:05:52.800> mean<00:05:53.760> it's<00:05:53.910> still<00:05:53.970> pretty<00:05:54.270> thick<00:05:54.630> but

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110

to be I mean it's still pretty thick but
it's<00:05:55.260> not<00:05:56.090> as<00:05:57.090> thick<00:05:57.449> my<00:05:57.599> hair<00:05:57.780> was

it's not as thick my hair was

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.940 
it's not as thick my hair was
and<00:05:59.210> micro<00:06:00.210> pattern<00:06:00.630> has<00:06:00.780> loosened<00:06:01.320> up<00:06:01.500> a<00:06:01.710> lot

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
and micro pattern has loosened up a lot

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.570 
and micro pattern has loosened up a lot
since<00:06:02.390> um<00:06:03.390> I<00:06:03.750> mean<00:06:04.560> that<00:06:04.770> could<00:06:04.890> be<00:06:05.070> because

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
since um I mean that could be because

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.060 
since um I mean that could be because
I've<00:06:05.910> strict<00:06:06.240> I've<00:06:06.480> straighten<00:06:06.840> my<00:06:06.960> hair<00:06:07.230> I've

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
I've strict I've straighten my hair I've

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.980 
I've strict I've straighten my hair I've
got<00:06:08.280> color<00:06:08.580> my<00:06:08.910> hair<00:06:08.940> and<00:06:09.480> my<00:06:09.660> hair<00:06:09.690> is<00:06:09.900> getting

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
got color my hair and my hair is getting

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.660 
got color my hair and my hair is getting
longer<00:06:10.320> so<00:06:10.680> I<00:06:10.710> think<00:06:10.860> all<00:06:11.280> those<00:06:11.430> play<00:06:11.640> a

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
longer so I think all those play a

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.780 
longer so I think all those play a
factor<00:06:11.940> into<00:06:12.930> my<00:06:13.080> chrome<00:06:13.770> cutter<00:06:14.070> getting<00:06:14.670> a

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
factor into my chrome cutter getting a

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.810 
factor into my chrome cutter getting a
little<00:06:14.940> bit<00:06:15.150> looser<00:06:15.470> but<00:06:16.470> I'm<00:06:16.680> other<00:06:17.640> than

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
little bit looser but I'm other than

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.070 
little bit looser but I'm other than
that<00:06:17.970> I<00:06:18.000> haven't<00:06:18.390> had<00:06:18.450> any<00:06:18.720> bad<00:06:18.930> experiences

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
that I haven't had any bad experiences

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.620 
that I haven't had any bad experiences
with<00:06:19.530> color<00:06:19.890> I<00:06:20.010> think<00:06:20.550> that<00:06:21.120> if<00:06:21.240> you<00:06:21.360> want<00:06:21.510> to

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
with color I think that if you want to

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.630 
with color I think that if you want to
go<00:06:21.870> for<00:06:22.110> it<00:06:22.230> just<00:06:22.770> go<00:06:22.920> for<00:06:23.160> it<00:06:23.220> i<00:06:23.340> mean<00:06:23.460> it's

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
go for it just go for it i mean it's
