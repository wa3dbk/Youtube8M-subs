probably<00:00:38.540> some<00:00:39.540> soon<00:00:40.760> redstone<00:00:41.840> repeaters

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
probably some soon redstone repeaters

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.540 
probably some soon redstone repeaters
rest<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.640> will<00:00:44.789> use<00:00:44.850> for<00:00:45.059> Justin<00:00:45.930> and

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
rest on that we will use for Justin and

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.400

what you do is simply add a bunch of

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:12.880 
what you do is simply add a bunch of
computers<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:00.030> chatter<00:01:09.830> then<00:01:11.270> collect<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
circle your that stone and you will need

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.760 
circle your that stone and you will need
to<00:01:18.299> create<00:01:18.570> all<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.049> can<00:01:19.200> make<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.439> any<00:01:19.590> way

piston add your favorite block on top
that<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.909> course<00:01:30.210> allows<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:31.049> going<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.409> go

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
that of course allows it's going to go

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.270 
that of course allows it's going to go
through<00:01:31.939> they<00:01:32.939> go<00:01:33.119> for<00:01:33.540> your<00:01:33.630> what<00:01:33.810> stone

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.540 

there<00:01:36.670> we<00:01:36.760> go<00:01:36.940> and<00:01:37.350> then<00:01:38.350> just<00:01:38.380> hook<00:01:39.130> it<00:01:39.250> up<00:01:39.340> to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
there we go and then just hook it up to

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.370 
there we go and then just hook it up to
a<00:01:39.580> meter<00:01:41.010> this<00:01:42.010> will<00:01:42.310> turn<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:42.970> clock<00:01:43.720> on<00:01:44.020> off

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
a meter this will turn the clock on off

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.010 
a meter this will turn the clock on off
so<00:01:45.370> in<00:01:46.150> this<00:01:46.300> position

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
so in this position

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.570 
so in this position
it'll<00:01:47.260> be<00:01:47.380> on<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:48.010> is<00:01:48.130> purchasing<00:01:48.460> a

liver<00:02:23.980> point<00:02:24.340> above<00:02:25.140> when<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.770> block<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:26.980> pipe

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
liver point above when the block is pipe

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.990 
liver point above when the block is pipe
makes<00:02:28.630> sense<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.170> me<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:30.130> when<00:02:30.250> it's<00:02:30.400> down<00:02:30.520> the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
makes sense to me and when it's down the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.020 
makes sense to me and when it's down the
book<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.270> down<00:02:32.010> it's<00:02:33.010> just<00:02:33.490> a<00:02:33.580> matter<00:02:33.760> of

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
book is down it's just a matter of

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.699 
book is down it's just a matter of
preference<00:02:34.330> maybe<00:02:36.150> so<00:02:37.209> next<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:37.930> will<00:02:38.140> need

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
preference maybe so next you will need

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.180 
preference maybe so next you will need
something<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.520> initiate<00:02:40.500> your<00:02:41.500> clock<00:02:41.890> which

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
something to initiate your clock which

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.720 
something to initiate your clock which
is<00:02:42.370> simply<00:02:42.760> about<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:44.260> it's<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.709> girl

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
is simply about you it it's a girl

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.680 
is simply about you it it's a girl
now<00:02:46.690> you<00:02:47.500> can<00:02:47.800> adjust<00:02:48.100> this<00:02:48.580> at<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.300> length<00:02:49.540> of

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
now you can adjust this at the length of

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.710 
now you can adjust this at the length of
this<00:02:49.870> pulse<00:02:50.370> within<00:02:51.370> hours<00:02:51.700> knowledge<00:02:52.270> if

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
this pulse within hours knowledge if

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.890 
this pulse within hours knowledge if
this<00:02:53.260> doesn't<00:02:53.970> suit<00:02:54.970> your<00:02:55.239> preferences<00:02:55.840> for

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
this doesn't suit your preferences for

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.880 
this doesn't suit your preferences for
whatever<00:02:56.260> reason<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:58.060> but<00:02:58.780> let's<00:02:59.410> make<00:02:59.650> that

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
whatever reason and but let's make that

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.850 
whatever reason and but let's make that
really<00:03:00.040> quick<00:03:00.750> he's<00:03:01.750> able<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.080> go<00:03:02.260> collect<00:03:02.590> so

yes sir then you can this far you can
relay<00:03:24.700> anyway<00:03:25.269> one<00:03:25.569> just<00:03:26.500> make<00:03:26.680> sure<00:03:26.860> it<00:03:26.980> goes

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
relay anyway one just make sure it goes

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:32.250 
relay anyway one just make sure it goes
into<00:03:27.400> this<00:03:27.670> book<00:03:27.909> and<00:03:28.980> add<00:03:29.980> your<00:03:31.260> initiating

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
into this book and add your initiating

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:41.660 
into this book and add your initiating
button<00:03:33.269> and<00:03:34.269> then<00:03:35.849> set<00:03:36.849> up<00:03:37.060> on<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.269> block<00:03:40.230> and

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
button and then set up on a block and

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.729 
button and then set up on a block and
that<00:03:42.670> block<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:44.879> featuring<00:03:46.019> or<00:03:47.019> depending

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
that block and featuring or depending

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.089 
that block and featuring or depending
what<00:03:48.459> you<00:03:48.610> want<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:48.879> do<00:03:49.000> with<00:03:49.209> your<00:03:49.420> clock<00:03:49.629> and

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
what you want to do with your clock and

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:55.410 
what you want to do with your clock and
repeaters<00:03:51.099> and<00:03:51.670> make<00:03:52.239> the<00:03:52.599> post<00:03:53.260> longer<00:03:54.420> let's

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
repeaters and make the post longer let's

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:06.619 
repeaters and make the post longer let's
just<00:03:56.079> check<00:03:56.379> if<00:03:56.590> this<00:03:56.769> works<00:03:59.790> it<00:04:00.790> does<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:03.430> does

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.390 

so<00:04:08.400> let's<00:04:09.400> put<00:04:09.670> a<00:04:09.849> block<00:04:10.090> over<00:04:10.299> here

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
so let's put a block over here

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.890 
so let's put a block over here
it<00:04:12.400> sounds<00:04:12.849> up<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.329> just<00:04:14.230> signal<00:04:15.750> now<00:04:16.750> you

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
it sounds up and just signal now you

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.500 
it sounds up and just signal now you
will<00:04:17.049> have<00:04:17.229> one<00:04:17.949> click<00:04:18.190> talk<00:04:18.539> one<00:04:19.539> tick<00:04:19.780> clock

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
will have one click talk one tick clock

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.719 
will have one click talk one tick clock
and<00:04:22.590> maybe<00:04:23.590> like<00:04:23.860> that<00:04:24.070> I<00:04:24.280> don't

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
and maybe like that I don't

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.969 
and maybe like that I don't
that's<00:04:25.030> quite<00:04:25.780> short<00:04:26.169> so<00:04:26.910> simply<00:04:27.910> kill<00:04:28.539> it

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
that's quite short so simply kill it

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.339 
that's quite short so simply kill it
there<00:04:29.979> we<00:04:30.070> go<00:04:30.280> and<00:04:30.599> then<00:04:31.599> depending<00:04:32.169> how<00:04:32.289> many

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
there we go and then depending how many

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.620 
there we go and then depending how many
repeaters<00:04:32.919> you<00:04:33.010> are<00:04:33.160> here<00:04:33.520> you<00:04:33.729> go<00:04:33.940> create<00:04:34.510> a

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
repeaters you are here you go create a

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.890 
repeaters you are here you go create a
longer<00:04:34.930> version<00:04:35.200> of<00:04:35.410> the<00:04:35.530> clock<00:04:36.450> so<00:04:37.450> that<00:04:37.690> is

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
longer version of the clock so that is

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.279 
longer version of the clock so that is
the<00:04:38.110> shortest<00:04:38.590> clock<00:04:38.830> you<00:04:39.039> can<00:04:39.340> create<00:04:40.289> with

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
the shortest clock you can create with

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.909 
the shortest clock you can create with
the<00:04:42.070> set<00:04:42.340> up<00:04:42.460> of<00:04:42.900> course<00:04:43.900> you<00:04:44.050> add<00:04:44.229> the<00:04:44.500> want<00:04:44.740> a

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
the set up of course you add the want a

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.920 
the set up of course you add the want a
clock

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.620 

that<00:04:48.229> I<00:04:48.500> don't<00:04:48.860> think<00:04:49.070> that<00:04:49.250> one<00:04:49.430> lasts<00:04:49.910> if<00:04:50.360> you

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
that I don't think that one lasts if you

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.460 
that I don't think that one lasts if you
log<00:04:51.139> out<00:04:51.350> and<00:04:52.630> but<00:04:53.630> yeah<00:04:53.870> you<00:04:53.930> can<00:04:54.169> make<00:04:54.289> this

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
log out and but yeah you can make this

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:02.170 
log out and but yeah you can make this
longer<00:04:54.830> let's<00:04:55.340> do<00:04:56.000> that<00:04:56.210> real<00:04:56.539> quick<00:04:57.759> let's<00:05:01.180> go

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
longer let's do that real quick let's go

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.550 
longer let's do that real quick let's go
back<00:05:03.110> home

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
back home

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.439 
back home
so<00:05:04.250> you<00:05:04.310> can<00:05:04.430> make<00:05:04.580> it<00:05:04.669> longer<00:05:04.789> by<00:05:05.060> adding<00:05:05.419> your

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
so you can make it longer by adding your

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.469 
so you can make it longer by adding your
repeaters<00:05:06.080> of<00:05:06.289> course<00:05:06.530> and<00:05:06.970> by<00:05:07.970> increasing

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
repeaters of course and by increasing

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:19.390 
repeaters of course and by increasing
delay<00:05:15.160> your<00:05:16.160> switch<00:05:17.889> and<00:05:18.889> as<00:05:19.009> you<00:05:19.100> can<00:05:19.250> see

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
delay your switch and as you can see

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.379 
delay your switch and as you can see
this<00:05:19.610> pulse<00:05:19.940> is<00:05:20.449> long<00:05:21.110> it's<00:05:21.590> almost<00:05:22.220> a<00:05:22.880> little

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
this pulse is long it's almost a little

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:30.189 
this pulse is long it's almost a little
quite<00:05:26.289> almost<00:05:27.370> and<00:05:28.370> then<00:05:29.330> if<00:05:29.690> you<00:05:29.930> want<00:05:30.080> to

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
quite almost and then if you want to

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.770 
quite almost and then if you want to
make<00:05:30.320> a<00:05:30.349> fancy<00:05:30.620> you<00:05:30.830> can<00:05:31.240> cover<00:05:32.240> all<00:05:32.449> this<00:05:32.599> up

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
make a fancy you can cover all this up

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.499 
make a fancy you can cover all this up
in<00:05:33.020> glass<00:05:33.259> and<00:05:33.620> put<00:05:33.800> this<00:05:33.919> on<00:05:33.979> the<00:05:34.160> water<00:05:34.509> neat

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:35.509 
in glass and put this on the water neat

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:39.189 
in glass and put this on the water neat
effect<00:05:37.090> would<00:05:38.090> you<00:05:38.210> go<00:05:38.389> about<00:05:38.539> doing<00:05:38.870> that

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 
effect would you go about doing that

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.089 
effect would you go about doing that
just<00:05:39.560> create<00:05:39.919> a<00:05:39.979> little<00:05:40.130> glass<00:05:40.400> and<00:05:41.710> I<00:05:42.710> would

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
just create a little glass and I would

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:48.040 
just create a little glass and I would
reckon<00:05:43.490> if<00:05:43.639> you<00:05:43.729> do<00:05:43.880> it<00:05:43.970> like<00:05:44.150> that<00:05:44.210> you<00:05:47.050> place

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
reckon if you do it like that you place

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.540 
reckon if you do it like that you place
your<00:05:48.199> glass<00:05:48.440> first<00:05:48.680> and<00:05:48.919> then<00:05:49.070> place<00:05:49.280> a<00:05:49.310> bit

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
your glass first and then place a bit

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.129 
your glass first and then place a bit
soon<00:05:49.729> because<00:05:50.120> if<00:05:50.360> you<00:05:50.479> have<00:05:50.599> a<00:05:50.630> water<00:05:50.930> leak

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139 
soon because if you have a water leak

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.890 
soon because if you have a water leak
you<00:05:51.349> can<00:05:51.530> do<00:05:51.860> it<00:05:52.010> all<00:05:52.190> over<00:05:52.220> again<00:05:52.599> in<00:05:53.599> there

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
you can do it all over again in there

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.920 
you can do it all over again in there
than<00:05:54.110> that<00:05:54.320> and<00:05:54.590> then<00:05:55.280> lastly<00:05:55.699> for<00:05:56.030> grabbing

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
than that and then lastly for grabbing

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.140 
than that and then lastly for grabbing
your<00:05:57.169> source<00:05:57.860> you<00:05:58.190> can<00:05:58.370> either<00:05:58.610> use<00:05:58.940> this

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
your source you can either use this

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.409 
your source you can either use this
right<00:05:59.479> here<00:05:59.659> obviously<00:06:00.110> or<00:06:00.789> if<00:06:01.789> it's<00:06:02.180> another

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
right here obviously or if it's another

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:04.659 
right here obviously or if it's another
location<00:06:02.990> you<00:06:03.320> need<00:06:03.380> it<00:06:03.590> you<00:06:03.860> can<00:06:04.070> simply<00:06:04.310> no
