00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.990
 Jens Weinmann has been in Hamm for 18 years 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.510
 tenant of a washer of him 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.570
 own data world largest operator of 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.670
 car wash but weinmann's shop 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.809
 is getting worse and worse he always has to 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.809
 reject more customers 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.430
 here were the weapons 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.930
 among those four inches under 18 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.370
 The submissions are great 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.800
 damage to your fields or damage 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.290
 have to 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.460
 the problem is every third new car 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.030
 today with so-called 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.040
 low-profile tires equipped 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.730
 But cars with such wide tires are 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.100
 unsuitable for the obsolete washing line 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.830
 The conveyor belts are so narrow that the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.269
 scratching rims when they are at the 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.010
 Iron chain pulled over 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.650
 Jens Weinmann shows us a report 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.170
 that he has given in this order 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.180
 photo proves because of the narrow track 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.399
 the drag chain is so close to 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.500
 rimmed that they even up 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:10.320
 the risk can get caught up in it 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.009
 there could be damage in this way 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.670
 Fields arise in the report means 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:21.539
 it is a very high one 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.780
 damage to the rim he has 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.119
 the report is created by Michael Walter 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.590
 Expert for car washes 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.000
 about 20 to 25 percent of all 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.979
 washing route in germany at transport 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.300
 facility necessarily spread yet 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.539
 suitable for low profile tires 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.890
 are 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.200
 at some badstraÃŸe not on the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.880
 transport devices guiding device 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.380
 so high that sometimes a 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.390
 certain control arm not 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.740
 to exclude is that means 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.780
 maybe that too, the track 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.119
 can be spoiled accident 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.280
 in extreme cases , it could happen in the 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.050
 extremely fall in the washroom of 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.840
 jens weinmann sees a appraisals 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.950
 such risk is a verifiable case 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.250
 but is not it too high due to this 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.780
 easy to help 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.860
 Through the calls you can see that the 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.910
 ferry has to be pulled over and 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.140
 can be damaged if you are here 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.179
 drives over it and a damaged one 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.160
 fehringer that means danger to life 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.090
 Upon request, he stated in writing 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.670
 quote we have no harm at all 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.320
 wishbone in front 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.080
 since the beginning of the recordings 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.730
 15 years ago the problem of the rims 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.910
 damage is the emo group 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.520
 obviously long known in 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.180
 this warning from 2003 to the 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.709
 Tenants said it was the mature height should 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.709
 Not less than 50 millimeters 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.940
 although the tight track trail is structurally 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.090
 was not changed it says in one 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.830
 have memo handbook two years later 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.780
 you customers with a mature height of 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.880
 equal below 80 millimeters 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.420
 low profile tires can do so 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.860
 Scratch rims through the conveyor belt 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.459
 if possible, always leave the rims 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.110
 inside the ribbon abut constitutes 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.850
 are instructions for action that 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.019
 Problem of the front of the follow 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.519
 relocate to the rear of the peoples 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.600
 should 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.890
 because the damage is not and the 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.810
 customer does not get under circumstances 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.410
 with that means a problem should be hushed up 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.750
 become 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.970
 that could be assumed so, yes always 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.500
 explained on demand in general could 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.510
 rim on the inside the 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.570
 Do not touch the control devices 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.110
 the contradiction referee is called 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.739
 it from him 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.739
 Quote 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.950
 our partners are well trained around 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.650
 our customers exactly in the conveyor belt 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.349
 to instruct and possible steering corrections 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.750
 to accompany the customer 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:42.319
 We will do a sample of our car 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.420
 has a mature height of 53 centimeters 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.870
 actually for immo wash streets 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.090
 Inappropriate in the Ruhr area we drive to 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.609
 five different nemo washing machines 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.579
 we turn all with hidden camera 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.909
 systems are identical with narrow ones 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:01.609
 conveyor belt and the exposed one 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:03.650
 iron chain in all innova streets the 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.840
 we go to while there are so-called 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.030
 Usage hints but we find 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.299
 no warnings for nidda cross section 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.609
 rims and the staff leaves us 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.639
 without comment into everything 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.419
 we drive very carefully there are damages 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.699
 it no 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.560
 for experts, the state of 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.310
 washing machines only inadequate 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.720
 controlled 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.310
 honestly, there are none 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.220
 regular check of waterways 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.849
 begins special confirmation risk 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.380
 look closely 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.430
 That can only be done on a voluntary basis 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.090
 time does not happen 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.130
 obligation for this should be there 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.229
 are neither desirable streets 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.000
 Operator in front of the painter 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.930
 subject to regular examination and 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.909
 even the car driver simply more 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.550
 to give security 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:49.430
 out of a total of about 16,000 washing systems 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.960
 in Germany only about 1500 have 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.050
 be voluntarily checked 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.330
 from the Association of the automotive industry immo 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.270
 Installations are not tested by the vgh 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.460
 so the information of the association in 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.669
 the emo washing machine trickles down in hamm 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:08.530
 everywhere the rust such particles fall 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.530
 then on the paint of the cars 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.580
 the report says it is particularly critical 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.950
 were detected corrosion at the 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.680
 shock absorbers and their attachments 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.840
 To classify as here and replace the 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.460
 fall down larger metal parts 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:29.160
 could not be ruled out 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:31.470
 In contrast , quote imo explained 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.060
 Systematically checks all systems in 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.880
 operation for possible damage 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.880
 These are continuously maintained resp 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.770
 exchanged the vga wants for two 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.690
 years the risk of motorists 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.380
 basically with all washing systems 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.410
 to decrease 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.600
 Monika Gall is part of the examination team for 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.000
 the vga seal of approval does not just exist 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.460
 There are problems with old systems as well 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.200
 especially with newer plants 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.600
 These non-contact systems 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.760
 touches problems because simple 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.740
 The pressure of water is too high 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.290
 amount of water hits the car and 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.650
 also the share the chemistry very aggressive 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.050
 is 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.240
 therefore it is actually very good that 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.400
 we have the vde seal then that is 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.080
 customer on the right side and sees 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.880
 Here was a facility that has a low 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.160
 damage potential for his car 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.830
 firmly 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.690
 and with him here at least the holds 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:26.810
 Tenants in the water have their own washing 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:29.330
 to be of concern one saves oneself 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.400
 even the cost of 350 euros that 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.870
 to renew water 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.430
 in the past, one has to be in the wise from eight to 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.800
 Ten thousand cars had water 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.530
 renew now uses 40 50,000 euros 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.760
 pulled out, however , always denies 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.220
 these allegations 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:48.830
 The quality of the water will be monthly 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:50.990
 controlled and she did not exist 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.990
 significant change in the 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:56.030
 intervalls of gross cleaning jens 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.310
 Weinmann has slow enough with emo 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:00.560
 In the legal dispute he makes his criticism 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:03.010
 publicly the emos responsible for the 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.180
 plant to wait to withstand 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.130
 Investments are very rare 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:10.720
 made so long driven to it 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:13.160
 always falls apart belongs to a us 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.830
 investment company nearly 100 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:19.600
 billion dollars manages profit 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.600
 seems more important than security
