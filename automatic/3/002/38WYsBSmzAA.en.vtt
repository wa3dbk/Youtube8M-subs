covers<00:01:17.700> over<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.969> towers<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.380> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
covers over the towers we have to have a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.529 
covers over the towers we have to have a
way<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.920> getting<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.399> error<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.789> the<00:01:21.000> car<00:01:21.240> and

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
way of getting the error on the car and

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.590 
way of getting the error on the car and
over<00:01:22.289> the<00:01:22.409> park

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
over the park

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.120 
over the park
they<00:01:24.960> really<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> front

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
they really just like the front

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.770 
they really just like the front
generates<00:01:27.090> downforce

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
generates downforce

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.080 
generates downforce
so<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.560> front<00:01:28.799> wing<00:01:29.159> generates<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.850> front

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
so the front wing generates the front

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.330 
so the front wing generates the front
downforce<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:31.200> rear<00:01:31.409> wing<00:01:31.619> generates<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
downforce the rear wing generates the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.789 
downforce the rear wing generates the
rear<00:01:32.549> there<00:01:33.299> are<00:01:33.420> also<00:01:33.659> about<00:01:33.990> 20<00:01:34.530> different

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
rear there are also about 20 different

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.430 
rear there are also about 20 different
settings<00:01:35.369> for<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.670> real<00:01:35.909> wing<00:01:36.259> you'll<00:01:37.259> see

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
settings for the real wing you'll see

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.880 
settings for the real wing you'll see
various<00:01:37.890> hole<00:01:38.159> positions<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> rear<00:01:39.149> wing

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
various hole positions on the rear wing

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.930 
various hole positions on the rear wing
what<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.190> do<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.490> full-scale

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
what we can do in the full-scale

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.200 
what we can do in the full-scale
component<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:43.049> change<00:01:43.560> these<00:01:43.799> elements<00:01:44.340> into

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
component is change these elements into

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.389 
component is change these elements into
different<00:01:45.659> angles<00:01:46.140> which<00:01:46.470> generate<00:01:46.890> less<00:01:47.190> or

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
different angles which generate less or

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.999 
different angles which generate less or
more<00:01:47.520> downforce<00:01:48.000> as<00:01:48.240> required<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:52.530> trick<00:01:52.830> is

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
more downforce as required the trick is

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.499 
more downforce as required the trick is
to<00:01:53.039> create<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.580> perfect<00:01:53.789> balance<00:01:54.060> between

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
to create the perfect balance between

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.960 
to create the perfect balance between
the<00:01:54.960> front<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.770> rear<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.250> car

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.570 

in<00:01:59.270> this<00:01:59.900> the<00:02:00.110> design<00:02:00.470> of<00:02:00.650> the<00:02:00.770> underbody<00:02:01.280> is

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
in this the design of the underbody is

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.300 
in this the design of the underbody is
key<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.660> diffuser<00:02:03.230> which<00:02:03.560> is<00:02:03.740> placed<00:02:04.040> at<00:02:04.220> the

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
rear of the car also plays a crucial

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.589 
rear of the car also plays a crucial
role

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.949 

basically<00:02:12.469> we<00:02:12.799> want<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.129> have<00:02:13.390> as<00:02:14.390> quick<00:02:14.749> air

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
basically we want to have as quick air

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.429 
basically we want to have as quick air
underneath<00:02:15.439> the<00:02:15.590> car<00:02:15.829> as<00:02:15.980> possible<00:02:17.139> but<00:02:18.139> to

underneath the car as possible but to

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.699 
underneath the car as possible but to
try<00:02:19.129> and<00:02:19.310> get<00:02:19.549> it<00:02:19.700> back<00:02:19.939> up<00:02:20.239> in<00:02:20.989> an<00:02:21.170> efficient

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
try and get it back up in an efficient

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.309 
try and get it back up in an efficient
manner<00:02:21.859> you<00:02:22.400> need<00:02:22.609> to<00:02:23.060> slow<00:02:23.719> the<00:02:23.930> Aerodyne
