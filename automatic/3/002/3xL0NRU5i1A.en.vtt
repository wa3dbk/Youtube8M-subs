else inside the box nope clear side get

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.660 
else inside the box nope clear side get
to<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> actual<00:01:33.750> case<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.860> she<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.280> flips

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
to the actual case that she just flips

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.880 
to the actual case that she just flips
out<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.829> guess<00:01:37.829> it's<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.070> like<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.670> now<00:01:39.890> you

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
out I guess it's just like that now you

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.920 
out I guess it's just like that now you
would<00:01:40.979> think<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.340> would<00:01:41.579> be<00:01:41.670> metal<00:01:42.060> because

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
would think that would be metal because

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.200 
would think that would be metal because
obviously<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:44.700> lg's<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.540> metal<00:01:46.110> as<00:01:46.259> well

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
obviously the lg's is metal as well

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:55.490 
obviously the lg's is metal as well
that's<00:01:48.210> actually<00:01:48.509> plastic<00:01:52.939> that's<00:01:54.079> not<00:01:55.079> boast

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that's actually plastic that's not boast

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.859 
that's actually plastic that's not boast
you<00:01:55.890> are<00:01:56.540> hard<00:01:57.540> plastic<00:01:58.110> i'm<00:01:58.619> guessing<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.869> LG

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
you are hard plastic i'm guessing the LG

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:08.170 
you are hard plastic i'm guessing the LG
here<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:03.380> pops<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.619> there<00:02:05.399> we<00:02:05.490> go

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.830 

so<00:02:09.180> it<00:02:09.390> doesn't<00:02:09.660> really<00:02:10.080> had<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.500> much<00:02:10.710> more

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
so it doesn't really had that much more

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.710 
so it doesn't really had that much more
thickness<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.170> phone<00:02:14.120> but<00:02:15.120> because<00:02:15.570> it's

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
thickness to the phone but because it's

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.560 
thickness to the phone but because it's
made<00:02:15.990> by<00:02:16.230> LG<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.910> efficiently<00:02:17.910> made<00:02:18.090> for<00:02:18.450> this

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
made by LG and efficiently made for this

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.430 
made by LG and efficiently made for this
phone<00:02:18.900> 2x<00:02:20.180> should<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.300> pretty<00:02:21.660> decent<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.410> mean

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
phone 2x should be pretty decent I mean

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.290 
phone 2x should be pretty decent I mean
you<00:02:23.070> can<00:02:23.370> get<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.880> hdmi<00:02:24.480> port<00:02:26.120> all<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
you can get to the hdmi port all the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:35.180 
you can get to the hdmi port all the
buttons<00:02:27.660> are<00:02:28.110> quite<00:02:29.040> easy<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.090> get<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:32.510> yep<00:02:34.190> and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
buttons are quite easy to get to yep and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.230 
buttons are quite easy to get to yep and
then<00:02:35.400> speakers<00:02:36.060> are<00:02:36.390> not<00:02:37.010> covered<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.910> get<00:02:39.060> to

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
then speakers are not covered and get to

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:49.240 
then speakers are not covered and get to
that<00:02:40.880> let's<00:02:41.880> just<00:02:42.030> see<00:02:42.959> how<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:47.930> hmm

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
that let's just see how is of that hmm

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.780 
that let's just see how is of that hmm
it<00:02:50.250> was<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.520> bit<00:02:50.700> weak<00:02:51.290> like<00:02:52.520> snapple<00:02:53.520> quite

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
it was a bit weak like snapple quite

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.040 
it was a bit weak like snapple quite
easily<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:55.430> mean<00:02:56.430> it's<00:02:57.239> not<00:02:57.450> very<00:02:57.630> impressive

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
easily I mean it's not very impressive

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.820 
easily I mean it's not very impressive
by<00:02:58.350> ill<00:02:58.560> ye<00:02:59.480> that's<00:03:00.480> what<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.840> looked<00:03:01.230> like<00:03:01.350> if

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
by ill ye that's what it looked like if

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.940 
by ill ye that's what it looked like if
it<00:03:01.980> wants<00:03:02.430> slide<00:03:03.950> guessing<00:03:04.950> that's<00:03:05.390> can<00:03:06.390> see

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
it wants slide guessing that's can see

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.490 
it wants slide guessing that's can see
it's<00:03:07.950> got<00:03:08.130> a<00:03:08.190> bounce<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:10.050> after<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.410> while

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
it's got a bounce to it so after a while

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.820 
it's got a bounce to it so after a while
that's<00:03:13.500> gonna<00:03:13.799> break<00:03:14.640> pretty<00:03:14.940> down<00:03:15.209> easily<00:03:15.830> so

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
that's gonna break pretty down easily so

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.370
