00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.750
 demands 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.580
 today I make you a video that it 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.290
 been so long that I 'm going 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.420
 do this by a year that is on the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.250
 ice but the cheek also finally decide to 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.660
 you do it it's a base to know 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.430
 it's super important 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.560
 in fact it's the shape of your face 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.170
 how to understand his face and for 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.780
 by her make up and better do it 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.820
 also while knowing how was 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.560
 put his forehead his blush for 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.900
 to go proportionately with his 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.980
 face then we start but I have some 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.840
 little notes because there are some 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.440
 a lot to say if they eat together 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.440
 not that we think 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:50.810
 but yes if you're like mikko yes ok 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.190
 it's good I know I go 120 go get off 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.190
 the faces poured the face that is 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.960
 says perfect jess kalba and megan fox in 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.520
 that kind of face there to apply 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.930
 your adding is not complicated you 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.350
 apply it the way you want 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.390
 a perfect face 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.869
 the oblong face it's the face that 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.340
 is done on the long and holy gisèle 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.330
 blin coucy and sarah jessica parker 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.280
 also 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.990
 and when it is applied your strong to 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.450
 day it's important to go apply it 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.670
 more horizontally to go 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.409
 precisely given the width to your 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.140
 face because it is longer in length 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.630
 we want to go compensate and balanced 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.100
 when the round face like kristen dunst 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.659
 or kévin diaz 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.060
 it was important to go and put 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.220
 blush in angle because the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.200
 face and more will have and then we want 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.659
 to go to length it precisely by putting 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.610
 really more important angle of 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.259
 paul in crumbs and on the cheekbones 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.330
 really round because just that 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.490
 rounds young faces rather 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.310
 to wear when you have a face more 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.290
 rectangular or an oval face 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.229
 the square faces it's more like 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.000
 adriana lima for example or mila kunis 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.649
 so we do a little like the face 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.659
 round we're going to really go on the 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.890
 blush again at an angle 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.490
 because because they did a little 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.170
 wider 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.210
 we want again would lengthen 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.100
 face 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.959
 we see the rectangular shape at 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.870
 jessica simpson for example alessandra 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.870
 ambrosio also and especially angelina 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.970
 pretty who is very very angular so and 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.120
 it's a usage that's between quarter and 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.400
 lots blond so we'll apply them the 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.980
 blush more horizontally and a 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.290
 a little bit in angle so we're going 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.400
 to really go on the bone but we 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.230
 wants to put it a little bit more 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.340
 horizontal to give a little bit of 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.340
 face width 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.260
 faces in triangle like the 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.080
 faces in quarters are forms of 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.530
 faces that are rarer and we see 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.990
 and christina ricci risk to us there 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.030
 let's have that kind of face there it's 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.820
 better to go apply the makeup to 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.290
 cheeks angled and more horizontally 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.760
 I hope the stuff should have us 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.410
 helped that it'll be easier for 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.410
 you go to apply blush 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.370
 to put your face avoiding 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.810
 now it's up to you click on 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.810
 pause and make head 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.160
 and here is your account to the ideal for 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.160
 your health face 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:43.400
 finally the most eyebrow shape 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.400
 flattering for your face 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.239
 thank you for watching and we see each other again 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.239
 in a video project
