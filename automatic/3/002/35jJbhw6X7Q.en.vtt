that<00:01:54.300> was<00:01:54.480> because<00:01:54.660> of<00:01:54.870> the<00:01:55.200> lands<00:01:55.380> they<00:01:55.500> had

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
that was because of the lands they had

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.080 
that was because of the lands they had
conquered<00:01:56.040> Nala<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.490> they<00:01:56.670> sort<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.880> change

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
that's changed decisional for now it's

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.810 
that's changed decisional for now it's
just<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.720> anyways<00:02:00.720> though<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.580> at<00:02:02.580> the

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
just the anyways though so at the

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.610 
just the anyways though so at the
moment<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:05.180> let's<00:02:06.180> start<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:06.990> battle<00:02:07.140> here<00:02:07.440> I

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
moment the let's start the battle here I

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.070 
moment the let's start the battle here I
can<00:02:07.860> start<00:02:08.100> on<00:02:08.190> off<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> rosters<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.050> eye

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
can start on off the rosters so the eye

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.110 
can start on off the rosters so the eye
and<00:02:10.860> finally<00:02:11.220> they<00:02:11.550> made<00:02:11.670> an<00:02:11.760> alliance<00:02:11.940> with

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
and finally they made an alliance with

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.030 
and finally they made an alliance with
the<00:02:12.180> Greyjoy's<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.500> basically<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
the Greyjoy's and so basically the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.910 
the Greyjoy's and so basically the
Greyjoy's<00:02:14.430> had<00:02:14.640> been<00:02:14.850> rebuffed<00:02:15.690> by<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.620> grey

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
irons and so they secretly made the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.810 
irons and so they secretly made the
lines<00:02:18.660> with<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.380> Huaraz<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.250> team<00:02:20.550> up<00:02:20.670> and

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
is they are basically in a position

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.429 
is they are basically in a position
where<00:04:35.249> they<00:04:35.759> sort<00:04:36.059> of<00:04:36.119> get<00:04:36.599> to<00:04:36.869> make<00:04:37.169> incisions

00:04:37.429 --> 00:04:37.439 
where they sort of get to make incisions

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:38.839 
where they sort of get to make incisions
do<00:04:37.769> they<00:04:37.889> want<00:04:38.129> to<00:04:38.219> actually<00:04:38.489> start

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.419 
and as you can see the thralls have
already<00:05:10.719> broken<00:05:10.869> because<00:05:11.259> thralls<00:05:11.679> are<00:05:12.189> as<00:05:12.339> i

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:12.429 
already broken because thralls are as i

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:14.579 
already broken because thralls are as i
said<00:05:12.579> before<00:05:12.669> the<00:05:13.539> worst<00:05:13.839> unit<00:05:14.229> in<00:05:14.319> the<00:05:14.409> game

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:24.579 
that Ironborn otherwise it's just

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:26.519 
that Ironborn otherwise it's just

through walls for the mainland which

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:28.709 
through walls for the mainland which
basically<00:06:26.829> means<00:06:27.129> that<00:06:27.519> if<00:06:28.300> they<00:06:28.449> want<00:06:28.629> to

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:32.079 
to have to get the troops all the way

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:33.839 
to have to get the troops all the way
from<00:06:32.139> pike

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:33.849 
from pike

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:36.570 
from pike
friend<00:06:34.240> Fran<00:06:34.509> will<00:06:34.719> mount<00:06:34.899> which<00:06:35.860> basically

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
friend Fran will mount which basically

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.489 
friend Fran will mount which basically
could<00:06:36.969> be<00:06:37.119> a<00:06:37.149> major<00:06:37.419> major<00:06:37.809> issue<00:06:38.110> for<00:06:38.229> that

00:06:38.489 --> 00:06:38.499 
could be a major major issue for that

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:40.260 
could be a major major issue for that
which<00:06:39.039> I<00:06:39.129> think<00:06:39.309> bounces<00:06:39.699> the<00:06:39.789> more<00:06:39.999> because

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
which I think bounces the more because

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.659 
which I think bounces the more because
as<00:06:40.449> I<00:06:40.899> said<00:06:41.020> before<00:06:41.139> right<00:06:42.129> now<00:06:42.309> they<00:06:42.459> have<00:06:42.639> a

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:42.669 
as I said before right now they have a

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:46.769 
as I said before right now they have a
way<00:06:43.119> to<00:06:43.179> a<00:06:43.419> time<00:06:43.779> of<00:06:43.899> it<00:06:44.939> yeah<00:06:45.939> it<00:06:46.389> needs<00:06:46.479> to<00:06:46.629> be

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:46.779 
way to a time of it yeah it needs to be

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:48.119 
way to a time of it yeah it needs to be
more<00:06:47.050> of<00:06:47.080> a<00:06:47.139> challenge<00:06:47.349> for<00:06:47.559> them<00:06:47.649> to<00:06:47.770> conquer

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:48.129 
more of a challenge for them to conquer

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:50.159 
more of a challenge for them to conquer
some<00:06:48.639> because<00:06:49.209> I<00:06:49.240> mean<00:06:49.419> consider<00:06:49.749> in<00:06:50.050> the

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.169 
some because I mean consider in the

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:52.260 
some because I mean consider in the
books<00:06:50.379> they<00:06:51.039> never<00:06:51.309> actually<00:06:51.520> conquer<00:06:52.149> the

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 
books they never actually conquer the

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.449 
books they never actually conquer the
Seven<00:06:52.389> Kingdoms<00:06:52.659> a<00:06:53.110> despite<00:06:54.039> the<00:06:54.189> fact<00:06:54.369> that

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:54.459 
Seven Kingdoms a despite the fact that

00:06:56.489 --> 00:06:56.499 
crusher when they lost mostly because

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:57.839 
crusher when they lost mostly because
they<00:06:56.800> basically<00:06:57.159> didn't<00:06:57.459> have<00:06:57.550> the<00:06:57.669> manpower

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:57.849 
they basically didn't have the manpower

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:01.949 
they basically didn't have the manpower
