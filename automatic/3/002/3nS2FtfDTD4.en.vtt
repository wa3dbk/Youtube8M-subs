00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
was deserted and evacuated because of

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.100 
was deserted and evacuated because of
nuclear<00:01:58.530> fallout<00:01:58.829> would<00:01:59.579> be<00:01:59.820> overgrown<00:02:00.180> so

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
nuclear fallout would be overgrown so

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.230 
nuclear fallout would be overgrown so
this<00:02:01.320> could<00:02:01.469> be<00:02:01.530> an<00:02:01.740> evacuated<00:02:02.310> new<00:02:02.729> town<00:02:03.000> or

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
this could be an evacuated new town or

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.450 
this could be an evacuated new town or
rebuilt<00:02:03.810> new<00:02:04.049> town<00:02:04.380> at<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.009> end<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.219> nuketown

2025 a nuclear bomb is detonated could

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.479 
2025 a nuclear bomb is detonated could
that<00:02:09.629> lead<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.020> area<00:02:10.560> being<00:02:10.770> abandoned

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
that lead to the area being abandoned

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.250 
that lead to the area being abandoned
for<00:02:12.030> 40<00:02:12.510> years<00:02:12.720> and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
for 40 years and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.649 
for 40 years and
then<00:02:13.379> some<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.430> items<00:02:14.580> could<00:02:15.000> be<00:02:15.120> blown<00:02:15.450> in

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
then some of the items could be blown in

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.420 
then some of the items could be blown in
two<00:02:15.689> different<00:02:16.019> locations<00:02:16.170> there<00:02:17.129> for

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
two different locations there for

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.300 
two different locations there for
reshaping<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.420> whole<00:02:18.629> map<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.650> map<00:02:19.799> would<00:02:20.129> be

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
reshaping the whole map the map would be

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.880 
reshaping the whole map the map would be
too<00:02:20.610> small<00:02:20.939> if<00:02:21.269> it<00:02:21.689> was<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.140> size<00:02:22.379> of<00:02:22.409> the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
too small if it was the size of the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.670 
too small if it was the size of the
previous<00:02:23.370> maps<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.209> could<00:02:24.540> be<00:02:24.689> open<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.439> the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
previous maps so could be open in the

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.580 
previous maps so could be open in the
Nevada<00:02:26.069> location<00:02:26.939> or<00:02:27.150> we<00:02:27.870> could<00:02:28.019> be<00:02:28.170> given<00:02:28.470> a

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
Nevada location or we could be given a

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.460 
Nevada location or we could be given a
new<00:02:28.829> location<00:02:29.250> entirely<00:02:30.150> what<00:02:30.989> about<00:02:31.260> an

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
new location entirely what about an

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.979 
new location entirely what about an
already<00:02:31.829> abandoned<00:02:32.430> area<00:02:32.909> of<00:02:33.030> fallout<00:02:33.510> such

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
already abandoned area of fallout such

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.680 
already abandoned area of fallout such
as<00:02:34.200> Chernobyl<00:02:34.610> this<00:02:35.610> image<00:02:35.879> of<00:02:36.000> Chernobyl<00:02:36.480> has

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
as Chernobyl this image of Chernobyl has

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.020 
as Chernobyl this image of Chernobyl has
many<00:02:37.049> abandoned<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.769> overgrown<00:02:38.030> buildings

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
many abandoned and overgrown buildings

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.300 
many abandoned and overgrown buildings
similar<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.019> marketing<00:02:40.530> image<00:02:40.920> seen

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
similar to the marketing image seen

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.699 
similar to the marketing image seen
within<00:02:41.579> gamestop<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:42.959> that's<00:02:43.170> just<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.439> theory

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
within gamestop so that's just a theory

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.289 
within gamestop so that's just a theory

be really really cooled you think the

be really really cooled you think the
map<00:02:55.530> will<00:02:55.829> be<00:02:55.889> bigger<00:02:56.280> or<00:02:56.579> do<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.090> think<00:02:57.299> we'll

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
map will be bigger or do you think we'll

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.140 
map will be bigger or do you think we'll
