00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.000
 you already have in meta running and the new 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.490
 response 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.080
 context and a shoe that is the 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.850
 younger sister of the super novak life 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.410
 has a little less bus in the 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.180
 half sole but in all has 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.820
 got a great shoe that weighs 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.380
 only 325 grams and has a drop of 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.449
 10 minutes the truth is that it does not fail 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.100
 absolutely nothing dampens well 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.109
 has a really good ride comfort 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.079
 good a good sole that promises 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:36.699
 comfort and grip and also a peru 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.699
 textile area that fits perfectly 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.350
 the midsole of this shoe state 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.090
 in your bus age also has 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.700
 a little less boost than your sister 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.739
 greater the supernova but with all its 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.750
 touch and its really similar response 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.850
 draws attention from the top 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.230
 of the midsole that is going low in 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.940
 the medial part both on the outside 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.860
 as in the interior and in this way 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.390
 separates the bus from the heel with that of the 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.500
 front and also that it gives a little 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.500
 more stability to sneakers 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.140
 The upper of this shoe is 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.850
 completely built in textile text 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.950
 It is an elastic material that adapts 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.570
 perfectly to which even the strips 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.060
 we have aids in the front of the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.619
 foot are elastic in such a way that they 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.540
 will adapt us to the three phases of the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.460
 hurry of our foot movement of 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.560
 a perfect way and then the solution 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.119
 Vamp because it is not the classic 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.250
 lives taking advantage of the three bands that 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.270
 they join the accordion was to make sure 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.270
 a magnificent soft 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.280
 The sole of this shoe is a sole 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:37.500
 which is built in two pieces of 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.909
 rubber brawn robert the back is 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.039
 more traditional with the stars of 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.960
 flexion to absorb well the blow of the 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.969
 heel on the front is 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.000
 segmented with a lot of stretch marks that 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:50.189
 they leave squares of this land rober that 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.990
 they assure us a perfect attraction and a 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.219
 grip almost almost I would say that in all 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.219
 grounds a sole 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.900
 for whom we recommend this magnificent 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.240
 response boost exit then for runners 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.500
 neutral and user templates that 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.660

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.460
 fantastic option for weights a little more 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.080
 heavy depends on the kilometers 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.850
 will remain many miles the same 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.200
 they have a short game but good with 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.270
 everything is a shoe that moves 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.580
 perfectly at rates above 415 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.620
 430 and that even if we ask for a 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.900
 little bit more will respond without problems 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.640
