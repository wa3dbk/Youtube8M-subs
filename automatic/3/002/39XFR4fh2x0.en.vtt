 against this famous konami franchise 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.730
 started the first 87 game was 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.330
 initially released only to 30 will 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.289
 but the following year it was converted 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.859
 platforms such as the mx2 or 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.710
 commodore 64 oms doses in one of the most 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:30.990
 famous the version of me that I give that is 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:33.860
 Let's talk this time without any doubts. 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.660
 some this game is one of the classics 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.390
 and my favorite 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.340
 franklin dies tango blood 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.680
 because this video is not on the board 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.469
 here's the channel 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.410
 fact that is not a simple and nostalgic 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.440
 classic is much more than that against 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.750
 left a legacy in the world of games in it 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.420
 you take control of pike river and 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.760
 lecce bin that if you realize are 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.219
 based on sylvester stallone and 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.600
 organ rains must have fields a fever 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.450
 in the 80s 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.760
 and there they will send them to an island with the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.850
 goal of ending network plans 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.700
 focus and your army that intends to dominate 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.759
 all the land the game takes place in the year of 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.670
 2000 600 and little and you have to kill 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.420
 every kind of enemy the initials that are 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.420
 I do not know 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.490
 american football players 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.310
 Robot soldiers robots have everything 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.820
 A little against was an example of how 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.439
 games the year elegans devils and at the time i 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.020
 I can risk saying that this game 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.329
 practically perfect since its 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.200
 gameplay that is totally fluid and 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.890
 easy 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.799
 your difficulty your fun anyway everything 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.979
 the flipper version has 10 phases 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.470
 while little girl has eight and as already 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.540
 I said the difficulty is intense 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.390
 who played a lot this knows what it's like to have 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.829
 headache but it is the typical difficulty 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.560
 game of the NES 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.680
 you have to know every stage all 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.750
 enemies to order they see everything or 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.120
 Are you going to have to play play more? 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.080
 A little there you learn 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:17.540
 and these phases can be forests 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.970
 cyber sindustrigo ice in the snow 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.520
 but in my opinion the craziest is the 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.360
 last which is a very somber phase 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.030
 involving demons to lens this phase yes 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.030
 It's too much to drink and to help you. 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.920
 you may have some guns and pops that 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.739
 It flew by on this one I think it is 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.480
 a rugby ball is well 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.810
 laser machine gun and my favorite 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.800
 gun is spreads the bullets for all 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.260
 place is sensational is sensational and a 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.260
 thing that was not seen much at the time is the 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.420
 cooperative mode is you can play with 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.390
 a friend on the same screen with all 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.000
 Enemies coming frantically fucking this 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.950
 and pressed a lot but it really is a lot 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.650
 fun we played a lot with 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.540
 my neighbors friends cousin the action 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.239
 many good memories with this game 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.489
 every step you went through was a 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.070
 emotion and when I finally succeeded 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.079
 defeating boston final randy falco 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:18.160
 Wow, we just missed giving a mortal back 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.160
 not so happy that I stayed 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.379
 ah and I was not aware of the 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:32.590
 of the konami code that gives 30 lives 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.480
 I had to go on the race even good times. 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.840
