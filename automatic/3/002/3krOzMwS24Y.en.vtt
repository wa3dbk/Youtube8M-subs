00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
areas there where it is cracked and it

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.899 
areas there where it is cracked and it
doesn't<00:01:15.930> show<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:16.350> really<00:01:16.740> well<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.189> here

you can kind of see the crack it's going
along<00:01:24.420> here<00:01:25.020> along<00:01:25.220> that<00:01:26.220> side<00:01:27.049> and<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.380> did

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560

along here along that side and I did
have<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.860> glue<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.250> part<00:01:29.579> back<00:01:30.210> together<00:01:30.420> and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
chip missing on this part and let's see

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.550 
chip missing on this part and let's see
that<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.759> center<00:01:39.329> piece<00:01:39.810> between<00:01:40.259> these<00:01:40.409> two

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
that the center piece between these two

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.020 
that the center piece between these two
buttons<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:41.040> gone<00:01:42.409> this<00:01:43.409> whole<00:01:43.770> button<00:01:44.610> does

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
buttons is gone this whole button does

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.870 
buttons is gone this whole button does
not<00:01:45.060> work<00:01:45.439> in<00:01:46.439> fact<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.799> disabled<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.490> because

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
not work in fact I disabled it because

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.170 
not work in fact I disabled it because
it<00:01:49.040> was<00:01:50.040> more<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.490> hindrance<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
it was more of a hindrance to the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.999 
it was more of a hindrance to the
operation<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.840> machine<00:01:52.170> than<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.950> help<00:01:55.009> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
operation of the machine than a help the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.929 
operation of the machine than a help the
hinges<00:01:56.549> for<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.329> front<00:01:57.659> cover<00:01:58.020> which<00:01:58.469> go

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
hinges for the front cover which go

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.899 
hinges for the front cover which go
which<00:01:59.939> goes<00:02:00.119> right<00:02:00.329> here<00:02:00.829> are<00:02:01.829> both<00:02:02.430> broken

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
which goes right here are both broken

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.300 
which goes right here are both broken
and<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.719> will<00:02:03.899> sit<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.320> there<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.130> put

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
part does lock on attack here I'll

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.950 
part does lock on attack here I'll
demonstrate<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:08.340> for<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.700> it's<00:03:09.570> hard<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.810> do

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
the screen lays down in there like that

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.220 
the screen lays down in there like that
then<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.770> top<00:03:17.330> got<00:03:18.330> these<00:03:18.540> two<00:03:18.750> needed<00:03:19.020> lifts

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
then the top got these two needed lifts

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.660 
then the top got these two needed lifts
here<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.680> have<00:03:19.830> to<00:03:19.950> click<00:03:20.130> down<00:03:20.310> inside

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
here that have to click down inside

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.250
