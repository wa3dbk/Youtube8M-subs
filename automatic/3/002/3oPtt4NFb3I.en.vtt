00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the very bottom the good thing about

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.310 
the very bottom the good thing about
that<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.439> he'll<00:01:17.250> always<00:01:17.869> look<00:01:18.869> if<00:01:19.049> you're<00:01:19.200> on

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
that is he'll always look if you're on

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.700 
that is he'll always look if you're on
one<00:01:19.650> half<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.630> stage<00:01:21.630> he'll<00:01:22.259> drag<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.619> to

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
one half of the stage he'll drag you to

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.440 
one half of the stage he'll drag you to
the<00:01:22.740> opposite<00:01:23.430> half<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.909> have<00:01:23.970> plenty<00:01:24.270> of

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
the opposite half so you have plenty of

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.990 
the opposite half so you have plenty of
time<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.960> get<00:01:25.920> out<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.369> attack<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:26.909> he

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
time to get out of that attack if he

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.249 
time to get out of that attack if he
does<00:01:27.180> do<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:27.659> he<00:01:27.720> still<00:01:27.900> does<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> little

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
does do it but he still does a little

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.289 
does do it but he still does a little
bit<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.439> damage<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.860> he's<00:01:29.159> dragging<00:01:29.460> he<00:01:30.150> had

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
bit of damage as he's dragging he had

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.060 
bit of damage as he's dragging he had
tiny<00:01:30.630> bit<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.470> actually<00:01:31.740> did<00:01:31.860> quite<00:01:31.979> a

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
tiny bit but you actually did quite a

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.920 
tiny bit but you actually did quite a
bit<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.400> damage<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.970> him

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
bit of damage to him

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.210 
bit of damage to him
counter<00:01:34.830> it<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.880> wouldn't<00:01:36.450> worry<00:01:37.220> about

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
counter it so I wouldn't worry about

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.880 
counter it so I wouldn't worry about
getting<00:01:38.490> grabbed<00:01:38.840> it's<00:01:40.490> fine<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.970> them<00:01:42.710> you<00:01:43.710> do

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
getting grabbed it's fine to them you do

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.570 
getting grabbed it's fine to them you do
not<00:01:43.920> get<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> checkpoint<00:01:44.640> at<00:01:45.120> the<00:01:46.430> at<00:01:47.430> this

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
not get a checkpoint at the at this

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.690 
not get a checkpoint at the at this
little<00:01:47.880> quick<00:01:48.510> time<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.870> that<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.640> to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
little quick time of that so you have to

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.800 
little quick time of that so you have to
continue<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.720> not<00:01:51.870> die<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:53.790> second<00:01:54.180> half<00:01:54.360> is

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
continue to not die the second half is

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.120 
continue to not die the second half is
harder<00:01:56.570> he's<00:01:57.570> got<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> new<00:01:58.080> lightning<00:01:58.710> ground

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
harder he's got a new lightning ground

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.540 
harder he's got a new lightning ground
attack<00:01:59.520> which<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.300> block<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:02.280> he's<00:02:02.400> got

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
attack which you can block and he's got

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.290 
attack which you can block and he's got
the<00:02:02.670> same<00:02:03.050> three<00:02:04.050> punch<00:02:04.350> attack<00:02:05.149> so<00:02:06.149> that

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
he like flies up high in the air and

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.220 
he like flies up high in the air and
like<00:02:17.430> speeds<00:02:18.420> down<00:02:18.750> towards<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.410> slam<00:02:19.680> you

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
like speeds down towards you to slam you

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.390 
like speeds down towards you to slam you
that<00:02:22.230> one<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.470> either<00:02:22.590> need<00:02:22.770> to<00:02:22.830> get<00:02:23.100> out<00:02:23.250> of

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
that one you either need to get out of

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.810 
that one you either need to get out of
the<00:02:23.459> way<00:02:23.640> or<00:02:24.660> block<00:02:25.620> at<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.130> precise<00:02:26.520> right

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
the way or block at the precise right

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.940 
the way or block at the precise right
moment<00:02:27.270> in<00:02:27.330> camera<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.110> blockable<00:02:28.820> but<00:02:29.820> i

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
moment in camera it is blockable but i

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.470 
moment in camera it is blockable but i
think<00:02:31.950> if<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.130> just<00:02:32.160> hold<00:02:32.520> down<00:02:32.670> block<00:02:33.060> you

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
think if you just hold down block you

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.680 
think if you just hold down block you
can<00:02:33.630> still<00:02:33.900> hurts<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.350> but<00:02:34.650> if<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:34.860> like<00:02:35.690> walk

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
can still hurts you but if you like walk

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.000 
can still hurts you but if you like walk
at<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:36.959> exact<00:02:37.350> right<00:02:37.530> time<00:02:37.940> you'll<00:02:38.940> be<00:02:39.030> fine

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
at the exact right time you'll be fine

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.330 
at the exact right time you'll be fine
so<00:02:43.160> yeah<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.910> hard<00:02:45.120> part<00:02:45.360> here<00:02:45.630> is<00:02:45.780> just<00:02:46.340> not

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
so yeah the hard part here is just not

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.380 
so yeah the hard part here is just not
screwing<00:02:47.880> up<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:50.250> know

start over and change the difficulty oh

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.310 
start over and change the difficulty oh
because<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.260> first<00:03:40.470> part<00:03:40.709> was<00:03:40.830> so<00:03:41.180> hard<00:03:42.320> right

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
because the first part was so hard right

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.030 
because the first part was so hard right
I<00:03:43.530> talked<00:03:43.739> about<00:03:43.830> that<00:03:44.070> before<00:03:44.459> but<00:03:45.890> like<00:03:46.890> it

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
I talked about that before but like it

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.570 
I talked about that before but like it
was<00:03:47.100> very<00:03:47.430> very<00:03:47.760> easy<00:03:47.880> on<00:03:48.810> medium<00:03:49.459> but<00:03:50.459> the

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
was very very easy on medium but the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.240 
was very very easy on medium but the
first<00:03:51.209> part<00:03:51.570> of<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.840> game<00:03:52.020> was<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:52.800> hard<00:03:53.130> on

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
first part of the game was so hard on

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.710 
first part of the game was so hard on
our<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:53.700> I<00:03:53.790> knew<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.000> didn't<00:03:54.270> want<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.510> play

two<00:04:20.400> hours<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.239> do<00:04:21.419> one<00:04:21.660> more<00:04:21.690> thing<00:04:23.300> but<00:04:24.300> I

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
two hours to do one more thing but I

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.650 
two hours to do one more thing but I
think<00:04:25.440> number<00:04:26.010> two<00:04:26.310> is<00:04:26.760> my<00:04:26.940> favorite<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:27.510> it's

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
think number two is my favorite and it's

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.180 
think number two is my favorite and it's
probably<00:04:27.990> just<00:04:28.110> because<00:04:28.440> I<00:04:28.500> did<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.680> guide<00:04:28.919> for

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
probably just because I did a guide for

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.400 
probably just because I did a guide for
it<00:04:29.340> but<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:33.270> was<00:04:33.450> also<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.900> first<00:04:34.020> one<00:04:34.260> that<00:04:34.350> I

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
it but it was also the first one that I

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.010 
it but it was also the first one that I
played<00:04:34.650> so<00:04:34.860> that<00:04:35.010> might<00:04:35.190> also<00:04:35.430> be<00:04:35.610> a<00:04:36.150> reason

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
played so that might also be a reason

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.940 
played so that might also be a reason
why<00:04:37.169> it's<00:04:37.410> my<00:04:37.500> favorite

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950
