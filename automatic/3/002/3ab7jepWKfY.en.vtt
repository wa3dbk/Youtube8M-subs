00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.110
 Hello! 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.409
 My name is Anastasia Kulikova. And today we will do 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:06.500
 silver flower bezel if you are interested then stay 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.260
 with me take two squares of tape 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.289
 5 cm wide and make a sharp petal 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:12.289
 spiral kanzashi 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:35.070
 for this we put one triangle in another 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:51.380
 grab one edge and roll it up 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.149
 we put a drop of glue and glue the straw 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:10.710
 to the other edge of the tape we reduce the two edges of the triangle 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.640
 and get a sharp kanzashi petal 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:47.020
 with a spiral 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:02:37.010
 we collect a flower from 11 such petals 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.160
 now from the silver brocade square 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.040
 5 cm ribbons make sharp petals turned out 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:51.750
 kanzashi make 16 of these petals 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:05.989
 glue the petals on the base of felt 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.540
 with a diameter of 6 cm along the edge 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.500
 make sure the edges of the petals form 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:04:13.810
 even circle of repp tape width 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.130
 4 cm make a sharp petal 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:24.270
 kanzashi total 11 pieces 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.580
 and glue from between the petals with a spiral 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:05:09.949
 i use shamballa bead as middle 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.530
 which I safely broke off from the stud 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.819
 By the way, I often use jewelry with 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.689
 studs for the middle of my colors 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:23.860
 kanzashi glue flower snowflake 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:48.529
 to the rim and here's the result done 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:51.680

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:59.819
