00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
kind of one of the styles that we think

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.740 
kind of one of the styles that we think
of<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.769> these<00:00:26.189> big<00:00:26.519> full-bodied<00:00:27.150> curls<00:00:27.510> and

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
the curling method to get that look

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.750 
the curling method to get that look
because<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.559> already<00:00:34.710> did<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.070> kind<00:00:35.640> of

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
because I already did the kind of

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.190 
because I already did the kind of
top-heavy<00:00:36.090> curls<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.660> now<00:00:36.809> we're<00:00:36.930> gonna<00:00:37.020> do

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
top-heavy curls so now we're gonna do

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.799

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
it's pretty it takes about it takes me

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.440 
it's pretty it takes about it takes me
because<00:00:44.399> everybody<00:00:44.730> asked<00:00:44.969> me<00:00:45.059> last<00:00:45.180> time<00:00:45.360> it

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
because everybody asked me last time it

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.810 
because everybody asked me last time it
takes<00:00:45.600> me<00:00:45.750> about<00:00:45.870> 20<00:00:46.200> minutes<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.700> it

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
takes me about 20 minutes you can do it

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.369 
takes me about 20 minutes you can do it
faster<00:00:48.300> with<00:00:48.570> different<00:00:48.870> hair<00:00:48.960> types<00:00:49.140> it's

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
faster with different hair types it's

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.720 
faster with different hair types it's
just<00:00:49.530> for<00:00:49.680> me<00:00:49.770> that's<00:00:50.070> how<00:00:50.129> long<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.399> took<00:00:50.520> uh

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
just for me that's how long it took uh

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.880 
just for me that's how long it took uh
and<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.480> think<00:00:51.719> that's<00:00:51.930> all<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.440> say<00:00:52.469> so

it like this is going to help us to get
a<00:01:27.470> curl<00:01:27.800> pattern<00:01:28.160> that<00:01:28.370> helps<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:29.230> best<00:01:30.729> follow

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
by the way yeah and then I'm using a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.550 
by the way yeah and then I'm using a
one-inch<00:01:38.090> curling<00:01:38.330> iron<00:01:38.720> you<00:01:39.020> can<00:01:39.140> use<00:01:39.320> an

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
one-inch curling iron you can use an

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.640 
one-inch curling iron you can use an
inch<00:01:40.040> and<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.310> quarter<00:01:40.580> or<00:01:41.530> maybe<00:01:42.530> a

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
inch and a quarter or maybe a

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.750 
inch and a quarter or maybe a
three-quarter<00:01:43.130> inch<00:01:43.340> those<00:01:43.490> would<00:01:43.640> be<00:01:43.729> a

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
three-quarter inch those would be a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.460 
three-quarter inch those would be a
little<00:01:44.030> bit<00:01:44.150> tight<00:01:44.360> an<00:01:44.630> inch<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:44.990> a<00:01:45.020> half<00:01:45.050> all

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
the way up to 2 inches I'd say and then

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.420 
the way up to 2 inches I'd say and then
you're<00:01:47.750> going<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:47.900> curl<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:48.650> wrap<00:01:49.100> it<00:01:49.250> back<00:01:49.369> up

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
you're going to curl and wrap it back up

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.520 
you're going to curl and wrap it back up
and<00:01:49.880> pin<00:01:50.330> in<00:01:50.450> place<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:50.900> help<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.140> curls<00:01:51.410> stay

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
and pin in place to help the curls stay

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.200 
and pin in place to help the curls stay
better<00:01:51.890> and<00:01:52.580> what<00:01:52.760> you're<00:01:52.850> going<00:01:52.970> to<00:01:53.030> do<00:01:53.150> is

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
better and what you're going to do is

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.760 
better and what you're going to do is
you're<00:01:53.330> going<00:01:53.420> to<00:01:53.479> curl<00:01:53.750> that<00:01:53.990> bottom<00:01:54.530> back

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
you're going to curl that bottom back

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.300 
you're going to curl that bottom back
section<00:01:55.280> first

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.100 

and<00:01:59.610> pin<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.330> all<00:02:00.450> up<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.750> then<00:02:00.900> you're<00:02:01.020> going

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
and pin it all up and then you're going

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.100 
and pin it all up and then you're going
to<00:02:01.170> let<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.530> second<00:02:02.220> back<00:02:02.549> section<00:02:03.000> down<00:02:03.180> and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
to let that second back section down and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.810 
to let that second back section down and
you're<00:02:04.619> going<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.770> curl<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.100> normally<00:02:05.729> as

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
you're going to curl that normally as

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.460 
you're going to curl that normally as
well<00:02:06.060> these<00:02:06.330> back<00:02:06.600> ones<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:07.110> be<00:02:07.229> pretty

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
well these back ones you can be pretty

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.900 
well these back ones you can be pretty
rough<00:02:07.680> with<00:02:07.950> them<00:02:08.100> you<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.490> want<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.729> make

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
rough with them you just want to make

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.400 
rough with them you just want to make
sure<00:02:09.030> you're<00:02:09.179> doing<00:02:09.300> like<00:02:09.479> inch<00:02:09.690> sections<00:02:10.229> and

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
sure you're doing like inch sections and

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
sure you're doing like inch sections and
that's<00:02:10.470> really<00:02:10.740> all<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.130> to<00:02:11.250> think

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
that's really all you have to think

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.670 
that's really all you have to think
about<00:02:11.670> they're<00:02:11.970> pretty<00:02:12.930> simple<00:02:13.200> as<00:02:13.410> far<00:02:13.440> as

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
about they're pretty simple as far as

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.260 
about they're pretty simple as far as
that<00:02:13.830> goes<00:02:13.890> then<00:02:14.670> we're<00:02:14.760> going<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:14.940> do<00:02:15.090> these

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
that goes then we're going to do these

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.850 
that goes then we're going to do these
front<00:02:15.660> ones<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.110> these<00:02:16.230> front<00:02:16.530> ones<00:02:16.590> we're

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
front ones so these front ones we're

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.050 
front ones so these front ones we're
actually<00:02:17.010> going<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.310> do<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.550> little<00:02:17.910> bit

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
actually going to do a little bit

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.150 
actually going to do a little bit
differently<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.810> we're<00:02:19.709> actually<00:02:19.830> going<00:02:20.069> to

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
differently and we're actually going to

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.640 
differently and we're actually going to
curl<00:02:20.550> them<00:02:20.819> up<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.569> back<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.290> can<00:02:22.380> kind<00:02:22.590> of

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
curl them up and back so you can kind of

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.620 
curl them up and back so you can kind of
see<00:02:22.800> them<00:02:22.890> lifting<00:02:23.400> up<00:02:23.520> at<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.819> roots<00:02:24.060> that's

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
see them lifting up at the roots that's

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.449 
see them lifting up at the roots that's
going<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.900> create<00:02:25.020> volume<00:02:25.680> right<00:02:25.890> there<00:02:25.920> kind

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
going to create volume right there kind

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.430 
going to create volume right there kind
of<00:02:26.550> create<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:26.970> volume<00:02:27.540> by<00:02:27.840> shape<00:02:28.140> towards

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
of create that volume by shape towards

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.320 
of create that volume by shape towards
the<00:02:28.590> front<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.370> also<00:02:29.400> want<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:29.910> make<00:02:30.090> sure

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
the front you also want to make sure

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.759 
the front you also want to make sure
that<00:02:30.600> when<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.900> wrap<00:02:31.080> back<00:02:31.380> up

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
that when you wrap back up

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.259 
that when you wrap back up
you<00:02:31.920> wrap<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.100> in<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.459> direction<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.030> that

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
you wrap it in that direction so that

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.240 
you wrap it in that direction so that
you<00:02:33.330> can<00:02:33.510> set<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.870> curl<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.350> way<00:02:34.560> it's<00:02:35.100> going

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
you can set the curl that way it's going

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.949 
you can set the curl that way it's going
to<00:02:35.310> create<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.610> lot<00:02:35.790> more<00:02:35.820> volume<00:02:36.390> in<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.660> front

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
to create a lot more volume in the front

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.009 
to create a lot more volume in the front
and<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.350> know<00:02:37.500> adheres<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.700> really<00:02:39.570> curled

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
and you know adheres that really curled

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.580 
and you know adheres that really curled
soft<00:02:40.830> look<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.310> Aria<00:02:41.640> has<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:43.050> you're<00:02:43.500> gonna

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
soft look that Aria has and you're gonna

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.199 
soft look that Aria has and you're gonna
repeat<00:02:43.769> that<00:02:44.010> on<00:02:44.069> the<00:02:44.190> other<00:02:44.310> side<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.970> then

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
repeat that on the other side and then

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.449 
repeat that on the other side and then
we're<00:02:45.390> gonna<00:02:45.480> let<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.900> top<00:02:46.110> down<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.800> I'm

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
we're gonna let the top down and I'm

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.309 
we're gonna let the top down and I'm
gonna<00:02:47.640> look<00:02:47.910> like<00:02:48.060> cousin<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.540> for<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.840> couple

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
gonna look like cousin it for a couple

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.470 
gonna look like cousin it for a couple
seconds<00:02:49.650> here<00:02:49.850> but<00:02:50.850> then<00:02:50.970> you're<00:02:51.090> gonna<00:02:51.239> let

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
seconds here but then you're gonna let

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.970 
seconds here but then you're gonna let
the<00:02:51.690> you're<00:02:52.140> going<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.319> choose<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.500> section<00:02:52.800> at

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
the you're going to choose a section at

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.160 
the you're going to choose a section at
the<00:02:53.069> very<00:02:53.280> back<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:54.120> back<00:02:54.630> section<00:02:55.050> and

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
the very back of that back section and

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.720 
the very back of that back section and
you're<00:02:55.350> going<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.500> curl<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:55.980> away<00:02:56.310> from<00:02:56.580> your

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
you're going to curl it away from your

you're going to curl it away from your
face<00:02:56.910> like<00:02:57.180> I'm<00:02:57.300> doing<00:02:57.569> here<00:02:57.870> keeping<00:02:58.500> that

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
face like I'm doing here keeping that

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.470 
face like I'm doing here keeping that
curling<00:02:58.890> iron<00:02:59.069> really<00:02:59.489> close<00:02:59.880> to<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.269> roots

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
curling iron really close to the roots

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.729 
curling iron really close to the roots
because<00:03:00.660> you're<00:03:00.900> really<00:03:01.140> wanting<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.470> pull

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
because you're really wanting to pull

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.259 
because you're really wanting to pull
those<00:03:01.860> roots<00:03:02.100> up<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.580> back<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:02.910> is<00:03:03.090> where

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
those roots up and back this is where

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.870 
those roots up and back this is where
we're<00:03:03.390> really<00:03:03.720> making<00:03:04.019> that<00:03:04.380> volume<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.130> then

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
we're really making that volume and then

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.250 
we're really making that volume and then
you're<00:03:06.030> going<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.269> wrap<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.690> back<00:03:06.810> up<00:03:07.079> like

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
you're going to wrap it back up like

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.780 
you're going to wrap it back up like
we've<00:03:07.500> done<00:03:07.650> with<00:03:07.799> every<00:03:08.070> other<00:03:08.190> piece<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.489> it

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
we've done with every other piece of it

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.509 
we've done with every other piece of it
and<00:03:10.519> pin<00:03:11.519> it<00:03:11.640> against<00:03:12.000> your<00:03:12.180> head<00:03:13.160> just<00:03:14.160> giving

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
and pin it against your head just giving
