is a really good deal to get this you

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.720 
is a really good deal to get this you

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
know like instead of on the separate

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.480 
know like instead of on the separate
like<00:01:25.910> get<00:01:26.180> a<00:01:26.210> headset<00:01:26.660> separate<00:01:27.320> or<00:01:27.650> you<00:01:28.310> know

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
which is a really good thing I'm not

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.170 
which is a really good thing I'm not
going<00:01:30.980> to<00:01:31.040> align<00:01:31.190> it<00:01:31.430> because<00:01:31.670> if<00:01:31.820> you<00:01:31.940> play

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
going to align it because if you play

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.420 
going to align it because if you play
online<00:01:32.360> wall<00:01:32.840> release<00:01:33.230> your<00:01:33.470> game<00:01:33.650> you<00:01:34.280> know<00:01:34.400> a

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
online wall release your game you know a

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.220 
online wall release your game you know a
headset<00:01:35.000> you<00:01:35.150> can<00:01:35.270> talk<00:01:35.510> to<00:01:35.720> friends<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.140> our

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
headset you can talk to friends and our

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.220 
headset you can talk to friends and our
stuff<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.280> is<00:01:37.400> a<00:01:37.430> good<00:01:37.610> concept<00:01:38.110> for<00:01:39.110> this

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
stuff so it is a good concept for this

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.980 
stuff so it is a good concept for this
also<00:01:40.100> for<00:01:40.910> the<00:01:41.060> ps4<00:01:41.830> for<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:42.920> friend<00:01:43.790> list

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
also for the ps4 for the friend list

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.120 
also for the ps4 for the friend list
basically<00:01:45.490> for<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.580> ps3<00:01:46.940> it's<00:01:47.270> only<00:01:47.450> 100<00:01:48.130> but

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
basically for the ps3 it's only 100 but

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.760 
basically for the ps3 it's only 100 but
for<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.730> ps4<00:01:50.170> their<00:01:51.170> thing<00:01:51.410> I<00:01:51.530> may<00:01:51.710> be

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770
