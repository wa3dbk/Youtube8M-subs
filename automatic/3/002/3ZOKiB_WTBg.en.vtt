fish finder on the new ride 115 X with
the<00:00:19.980> new<00:00:20.340> console<00:00:20.820> but<00:00:21.689> it's<00:00:22.110> so<00:00:22.320> simple<00:00:22.650> I

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:23.329 
the new console but it's so simple I

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
console is to be able to fish finder on

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.840 
console is to be able to fish finder on
here<00:00:37.290> with<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.530> transducer<00:00:38.220> drop<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
here with the transducer drop the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.640 
here with the transducer drop the
transducer<00:00:39.420> down<00:00:39.570> into<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> hole<00:00:40.110> into<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
transducer down into the hole into the
