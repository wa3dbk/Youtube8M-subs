what the idea is trying to get across
a<00:02:06.920> lot<00:02:07.550> of<00:02:07.580> times<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:07.970> direction<00:02:08.240> just<00:02:08.900> gets

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
a lot of times the direction just gets

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.719 
a lot of times the direction just gets
narrowed<00:02:09.590> down<00:02:09.620> to<00:02:09.800> can<00:02:10.370> you<00:02:10.430> just<00:02:10.580> make<00:02:10.700> it

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
narrowed down to can you just make it

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.600 
then the brute chieftains have very
elaborate<00:05:19.780> headdresses<00:05:20.530> and<00:05:20.710> very<00:05:21.130> elaborate

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
elaborate headdresses and very elaborate

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.630 
elaborate headdresses and very elaborate
shoulder<00:05:22.120> pads<00:05:22.330> and<00:05:22.660> armor<00:05:23.020> on<00:05:23.170> them<00:05:23.350> well<00:05:23.890> the

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
shoulder pads and armor on them well the

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.740 
shoulder pads and armor on them well the
interesting<00:05:24.880> thing<00:05:25.210> with<00:05:25.360> some<00:05:25.510> of<00:05:25.600> the<00:05:25.660> ideas

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
interesting thing with some of the ideas

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.740 
interesting thing with some of the ideas
that<00:05:25.990> we<00:05:26.260> came<00:05:26.410> up<00:05:26.470> with<00:05:26.770> is<00:05:27.270> not<00:05:28.270> only<00:05:28.540> do<00:05:28.660> we

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
that we came up with is not only do we

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.030 
that we came up with is not only do we
need<00:05:28.870> to<00:05:28.960> figure<00:05:29.110> out<00:05:29.230> how<00:05:29.320> the<00:05:29.440> Brutes

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
need to figure out how the Brutes

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.190 
need to figure out how the Brutes
interact<00:05:30.670> with<00:05:30.820> the<00:05:30.940> other<00:05:31.030> covenant<00:05:31.600> but

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
interact with the other covenant but

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.170 
interact with the other covenant but
also<00:05:32.320> how<00:05:32.560> brutes<00:05:32.830> interact<00:05:33.280> with<00:05:33.490> fruits<00:05:33.880> and

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
also how brutes interact with fruits and

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.119 
also how brutes interact with fruits and
we<00:05:34.930> developed<00:05:35.320> the<00:05:35.380> idea<00:05:35.410> of<00:05:35.740> the<00:05:35.770> brute<00:05:36.100> pack

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:38.129 
we developed the idea of the brute pack

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.249 
we developed the idea of the brute pack
what<00:05:39.089> makes<00:05:39.239> it<00:05:39.330> feel<00:05:39.509> like<00:05:39.539> two<00:05:39.869> characters

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 
what makes it feel like two characters

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:41.899 
what makes it feel like two characters
are<00:05:40.379> aware<00:05:40.559> of<00:05:40.619> each<00:05:40.770> other<00:05:40.979> deciding<00:05:41.610> to<00:05:41.759> do

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
are aware of each other deciding to do

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.510 
are aware of each other deciding to do
the<00:05:42.029> same<00:05:42.239> thing<00:05:42.539> at<00:05:42.629> the<00:05:42.689> same<00:05:42.749> time<00:05:43.520> maybe

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
the same thing at the same time maybe

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.010 
the same thing at the same time maybe
you're<00:05:44.759> kind<00:05:44.969> of<00:05:45.059> come<00:05:45.179> around<00:05:45.389> a<00:05:45.509> corner<00:05:45.539> and

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
you're kind of come around a corner and

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.509 
you're kind of come around a corner and
see<00:05:46.199> them<00:05:46.379> doing<00:05:46.679> some<00:05:46.949> sort<00:05:47.129> of<00:05:47.159> an<00:05:47.279> activity

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:47.519 
see them doing some sort of an activity

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:49.519 
see them doing some sort of an activity
that<00:05:47.729> that<00:05:48.629> has<00:05:48.869> nothing<00:05:49.019> to<00:05:49.199> do<00:05:49.379> with

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:49.529 
that that has nothing to do with

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:50.719 
that that has nothing to do with
fighting<00:05:49.739> but<00:05:49.979> it's<00:05:50.129> going<00:05:50.219> to<00:05:50.279> give<00:05:50.429> you<00:05:50.550> sort

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
fighting but it's going to give you sort

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.969 
fighting but it's going to give you sort
of<00:05:50.819> more<00:05:50.999> insight<00:05:51.449> into<00:05:51.869> what<00:05:52.080> the<00:05:52.349> brute<00:05:52.619> pack

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
of more insight into what the brute pack

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.749 
of more insight into what the brute pack
mentality<00:05:53.249> is<00:05:53.789> like<00:05:55.009> we<00:05:56.009> have<00:05:56.159> this<00:05:56.309> really

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 
mentality is like we have this really

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:59.479 
mentality is like we have this really
brutal<00:05:57.239> behavior<00:05:57.389> now<00:05:57.839> which<00:05:58.080> is<00:05:58.110> just<00:05:58.559> the

00:05:59.479 --> 00:05:59.489 
brutal behavior now which is just the

00:05:59.489 --> 00:06:01.129 
brutal behavior now which is just the
chieftain<00:05:59.879> saying<00:06:00.149> everybody<00:06:00.899> throw<00:06:01.080> a

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
chieftain saying everybody throw a

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.379 
chieftain saying everybody throw a

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
grenade and as a result a second later

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.309 
grenade and as a result a second later
you<00:06:03.689> have<00:06:03.869> grenades<00:06:04.319> flying<00:06:04.709> at<00:06:04.860> your<00:06:04.949> face

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:08.399 
that's always going to give the player a

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:09.949 
that's always going to give the player a
