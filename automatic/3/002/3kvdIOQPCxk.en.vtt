hey guys what's going on it's been a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.560 
hey guys what's going on it's been a
while<00:00:11.040> it's<00:00:13.610> been<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.730> quite<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.089> long<00:00:15.330> while

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
think like five months since i sat down

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.310 
think like five months since i sat down
here<00:00:18.810> with<00:00:18.990> my<00:00:19.140> mic<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.740> recorded<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.430> video

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
here with my mic and recorded the video

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.259 
here with my mic and recorded the video
but<00:00:22.320> here<00:00:23.010> i<00:00:23.039> am<00:00:23.189> with<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.519> video<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:26.240> yeah<00:00:27.240> I

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
but here i am with the video and yeah I

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.849 
but here i am with the video and yeah I
just<00:00:28.340> just<00:00:29.340> billow<00:00:29.580> something<00:00:30.560> to<00:00:31.560> have<00:00:31.740> in

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
just just billow something to have in

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.150 
just just billow something to have in
this<00:00:31.949> video<00:00:32.279> i<00:00:33.200> just<00:00:34.200> sat<00:00:34.590> down<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.950> played

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
this video i just sat down and played

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.740 
this video i just sat down and played
around<00:00:35.370> with<00:00:35.579> redstone<00:00:36.000> when<00:00:36.210> i<00:00:36.270> came<00:00:36.450> up<00:00:36.570> with

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
around with redstone when i came up with

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.540 
around with redstone when i came up with
this<00:00:36.870> little<00:00:37.290> i<00:00:37.620> guess<00:00:40.190> this<00:00:41.190> combination

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
this little i guess this combination

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.549 
this little i guess this combination
lock<00:00:42.420> system<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.469> door<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:45.110> it's<00:00:46.110> inspired

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
lock system for a door and it's inspired

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.819 
lock system for a door and it's inspired
by<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> pin<00:00:47.550> tumbler<00:00:47.879> lock<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.660> know<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.590> ones

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
by a pin tumbler lock you know the ones

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.290 
by a pin tumbler lock you know the ones
you<00:00:50.160> opened<00:00:50.399> with<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> key<00:00:50.610> like<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:52.170> your<00:00:52.289> house

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
you opened with a key like to your house

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.049 
you opened with a key like to your house
i<00:00:54.300> think<00:00:54.989> i<00:00:55.140> have<00:00:55.170> seen<00:00:55.590> my<00:00:55.829> video<00:00:58.100> that<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.219> has

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
i think i have seen my video that it has

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.720 
i think i have seen my video that it has
the<00:01:00.090> same<00:01:00.480> concept<00:01:01.050> as<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.710> think<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.609> was

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the same concept as this I think it was

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.460 
the same concept as this I think it was
sethbling<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.359> made<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.690> I'll<00:01:04.049> link<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.379> in

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
sethbling that made it I'll link it in

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.730 
sethbling that made it I'll link it in
the<00:01:04.530> description<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> look<00:01:05.309> at<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:06.740> yeah

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
the description have a look at it yeah

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.929 
the description have a look at it yeah
so<00:01:08.070> that's<00:01:08.280> what<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.880> inspired<00:01:09.450> from<00:01:10.939> but

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
so that's what this is inspired from but

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.990 
so that's what this is inspired from but
it's<00:01:12.090> kind<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.659> different<00:01:13.340> so<00:01:14.340> basically<00:01:14.700> you

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
it's kind of different so basically you

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.170 
it's kind of different so basically you
probably<00:01:15.330> understand<00:01:15.930> our<00:01:16.350> pin<00:01:16.790> tumbler<00:01:17.790> lock

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
probably understand our pin tumbler lock

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.050 
probably understand our pin tumbler lock
works<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.810> basically<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:20.310> bunch<00:01:20.939> of

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
works it's basically just a bunch of

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.039 
works it's basically just a bunch of
pins<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.630> depending<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.170> which<00:01:24.049> position

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
pins and depending on which position

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.630 
pins and depending on which position
they're<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:27.360> lock<00:01:27.509> with<00:01:27.689> either<00:01:27.810> open<00:01:28.320> or

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
they're in the lock with either open or

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.770 
they're in the lock with either open or
not<00:01:29.640> open<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:31.159> here<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.340> will<00:01:32.909> use<00:01:33.240> sand<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
not open so here we will use sand to

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.649 
not open so here we will use sand to
represent<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.439> pins<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:36.180> height<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
represent the pins the height of the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.990 
represent the pins the height of the
pins<00:01:36.900> i<00:01:37.140> will<00:01:37.320> say<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.920> we<00:01:38.040> will<00:01:38.189> build<00:01:38.490> our<00:01:38.700> key

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
pins i will say so we will build our key

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.719 
pins i will say so we will build our key
and<00:01:39.470> we<00:01:40.470> will<00:01:40.590> send<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.920> into<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.280> system<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
and we will send it into the system and

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.100 
and we will send it into the system and
if<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.380> right<00:01:43.409> key<00:01:44.600> this<00:01:45.600> door<00:01:45.840> over

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
if it is the right key this door over

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.350 
if it is the right key this door over
here<00:01:46.140> here<00:01:46.890> will<00:01:46.979> open<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:49.880> in<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.149> end<00:01:51.240> i'll

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
here here will open and in the end i'll

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.840 
here here will open and in the end i'll
show<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.780> redstone<00:01:52.170> i'm<00:01:52.560> sure<00:01:52.799> i<00:01:53.159> could

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
show you the redstone i'm sure i could

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.240 
show you the redstone i'm sure i could
make<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.360> way<00:01:54.810> more<00:01:55.049> compact<00:01:55.500> but<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.040> gotta

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
make this way more compact but you gotta

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.950 
make this way more compact but you gotta
keep<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.670> mind<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.420> been<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> while

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
keep in mind that it's been a while

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.670 
keep in mind that it's been a while
since<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.590> did<00:01:58.860> all<00:01:59.729> this<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.390> well<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.530> quote

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
since I did all this and well to quote

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.510 
since I did all this and well to quote
mumbo<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:03.149> an<00:02:03.329> elephant<00:02:04.159> ok<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.219> I'm<00:02:05.399> going

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
mumbo it's an elephant ok so I'm going

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.830 
mumbo it's an elephant ok so I'm going
to<00:02:05.610> show<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.759> how<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.030> works

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
to show you how it works

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.510 
to show you how it works
you<00:02:08.840> put<00:02:09.050> your<00:02:09.170> sanding<00:02:09.709> right<00:02:09.979> here<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.429> I've

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
you put your sanding right here and I've

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.229 
you put your sanding right here and I've
set<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:11.060> combination<00:02:11.810> for<00:02:11.840> this<00:02:12.849> which<00:02:13.849> look

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
set the combination for this which look

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.900 
set the combination for this which look
like<00:02:14.270> looks<00:02:15.020> like<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:18.130> so<00:02:19.130> this<00:02:19.250> is<00:02:19.280> my<00:02:19.489> combo

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
like looks like this so this is my combo

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.100 
like looks like this so this is my combo
is<00:02:20.030> mikey<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.780> we'll<00:02:21.770> try<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.040> combination

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
is mikey and we'll try the combination

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:31.500 
is mikey and we'll try the combination
and<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.230> send<00:02:24.500> down<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:25.069> analyze<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:27.250> and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.360 

show<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.569> that<00:02:32.959> it<00:02:33.530> won't<00:02:33.709> work<00:02:33.950> with<00:02:34.160> another

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
show you that it won't work with another

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:46.090 
show you that it won't work with another
combo<00:02:34.819> I'll<00:02:35.030> just<00:02:35.980> do<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.010> random<00:02:37.459> one<00:02:42.160> try<00:02:45.100> and

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
combo I'll just do a random one try and

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.000 
combo I'll just do a random one try and
sundown<00:02:46.880> analyze<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:47.989> it<00:02:48.290> won't<00:02:48.470> work<00:02:49.480> and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
sundown analyze it and it won't work and

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.150 
sundown analyze it and it won't work and
so<00:02:52.010> that's<00:02:52.130> basically<00:02:52.940> kind<00:02:53.720> of<00:02:53.870> simple<00:02:54.319> for

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
so that's basically kind of simple for

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.289 
so that's basically kind of simple for
some<00:02:55.310> people<00:02:55.670> I<00:02:55.849> guess<00:02:57.220> you've<00:02:58.220> no<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.970> bit<00:02:59.209> of

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
some people I guess you've no a bit of

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.000 
some people I guess you've no a bit of
redstone<00:02:59.599> that<00:02:59.870> it's<00:03:00.019> not<00:03:00.200> so<00:03:00.440> hard<00:03:00.709> actually

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
redstone that it's not so hard actually

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.199 
redstone that it's not so hard actually
to<00:03:01.250> analyze<00:03:01.819> some<00:03:02.090> sand<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:03.730> see<00:03:04.730> what<00:03:04.970> code

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
to analyze some sand and see what code

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.990 
to analyze some sand and see what code
it<00:03:05.390> is<00:03:05.590> but<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.830> cool<00:03:07.040> thing<00:03:07.069> that<00:03:07.670> I<00:03:07.760> made

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
it is but the cool thing that I made

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.539 
it is but the cool thing that I made
here<00:03:08.540> is<00:03:08.950> that<00:03:09.950> I<00:03:10.250> have<00:03:10.609> made<00:03:10.820> so<00:03:11.209> you<00:03:11.269> can

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
here is that I have made so you can

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.500 
here is that I have made so you can
provide<00:03:13.549> open<00:03:13.970> just<00:03:14.420> real<00:03:14.600> fine<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:16.480> made<00:03:17.480> it

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
provide open just real fine I made it

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.539 
provide open just real fine I made it
you<00:03:18.500> can<00:03:19.570> make<00:03:20.570> a<00:03:20.600> new<00:03:20.810> combination<00:03:21.250> by<00:03:22.250> just

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
you can make a new combination by just

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.729 
you can make a new combination by just
placing<00:03:22.850> sand<00:03:23.359> over<00:03:23.600> here<00:03:23.810> by<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.470> way<00:03:24.590> this

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
placing sand over here by the way this

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.250 
placing sand over here by the way this
is<00:03:24.890> mumbles<00:03:25.340> door<00:03:25.670> mumbles<00:03:26.630> three<00:03:26.870> by<00:03:27.019> three

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
is mumbles door mumbles three by three

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.250 
is mumbles door mumbles three by three
ball<00:03:27.799> tour<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.130> think<00:03:28.540> link<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:29.690> is<00:03:29.959> also

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
ball tour I think link to that is also

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.410 
ball tour I think link to that is also
in<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.380> description<00:03:30.519> but<00:03:31.519> if<00:03:31.910> I<00:03:32.030> want<00:03:32.209> to<00:03:32.239> make

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
in the description but if I want to make

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.740 
in the description but if I want to make
a<00:03:32.450> new<00:03:32.660> combination<00:03:33.760> let's<00:03:34.760> say<00:03:35.000> two<00:03:35.799> three

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
a new combination let's say two three

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:45.129 
a new combination let's say two three
four<00:03:38.950> let's<00:03:39.950> be<00:03:40.100> creative<00:03:40.450> 5<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:42.340> 1<00:03:43.359> 2<00:03:44.359> 3<00:03:44.389> 4<00:03:44.750> 5<00:03:44.959> 1

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
four let's be creative 5 and 1 2 3 4 5 1

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:49.509 
four let's be creative 5 and 1 2 3 4 5 1
i'll<00:03:45.950> press<00:03:46.940> new<00:03:47.329> combination<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:49.040> door<00:03:49.310> will

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
i'll press new combination the door will

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:58.479 
i'll press new combination the door will
lag<00:03:50.000> up<00:03:50.209> a<00:03:50.329> bit<00:03:51.850> that<00:03:52.850> is<00:03:52.940> fine

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.050 

okay<00:03:59.659> there<00:04:00.659> we<00:04:00.690> go<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.580> now<00:04:02.580> we'll<00:04:02.700> try<00:04:02.879> out

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
okay there we go and now we'll try out

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.869 
okay there we go and now we'll try out
the<00:04:03.209> new<00:04:03.239> combination<00:04:04.340> so<00:04:05.340> two<00:04:05.930> three<00:04:07.879> four

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
the new combination so two three four

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:16.939 
the new combination so two three four
five<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:11.480> one<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:13.230> we'll<00:04:13.470> try<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:15.650> our<00:04:16.650> new

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
five and one and we'll try it our new

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:23.390 
five and one and we'll try it our new
key<00:04:17.269> it<00:04:18.269> sent<00:04:18.540> down<00:04:19.280> ah<00:04:20.299> sweet<00:04:22.250> so<00:04:23.250> that's

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
key it sent down ah sweet so that's

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.020 
key it sent down ah sweet so that's
pretty<00:04:23.580> cool<00:04:23.729> um<00:04:25.490> kind<00:04:26.490> of<00:04:26.550> a<00:04:26.639> simple<00:04:27.169> simple

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
pretty cool um kind of a simple simple

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.730 
pretty cool um kind of a simple simple
idea<00:04:30.030> simple<00:04:30.690> thing<00:04:30.900> it's<00:04:31.050> nothing<00:04:31.320> too<00:04:31.500> fancy

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
idea simple thing it's nothing too fancy

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.840 
idea simple thing it's nothing too fancy
guys<00:04:32.100> I<00:04:32.130> know<00:04:32.490> but<00:04:32.729> I<00:04:33.030> needed<00:04:33.300> something<00:04:33.900> a

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
guys I know but I needed something a

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
guys I know but I needed something a
little<00:04:35.850> nice<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.360> show<00:04:36.570> you<00:04:38.780> so<00:04:39.780> yeah

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
little nice to show you so yeah

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.219 
little nice to show you so yeah
hopefully<00:04:40.139> you<00:04:40.590> liked<00:04:40.830> it<00:04:41.010> i<00:04:41.360> won't<00:04:42.360> go<00:04:42.840> into

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
hopefully you liked it i won't go into

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.010 
hopefully you liked it i won't go into
too<00:04:43.530> much<00:04:43.680> detail<00:04:43.919> in<00:04:44.490> how<00:04:44.639> this<00:04:44.789> works<00:04:45.120> but

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
too much detail in how this works but

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.620 
too much detail in how this works but
what<00:04:46.500> i<00:04:46.530> would<00:04:46.710> do<00:04:46.889> is<00:04:47.130> show<00:04:47.490> you<00:04:47.630> redstone

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
what i would do is show you redstone

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.129 
what i would do is show you redstone
behind<00:04:48.870> it<00:04:49.550> so<00:04:50.550> this<00:04:50.699> is<00:04:50.850> it<00:04:51.000> it's<00:04:51.330> pretty<00:04:51.780> huge

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
behind it so this is it it's pretty huge

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:58.400 
behind it so this is it it's pretty huge
I<00:04:52.580> guess<00:04:53.930> it's<00:04:54.930> just<00:04:55.050> a<00:04:55.949> bunch<00:04:56.340> of<00:04:56.610> and<00:04:57.410> gates

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
I guess it's just a bunch of and gates

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.790 
I guess it's just a bunch of and gates
xor<00:04:58.860> gate<00:04:58.889> you<00:04:59.490> know<00:04:59.690> that<00:05:00.690> deal<00:05:00.960> much<00:05:01.289> delays

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
xor gate you know that deal much delays

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.900 
xor gate you know that deal much delays
and<00:05:02.190> yeah<00:05:02.840> nothing<00:05:03.840> too<00:05:04.050> fancy<00:05:04.320> but<00:05:04.880> yeah<00:05:05.880> I

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
and yeah nothing too fancy but yeah I

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.990 
and yeah nothing too fancy but yeah I
like<00:05:06.210> this<00:05:06.240> this<00:05:06.900> concept<00:05:07.500> of<00:05:07.740> a<00:05:08.310> code<00:05:08.760> lock

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
like this this concept of a code lock

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.890 
like this this concept of a code lock
and<00:05:09.830> I<00:05:10.830> know<00:05:10.889> the<00:05:11.400> concept<00:05:11.849> is<00:05:12.000> pretty<00:05:12.090> old<00:05:12.479> and

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
and I know the concept is pretty old and

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.129 
and I know the concept is pretty old and
it's<00:05:13.500> been<00:05:13.680> done<00:05:13.860> before<00:05:13.889> but<00:05:14.750> the<00:05:15.750> new<00:05:15.900> thing

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
it's been done before but the new thing

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:17.330 
it's been done before but the new thing
that<00:05:16.169> I<00:05:16.349> implement<00:05:16.680> that<00:05:16.770> you<00:05:16.919> can<00:05:17.070> actually

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
that I implement that you can actually

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.870 
that I implement that you can actually
change<00:05:17.820> your<00:05:18.180> combo<00:05:19.400> directly<00:05:20.400> from<00:05:20.580> where

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
change your combo directly from where

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.040 
change your combo directly from where
you<00:05:21.030> put<00:05:21.240> in<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.419> side<00:05:21.570> I<00:05:21.599> think<00:05:21.750> that's

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
you put in the side I think that's

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.990 
you put in the side I think that's
pretty<00:05:22.200> cool<00:05:22.410> I<00:05:22.680> don't<00:05:23.370> know<00:05:23.460> what<00:05:23.610> you<00:05:23.729> think

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
pretty cool I don't know what you think

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.949 
pretty cool I don't know what you think
but<00:05:25.130> but<00:05:26.130> yeah<00:05:26.960> the<00:05:27.960> download<00:05:28.380> link<00:05:28.620> will<00:05:28.800> be
