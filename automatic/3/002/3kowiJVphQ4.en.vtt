00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.070
 what's up with everyone talking to them 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.379
 marcano MÃ¨diques and you will see next mark 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.900
 what is that about I am god challenge willy flex and 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.300
 when building good well probably or 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.820
 surely more than anything they will already know 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:27.070
 what this challenge is basically 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:29.140
 kill five draw 5200 enemies of 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.390
 training that is they are pure bots all 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.670
 I'm killing them, they're not enemies 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.670
 of reals are only the 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.510
 computers to the bots and it's good to kill 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.780
 to the 200 enemies in less than 5 minutes 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.829
 or in 5 minutes and good at the end foresees 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.620
 killed 202 pains and cover the 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.109
 requirement to kill 200 and well then I 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.199
 towards the beginning I started to play 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.370
 well that can also be and good 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.379
 I say how difficult it can be 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.629
 because he had already tried this 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.360
 challenge in the target is one is indeed what 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.860
 I went up as the special when I had 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.830
 when you arrive you find them 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.170
 subscribers I raised this challenge in white 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.450
 only has 300 enemies in 10 minutes 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.469
 this was easier than right now 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:20.110
 and almost nobody but that is simple and the 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:23.140
 I was really disappointed that God did not 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.149
 they saw so many but let's say it cost me 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.560
 very much work this challenge that of the 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:31.140
 cooking and it also cost me quite 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.140
 work east of the black ops 2 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.659
 the challenge is basically to kill 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.780
 the 200 but I forgot to tell you that 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.789
 is between two people and good between as 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.280
 they can see filling themselves only against 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.860
 new the wta is much much more difficult 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.229
 than playing with someone who supports you like that 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.009
 that I can right now I put the 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:55.270
 Hunger the dogs and the low service itself 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:58.479
 of secondary weapon of year 94 with the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.489
 charger but it is not true that 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.890
 we want fast he reminded us of his name and 

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:06.030
 with the handle to give it a little 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.590
 greater precision so one then I 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.390
 many here several games I had to 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.549
 recover this game from the mode without the 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.579
 true because she opened me up 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.049
 record and that this month did not have the 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.940
 gameplay that I wanted and good too 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.670
 because the torture of the capturing 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.590
 good 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.020
 rather, right now he's giving his 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.060
 cans and sometimes record activates once 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.770
 recognizes videos and sometimes not so 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.840
 well I had to recover this game 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.950
 from the cinema mode and then I tell you 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.660
 you have a great time here killing the 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.630
 bots that even though it is in the 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.989
 easier difficulty in recruiting then 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.200
 sometimes they are half let's say lucky for 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.569
 Do not say another word and they kill you 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.060
 when you least expect it, they kill you with 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.250
 Ketchup with a shotgun then they give it to you 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.739
 pulling your streaks 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.780
 for example the python is not true the 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.560
 virus that melting in luck what 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.060
 like you can download it 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.150
 specialist compose the vip and ask that 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.250
 are pointing the bots and posts 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.610
 of assets I already tell you cities you the 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.260
 You spend quite a lot, very relaxed 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.239
 quite comfortable here I feel a 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.459
 total massacre I think later 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.019
 they even give me the killer streak 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.090
 nuclear with a killer peek 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.920
 nuclear because they are waiting for me and 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.380
 what material they found from and from another side 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.280
 and good at the end I get that I do not have 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.680
 not even once 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.160
 I think that this challenge also destroyed 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.080
 stacks like the first one of the medal 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.660
 of nuclear killer you listen to me 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.630
 basically the player is not nervous 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.610
 because they are one hundred and eighty-something and 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.640
 well I had to that previous guards 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.180
 level that 2 185 182 and here comes the 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.519
 ugly moment is very nervous and already 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.840
 I was taxiing at the end of the game 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.170
 how can you see that he did not kill him in 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.819
 mislazos tales said 11 please 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.040
 that more 200 have been killed and 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.830
 effectively 202 as well as the guys 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.140
 I hope you liked it and that you give it 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.630
 like subscribe and well then I with 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:11.670
