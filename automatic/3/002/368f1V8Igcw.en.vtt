the next one we're going to get into is

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.910 
the next one we're going to get into is
process<00:00:51.120> C<00:00:51.329> key<00:00:51.660> which<00:00:51.989> will<00:00:52.199> automatically

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
process C key which will automatically

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.650 
process C key which will automatically
build<00:00:53.219> everything<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.910> your<00:00:54.030> building<00:00:54.420> queue

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
build everything in your building queue

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.020 
build everything in your building queue
to<00:00:55.230> do<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.590> due<00:00:55.860> process<00:00:57.320> underscore<00:00:58.670> C<00:00:59.670> Q

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
to do this due process underscore C Q

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.779 
to do this due process underscore C Q
and<00:01:00.300> then<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.690> city<00:01:00.960> name<00:01:01.230> right<00:01:01.440> after<00:01:01.890> now<00:01:02.760> I

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
and then the city name right after now I

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.329 
and then the city name right after now I
know<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.449> some<00:01:03.809> barbarian<00:01:04.530> villages<00:01:05.070> don't

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
know that some barbarian villages don't

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.810 
know that some barbarian villages don't
work<00:01:05.549> like<00:01:06.390> something<00:01:07.049> like<00:01:07.229> trivets<00:01:07.890> sack<00:01:08.580> I

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
work like something like trivets sack I

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.149 
work like something like trivets sack I
so<00:01:09.540> what<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.229> do<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.680> put<00:01:11.070> an

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
so what you have to do is put an

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.370 
so what you have to do is put an
underscore<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.210> maybe<00:01:13.200> some<00:01:15.380> quotation

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
underscore and maybe some quotation

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.940 
underscore and maybe some quotation
marks<00:01:16.650> around<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.189> then<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.460> will<00:01:17.549> work<00:01:18.950> so

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
marks around it and then it will work so

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.390 
marks around it and then it will work so
keep<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.580> doing<00:01:20.909> that

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.520 

okay<00:01:25.100> now<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.160> next<00:01:27.020> cheat<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.050> we're<00:01:28.380> going

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
okay now the next cheat that we're going

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.160 
okay now the next cheat that we're going
to<00:01:28.590> go<00:01:28.740> into<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.910> Tuggle<00:01:30.420> fog<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.140> war

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
and you can activate this by going to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.470 
and you can activate this by going to
the<00:01:36.540> roam<00:01:36.720> shell<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.290> tucking<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.890> Tuggle

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480

everything in the campaign map now we're

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.320 
everything in the campaign map now we're
going<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.660> some<00:01:48.660> coordinates<00:01:49.470> cheat<00:01:50.000> now<00:01:51.000> just

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
going to some coordinates cheat now just

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.120 
going to some coordinates cheat now just
point<00:01:51.720> your<00:01:51.870> cursor<00:01:52.140> somewhere<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.920> map

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
point your cursor somewhere in the map

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.030 
point your cursor somewhere in the map
this<00:01:53.430> won't<00:01:53.700> work<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:53.940> C<00:01:54.540> or<00:01:54.900> like<00:01:55.680> really

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
this won't work for C or like really

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.390 
this won't work for C or like really
DeForest<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.450> type<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:57.990> show<00:01:58.530> underscore

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
DeForest so type in show underscore

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.870 
DeForest so type in show underscore
cursor<00:02:00.300> staff<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:02.100> will<00:02:02.250> give<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
cursor staff and it will give you the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.670 
cursor staff and it will give you the
position<00:02:03.030> coordinates<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.740> map<00:02:04.980> so<00:02:06.680> this

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
position coordinates of the map so this

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.280 
position coordinates of the map so this
for<00:02:08.460> this<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.790> work<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.540> use<00:02:10.050> the

for this to work you have to use the

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.650 
for this to work you have to use the
Move<00:02:10.500> character<00:02:11.010> cheat<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:12.180> do<00:02:12.360> move
