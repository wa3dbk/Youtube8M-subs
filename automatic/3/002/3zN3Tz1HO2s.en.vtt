and<00:00:21.050> like<00:00:21.650> the<00:00:21.739> thing<00:00:21.919> I<00:00:22.009> struggle<00:00:22.339> with<00:00:22.369> the

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
and like the thing I struggle with the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:23.739 
and like the thing I struggle with the
most<00:00:22.730> when<00:00:22.939> I<00:00:22.970> do<00:00:23.089> score<00:00:23.390> build<00:00:23.570> is<00:00:23.689> the

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:23.749 
most when I do score build is the

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:25.599 
most when I do score build is the
scoring<00:00:24.140> nice<00:00:24.289> goals<00:00:24.619> getting<00:00:25.099> clips<00:00:25.429> at<00:00:25.579> the

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
scoring nice goals getting clips at the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.040 
scoring nice goals getting clips at the
end<00:00:25.759> because<00:00:25.849> I<00:00:25.999> really<00:00:26.419> am<00:00:26.449> NOT<00:00:26.689> the<00:00:26.779> best<00:00:26.900> at

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
end because I really am NOT the best at

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.809 
end because I really am NOT the best at
skilling<00:00:27.380> and<00:00:27.529> I<00:00:27.890> often<00:00:28.130> find<00:00:28.279> myself<00:00:28.369> just

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:28.819 
skilling and I often find myself just

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:30.370 
skilling and I often find myself just
having<00:00:29.060> to<00:00:29.119> like<00:00:29.269> edit<00:00:29.689> in<00:00:29.960> some<00:00:30.169> pretty

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
having to like edit in some pretty

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.409 
having to like edit in some pretty
medium<00:00:30.800> goals<00:00:31.189> and<00:00:31.429> I<00:00:31.759> really<00:00:32.119> think<00:00:32.239> it's

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
medium goals and I really think it's

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.330
