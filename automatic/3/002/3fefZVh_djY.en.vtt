the second string and the third fret of
the<00:02:28.190> first<00:02:28.519> string<00:02:28.579> so<00:02:28.880> we<00:02:28.910> got<00:02:29.060> this<00:02:32.200> kind<00:02:33.200> of

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
the first string so we got this kind of

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.750 
the first string so we got this kind of
pattern<00:02:33.590> again<00:02:33.769> by<00:02:33.890> itself<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.310> doesn't<00:02:34.340> sound

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
pattern again by itself it doesn't sound

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.940 
pattern again by itself it doesn't sound
too<00:02:35.000> good<00:02:35.180> but<00:02:35.360> as<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.930> add<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.350> open<00:02:36.680> strings

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
too good but as I add the open strings

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:44.250 
too good but as I add the open strings
in<00:02:37.130> between<00:02:37.400> like<00:02:37.609> I<00:02:37.670> showed<00:02:37.819> you<00:02:37.910> before

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.170 

sounds<00:02:45.260> really<00:02:45.620> really<00:02:45.739> good<00:02:46.069> now<00:02:46.970> if<00:02:47.090> you

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
sounds really really good now if you

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.340 
sounds really really good now if you
notice<00:02:47.420> I'm<00:02:47.510> using<00:02:47.569> my<00:02:47.840> one<00:02:48.019> of<00:02:48.079> my<00:02:48.200> two

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
notice I'm using my one of my two

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.800 
notice I'm using my one of my two
fingers<00:02:48.739> you<00:02:49.130> really<00:02:49.880> can<00:02:50.090> use<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.359> one<00:02:50.690> in

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
fingers you really can use the one in

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.949 
fingers you really can use the one in
the<00:02:50.870> two<00:02:51.079> or<00:02:51.319> the<00:02:51.730> two<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:52.940> three<00:02:53.090> fingers

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.660 

it<00:02:59.959> really<00:03:00.319> depends<00:03:00.799> on<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.130> song<00:03:01.400> you're

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
it really depends on the song you're

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.670 
it really depends on the song you're
playing<00:03:01.700> if<00:03:02.239> you're<00:03:02.690> using<00:03:02.870> this<00:03:03.109> as<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.319> solo

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
playing if you're using this as a solo

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.160 
playing if you're using this as a solo
of<00:03:03.859> using<00:03:04.280> it<00:03:04.340> as<00:03:04.459> a<00:03:04.489> phil'<00:03:04.880> what<00:03:05.569> chords<00:03:06.049> I'm

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
of using it as a phil' what chords I'm

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.900 
of using it as a phil' what chords I'm
playing<00:03:06.440> it<00:03:06.620> over<00:03:06.739> a<00:03:07.069> lot<00:03:07.519> of<00:03:07.670> different

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
playing it over a lot of different

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.879 
playing it over a lot of different
factors<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:08.480> I'll<00:03:08.780> probably<00:03:09.139> practice<00:03:09.709> with

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
factors so I'll probably practice with

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.240 
factors so I'll probably practice with
both<00:03:10.130> fingers<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:11.750> one<00:03:11.989> in<00:03:12.109> the<00:03:12.200> two<00:03:12.440> and<00:03:12.769> also

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
both fingers the one in the two and also

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.550 
both fingers the one in the two and also
using<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:14.120> with<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.239> tune<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.690> three<00:03:14.900> just<00:03:15.440> to

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
using it with the tune the three just to

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.410 
using it with the tune the three just to
get<00:03:15.680> used<00:03:15.889> to<00:03:16.069> either<00:03:16.280> one<00:03:16.639> in<00:03:16.790> case<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.150> need

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
get used to either one in case you need

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.390 
get used to either one in case you need
one<00:03:18.109> or<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.319> other<00:03:18.470> for<00:03:18.560> a<00:03:18.709> particular<00:03:19.160> song

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
one or the other for a particular song

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.190 
one or the other for a particular song
so<00:03:20.090> again<00:03:20.329> what<00:03:20.540> I<00:03:20.569> want<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:20.989> practice

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
so again what I want you to practice

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.280 
so again what I want you to practice
this<00:03:21.470> time<00:03:21.889> again<00:03:22.609> is<00:03:22.790> going<00:03:23.359> up<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:24.109> scale

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
this time again is going up the scale

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.470 
this time again is going up the scale
starting<00:03:24.920> from<00:03:25.069> the<00:03:25.190> lowest<00:03:25.609> string<00:03:25.760> working

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
starting from the lowest string working

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:35.300 
starting from the lowest string working
your<00:03:26.569> way<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.870> one

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.610 

then<00:03:36.310> working<00:03:36.550> away<00:03:36.820> backwards<00:03:37.780> kept<00:03:38.440> playing

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
then working away backwards kept playing

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.530 
then working away backwards kept playing
the<00:03:38.770> highest<00:03:39.130> note<00:03:39.340> then<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.850> lower<00:03:40.060> note<00:03:40.330> and

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
the highest note then the lower note and

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.380 
the highest note then the lower note and
working<00:03:40.900> down<00:03:41.080> so<00:03:41.680> on<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.310> way<00:03:42.460> down<00:03:43.090> the

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
working down so on the way down the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.300 
working down so on the way down the
scale<00:03:43.660> would<00:03:43.810> be<00:03:43.870> first<00:03:44.770> string<00:03:45.070> three

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
scale would be first string three

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.920 
scale would be first string three
zero<00:03:49.830> second<00:03:50.830> string<00:03:51.160> third<00:03:51.370> fret<00:03:52.470> open<00:03:53.470> again

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
zero second string third fret open again

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.640 
zero second string third fret open again
third<00:03:55.930> string<00:03:56.380> to<00:03:57.510> open<00:03:59.460> fourth<00:04:00.460> string<00:04:00.580> to

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
third string to open fourth string to

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.760 
third string to open fourth string to
open<00:04:02.650> again<00:04:03.660> fifth<00:04:04.660> string<00:04:04.960> to<00:04:05.580> open<00:04:06.580> one<00:04:06.760> time

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
open again fifth string to open one time

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.700 
open again fifth string to open one time
then<00:04:08.770> the<00:04:09.010> six<00:04:09.310> string<00:04:09.610> three<00:04:10.380> then<00:04:11.380> open

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
then the six string three then open

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.830 
then the six string three then open
again<00:04:11.880> so<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:12.970> whole<00:04:13.150> pattern<00:04:13.360> is<00:04:13.570> gonna<00:04:13.750> walk

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
again so the whole pattern is gonna walk

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:26.490 
again so the whole pattern is gonna walk
like<00:04:14.080> this<00:04:24.630> she<00:04:25.630> based<00:04:25.780> gonna<00:04:25.990> practice<00:04:26.230> at

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
like this she based gonna practice at

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.530 
like this she based gonna practice at
scale<00:04:26.770> going<00:04:27.070> down<00:04:27.400> going<00:04:27.700> up<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.090> scale<00:04:28.240> as

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
scale going down going up the scale as

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.270 
scale going down going up the scale as
many<00:04:28.690> times<00:04:28.930> as<00:04:29.050> you<00:04:29.170> want<00:04:29.320> what's<00:04:29.980> really

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
many times as you want what's really

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.530 
many times as you want what's really
cool<00:04:30.460> about<00:04:30.520> this<00:04:30.850> you<00:04:30.910> can<00:04:31.210> make<00:04:31.330> your<00:04:31.510> own

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
cool about this you can make your own

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.150 
cool about this you can make your own
patterns<00:04:32.080> up<00:04:32.230> with<00:04:32.350> it<00:04:32.470> too<00:04:32.620> if<00:04:32.830> I'm

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
patterns up with it too if I'm

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.190 
patterns up with it too if I'm
particularly<00:04:33.520> playing<00:04:34.030> I<00:04:34.360> don't<00:04:34.840> have<00:04:34.990> to<00:04:35.080> go

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
particularly playing I don't have to go

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.560 
particularly playing I don't have to go
all<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.710> way<00:04:35.740> I<00:04:36.160> can<00:04:36.760> kind<00:04:36.970> of<00:04:37.000> play<00:04:37.180> part<00:04:37.450> of

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
all the way I can kind of play part of

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:45.090 
all the way I can kind of play part of
them<00:04:39.810> then<00:04:40.810> work<00:04:41.080> back<00:04:41.290> down<00:04:43.680> or<00:04:44.680> kind<00:04:44.950> of<00:04:45.010> go

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
them then work back down or kind of go

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.340 
them then work back down or kind of go
up<00:04:45.130> a<00:04:45.250> little<00:04:45.370> more<00:04:48.840> maybe<00:04:49.840> I<00:04:49.930> want<00:04:50.110> to<00:04:50.200> stay<00:04:50.320> on

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
up a little more maybe I want to stay on

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.880 
up a little more maybe I want to stay on
these<00:04:50.560> two<00:04:50.710> notes

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.500 

maybe<00:04:54.520> I<00:04:54.610> want<00:04:54.790> to<00:04:54.850> jump<00:04:55.060> up<00:04:55.150> to<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.300> one

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
maybe I want to jump up to the one

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.980 
maybe I want to jump up to the one
string<00:04:56.940> maybe<00:04:57.940> I<00:04:58.060> like<00:04:58.360> that<00:04:58.540> little<00:04:58.690> riff

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
string maybe I like that little riff

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.390 
string maybe I like that little riff
there<00:04:59.230> I<00:04:59.260> want<00:04:59.500> to<00:04:59.530> do<00:04:59.620> that<00:04:59.710> at<00:04:59.830> 10<00:05:00.010> times<00:05:00.130> in<00:05:00.340> a

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
there I want to do that at 10 times in a

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.610 
there I want to do that at 10 times in a
row<00:05:03.090> this<00:05:04.090> pattern<00:05:04.540> is<00:05:04.660> really<00:05:04.900> foolproof<00:05:05.410> you

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
row this pattern is really foolproof you

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.350 
row this pattern is really foolproof you
can<00:05:05.740> pretty<00:05:06.010> much<00:05:06.130> do<00:05:06.370> anything<00:05:06.400> you<00:05:07.030> want

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
can pretty much do anything you want

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.180 
can pretty much do anything you want
with<00:05:07.510> it<00:05:07.540> it's<00:05:07.750> really<00:05:08.020> a<00:05:08.140> lot<00:05:08.290> of<00:05:08.350> fun<00:05:08.650> so

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
with it it's really a lot of fun so

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.070 
with it it's really a lot of fun so
again<00:05:09.400> take<00:05:09.700> your<00:05:09.730> time<00:05:10.030> with<00:05:10.210> it<00:05:10.240> play<00:05:10.900> with

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
again take your time with it play with

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.750 
again take your time with it play with
that<00:05:11.200> scale<00:05:11.560> and<00:05:11.770> see<00:05:11.860> what<00:05:12.370> you<00:05:12.460> can<00:05:12.580> come<00:05:12.700> up
