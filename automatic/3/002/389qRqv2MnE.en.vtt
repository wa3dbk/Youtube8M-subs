space<00:00:43.420> on<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:44.109> board<00:00:44.320> so<00:00:44.890> I'm<00:00:45.010> gonna<00:00:45.129> take<00:00:45.370> my

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
space on the board so I'm gonna take my

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.939 
space on the board so I'm gonna take my
one<00:00:46.120> rapt<00:00:46.510> tile<00:00:46.840> and<00:00:47.019> I'm<00:00:47.079> gonna<00:00:47.230> go<00:00:47.379> first

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
one rapt tile and I'm gonna go first

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.529 
one rapt tile and I'm gonna go first
and<00:00:48.070> I'm<00:00:48.460> gonna<00:00:48.640> start<00:00:48.969> over<00:00:49.059> here<00:00:49.329> with<00:00:49.449> this

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
and I'm gonna start over here with this

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.389 
and I'm gonna start over here with this
yellow<00:00:49.840> gem<00:00:50.230> and<00:00:50.350> I'm<00:00:50.440> gonna<00:00:50.590> place<00:00:50.859> it<00:00:50.890> just

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
yellow gem and I'm gonna place it just

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.750 
yellow gem and I'm gonna place it just
like<00:00:51.730> this<00:00:52.030> and<00:00:52.390> so<00:00:53.170> if<00:00:53.199> there<00:00:53.500> is<00:00:53.649> a<00:00:53.679> gem<00:00:54.280> I<00:00:54.519> get

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
like this and so if there is a gem I get

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.279 
like this and so if there is a gem I get
to<00:00:54.910> move<00:00:55.030> it<00:00:55.149> to<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.300> end<00:00:55.449> of<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:55.899> adjoining

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
to move it to the end of the adjoining

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.069 
to move it to the end of the adjoining
route<00:00:56.679> like<00:00:57.219> so<00:00:57.670> then<00:00:58.390> that's<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:58.719> end<00:00:58.750> of<00:00:58.929> my

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
route like so then that's the end of my

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.900 
route like so then that's the end of my
turn<00:00:59.350> I<00:00:59.559> take<00:00:59.739> a<00:00:59.769> new<00:00:59.980> route<00:01:00.129> tile<00:01:00.429> and<00:01:00.760> it's

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
turn I take a new route tile and it's

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:12.359 
turn I take a new route tile and it's
Tani's<00:01:01.269> turn<00:01:01.480> to<00:01:01.600> go<00:01:01.719> okay<00:01:02.620> so<00:01:10.020> okay<00:01:11.020> over<00:01:11.950> here

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
keep going there okay so once a gem is

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.200 
keep going there okay so once a gem is
moved<00:01:44.799> to<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.250> edge<00:01:45.430> of<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.759> board<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.090> I'll

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
moved to the edge of the board and I'll

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
pretend that I have gotten mine here and

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.539 
pretend that I have gotten mine here and
that<00:01:49.930> I<00:01:49.960> went<00:01:50.320> oh<00:01:50.469> I<00:01:50.649> told<00:01:51.009> her<00:01:51.130> I<00:01:51.159> wasn't<00:01:51.460> gonna

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
color token is at that exit gateway

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.120 
color token is at that exit gateway
which<00:01:59.500> is<00:01:59.680> mine

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
which is mine
