00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
strength but in comparison if you think

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.740 
strength but in comparison if you think
about<00:03:48.920> Super<00:03:49.400> Saiyans<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:50.000> stuff<00:03:50.420> that<00:03:50.599> what

about Super Saiyans and stuff that what
that<00:03:50.780> won't<00:03:50.989> even<00:03:51.140> happen<00:03:51.260> but<00:03:52.220> um<00:03:52.430> that

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
that won't even happen but um that

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.809 
that won't even happen but um that
that's<00:03:53.000> what<00:03:53.390> I<00:03:53.420> think<00:03:53.780> that's<00:03:54.579> know<00:03:55.579> of<00:03:55.730> my

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
that's what I think that's know of my

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.750 
that's what I think that's know of my
second<00:03:56.180> scenario<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.920> my<00:03:57.920> third<00:03:58.189> scenario<00:03:58.400> is

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
second scenario and my third scenario is

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.420 
second scenario and my third scenario is
and<00:03:59.500> the<00:04:00.500> third<00:04:00.890> scenario<00:04:02.590> pretty<00:04:03.590> bland<00:04:04.250> and

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
and the third scenario pretty bland and

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.839 
and the third scenario pretty bland and
tasteless<00:04:04.519> I<00:04:05.389> mean<00:04:05.599> it<00:04:05.780> ends<00:04:06.049> right<00:04:06.590> there

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
tasteless I mean it ends right there

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.160 
tasteless I mean it ends right there
because<00:04:07.849> Vegeta<00:04:08.840> and<00:04:08.930> nappa<00:04:09.049> they<00:04:09.769> go<00:04:09.950> alright

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170

Raddatz<00:04:12.170> yeah<00:04:13.099> he<00:04:13.220> died<00:04:13.459> that's<00:04:14.389> the<00:04:14.510> thing<00:04:14.750> we

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
Raddatz yeah he died that's the thing we

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.949 
Raddatz yeah he died that's the thing we
should<00:04:15.889> probably<00:04:16.400> go<00:04:17.120> check<00:04:17.329> that<00:04:17.479> out<00:04:17.660> right

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
should probably go check that out right

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.969 
should probably go check that out right
to<00:04:18.320> now<00:04:18.519> so<00:04:19.519> they<00:04:19.970> actually<00:04:20.150> do<00:04:20.600> come<00:04:21.590> on<00:04:21.769> earth

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
that's the thing so that that's the

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.129 
that's the thing so that that's the
third<00:04:54.800> scenario<00:04:55.010> it's<00:04:55.849> pretty<00:04:56.180> bland<00:04:56.930> and

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
let's just go with the fourth scenario

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.029 
let's just go with the fourth scenario
and<00:05:03.409> that<00:05:04.180> came<00:05:05.180> up<00:05:05.330> with<00:05:05.510> and<00:05:05.750> Gohan<00:05:06.289> Goku

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
and that came up with and Gohan Goku

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:12.520 
and that came up with and Gohan Goku
Dyson<00:05:07.639> but<00:05:08.510> Gohan<00:05:09.699> doesn't<00:05:10.699> he<00:05:11.260> unleashes<00:05:12.260> a

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
Dyson but Gohan doesn't he unleashes a

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.089 
Dyson but Gohan doesn't he unleashes a
hidden<00:05:12.800> power<00:05:12.949> you<00:05:13.310> know<00:05:13.430> his<00:05:13.580> dad<00:05:13.820> died<00:05:14.150> I

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
hidden power you know his dad died I

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.040 
hidden power you know his dad died I
mean<00:05:16.099> this<00:05:16.430> imagines<00:05:16.880> Rattus<00:05:17.180> beating<00:05:17.599> up<00:05:17.750> his

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
mean this imagines Rattus beating up his

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.890 
mean this imagines Rattus beating up his
father<00:05:18.380> and<00:05:18.740> he<00:05:18.889> raged<00:05:19.220> the<00:05:19.639> night<00:05:20.330> of<00:05:20.449> his<00:05:20.570> dad

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
father and he raged the night of his dad

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.740 
father and he raged the night of his dad
dying<00:05:21.440> in<00:05:21.770> his<00:05:21.949> rage<00:05:22.280> so<00:05:23.090> I<00:05:23.120> think<00:05:23.270> Raddatz

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
dying in his rage so I think Raddatz

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.930 
dying in his rage so I think Raddatz
would<00:05:23.960> get<00:05:24.710> killed<00:05:25.039> by<00:05:25.340> Gohan<00:05:27.490> but<00:05:28.490> where<00:05:28.789> does

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
would get killed by Gohan but where does

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.040 
would get killed by Gohan but where does
that<00:05:28.970> go<00:05:29.210> from<00:05:29.389> there<00:05:29.539> that's<00:05:29.690> pretty<00:05:29.810> much

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
that go from there that's pretty much

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.850 
that go from there that's pretty much
the<00:05:30.169> same<00:05:30.349> thing<00:05:30.650> with<00:05:32.110> what<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.470> second

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
the same thing with what the second

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.310 
the same thing with what the second
scenario<00:05:34.510> everything<00:05:35.510> will<00:05:35.750> go<00:05:35.870> fine<00:05:35.900> and

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
scenario everything will go fine and

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.939 
scenario everything will go fine and
dandy<00:05:36.639> no<00:05:37.639> threats<00:05:38.030> will<00:05:38.419> be<00:05:38.599> there<00:05:39.440> unless

the
the<00:05:40.500> androids<00:05:40.980> and<00:05:41.420> all<00:05:42.420> that<00:05:42.600> to<00:05:42.720> do<00:05:42.840> is

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
the androids and all that to do is

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.210 
the androids and all that to do is
deactivate<00:05:43.620> them<00:05:43.710> before<00:05:43.980> they<00:05:44.070> get

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
deactivate them before they get

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.610 
deactivate them before they get
activated<00:05:47.120> but<00:05:48.120> here's<00:05:49.020> the<00:05:49.260> good<00:05:49.380> thing

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
activated but here's the good thing

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.700 
activated but here's the good thing
though<00:05:50.090> since<00:05:51.090> doke<00:05:51.960> is<00:05:52.170> dead

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710

does<00:05:53.040> dr.<00:05:53.340> dubrow<00:05:53.940> even<00:05:54.540> mess<00:05:54.840> with<00:05:54.870> the

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
does dr. dubrow even mess with the

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.100 
does dr. dubrow even mess with the
androids<00:05:55.770> he<00:05:56.580> stops<00:05:56.970> there<00:05:57.270> I<00:05:57.510> think<00:05:57.990> the

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
androids he stops there I think the

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.490 
androids he stops there I think the
