this year eat someone and do something a
little<00:00:09.380> bit<00:00:09.470> different<00:00:09.890> they've<00:00:10.340> always<00:00:10.580> had

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.100 
the goal of making badass that cater to

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.920 
the goal of making badass that cater to
all<00:00:13.460> the<00:00:13.580> different<00:00:13.880> players<00:00:14.060> feed<00:00:14.810> on

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:14.930 
all the different players feed on

personal preferences and nuances at the
plate<00:00:17.360> so<00:00:18.020> this<00:00:18.110> year<00:00:18.320> they<00:00:18.380> came<00:00:18.590> out<00:00:18.680> with

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
plate so this year they came out with

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.040 
plate so this year they came out with
the<00:00:18.890> speed<00:00:19.190> and<00:00:19.220> the<00:00:19.580> excel<00:00:19.940> speed<00:00:20.660> series

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
the speed and the excel speed series

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.160 
the speed and the excel speed series
there's<00:00:21.200> going<00:00:21.290> to<00:00:21.350> be<00:00:21.440> more<00:00:21.740> of<00:00:21.890> the<00:00:22.040> balanced

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
there's going to be more of the balanced

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.140 
there's going to be more of the balanced
real<00:00:24.170> balanced<00:00:24.560> feel<00:00:24.770> smaller<00:00:25.250> barrel<00:00:25.700> made

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
real balanced feel smaller barrel made

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.730 
real balanced feel smaller barrel made
for<00:00:26.420> more<00:00:26.660> of<00:00:26.720> your<00:00:26.750> contact<00:00:27.260> hitter<00:00:27.500> the

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
for more of your contact hitter the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.170 
for more of your contact hitter the
excel<00:00:28.130> series<00:00:28.460> is<00:00:28.550> going<00:00:28.670> to<00:00:28.730> be<00:00:28.820> slightly

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
excel series is going to be slightly

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.760 
excel series is going to be slightly
more<00:00:29.360> unloaded<00:00:30.050> because<00:00:30.470> it<00:00:30.560> has<00:00:30.650> an

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
more unloaded because it has an

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.800 
more unloaded because it has an
elongated<00:00:30.949> barrel<00:00:31.670> made<00:00:32.329> more<00:00:32.480> for<00:00:32.689> your

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
elongated barrel made more for your

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.660 
elongated barrel made more for your
power<00:00:32.989> hitter<00:00:33.290> but<00:00:33.950> again<00:00:34.220> you<00:00:34.370> know<00:00:34.489> there's

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
power hitter but again you know there's

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.890 
power hitter but again you know there's
so<00:00:34.850> many<00:00:34.970> different<00:00:35.239> types<00:00:35.329> of<00:00:35.540> hitters<00:00:35.750> out

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
so many different types of hitters out

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.540 
so many different types of hitters out
there<00:00:36.170> and<00:00:36.440> Easton<00:00:36.890> just<00:00:37.040> want<00:00:37.220> to<00:00:37.280> provide<00:00:37.430> a

there and Easton just want to provide a

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.250 
there and Easton just want to provide a
bad<00:00:37.790> for<00:00:38.090> each<00:00:38.239> type<00:00:38.450> of<00:00:38.600> hitter<00:00:38.720> make<00:00:39.110> sure

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
bad for each type of hitter make sure

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.510 
bad for each type of hitter make sure
that<00:00:39.350> they're<00:00:39.620> you<00:00:39.860> know<00:00:39.950> put<00:00:40.190> in<00:00:40.250> a<00:00:40.310> position

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
that they're you know put in a position

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.420 
that they're you know put in a position
to<00:00:40.880> succeed<00:00:41.120> at<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:41.450> plate<00:00:42.190> yeah<00:00:43.190> so

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430

basically what they did is they have
what<00:00:44.989> they<00:00:45.110> call<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:45.440> excel<00:00:45.890> one<00:00:46.130> the<00:00:46.760> xl2<00:00:47.270> and

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
what they call the excel one the xl2 and

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.530 
what they call the excel one the xl2 and
the<00:00:48.170> excel<00:00:48.559> three<00:00:48.890> they<00:00:49.220> also<00:00:49.370> have<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:49.730> s1<00:00:50.210> s2

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
the excel three they also have the s1 s2

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.680 
the excel three they also have the s1 s2
and<00:00:51.230> s3<00:00:51.620> you<00:00:52.040> know<00:00:52.130> one<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.399> excel<00:00:52.760> model<00:00:53.149> like

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
and s3 you know one the excel model like

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.510 
and s3 you know one the excel model like
we<00:00:53.719> said<00:00:53.989> was<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.200> bigger<00:00:54.680> barrels<00:00:55.160> that<00:00:55.340> has

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
we said was the bigger barrels that has

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.790 
we said was the bigger barrels that has
stands<00:00:56.270> for<00:00:56.450> the<00:00:56.510> speed<00:00:56.600> series<00:00:57.110> so<00:00:57.350> basically

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
stands for the speed series so basically

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.500 
stands for the speed series so basically
on<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.010> s-1<00:00:58.190> in<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:58.640> excel<00:00:59.030> lon

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
on the s-1 in the excel lon

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.389 
on the s-1 in the excel lon
it's<00:00:59.840> very<00:01:00.020> comfortable<00:01:00.440> to<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.860> omens<00:01:01.250> of

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
it's very comfortable to the omens of

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.250 
it's very comfortable to the omens of
the<00:01:01.489> past<00:01:01.730> you<00:01:02.149> know<00:01:02.239> it's<00:01:02.420> a<00:01:02.480> two<00:01:02.660> piece<00:01:02.899> cold

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
the past you know it's a two piece cold

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.859 
the past you know it's a two piece cold
composite<00:01:03.920> that<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:05.030> Barents<00:01:05.359> composite

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
composite that and the Barents composite

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.590 
composite that and the Barents composite
is<00:01:05.929> their<00:01:06.200> state<00:01:06.439> of<00:01:06.499> the<00:01:06.560> IMX<00:01:07.249> composite<00:01:07.880> the

xl2 and the s2 is very similar to the

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:13.090 
xl2 and the s2 is very similar to the

general<00:01:28.909> we<00:01:29.179> kind<00:01:29.359> of<00:01:29.420> have<00:01:29.509> to<00:01:29.630> look<00:01:29.749> at<00:01:29.869> the

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
general we kind of have to look at the

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:32.019 
general we kind of have to look at the
finer<00:01:30.170> points<00:01:30.439> with<00:01:31.249> all<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.490> rule<00:01:31.639> changes

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:32.029 
finer points with all the rule changes

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:33.550 
finer points with all the rule changes
we've<00:01:32.240> seen<00:01:32.270> over<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:32.779> last<00:01:32.840> year

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
we've seen over the last year

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.349 
we've seen over the last year
Plainfield<00:01:34.130> has<00:01:34.490> really<00:01:34.700> been<00:01:34.849> leveled<00:01:35.240> I

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
Plainfield has really been leveled I

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:36.760 
Plainfield has really been leveled I
mean<00:01:35.599> the<00:01:35.689> ball<00:01:35.899> is<00:01:36.109> going<00:01:36.229> to<00:01:36.289> come<00:01:36.469> off<00:01:36.619> the

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
mean the ball is going to come off the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.889 
mean the ball is going to come off the
bat<00:01:36.950> pretty<00:01:37.159> much<00:01:37.429> the<00:01:37.670> same<00:01:37.849> speed<00:01:38.179> across

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.809 
bat pretty much the same speed across
the<00:01:39.109> board<00:01:39.349> so<00:01:39.799> you<00:01:39.859> know<00:01:40.130> what<00:01:40.310> Easton<00:01:40.639> did

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
the board so you know what Easton did

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:41.980 
the board so you know what Easton did
was<00:01:40.969> try<00:01:41.119> to<00:01:41.179> look<00:01:41.359> at<00:01:41.450> some<00:01:41.599> of<00:01:41.689> the<00:01:41.749> finer

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
was try to look at some of the finer

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.080 
was try to look at some of the finer
points<00:01:42.109> make<00:01:43.099> one<00:01:43.249> of<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.429> most<00:01:43.490> comfortable

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
points make one of the most comfortable

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.179 
points make one of the most comfortable
swinging<00:01:44.539> bags<00:01:44.749> now<00:01:45.439> give<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.770> player<00:01:46.009> that

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
swinging bags now give the player that

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.649 
swinging bags now give the player that
the<00:01:46.520> added<00:01:46.759> confidence<00:01:47.270> they<00:01:47.359> need<00:01:47.389> at<00:01:47.569> the

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
the added confidence they need at the

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.059 
the added confidence they need at the
plate<00:01:47.899> so<00:01:48.169> what<00:01:48.319> they<00:01:48.439> did<00:01:48.499> with<00:01:48.740> this<00:01:48.859> pack

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
plate so what they did with this pack

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:50.980 
plate so what they did with this pack
the<00:01:49.249> two-piece<00:01:49.669> design<00:01:49.849> they're<00:01:50.659> gonna<00:01:50.869> have

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
the two-piece design they're gonna have

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.779 
the two-piece design they're gonna have
very<00:01:51.020> little<00:01:51.619> vibration<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:52.399> ball<00:01:52.579> is<00:01:52.669> going

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
very little vibration the ball is going

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.149 
very little vibration the ball is going
to<00:01:52.849> jump<00:01:53.119> off<00:01:53.359> and<00:01:54.049> I<00:01:54.109> like<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:54.380> excel<00:01:54.770> model

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
to jump off and I like the excel model

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.139 
to jump off and I like the excel model
the<00:01:55.249> barrel<00:01:55.549> is<00:01:55.609> going<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:55.789> give<00:01:55.880> you<00:01:55.969> one<00:01:56.090> of

the barrel is going to give you one of
the<00:01:56.209> biggest<00:01:56.479> sweet<00:01:56.689> spots<00:01:56.929> in<00:01:57.109> the<00:01:57.200> market<00:01:57.590> so

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
the biggest sweet spots in the market so

00:01:58.159 --> 00:01:59.800 
the biggest sweet spots in the market so
instead<00:01:58.429> of<00:01:58.489> you<00:01:58.609> know<00:01:58.669> necessarily<00:01:59.539> seeing<00:01:59.719> a

instead of you know necessarily seeing a
greater<00:02:00.020> performance<00:02:00.649> it's<00:02:00.770> all<00:02:00.889> more<00:02:01.069> about

00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:01.279 
greater performance it's all more about

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:03.550 
greater performance it's all more about
comfort<00:02:01.759> you<00:02:02.359> know<00:02:02.419> swing<00:02:02.719> speed<00:02:03.079> and<00:02:03.380> just

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
comfort you know swing speed and just

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.260 
comfort you know swing speed and just
give<00:02:03.739> you<00:02:03.829> a<00:02:03.889> large<00:02:04.189> sweet<00:02:04.489> spot<00:02:04.759> to<00:02:04.969> make<00:02:05.090> sure

give you a large sweet spot to make sure
you<00:02:05.389> get

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
you get

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.839 
you get
good<00:02:06.229> contact<00:02:06.680> on<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.890> ball<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:10.640> know<00:02:10.729> we're

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
good contact on the ball you know we're

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.250 
good contact on the ball you know we're
looking<00:02:10.940> at<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:11.300> what<00:02:11.690> kind<00:02:12.020> of<00:02:12.050> player

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
looking at that what kind of player

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.380 
looking at that what kind of player
would<00:02:12.440> be<00:02:12.560> interested<00:02:13.099> in<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.220> S<00:02:13.340> one<00:02:13.610> of<00:02:13.730> xl1

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
would be interested in the S one of xl1

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.089 
would be interested in the S one of xl1
I<00:02:14.630> guess<00:02:14.900> I'll<00:02:15.050> start<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.349> excel<00:02:15.709> one<00:02:15.920> it's

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
I guess I'll start to excel one it's

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.199 
I guess I'll start to excel one it's
definitely<00:02:16.489> going<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.640> be<00:02:16.730> made<00:02:16.910> for<00:02:17.090> your

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
definitely going to be made for your

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.850 
definitely going to be made for your
power<00:02:17.390> hitters<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:18.020> mean<00:02:18.200> with<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.440> extended

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
power hitters I mean with the extended

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.350 
power hitters I mean with the extended
barrel<00:02:19.069> you<00:02:19.340> are<00:02:19.520> gonna<00:02:19.640> have<00:02:19.819> a<00:02:19.849> little<00:02:20.150> bit

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
barrel you are gonna have a little bit

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.000 
barrel you are gonna have a little bit
more<00:02:20.510> weight<00:02:20.750> out<00:02:20.989> on<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.530> end<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:21.860> bat

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
more weight out on the end of the bat

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.559 
more weight out on the end of the bat
it's<00:02:22.580> gonna<00:02:22.700> make<00:02:22.880> it<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:23.060> little<00:02:23.269> bit<00:02:23.450> more

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
it's gonna make it a little bit more

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.059 
it's gonna make it a little bit more
difficult<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.200> swing<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:24.739> you're<00:02:24.830> gonna<00:02:24.950> have

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
difficult to swing and you're gonna have

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.290 
difficult to swing and you're gonna have
to<00:02:25.160> be<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.280> really<00:02:25.430> strong<00:02:25.730> player<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.180> be<00:02:26.269> able

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
to be a really strong player to be able

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.120 
to be a really strong player to be able
to<00:02:26.480> keep<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.780> bat<00:02:26.930> level<00:02:27.380> through<00:02:27.769> the<00:02:27.920> zone

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
to keep the bat level through the zone

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.580 
to keep the bat level through the zone
you<00:02:28.790> look<00:02:28.970> at<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.180> S<00:02:29.300> one<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.870> whole<00:02:30.140> concept

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
you look at the S one the whole concept

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.710 
you look at the S one the whole concept
behind<00:02:30.769> the<00:02:31.099> speed<00:02:31.370> series<00:02:31.790> it's<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:32.330> very<00:02:32.569> much

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
behind the speed series it's a very much

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.360 
behind the speed series it's a very much
more<00:02:32.750> balanced<00:02:33.410> bat<00:02:33.620> it's<00:02:33.920> going<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.099> make<00:02:34.250> it

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
more balanced bat it's going to make it

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.009 
more balanced bat it's going to make it
easier<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.760> swing<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.360> balance<00:02:35.660> points<00:02:35.900> can

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
easier to swing the balance points can

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.720 
easier to swing the balance points can
be<00:02:36.050> closer<00:02:36.349> to<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.739> handle<00:02:36.890> which<00:02:37.610> will

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
be closer to the handle which will

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.309 
be closer to the handle which will
basically<00:02:37.850> make<00:02:38.299> it<00:02:38.330> easier<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.870> keep<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.049> bat

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
basically make it easier to keep the bat

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.460 
basically make it easier to keep the bat
level<00:02:39.739> through<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:39.980> zone<00:02:40.900> me<00:02:41.900> as<00:02:42.080> a<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.380> know
