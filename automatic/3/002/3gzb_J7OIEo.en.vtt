shooter or something to that effect and

shooter or something to that effect and
you<00:01:34.560> would<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:34.890> wrong<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.820> way<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.030> destroy

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
you would be wrong the way you destroy

you would be wrong the way you destroy
these<00:01:36.840> airships<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.470> much<00:01:37.800> more<00:01:38.040> interesting

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
these airships is much more interesting

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.880 
these airships is much more interesting
you<00:01:38.850> just<00:01:39.060> jump<00:01:39.630> aboard<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.170> together<00:01:40.590> as<00:01:40.800> a

away removing sections from the larger
hull<00:01:59.070> or<00:01:59.550> you<00:01:59.970> can<00:02:00.119> place<00:02:00.330> bombs<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:01.140> while

great sacrifice

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.130 
great sacrifice
but<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.760> game<00:02:09.910> is<00:02:10.060> not<00:02:10.090> as<00:02:10.420> simple<00:02:10.600> as<00:02:10.870> just

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
but the game is not as simple as just

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.590 
but the game is not as simple as just
cutting<00:02:11.680> away<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.220> airships<00:02:13.030> themselves
