00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.439
 if you remember the old way was 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.230
 is that you complete the first mission and 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.480
 switch to your friend this way 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.369
 about the same only mission 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.650
 different this time need another 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.990
 mission to take north anton at all 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.360
 just in the game two missions north i us 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.219
 This is the first and somewhere near the end of the game 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.860
 one more mission so here you need 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.160
 choose this particular mission ie the second 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.950
 and so select replay assignment from 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.950
 pause the game and select the task that 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.440
 called to bury the hatchet of war and 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.360
 play it you have to get to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.379
 the airport and the plane we get into 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.699
 north yankton 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.489
 you have to get to the city center and in 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.530
 downtown exactly in the center because 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.719
 It may not work if you are on 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.840
 periphery of the city you must take 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.630
 an invitation from your friend who 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.020
 must create an invitation session 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.560
 as well as in the previous version of this cry 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.250
 and then you already know everything you must 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.220
 take the helicopter you have to fly here in 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.450

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.490
 and so your friends can play with you 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.140
 you must 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.299

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.310
