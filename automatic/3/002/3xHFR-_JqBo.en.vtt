00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.099
 because of an owner in the 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.099
 replay time gives away the base 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.050
 the strong ones do that at the beginning 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.640
 clearly setting the tone as the seventeenth minute 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.239
 sensitive flank of schirinzi expect 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.710
 he does not 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.710
 that hits 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.129
 the basler in the first quarter of an hour 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:53.030
 aggressively non-existent the first serious 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:56.019
 try in the 23 minute kick 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.540
 but the guidance is glorious 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:02.470
 played out here 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.449
 Here he is looking for fly and finds the 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.280
 head from marco streller and that hits 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.620
 again like on thursday 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.620
 against tel aviv with his head 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.350
 the thuner reaction follows right away 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.350
 connection to the enemy 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.509
 say whole morning you risk the thuner 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.509
 we seek heaven 's compensation 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.039
 play him 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.940
 beautiful attack triggering is at home 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.670
 I am in the final position 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.720
 the live 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.380
 is thick 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.380
 successfully 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:53.720
 one minute later another liquid 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:55.920
 tunnel combination of brazilians 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.250
 Cassio with the attempt 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.990
 Now it would take 36 minutes to arrive 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.479
 the thuner compensation highly deserved 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.520
 but the basler can do that 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.229
 save a tight lead in the break 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.770
 there is still there 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.890
 potential for improvement second half 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.130
 do corner 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.800
 niki once again extremely present 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.170
 that the bundesliga but its efficiency 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.099
 leaves much to be desired ultimately 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.019
 no problem for summer 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:31.019
 then corner kicked on the opposite side 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:35.520
 by valentin stocker comes right down to it 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:38.580
 head from 40 2 60 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.680
 In terms of efficiency, this is what distinguishes everyone 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.560
 In addition, the bazany few opportunities 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.740
 lead 2 1 0 0 in the team of urs fischer 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.550
 stand effort and yield by far 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.550
 no over 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.820
 the thuner fight undaunted 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.590
 continue 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.890
 christian schneuwly with this distance 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.890
 knaller 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.820
 ten minutes came as the bench 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.020
 andreas wittwer here dangerous in 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.670
 set scene 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.670
 and equal to the 1 1 to achieve 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.540
 no time properly paid 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.540
 and touch 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.220
 the next position 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.400
 probably is 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.400
 but 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.900
 but here the final war remains off in 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.090
 the referee already has to 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.840
 wrongly decided on offside 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.390
 after a good ten minutes christian 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.920
 Schneuwly 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.920
 simoni to rent 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:05.870
 minute the replay time runs goalkeeper 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:08.110
 commit ball forward and then 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.110
 is 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.459
 it does 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.650
 there 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.280
 the gift of balancing, of course 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:30.229
 like to have seen everything in all 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.229
 the undecided fair
