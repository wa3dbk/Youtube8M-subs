00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.190 
tight game I could hopefully get fouled
and<00:01:56.640> hit<00:01:56.729> free<00:01:56.939> throws<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.020> know

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
and hit free throws and you know

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.459 
and hit free throws and you know
definitely<00:01:58.799> close<00:01:59.430> close<00:02:00.390> close<00:02:01.170> out<00:02:01.890> strong

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
definitely close close close out strong

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.319 
definitely close close close out strong
so<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.530> think<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.740> can<00:02:04.920> see<00:02:05.040> him<00:02:05.219> just<00:02:05.610> trying<00:02:06.119> to
