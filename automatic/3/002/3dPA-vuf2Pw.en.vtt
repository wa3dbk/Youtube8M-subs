00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.329
 let's go down I also spend in this 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.519
 functions and there are a lot of things that 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.560
 I have missed that they will speak but good 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.740
 I summarize it the other day of Laura 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.720
 fidalgo was outraged because forgiveness 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.580
 also this serious because they laughed at him 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.930
 tango that we all get excited you and 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.220
 laura fidalgo back they were staying 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.470
 laughs that yes we intend there is no 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.330
 the vihuela I raise a little bit and the 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.659
 truth is that he was running with us 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.250
 laura of something else sincerely and when 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.810
 they all came running here the truth 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.539
 that I did not really want to 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.450
 come but not for her really 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:37.050
 many came to laura I did not see her either 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.050
 you had piquin 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.950
 I almost fall to tears 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.049
 I thrilled yes I said it is not an obligation that 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.729
 what one emotion emotion the other does not 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.709
 it is not obligation come and run 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.840
 everything comes running or there makes a 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:55.000
 the great majority participant 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.709
 personal but mine that if I come I 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.340
 I have to put forward always for 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:01.660
 see obviously by logic all 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.750
 through that because if not what 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.940
 emotion you did not see the we're going to come and 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.270
 run to everything because that's the way I'm going to 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.270
 to be 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:17.530
 but you saw the dance and you liked it more and 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.150
 in the TV is for the bar to all and 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.120
 good and then they all left running 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.459
 and it's perfect obviously not discussed 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.200
 the great dancer who is and everything I am 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.209
 in a company where they also have 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.370
 because there was also talk of a lack 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.859
 of respect towards the tango that would be 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.439
 well sometimes that does not clarify but one 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:37.120
 He does not lack the respect and I come to a 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:40.719
 company where stravaganzza tango is 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.519
 also and obviously that is something very 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:48.609
 cute that was lived but it was not for 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:50.290
 come against her or anyone and 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.689
 what we were doing with Laura was 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.299
 she was becoming herself and as she was 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:57.639
 all the time and good and we all 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.919
 We were laughing and wanted and want to create 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:02.220
 when the camera clarity sorry for this 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.220
 delay 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.359
 good gentlemen how are we for rock 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.880
 and roll and then he lives in his boy goes to 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.620
 to dance after a boy 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.410
 an exit again whenever 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.950
 It is surprising to know that it is well behind you 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.950
 they put us together 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.590
 we are not in a joke 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.209
 and there is no one else 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.969
 do not 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.570
 m 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.020
 good 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.390
 it's true 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.390
 ah 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.579
 and much more 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.579
 I 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.390
 a motorcycle 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.010
