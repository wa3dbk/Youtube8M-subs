00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
just a bit more violence so it's pretty

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.870

it<00:04:53.040> is<00:04:53.160> interesting<00:04:53.460> it's<00:04:54.090> more<00:04:54.420> like<00:04:54.540> a<00:04:54.600> hack

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
it is interesting it's more like a hack

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.300 
it is interesting it's more like a hack
and<00:04:54.870> slash<00:04:55.020> it's<00:04:55.290> fun<00:04:55.470> to<00:04:55.590> play<00:04:55.710> but<00:04:56.040> it<00:04:56.160> is

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
and slash it's fun to play but it is

really violence and it's kind of

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.930 
really violence and it's kind of
interesting<00:04:58.230> I<00:04:58.560> guess<00:04:58.770> number<00:04:59.580> four<00:04:59.760> is

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
interesting I guess number four is

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.940

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
PlayStation 3 and Xbox I think it was a

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.630

lot of people are gonna probably

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.190 
lot of people are gonna probably
complain<00:05:09.030> that<00:05:09.060> this<00:05:09.240> game<00:05:09.450> isn't<00:05:09.750> as<00:05:09.840> violent

as<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.410> other<00:05:10.560> ones<00:05:10.770> but<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.700> reason<00:05:11.910> I<00:05:12.000> put

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
as the other ones but the reason I put

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.070 
as the other ones but the reason I put
on<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.300> list<00:05:12.450> is<00:05:12.600> because<00:05:12.630> it's<00:05:12.840> kind<00:05:12.900> of

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
on the list is because it's kind of

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.650 
on the list is because it's kind of
disturbing<00:05:13.560> how<00:05:14.030> realistically<00:05:15.030> you<00:05:15.270> can<00:05:15.420> rip

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660
