on<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.160> issue<00:00:32.279> at<00:00:32.460> hand<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.880> most<00:00:33.059> things<00:00:33.180> I'm

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
on the issue at hand so most things I'm

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.700 
on the issue at hand so most things I'm
really<00:00:33.480> depending<00:00:33.870> on<00:00:33.930> caffeine<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.380> keep<00:00:34.559> it

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
focused and a lot of the times it

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.380 
focused and a lot of the times it
doesn't<00:00:38.460> even<00:00:38.550> really<00:00:38.700> work<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.180> end<00:00:39.329> up

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
doesn't even really work I end up

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.990 
doesn't even really work I end up
crashing<00:00:39.870> hard<00:00:40.020> anyways<00:00:40.379> but<00:00:40.969> recently<00:00:41.969> I

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
crashing hard anyways but recently I

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.190 
crashing hard anyways but recently I
ended<00:00:42.360> up<00:00:42.450> somewhere<00:00:42.660> across<00:00:42.989> something

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
ended up somewhere across something

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.540 
ended up somewhere across something
that's<00:00:43.410> really<00:00:43.770> helped<00:00:43.980> me<00:00:44.129> out<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.399> helped

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
that's really helped me out and helped

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.400 
that's really helped me out and helped
me<00:00:44.640> through<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.899> wanted<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.230> share

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410

that with you guys so make sure you stay

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.819 
that with you guys so make sure you stay
at<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> end<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.899> video<00:00:49.140> because<00:00:49.500> this

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
at the end of the video because this

could possibly help a lot of you guys

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.779 
could possibly help a lot of you guys
out<00:00:51.059> as<00:00:51.180> well<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:55.110> sill<00:00:55.320> fab<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:56.160> nootropic

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
out as well so sill fab is a nootropic

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.060 
out as well so sill fab is a nootropic
and<00:00:57.120> nootropics<00:00:57.989> are<00:00:58.170> supplements<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.920> are

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
and nootropics are supplements that are

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.099 
and nootropics are supplements that are
used<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.460> enhance<00:00:59.609> memory<00:01:00.449> or<00:01:00.719> other

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
used to enhance memory or other

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.650 
used to enhance memory or other
cognitive<00:01:01.320> functions<00:01:01.590> silt<00:01:02.550> f<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.969> composed

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
cognitive functions silt f is composed

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.179 
cognitive functions silt f is composed
of<00:01:03.899> two<00:01:04.140> main<00:01:04.320> ingredients<00:01:04.439> which<00:01:05.010> are

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
of two main ingredients which are

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.100 
of two main ingredients which are
artichoke<00:01:05.729> extract<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.390> porcelain<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:06.990> it's

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
artichoke extract and porcelain so it's

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.690 
artichoke extract and porcelain so it's
an<00:01:07.200> all-natural<00:01:07.470> supplement<00:01:07.830> its<00:01:08.400> main

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
an all-natural supplement its main

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.870 
an all-natural supplement its main
function<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.600> naturally<00:01:10.110> induce<00:01:10.500> LTP<00:01:11.100> or

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
function is to naturally induce LTP or

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.760 
function is to naturally induce LTP or
long-term<00:01:12.210> potentiation<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.470> long-term

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
long-term potentiation the long-term

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.399 
long-term potentiation the long-term
potentiation<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:15.240> cellular<00:01:15.810> mechanism

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
potentiation is a cellular mechanism

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.920 
potentiation is a cellular mechanism
which<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.650> responsible<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.150> encoding<00:01:18.750> of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
which is responsible for the encoding of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.960 
which is responsible for the encoding of
the<00:01:19.380> neurons<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.310> are<00:01:20.400> responsible<00:01:20.820> for

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the neurons that are responsible for

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.700 
the neurons that are responsible for
memory<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.420> essentially<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.110> strengthens<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
memory so essentially it strengthens the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.530 
memory so essentially it strengthens the
connections<00:01:23.130> between<00:01:23.280> those<00:01:23.580> neurons<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.299> it

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
connections between those neurons and it

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.120 
connections between those neurons and it
improves<00:01:24.840> oral<00:01:25.170> learning<00:01:25.500> as<00:01:25.619> well<00:01:25.740> as<00:01:25.799> memory

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
improves oral learning as well as memory

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.109 
improves oral learning as well as memory
now<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.520> guys<00:01:26.640> are<00:01:26.759> interested<00:01:26.909> in

some<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.840> more<00:02:15.959> prominent<00:02:16.170> effects<00:02:16.680> that

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
some of the more prominent effects that

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.500 
some of the more prominent effects that
I've<00:02:16.890> been<00:02:17.010> noticing<00:02:17.280> from<00:02:17.640> daily<00:02:17.940> use<00:02:18.150> would

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
I've been noticing from daily use would

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.290 
I've been noticing from daily use would
be<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:19.050> focus<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.980> motivation<00:02:20.580> the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
be the focus and the motivation the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.850 
be the focus and the motivation the
energy<00:02:21.599> is<00:02:21.720> there<00:02:21.870> as<00:02:21.989> well<00:02:22.019> but<00:02:22.440> I'm<00:02:22.620> also

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
energy is there as well but I'm also

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.339 
energy is there as well but I'm also
stacking<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.610> with<00:02:23.849> their<00:02:24.420> smart<00:02:24.930> caffeine

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
stacking it with their smart caffeine

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.170 
stacking it with their smart caffeine
when<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:25.800> buy<00:02:25.950> silt<00:02:26.250> up<00:02:26.430> it's<00:02:26.670> an<00:02:26.880> additional

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
when you buy silt up it's an additional

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.240 
when you buy silt up it's an additional
$10<00:02:27.599> so<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:27.900> figured<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.290> tried<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.709> as<00:02:28.830> well<00:02:29.010> and

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
$10 so I figured I tried it as well and

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.050 
$10 so I figured I tried it as well and
smart<00:02:30.030> caffeine<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:31.130> caffeine<00:02:32.130> combined<00:02:32.880> with

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
smart caffeine is caffeine combined with

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.370 
smart caffeine is caffeine combined with
l-theanine<00:02:33.599> which<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.050> an<00:02:34.110> amino<00:02:34.260> acid

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
l-theanine which is an amino acid

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.830 
l-theanine which is an amino acid
combining<00:02:35.310> these<00:02:35.430> two<00:02:35.730> it's<00:02:36.390> supposed<00:02:36.750> to

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
combining these two it's supposed to

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.380 
combining these two it's supposed to
prolong<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.290> effects<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.650> caffeine<00:02:38.099> and<00:02:38.430> just

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
prolong the effects of caffeine and just

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.910 
prolong the effects of caffeine and just
give<00:02:39.569> you<00:02:39.690> more<00:02:39.959> of<00:02:39.989> a<00:02:40.110> stable<00:02:40.349> energy<00:02:40.620> as

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
give you more of a stable energy as

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.759 
give you more of a stable energy as
opposed<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.400> kind<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.390> shoot<00:02:43.290> up<00:02:43.410> an<00:02:43.500> energy

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
opposed to kind of a shoot up an energy

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.289 
opposed to kind of a shoot up an energy
and<00:02:43.890> then<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.010> crash<00:02:44.310> which<00:02:44.610> most<00:02:44.880> caffeine

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
and then a crash which most caffeine

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.330 
and then a crash which most caffeine
would<00:02:45.420> give<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:45.720> like<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> coffee<00:02:46.170> or<00:02:46.590> having

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
would give you like a coffee or having

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.680 
would give you like a coffee or having
an<00:02:47.400> energy<00:02:47.549> drink<00:02:47.970> or<00:02:48.060> something<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:48.540> right

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
an energy drink or something so right

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.539 
an energy drink or something so right
now<00:02:48.840> my<00:02:48.930> current<00:02:49.200> daily<00:02:49.380> routine<00:02:49.830> is<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.370> wake

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
now my current daily routine is I wake

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.150 
now my current daily routine is I wake
up<00:02:50.640> at<00:02:50.760> 6:30<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.840> take<00:02:52.049> three<00:02:52.680> capsules<00:02:53.069> of

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
up at 6:30 and I take three capsules of

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.890 
up at 6:30 and I take three capsules of
sill<00:02:53.340> tap<00:02:53.549> on<00:02:53.819> an<00:02:54.150> empty<00:02:54.299> stomach<00:02:54.480> right<00:02:54.750> away

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
sill tap on an empty stomach right away

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.270 
sill tap on an empty stomach right away
before<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.230> do<00:02:55.319> anything<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.860> that's<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:56.099> full

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
before I do anything and that's a full

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.430 
before I do anything and that's a full
dosage<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:57.239> recommends<00:02:57.780> two<00:02:58.049> to<00:02:58.230> three

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
dosage it recommends two to three

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.870 
dosage it recommends two to three
capsules<00:02:58.829> I<00:02:59.040> find<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.370> three<00:02:59.549> capsules

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
capsules I find that three capsules

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.550 
capsules I find that three capsules
gives<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.239> much<00:03:00.420> more<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.810> benefit<00:03:01.290> than

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
gives you much more of a benefit than

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.670 
gives you much more of a benefit than
then<00:03:02.220> two<00:03:02.549> does<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.299> take<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:04.140> have<00:03:04.530> my

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
then two does so I take that I have my

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.150 
then two does so I take that I have my
breakfast<00:03:05.099> and<00:03:06.290> also<00:03:07.290> like<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.590> stated<00:03:07.829> I<00:03:07.980> take

a lot of pre-workout supplements so I

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.750

long-term<00:04:37.449> effects<00:04:37.870> of<00:04:37.960> that<00:04:38.050> are<00:04:38.229> but<00:04:38.530> so<00:04:39.099> far

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
long-term effects of that are but so far

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.559 
long-term effects of that are but so far
has<00:04:39.460> been<00:04:39.610> really<00:04:39.940> really<00:04:40.060> good

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:40.569 
has been really really good

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:41.820 
has been really really good
so<00:04:40.660> a<00:04:40.690> couple<00:04:40.900> things<00:04:41.020> I've<00:04:41.229> actually<00:04:41.440> noticed

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
so a couple things I've actually noticed

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.339 
so a couple things I've actually noticed
as<00:04:41.919> well<00:04:42.099> as<00:04:42.370> a<00:04:42.430> result<00:04:42.970> of<00:04:43.210> taking<00:04:43.599> silica<00:04:44.050> so

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
as well as a result of taking silica so

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.680 
as well as a result of taking silica so
one<00:04:44.530> of<00:04:44.560> them<00:04:44.710> would<00:04:44.800> be<00:04:45.039> from<00:04:45.819> day<00:04:46.090> to<00:04:46.150> day<00:04:46.300> and

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
one of them would be from day to day and

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.270 
one of them would be from day to day and
like<00:04:46.870> I<00:04:46.960> said<00:04:47.139> before<00:04:47.289> I've<00:04:47.710> been<00:04:47.949> finding<00:04:48.130> it

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
like I said before I've been finding it

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.370 
like I said before I've been finding it
really<00:04:48.370> hard<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.669> stay<00:04:48.819> focused<00:04:49.240> and<00:04:49.419> I<00:04:50.229> was

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
really hard to stay focused and I was

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.560 
really hard to stay focused and I was
also<00:04:50.530> getting<00:04:50.830> pretty<00:04:51.669> heavy<00:04:51.880> crashes<00:04:52.449> around

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
also getting pretty heavy crashes around

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.719 
also getting pretty heavy crashes around
1:00<00:04:52.960> to<00:04:53.110> 2:00<00:04:53.289> in<00:04:53.440> the<00:04:53.470> afternoon<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:54.160> it's

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
1:00 to 2:00 in the afternoon and it's

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:55.920 
1:00 to 2:00 in the afternoon and it's
probably<00:04:54.970> because<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.270> coffee<00:04:55.539> and<00:04:55.840> a

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
probably because the coffee and a

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.659 
probably because the coffee and a
pre-workout<00:04:56.229> that<00:04:56.470> I've<00:04:56.560> been<00:04:56.620> taking<00:04:56.800> but<00:04:57.280> as

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
pre-workout that I've been taking but as

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.550 
pre-workout that I've been taking but as
a<00:04:57.970> result<00:04:58.300> of<00:04:58.449> that<00:04:58.570> I<00:04:58.780> would<00:04:58.990> usually<00:04:59.199> head<00:04:59.530> to

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
a result of that I would usually head to

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.689 
a result of that I would usually head to
them<00:04:59.740> being<00:04:59.949> a<00:05:00.039> store<00:05:00.220> and<00:05:00.340> grab<00:05:00.460> like<00:05:00.639> a

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
them being a store and grab like a

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.879 
them being a store and grab like a
chocolate<00:05:01.090> bar<00:05:01.120> or<00:05:01.509> just<00:05:02.349> some<00:05:02.530> kind<00:05:02.800> of

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
chocolate bar or just some kind of

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.010 
chocolate bar or just some kind of
simple<00:05:03.220> sugar<00:05:03.460> to<00:05:03.880> kind<00:05:04.120> of<00:05:04.180> give<00:05:04.449> me<00:05:04.509> a<00:05:04.539> quick

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
simple sugar to kind of give me a quick

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.749 
simple sugar to kind of give me a quick
boost<00:05:05.289> of<00:05:05.440> energy<00:05:05.530> because<00:05:06.190> fast<00:05:06.550> digesting

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 
boost of energy because fast digesting

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.180 
boost of energy because fast digesting
carbohydrates<00:05:07.630> but<00:05:07.900> I<00:05:08.139> found<00:05:08.860> that<00:05:09.009> in<00:05:09.159> the

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
carbohydrates but I found that in the

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.649 
carbohydrates but I found that in the
last<00:05:09.400> few<00:05:09.580> weeks<00:05:09.639> I<00:05:09.970> have<00:05:10.150> really<00:05:10.360> been<00:05:10.449> doing

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:10.659 
last few weeks I have really been doing

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:12.930 
last few weeks I have really been doing
that<00:05:10.780> at<00:05:10.900> all<00:05:11.110> because<00:05:11.550> throughout<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.729> day<00:05:12.880> I

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
that at all because throughout the day I

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.390 
that at all because throughout the day I
have<00:05:13.389> constant<00:05:13.960> steady<00:05:14.199> energy<00:05:14.380> and<00:05:14.800> focus<00:05:15.130> so

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
have constant steady energy and focus so

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.950 
have constant steady energy and focus so
that's<00:05:16.210> something<00:05:16.479> that's<00:05:16.630> really<00:05:16.690> really

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
that's something that's really really

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.020 
that's something that's really really
beneficial<00:05:17.500> for<00:05:17.710> me<00:05:17.889> especially<00:05:18.400> you<00:05:18.909> know

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
I've been able to cut out sugar pretty

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.100 
I've been able to cut out sugar pretty
much<00:05:20.770> from<00:05:21.070> from<00:05:21.580> my<00:05:22.060> daily<00:05:22.330> routine<00:05:22.780> which<00:05:22.990> is

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
recall information a lot faster so this

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.270 
recall information a lot faster so this
is<00:05:31.810> something<00:05:32.020> that<00:05:32.050> feels<00:05:32.229> really<00:05:32.620> good<00:05:32.800> just

to take the stack probably indefinitely

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.529 
to take the stack probably indefinitely
because<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.520> event<00:06:00.729> the<00:06:00.820> benefits<00:06:01.210> have<00:06:01.330> just
