00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.109 
figured it out here's the Rube Goldberg
operation<00:01:48.570> these<00:01:49.380> three<00:01:49.979> things<00:01:50.009> all<00:01:50.670> hook<00:01:51.000> up

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
operation these three things all hook up

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.960 
operation these three things all hook up
together<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:52.259> I'm<00:01:52.500> putting<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> not<00:01:53.610> big

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
together this I'm putting on a not big

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.719 
together this I'm putting on a not big
nut<00:01:54.329> here<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.619> tire<00:01:55.799> coming<00:01:56.159> down<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.610> it

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
nut here is it tire coming down is it

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.959 
nut here is it tire coming down is it
coming<00:01:56.880> down<00:01:57.090> yeah<00:01:57.860> excellent<00:01:58.860> tell<00:01:59.670> me<00:01:59.790> when

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
coming down yeah excellent tell me when

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.260 
coming down yeah excellent tell me when
it<00:02:00.090> hits<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.540> ground<00:02:00.570> it's<00:02:01.140> feeling<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.530> loser

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
it hits the ground it's feeling a loser

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.149 
it hits the ground it's feeling a loser
this<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.450> ok<00:02:03.810> back<00:02:04.049> up<00:02:04.079> here<00:02:04.439> look<00:02:04.649> up<00:02:04.770> here<00:02:04.799> now

can see is a very narrow tire with not a
lot<00:02:48.880> of<00:02:49.180> big<00:02:49.450> tread<00:02:49.810> on<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.050> because<00:02:50.350> it's<00:02:50.530> a

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
lot of big tread on it because it's a

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.130 
lot of big tread on it because it's a
temporary<00:02:51.040> spare<00:02:51.700> so<00:02:52.330> you<00:02:52.420> want<00:02:52.570> to<00:02:52.660> take<00:02:52.960> the

sitting<00:02:55.720> on<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.050> ground<00:02:56.290> because<00:02:57.160> once<00:02:57.490> it's

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
sitting on the ground because once it's

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.090 
sitting on the ground because once it's

torque wrench all right and if it's

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.770 
torque wrench all right and if it's
really<00:03:20.080> tough<00:03:20.760> be<00:03:21.760> careful<00:03:22.270> this<00:03:22.390> doesn't

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
really tough be careful this doesn't

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.280 
really tough be careful this doesn't
just<00:03:22.810> fling<00:03:23.410> up<00:03:23.590> in<00:03:23.710> your<00:03:23.830> face<00:03:24.070> there<00:03:24.400> we<00:03:24.520> go

just fling up in your face there we go
and<00:03:26.290> remember<00:03:26.590> this<00:03:27.130> is<00:03:27.190> supposed<00:03:27.460> to<00:03:27.670> be<00:03:27.730> a

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
and remember this is supposed to be a

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.600 
and remember this is supposed to be a
flat<00:03:28.030> tire<00:03:28.300> so<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:29.230> flat<00:03:29.650> tire<00:03:29.950> will<00:03:30.190> look<00:03:30.460> like

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
flat tire so a flat tire will look like

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.070 
flat tire so a flat tire will look like
it's<00:03:30.820> off<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.210> ground<00:03:31.420> but<00:03:31.660> you<00:03:31.780> won't<00:03:31.960> be

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
it's off the ground but you won't be

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.380 
it's off the ground but you won't be
able<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.290> fit<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.650> new<00:03:32.830> tire<00:03:33.130> in<00:03:33.340> because<00:03:33.730> the

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
able to fit the new tire in because the

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.390 
able to fit the new tire in because the
new<00:03:34.570> tire<00:03:34.780> will<00:03:34.960> have<00:03:35.110> a<00:03:35.140> lot<00:03:35.290> of<00:03:35.320> air<00:03:35.530> so<00:03:36.340> you

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
new tire will have a lot of air so you

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.050 
new tire will have a lot of air so you
want<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:36.730> clear<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.540> ground<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:39.790> don't<00:03:39.940> want
