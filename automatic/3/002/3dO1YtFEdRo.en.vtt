00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
 hello youtube friends today we are going to 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.640
 make a comparison between the tours 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.330
 of this presentation with the tours of 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.799
 this presentation and obviously the great 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.720
 difference that there is that has such control 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.760
 and esteban but at bottom 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.410
 exactly the same one more accessory 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.410
 good what about this box 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.199
 in this way as I had already taken it 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.730
 but there is a presentation there is one of 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.800
 gumdrops are three pairs of two 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.800
 gummies for the ear and in the puppy 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.630
 all right 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.650
 in the box comes a manual and a 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.650
 warranty 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.230
 and 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.430
 good the quality is pretty good with 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.900
 the 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.900
 with their respective control such 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.060
 and now let's see 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.060
 an improved version of 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.640
 the smallest box 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.520
 this is the version as I commented without 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.390
 count can only realize one 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.280
 difference that they do not have and wants 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.280
 of the bird here cost me 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.119
 excuse my voice but I'm a little 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.310
 cold so then I have the one 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:45.240
 little more more hoarse than usual 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.860
 well here we find 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.860
 most complete annual 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:57.270
 for example the manual where all 

00:01:53.249 --> 00:02:02.180
 the specifications all the hearing aids 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:05.350
 which has all the models bits 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.350
 ahead and others 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.350
 and thereafter 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:16.670
 more manual information 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.670
 how does he deal 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.470
 Y 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.920
 where the hearing aids themselves 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.900
 the gummies clients in these 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.900
 benefits that are six parents 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.890
 the case differently differently and the 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:54.230
 puppy also ends 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.940
 similar cases of what it puts 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.209
 then how could they see the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.510
 presentations are different 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.230
 If we talk about quality, quality is 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.230
 pretty similar 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.950
 I would say that this presentation a little 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.959
 more than half better quality but that's not 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.980
 remove that now also be good 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.299
 quality so good this video 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.190
 relatively short so they can see 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:28.090
 the differences and leave him invited to my 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.590
