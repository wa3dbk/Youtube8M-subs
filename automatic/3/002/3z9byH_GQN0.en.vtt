00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
because inhaling hepta inhaling

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.499 
because inhaling hepta inhaling
chemicals<00:01:48.110> isn't<00:01:49.110> fun<00:01:49.490> so<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:51.060> product

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
chemicals isn't fun so this product

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.190 
chemicals isn't fun so this product
comes<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.079> two<00:01:52.380> strengths<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.640> product<00:01:54.200> and

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
comes in two strengths the product and

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.899 
comes in two strengths the product and
the<00:01:55.320> box<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.460> strength<00:01:56.759> is

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
the box that I have the strength is

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.280 
the box that I have the strength is
normal<00:01:57.270> strength<00:01:57.540> which<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.899> for<00:01:58.079> mid-tone

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
normal strength which is for mid-tone

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.700 
normal strength which is for mid-tone
hair<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.130> guess<00:01:59.430> it's<00:01:59.670> like<00:01:59.790> light<00:02:00.090> Browns

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
hair so I guess it's like light Browns

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.370 
hair so I guess it's like light Browns
medium<00:02:01.710> Browns<00:02:02.009> maybe<00:02:02.430> even<00:02:03.000> or<00:02:03.570> like<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> dark

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
medium Browns maybe even or like a dark

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.160 
medium Browns maybe even or like a dark
blonde<00:02:04.710> or<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.549> comes<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.180> max<00:02:06.719> strength

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
blonde or it comes in a max strength

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.559 
blonde or it comes in a max strength
which<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.710> suggested<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.459> dark<00:02:08.849> brown<00:02:09.090> and

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
which is suggested like dark brown and

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.710 
which is suggested like dark brown and
black<00:02:09.929> hair<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.849> got<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.030> normal<00:02:12.330> strength

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
black hair I got the normal strength

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.860 
black hair I got the normal strength
which<00:02:12.959> worked<00:02:13.260> fine

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
which worked fine

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.930 
which worked fine
me<00:02:14.049> I<00:02:14.440> was<00:02:14.920> going<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.129> get<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.340> max<00:02:15.580> strength

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
me I was going to get the max strength

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.580 
me I was going to get the max strength
but<00:02:16.120> I'm<00:02:16.209> kind<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.480> glad<00:02:16.599> now<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.230> didn't

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
but I'm kind of glad now that I didn't

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.949 
but I'm kind of glad now that I didn't
because<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.190> strength<00:02:18.489> I<00:02:18.790> had<00:02:19.420> this<00:02:19.540> fine

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
because the strength I had this fine

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.009 
because the strength I had this fine
and<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:20.290> lighting<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:21.159> the<00:02:21.760> sun's<00:02:21.970> come<00:02:22.209> out

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.360 

we<00:02:26.019> will<00:02:26.170> see<00:02:26.379> how<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:26.799> turns<00:02:27.129> out<00:02:27.310> I

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
we will see how this turns out I

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.509 
we will see how this turns out I
probably<00:02:27.670> look<00:02:28.120> like<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.360> curse<00:02:28.629> it's<00:02:28.989> okay

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
probably look like a curse it's okay

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.289 
probably look like a curse it's okay

hair leaving it in for 45 minutes and as

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.920 
hair leaving it in for 45 minutes and as
I<00:02:51.190> said<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:51.519> also<00:02:51.670> applied<00:02:52.239> heat<00:02:52.480> for<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.750> last

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
I said I also applied heat for the last

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.170 
I said I also applied heat for the last
10<00:02:53.349> minutes<00:02:53.560> about<00:02:53.980> 45<00:02:54.459> minutes<00:02:54.640> especially

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
10 minutes about 45 minutes especially

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.119 
10 minutes about 45 minutes especially
the<00:02:55.299> areas<00:02:55.750> where<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.440> color<00:02:56.650> hadn't<00:02:57.010> lifted

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
the areas where the color hadn't lifted

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.789 
the areas where the color hadn't lifted
as<00:02:57.430> much<00:02:57.609> after<00:02:58.450> that<00:02:58.690> you<00:02:59.200> have<00:02:59.379> to<00:02:59.560> rinse

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
as much after that you have to rinse

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.680 
as much after that you have to rinse
your<00:03:00.040> hair<00:03:00.280> for<00:03:00.489> about<00:03:00.579> 20<00:03:01.180> minutes<00:03:01.480> I<00:03:01.629> think

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
your hair for about 20 minutes I think

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.069 
your hair for about 20 minutes I think
it<00:03:01.989> is<00:03:02.109> 10<00:03:02.560> 20<00:03:02.890> minutes<00:03:03.159> so<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.030> set<00:03:04.569> a<00:03:04.599> timer<00:03:04.900> on

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
it is 10 20 minutes so I set a timer on

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.170 
it is 10 20 minutes so I set a timer on
my<00:03:05.170> phone<00:03:05.560> just<00:03:05.950> so<00:03:06.250> I<00:03:06.280> would<00:03:06.609> know<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:06.970> because

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
my phone just so I would know it because

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.860 
my phone just so I would know it because
I<00:03:07.209> didn't<00:03:07.510> want<00:03:07.629> to<00:03:08.430> not<00:03:09.510> rinse<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.599> out<00:03:10.690> for

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
I didn't want to not rinse it out for

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.809 
I didn't want to not rinse it out for
long<00:03:10.959> enough<00:03:11.170> because<00:03:11.319> that<00:03:11.590> will<00:03:11.829> affect<00:03:12.190> the

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
long enough because that will affect the

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.699 
long enough because that will affect the
process<00:03:13.359> of<00:03:13.780> your<00:03:13.989> hair

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
process of your hair

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.069 
process of your hair
finally<00:03:15.159> like<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.640> final<00:03:15.940> process<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.720> final

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
finally like the final process the final

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.360 
finally like the final process the final
look<00:03:17.290> go<00:03:17.859> ahead

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
look go ahead

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.879 
look go ahead
after<00:03:19.180> that<00:03:19.329> you<00:03:19.510> need<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.930> apply<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.349> buffer

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
after that you need to apply the buffer

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:26.580 
after that you need to apply the buffer
which<00:03:21.069> I'm<00:03:21.310> still<00:03:22.060> kept<00:03:24.030> which<00:03:25.030> is<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:26.470> know

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
which I'm still kept which is you know

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.259 
which I'm still kept which is you know
so<00:03:26.799> this<00:03:26.889> is<00:03:27.040> Part<00:03:27.310> C<00:03:27.370> which<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.060> hair

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
so this is Part C which is the hair

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.619 
so this is Part C which is the hair
buffer<00:03:29.129> you<00:03:30.129> apply<00:03:30.579> it<00:03:30.639> into<00:03:30.940> your<00:03:31.150> hair<00:03:31.450> and

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
buffer you apply it into your hair and

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.180 
buffer you apply it into your hair and
you<00:03:31.720> massage<00:03:32.139> it<00:03:32.169> in<00:03:32.410> for<00:03:32.620> one<00:03:32.799> minute<00:03:33.099> and

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
you massage it in for one minute and

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.520 
you massage it in for one minute and
then<00:03:33.669> you<00:03:33.790> need<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:33.970> rinse<00:03:34.269> for<00:03:34.599> between<00:03:35.260> five

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
then you need a rinse for between five

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.110 
then you need a rinse for between five
and<00:03:35.560> ten<00:03:35.950> minutes<00:03:35.980> depending<00:03:36.340> on<00:03:36.849> the<00:03:36.940> length

first seven minutes because my hair is

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.220 
first seven minutes because my hair is
kind<00:03:41.590> of<00:03:41.769> thick<00:03:42.040> but<00:03:42.370> it's<00:03:42.549> not<00:03:43.120> too<00:03:43.480> long<00:03:43.750> so

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
kind of thick but it's not too long so

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.140 
kind of thick but it's not too long so

rinsing it for seven minutes I believe

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.629 
rinsing it for seven minutes I believe
was<00:03:46.870> good<00:03:47.049> enough<00:03:47.260> after<00:03:47.889> that<00:03:48.129> you<00:03:48.340> need<00:03:48.459> to

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
as if I was to bleach it but it was

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.189 
as if I was to bleach it but it was
still<00:04:15.669> enough<00:04:16.030> that<00:04:16.479> it<00:04:16.810> was<00:04:16.930> a<00:04:16.959> very

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
still enough that it was a very

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.800 
still enough that it was a very
uncomfortable<00:04:17.919> feeling<00:04:18.160> to<00:04:18.609> have<00:04:19.239> had<00:04:19.449> I<00:04:19.479> felt

uncomfortable feeling to have had I felt

this<00:04:22.479> and<00:04:22.780> I'm<00:04:22.930> not<00:04:22.960> sure<00:04:23.620> if<00:04:24.159> this<00:04:24.400> is<00:04:24.550> because

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
this and I'm not sure if this is because

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.129 
this and I'm not sure if this is because
I<00:04:24.909> didn't<00:04:25.330> dye<00:04:25.419> my<00:04:25.659> hair<00:04:25.690> with

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
suggest to do after I remove the color

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.659 
suggest to do after I remove the color
but<00:04:30.400> it<00:04:31.330> did<00:04:31.900> tend<00:04:32.379> to<00:04:32.499> go<00:04:32.650> back<00:04:33.009> to<00:04:33.340> more<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.550> a

but it did tend to go back to more of a
pinky<00:04:34.240> color<00:04:34.599> not<00:04:35.409> really<00:04:35.710> pink<00:04:36.340> pink<00:04:36.610> as<00:04:36.789> it
