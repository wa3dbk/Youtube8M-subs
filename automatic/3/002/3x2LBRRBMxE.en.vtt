about<00:01:13.770> studies<00:01:14.250> backing<00:01:14.610> up<00:01:14.729> supplements<00:01:15.270> so

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
about studies backing up supplements so

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.660 
about studies backing up supplements so
I'm<00:01:15.869> really<00:01:16.080> big<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.619> one<00:01:16.799> here<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.520> that

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
I'm really big on this one here but that

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.249 
I'm really big on this one here but that
study<00:01:17.909> was<00:01:18.000> done<00:01:18.210> about<00:01:18.299> four<00:01:18.600> scoops<00:01:18.960> for

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
study was done about four scoops for

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.260 
study was done about four scoops for
most<00:01:19.470> people<00:01:19.799> i<00:01:19.890> do<00:01:19.950> recommend<00:01:20.340> four<00:01:20.970> scoops

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
most people i do recommend four scoops

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.149 
most people i do recommend four scoops
it<00:01:21.479> also<00:01:21.720> claims<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.140> states<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.770> very

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
it also claims that states that very

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.609 
it also claims that states that very
clearly<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.880> back<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.299> supplement<00:01:24.810> so

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
clearly on the back of the supplement so

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.399 
clearly on the back of the supplement so
essentially<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.610> 90<00:01:26.970> serving<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.420> really<00:01:27.900> 45

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
essentially this 90 serving is really 45

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.520 
essentially this 90 serving is really 45
and<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.220> one's<00:01:29.430> really<00:01:29.820> 15<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.020> i<00:01:31.049> think<00:01:31.170> four

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
and this one's really 15 so i think four

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.020 
and this one's really 15 so i think four
scoops<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.130> definitely<00:01:32.520> what<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.759> want<00:01:32.939> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
scoops is definitely what you want to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.200 
scoops is definitely what you want to
take<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.479> as<00:01:33.659> far<00:01:34.350> as<00:01:34.560> consumption<00:01:35.100> during<00:01:35.939> a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
take in as far as consumption during a

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.039 
take in as far as consumption during a
workout<00:01:37.460> so<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:39.570> know<00:01:39.659> having<00:01:39.930> that

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
workout so that you know having that

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.620 
workout so that you know having that
said<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.979> think<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.729> best<00:01:41.970> time<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.390> take<00:01:42.570> a

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
said I think the best time to take a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.719 
said I think the best time to take a
product<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.590> during<00:01:44.100> your<00:01:44.280> workout

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
product like this is during your workout
