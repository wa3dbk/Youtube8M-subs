00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.090
 with the video Mr. Cordalis I have 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.840
 understood there is something else 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.180
 is correct 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.720
 It would only be business like 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:11.180
 showbusiness showbusiness is like that 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:14.060
 Everything was not real, he had to 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.390
 may not be true people can be 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.150
 and not a karaoke singer but 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.000
 properly your own personality 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.500
 be validated by his 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.519

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:56.709
 kanji merkel he can dance at all 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.540
 concentrate or let himself be 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.060
 distract from the pretty dancers 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.030

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.040

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.169
