 this phalaenopsis dwarf why 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.099
 dwarf because it is three times 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.489
 less of this and indeed it is more 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.559

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.329
 dwarf phalaenopsis part replant 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.760
 you don't need him right away because 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.480
 comfortable and even an hour numerous 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.930
 potty 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.950
 Well, when he starts to wallow like that 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.670
 me for example 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.399
 lead, yes, he already got out completely 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.780
 even a little prisoh but then he polish 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.930
 here and here there are dry roots that we 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.299
 with you now we will cut him transplanted him 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.280
 ask me where are we from 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.040
 little bucket will be transplanted 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.590
 very easy do not bother with pots 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.229
 they are very expensive and not worth it 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.790
 to buy them for this from me 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.130
 using ordinary plastic 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.130
 prospector as you see it twice 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.520
 more than the most common stavra chicco 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.979
 I did it in the usual and a knife here 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.439
 Here are holes for this is 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.600
 a must for any orchid so 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.520
 like shopping cups there are such 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.229
 holes for what it is for it to be 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.740
 aired the cars and not to 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.369
 there was a flag menu there for this 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.470
 I take my favorite dwarf orchid 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.140
 how to become equal to me blooms bright blue 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.479
 even purple so color necessarily 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.610
 I will share photos with you when he has 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.840
 I bloom dwarf blooms 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.420
 orchid unlike large pollinosis 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.189
 Sans half a year if big phalaenopsis 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.800
 if you liked your but i'm a cat 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:12.410
 can even reduce a whole year or there times 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.120
 in three months that little dwarf 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:21.080
 blooms only once every six months and so I 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.480
 for this doing here for this I will 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.840
 use a pruner and I will 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.450
 needed to cut off 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.840
 old-aged 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.690
 here are such dried roots they are not for us 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:41.000
 need them cut off easily don't be afraid 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:52.970
 they are dry they are no longer needed orchids 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:57.200
 we cut see was was a piece of bhav in 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:01.780
 This moss will leave here by the way, too, very 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.780
 need an orchid it also keeps moisture 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:18.500
 it's the same old roots 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.510
 so don't be afraid to cut them off 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.209
 the plant is no longer needed only can 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.209
 call because you don't need to cut them off 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.359
 here by the way, note this 3 branches 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.419
 that were already sending me 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:39.859
 data on phalaenopsis dwarf was three 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:43.400
 years gave hi glasses they stay when 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:45.919
 Iâ€™ll cut them off completely 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.549
 Well, now the fun will be 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:49.560
 transplant 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.780
 God, we leave it to her already 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.940
 fasten like this because god 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.500
 keeps us wet 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:02.010
 take a glass of flax bark by the way girls 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.940
 punishment to know she did not shop she 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:09.269
 of our collected from the usual large 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:12.510
 I washed the pieces then steamed it 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.250
 then dry-heat closet it on 250 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.070
 degrees and probably not but been there 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.350
 somewhere you can half an hour if it is not much 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.169
 it was wet if it dried up 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.990
 for whom hours for such a dwarf 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:28.560
 Hideki are very large pieces therefore 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.600
 we cut them thread and finish here 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.880
 These are the most important things for you to understand. 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.560
 if they try to 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.260
 let them be so small 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.910
 clumsy they keep moisture in 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.720
 because we take the largest 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:47.870
 large layered pieces here cut off 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.870
 leave and throw 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.409
 since my he give a little wait 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.479

 plant carefully plant the roots of this 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.840
 root leave because if we have it 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:21.560
 there we shove it we will break it very 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.560
 fragile and throw further 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:38.779
 hold don't be afraid to go there 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.779
