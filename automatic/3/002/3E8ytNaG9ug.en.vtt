Garrett

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.240 

it's<00:01:33.280> really<00:01:33.580> nice

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:02:13.040 

but<00:01:41.250> so

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:03:21.000 

you

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:04:07.820 

you

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.430 

so<00:04:08.830> I<00:04:08.860> said<00:04:09.250> earlier<00:04:09.520> it's<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:10.030> 21st<00:04:10.840> of<00:04:11.170> May

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
so I said earlier it's the 21st of May

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.010 
so I said earlier it's the 21st of May
2011<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:12.640> it's<00:04:12.820> been<00:04:13.030> exactly<00:04:13.300> 12<00:04:13.720> months

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
2011 and it's been exactly 12 months

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.370 
2011 and it's been exactly 12 months
since<00:04:14.590> I<00:04:14.740> passed<00:04:14.980> by<00:04:15.220> foot<00:04:15.580> bike<00:04:15.790> license<00:04:16.270> so<00:04:16.900> I

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
since I passed by foot bike license so I

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.810 
since I passed by foot bike license so I
can't<00:04:17.800> believe<00:04:18.010> first<00:04:18.310> of<00:04:18.430> all<00:04:18.489> how<00:04:18.550> quickly

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
can't believe first of all how quickly

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.470 
can't believe first of all how quickly
it's<00:04:19.090> gone

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
it's gone

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.840 
it's gone
but<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:20.470> most<00:04:20.650> important<00:04:21.250> update<00:04:21.489> I<00:04:21.520> guess<00:04:21.730> is

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
but the most important update I guess is

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.750 
but the most important update I guess is
that<00:04:21.970> I<00:04:22.030> still<00:04:22.390> haven't<00:04:22.630> got<00:04:22.840> a<00:04:22.870> bike<00:04:23.760> and

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
that I still haven't got a bike and

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
that I still haven't got a bike and
that's<00:04:24.910> due<00:04:25.090> to<00:04:25.120> many<00:04:25.690> reasons<00:04:26.340> but<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.780> most

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
that's due to many reasons but the most

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.570 
that's due to many reasons but the most
important<00:04:29.200> thing<00:04:29.350> is<00:04:29.500> about<00:04:29.740> I<00:04:29.800> hope<00:04:30.130> to<00:04:30.310> be<00:04:30.460> on

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
important thing is about I hope to be on

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.460 
important thing is about I hope to be on
the<00:04:30.670> road<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.090> have<00:04:31.210> a<00:04:31.240> bike<00:04:31.480> by<00:04:31.720> September<00:04:32.320> of
