00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.420
 in later minutes and I bring you a 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.010
 video of then a mod like this and mozart 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.380
 block launcher is very unstable and 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.700
 fact is a complement of a pk that 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.320
 has to install to you to be able to 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.849
 have what are effects of positions 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.410
 without having to make a 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.390
 server in fact this I saw it in 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.680
 broths in this morning so all 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.160
 tweets when I did the I do not know exactly 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.829
 where the creators took it to went to escape 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.140
 they take but well I saw it in the channel 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.850
 12 and many were asking us from 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.110
 days ago but the problem is that 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.469
 we had brought because we were 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.269
 on April 8 and block launcher does not work 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.949
 well he does not work for me in the wii 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.050
 what simply does not open is closed 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.589
 then I will return 7 to show 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.089
 this is worth mentioning that it may be 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.129
 problem with the will 8 since you can 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.539
 this in the will 9 work well so 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.190
 have the same present if you want to return 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.960
 to the apec will 7 to my page 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.179
 facebook as always not removed and the 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.739
 link and fire not said that we're going to 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.870
 start here is a little different the 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.090
 issue is no longer with our name we 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.580
 we put point effects now I notice that I 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.560
 a little bit of d 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.350
 of the air that install this I do not know by 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.840
 what does not happen to you too 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.780
 effect let's put speed 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.090
 we put the time for example about 30 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.799
 seconds and then the power that by 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.759
 example let's put about 3 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.619
 I do not want to be so fast and you see 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.719
 in three it looks like this ridiculously 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.789
 stretched everything until next chorus to put him 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.890
 7 and you see everything horrible the camera 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.840
 he turned around and everything moved and well 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.689
 we have the speed in 3 the truth that is 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.500
 see very location see let's move it to 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:48.579
 options or people where I am 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.860
 wow you see that it looks super crazy and they are 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.789
 20 different effects of positions that 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.770
 I'm going to have to leave them in the 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.179
 description a link to a page where 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.829
 come all the list of them are the 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.360
 I showed the embryo video I showed this 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.299
 but well let's show them by 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.079
 example now is the swim one becomes one 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.079
 of those who most 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.500
 nausea in a second with about 10 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.959
 seconds nothing and we will put has 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.819
 increased to 8 to see what happens 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.740
 look for the first point to work 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.060
 effect then the name of the effect is 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.430
 low bone destruction is nothing 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.770
 spears younger are several are 20 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.840
 then we put the time in this 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.120
 case I put 10 that are 10 seconds and this 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.890
 is I put 8 which is the power level 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.290
 I want it to have the effect if they put 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.060
 one is going to be the basic effect and they put 2 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.640
 a little stronger so avoid putting 8 that 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.200
 I think it 's a lot, let's see what happens and 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.170
 wow in this game 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.670
 this is it would take pretty fucked ok ya 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.590
 it ended was brief but well there they are 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.209
 this and as I tell you, it may have 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.950
 a lot may not work, maybe 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.170
 same I do not know on my device not 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.940
 it works but if you and the wii what 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.500
 it works for them then perfect to lower that 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.480
 link of the last blog iron on the 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.000
 description that as I told you is the link 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.290
 always used the link that I left them and 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.480
 you always know how to load a version 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.660
 because that's what the creator did and we're going to 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.660
 watch 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.660
 to see to see that another good effect the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:20.070
 fire resistance is not very useful I 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:23.670
 me for 30 seconds not for 300 seconds and 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:27.680
 let's boost it in 2 to the stand or 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.680
 best in 3 sugar max jump 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.080
 it's not so high we're going to put it off 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.260
 point is 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.960
 bewkes 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.960
 young 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.970
 200 seconds and we empower it to be 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.760
 a 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.120
 you can 55 to see what happens super super 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.930
 jump 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.209
 wow wow egg egg 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.030
 ok this just as a precaution see if you 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.620
 can 55 the effect is very powerful and 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.790
 well we are created as the video 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.980
 what I brought them how are servers 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.810
 but this can be done already 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.280
 directly on your maps 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.689
 or else use commands and everything is a 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.659
 little uncomfortable but good for now 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:10.609
 that's how it is and the truth works very well 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.260
 that I really liked it can perform 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.879
 aui 7 if April 8 does not work anyway 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.070
 may agÃ¼il 9 already work have 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.850
 there APEC has kept what 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.949
 is this add-on 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.419
 it is simply installed at the beginning 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.009
 it may blanch it from an error or 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.680
 something like that they should simply continue and 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.840
 jobs abnormal and that more than more then the 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.400
 people cross everything in this video all 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.490
 the effects is to lower in the destruction 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.080
 in a link to a very minecraft forum 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.780
 pretty where comes what the 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.190
 resistance to fire what is the 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.090
 poisoning what is the jump to the 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.520
 speed 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.580
 They are slow enough that efe 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.919
 can add very good also from the 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.900
 force and then nothing I think it's all for 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.460
 this video if they take care of the link of the freckle 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.340
 of this complement the description together 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.500
 with the block launcher along with everything 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.000
 what is necessary for them to have all this and 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.350
 also to who is wondering what am 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.150
 doing in this pixelar good of that 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.330
 pixel application ams that I brought them 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.669
 two days ago in which they can 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.100
 you print what are photos in 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.050
 pixel art for those who like to do 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.180
 pixel art now more easily and then 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.180
 nothing is the video synth they take care
