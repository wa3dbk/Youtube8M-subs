00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
so I'm assuming you used the long

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.150 
so I'm assuming you used the long
bristles<00:01:13.070> for<00:01:13.370> the<00:01:14.210> lashes<00:01:14.810> ooh<00:01:15.080> I<00:01:15.800> can

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
bristles for the lashes ooh I can

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:23.850 
bristles for the lashes ooh I can

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.040 

like<00:01:24.860> that<00:01:25.160> it's<00:01:25.430> like<00:01:25.760> long<00:01:26.510> bristles

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
like that it's like long bristles

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.750 
like that it's like long bristles
because<00:01:27.500> it<00:01:27.620> almost<00:01:28.010> feels<00:01:28.340> like<00:01:28.490> you're

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
because it almost feels like you're

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.800 
because it almost feels like you're
doing<00:01:29.120> it<00:01:29.240> with<00:01:29.450> like<00:01:30.260> an<00:01:30.440> eyelash<00:01:30.860> comb<00:01:31.810> and

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
doing it with like an eyelash comb and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.810 
doing it with like an eyelash comb and
you<00:01:32.960> can<00:01:33.110> kind<00:01:33.320> of<00:01:33.410> get<00:01:33.620> out<00:01:33.860> all<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.400> clumps

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
you can kind of get out all the clumps

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.290 
you can kind of get out all the clumps
as<00:01:35.390> you're<00:01:35.720> putting<00:01:35.900> it<00:01:36.140> on<00:01:36.940> which<00:01:37.940> is<00:01:38.090> always

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
as you're putting it on which is always

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.090 
as you're putting it on which is always
nice<00:01:40.750> if<00:01:41.750> you<00:01:41.870> like<00:01:41.930> it<00:01:42.200> really<00:01:42.380> gets<00:01:42.710> all<00:01:42.920> the

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
nice if you like it really gets all the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.010

eyelashes<00:01:43.700> I<00:01:44.090> don't<00:01:44.360> know<00:01:44.480> if<00:01:44.540> you<00:01:44.660> can<00:01:44.780> tell

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
eyelashes I don't know if you can tell

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.500 
eyelashes I don't know if you can tell
because<00:01:45.170> my<00:01:45.470> eyelashes<00:01:46.040> are<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:46.670> short<00:01:47.180> but

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
because my eyelashes are so short but

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.170 
because my eyelashes are so short but
this<00:01:48.470> is<00:01:48.680> actually<00:01:49.130> working<00:01:49.280> really<00:01:49.610> well<00:01:49.760> in

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
this is actually working really well in

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.180 
this is actually working really well in
comparison<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.930> other<00:01:51.110> mascaras<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:51.830> I<00:01:51.950> have

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
comparison to other mascaras that I have

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.970 
comparison to other mascaras that I have
used<00:01:52.430> on<00:01:52.760> my<00:01:53.300> little<00:01:53.570> short<00:01:53.900> sparse<00:01:54.350> straight

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
used on my little short sparse straight

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.180 
used on my little short sparse straight
eyelashes<00:01:55.640> I<00:01:55.850> like<00:01:56.690> that<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.680> brush<00:01:57.950> the

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
eyelashes I like that the brush the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.950 
eyelashes I like that the brush the
bristles<00:01:58.640> are<00:01:58.760> really<00:01:59.030> long<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.480> straight<00:01:59.780> so

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
bristles are really long and straight so

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.050 
bristles are really long and straight so
it<00:02:00.050> almost<00:02:00.230> combs<00:02:00.770> it<00:02:01.040> out<00:02:01.250> as<00:02:01.460> you're<00:02:01.820> putting

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
it almost combs it out as you're putting

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.200 
it almost combs it out as you're putting
it<00:02:02.300> on<00:02:02.480> so<00:02:03.260> it<00:02:03.380> keeps<00:02:03.590> your<00:02:04.210> eyelashes

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
it on so it keeps your eyelashes

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.460 
it on so it keeps your eyelashes
separated<00:02:05.720> so<00:02:05.840> they're<00:02:05.990> not<00:02:06.110> all<00:02:06.290> like

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
separated so they're not all like

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.410 
separated so they're not all like
clumped<00:02:06.890> together<00:02:06.979> and<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:08.030> can<00:02:08.210> definitely

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
clumped together and I can definitely

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.340 
clumped together and I can definitely
see<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.080> lot<00:02:09.290> more<00:02:09.770> volume<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.729> length<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:15.230> it

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
see a lot more volume and length and it

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.320 
see a lot more volume and length and it
dries<00:02:15.590> pretty<00:02:15.620> fast<00:02:16.040> too<00:02:16.610> because<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.060> lot<00:02:17.300> of

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
dries pretty fast too because a lot of

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.600 
dries pretty fast too because a lot of
times<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:17.810> feel<00:02:17.989> like<00:02:18.290> after<00:02:18.590> I<00:02:19.160> put<00:02:19.340> my<00:02:19.370> mascara

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
times I feel like after I put my mascara

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.670 
times I feel like after I put my mascara
on<00:02:20.030> when<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.270> blink<00:02:20.660> I<00:02:20.840> can<00:02:21.050> feel<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.410> kind<00:02:21.560> of

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
on when I blink I can feel it kind of

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.590 
on when I blink I can feel it kind of
going<00:02:21.980> everywhere<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:23.000> you<00:02:23.060> can<00:02:23.300> see<00:02:23.450> the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
going everywhere so you can see the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.510 
going everywhere so you can see the
difference<00:02:23.989> between<00:02:24.140> this<00:02:24.530> eye<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:24.800> this<00:02:25.220> eye

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
difference between this eye and this eye

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.979 
difference between this eye and this eye
I<00:02:25.790> know<00:02:25.880> you<00:02:26.000> could<00:02:26.209> probably<00:02:26.300> tell<00:02:26.630> a<00:02:26.690> lot

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
I know you could probably tell a lot

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.750 
I know you could probably tell a lot
better<00:02:27.260> if<00:02:27.590> your<00:02:27.890> eyelashes<00:02:28.430> are<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:28.610> lot

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
better if your eyelashes are a lot

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.390 
better if your eyelashes are a lot
thicker<00:02:29.000> or<00:02:29.270> longer<00:02:29.300> but<00:02:30.290> for<00:02:30.500> me<00:02:30.709> because<00:02:31.160> my

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
thicker or longer but for me because my

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.120 
thicker or longer but for me because my
eyelashes<00:02:31.970> are<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.180> short<00:02:32.450> sparse<00:02:33.020> and<00:02:33.350> very

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
eyelashes are a short sparse and very

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.850 
eyelashes are a short sparse and very
few<00:02:34.610> if<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.510> works<00:02:35.750> on<00:02:35.989> me<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.230> feel<00:02:36.530> like<00:02:36.650> it'll

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
few if it works on me I feel like it'll

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.370 
few if it works on me I feel like it'll
work<00:02:37.100> on<00:02:37.280> anyone<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.150> anyways<00:02:38.690> I<00:02:38.840> really<00:02:38.900> like

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
work on anyone so anyways I really like

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.770 
work on anyone so anyways I really like
the<00:02:39.530> formula<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:40.340> usually<00:02:41.120> use<00:02:41.330> like<00:02:41.600> the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
the formula I usually use like the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.810 
the formula I usually use like the
falsies<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.560> I've<00:02:42.709> been<00:02:42.890> using<00:02:43.100> another<00:02:43.520> one

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
falsies and I've been using another one

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.590 
falsies and I've been using another one
one<00:02:44.600> of<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.810> new<00:02:45.020> ones<00:02:45.260> what's<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.560> called<00:02:45.770> I

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
one of the new ones what's it called I

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.550 
one of the new ones what's it called I
forget<00:02:47.600> what<00:02:47.720> it's<00:02:47.840> called<00:02:48.020> it's<00:02:48.200> like<00:02:48.350> in<00:02:48.470> an

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
forget what it's called it's like in an

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.949 
forget what it's called it's like in an
orange<00:02:48.800> tube<00:02:49.100> which<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.489> also<00:02:49.640> really<00:02:50.150> like<00:02:50.330> but

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
orange tube which I also really like but

orange tube which I also really like but
I<00:02:50.989> really<00:02:51.260> like<00:02:51.410> this<00:02:51.590> formula<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.100> I

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
I really like this formula and I

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.580 
I really like this formula and I
actually<00:02:52.370> really<00:02:52.850> like<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.810> brush<00:02:54.080> so

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
actually really like the brush so
