00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello to all and lease no case I hope 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.339
 that you're fine in any case me that 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.509
 goes nickel so today in this 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.919
 video i'm going to show you a few 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.530
 little novelties that he had in this 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.200
 dlc is all the problems that rockstar 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.370
 corrected so with this update and 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.470
 you will see that frankly there is 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.130
 a lot of two problems that have been 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.570
 solved 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.550
 and frankly it's really fun 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.920
 and you will see also that they have so 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.029
 benefited to remove certain things and 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.920
 its part that we find that it is a little 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.599
 more is generating so it's all gone 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.400
 first a new option the one at 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.140
 santos custom now allows you to add 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.110
 or remove the roofs of vehicles 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.520
 who have versions without you 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.559
 sales prices of these vehicles have 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.010
 has been reviewed in connection with this 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.050
 change 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.000
 so that's not bad for example for 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.649
 the coquette or vehicles like that if 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 you never want it without the roof 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.070
 where to go this custom there is a small 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.469
 option and you can remove it from 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.700
 heats that it's really not bad 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.770
 then when you call a keystroke 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.539
 an indicator display 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.989
 now to show the distance from 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.940
 jet 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.600
 so when the jet is close 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.309
 the indicator turns red at the month you 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.750
 you know pretty much where we are flying 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.600
 and when is it necessary to start 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.430
 covered correction of a problem that 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.439
 made sure that the t-shirts won 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.420
 as a reward was not 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.640
 correctly unblock so for example 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.140
 imagined for robberies if you 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.360
 break the head to make the challenges and all 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.560
 and that in the end the t-shirt does not know 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.540
 to unblock frankly it had to 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.299
 to be pretty boring and the rockstar the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.490
 correct then here we have the 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.320
 croo challenges lists were removed 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.509
 so that I think it's really 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.850
 it's still pretty boring 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.189
 earn money and sen we will say 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.540
 legally with his little challenges and I 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.409
 find it really unfortunate that he has them 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.479
 later removed some weapons were 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.850
 rebalanced so the machine gun and the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.009
 combat machine gun now inflicts 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.560
 more damage and the shotgun 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.670
 Dassault is now less effective in 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.439
 longer distances 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.759
 so small small corrections 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.770
 at the level of weapons 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.299
 the bob cargo hook can not 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.890
 raised the vehicles of the players in 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.210
 passive mode 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.759
 fix a problem that was doing in 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.860
 so that the harness bag will turn 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.030
 in sports bag so remember the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.429
 little glitch that's a bit too 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.690
 pity he pulled it off and that I 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.280
 find that's what will happen there 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.680
 it's the 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.900
 the most pity thing he can there 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.690
 have the back door of the post 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.819
 font is now locked on gta 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.080
 5 online so remember when the 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.850
 robberies have arrived everyone 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.890
 was happy that the back door 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.450
 so the police station was opened 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.280
 there they come to close it I 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.260
 think it's a shame 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.400
 we allowed a few parents to 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.110
 those who make trailers that 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.130
 want to have fun 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.680
 it's the only place we can 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.569
 could come back so asked as we 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.130
 said in prison cells and that 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.830
 could savor doing so a little 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.420
 more so then the roller coaster 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.970
 are no longer invisible when they are 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.310
 far preview and therefore corrections from 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.720
 problem that duplicates and the panels of the 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.120
 dynasty quickly remember in front 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.860
 the apartment especially on ps3 we saw 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.110
 all the time so the front panel 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.370
 the stoere team that duplicates itself is 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.980
 as it gives the top it was really 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.739
 2 disgusting and they finally corrected 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.880
 see if it will not come back later 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.910
 then he if we have novelties so 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.250
 which have been added on ps4 xbox one and 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.140
 pc only so the hood view to the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.600
 first person has been added for 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.239
 ps4 and xbox one versions as it was 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.100
 already available on the pc version so 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.170
 to activate the hood view at the first 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.150
 no one must go into start and 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.700
 settings there is a new tab that has 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.720
 been added looking for a little bit but 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.880
 unfortunately so when you 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.380
 activate it you take away the first view 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.540
 nobody where we see the steering wheel and 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.150
 the car's habitat so after that's 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.430
 it's up to you to choose more accessories 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.680
 been added to the gta interactions menu 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.630
 5 online players can now 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.370
 change show them their chains and 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.470
 their earrings from 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.989
 menu accessories section 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.519
 interactions then it becomes a 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.190
 little hotter so the dancers of the 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.200
 vanni to unicorn now removes their 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.170
 water during private dances on the 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.959
 ps4 xbox one versions of gta 5 online 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.239
 improvements have been made to the 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.489
 vibration force of the levers the 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.310
 number of female dancers unicorn a 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:10.010
 been increased on gta 5 online for 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.420
 match with the story mode and that 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.660
 then I think it's really not 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.430
 wrong 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.669
 the vehicles are going to be really 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.840
 deformed on ps4 xbox live and pc 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.579
 after 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.040
 after being typed for example with 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.960
 baseball bats or weapons of 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.250
 melee and that frankly I 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.680
 think it's really stylish to have 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.180
 a little more realism in the game so 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.800
 then there is still a very very 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.900
 big list of corrections that have been 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.160
 so brought in I did not all wanted 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.840
 say in the video it would really be 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.860
 very long and not everything is very 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.360
 interesting to know 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.860
 so me what I'm going to do is that 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.690
 I will put you the link of this post 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.919
 in the description like that if ever 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.229
 you want to go see for yourself 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.790
 you can but be honest 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.620
 I believe there are at least more than 100 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.850
 correction it's really huge all the 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.620
 all the bugs that there were in the 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.940
 robberies have been corrected 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.650
 full of bugs on the online frankly 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.790
 they really fix everything months in 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.660
 this video I told you the most 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.610
 important to know 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.130
 but if you want to see that in detail I 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.360
 you put the link in the description 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.380
 and so we come to the end of 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.030
 this video I really hope she 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.590
 Did you feel free to drop a 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.820
 little blue thumb if that's the case and at 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.840
 subscribe if it's not already done 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.700
 it will make me really happy 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.620
 I stole it is on these images I 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.740
 tell you all good game and shock everything 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.740
 the world
