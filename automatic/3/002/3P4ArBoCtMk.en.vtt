00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890

really<00:00:35.219> run<00:00:35.399> out<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.910> material<00:00:36.420> too<00:00:37.110> fast<00:00:37.469> I'll

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
really run out of material too fast I'll

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.930 
really run out of material too fast I'll
upload<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.969> video<00:00:39.300> once<00:00:40.230> every<00:00:40.620> two<00:00:40.890> weeks<00:00:40.940> so

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
upload a video once every two weeks so

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.000 
upload a video once every two weeks so
instead<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.480> every<00:00:42.870> week<00:00:43.110> once<00:00:43.530> every<00:00:43.649> two

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
instead of every week once every two

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.700 
instead of every week once every two
weeks<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.660> after<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.870> there<00:00:46.079> might<00:00:46.260> be<00:00:46.289> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
weeks and after that there might be a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.889 
weeks and after that there might be a
short<00:00:46.920> period<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.520> majors<00:00:48.059> not<00:00:48.270> uploading

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
short period of majors not uploading

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.529 
short period of majors not uploading
anything<00:00:49.110> at<00:00:49.379> all<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.489> keep<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.300> mind

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
anything at all so you keep that in mind

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.160 
anything at all so you keep that in mind
because<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.440> focus<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:53.039> my<00:00:53.250> studies

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
because I have to focus on my studies

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.389 
because I have to focus on my studies
let's<00:00:55.170> see<00:00:55.410> what<00:00:55.559> else<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:55.980> say<00:00:56.280> oh

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
let's see what else to have to say oh

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.709 
let's see what else to have to say oh
yeah<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.969> after<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:58.020> stopped<00:00:58.890> making<00:00:59.309> videos

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
yeah so after I stopped making videos

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.080 
yeah so after I stopped making videos
consistently<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:01.410> guess<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:02.039> might<00:01:02.550> start

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
consistently I guess I might start

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.690
