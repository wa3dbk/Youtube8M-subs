one<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.570> concepts<00:00:10.050> that's<00:00:10.260> been

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:10.470 
one of the concepts that's been

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.830 
one of the concepts that's been
developed<00:00:10.950> over<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.280> last<00:00:11.309> decade<00:00:12.000> or<00:00:12.030> so<00:00:12.210> in

breast cancer is the concept of what's

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.880 
breast cancer is the concept of what's
called<00:00:16.439> neoadjuvant<00:00:17.040> chemotherapy<00:00:18.890> meaning

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
called neoadjuvant chemotherapy meaning

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.980 
called neoadjuvant chemotherapy meaning
that<00:00:20.130> rather<00:00:20.400> than<00:00:20.790> giving<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.270> chemotherapy

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
that rather than giving the chemotherapy

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.830 
that rather than giving the chemotherapy
after<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.590> surgery<00:00:23.090> the<00:00:24.090> chemotherapy<00:00:24.810> is

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
after the surgery the chemotherapy is

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.279 
after the surgery the chemotherapy is
given<00:00:24.990> before<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.710> surgery<00:00:26.630> the<00:00:27.630> reasons<00:00:28.050> for

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
given before the surgery the reasons for

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.550 
given before the surgery the reasons for
that<00:00:28.500> are<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.859> couple<00:00:29.210> number<00:00:30.210> one<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.840> hope

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
that are a couple number one is to hope

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.549 
that are a couple number one is to hope
to<00:00:31.830> shrink<00:00:32.220> the<00:00:32.369> tumor<00:00:32.780> such<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:34.050> one<00:00:34.290> might

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
to shrink the tumor such that one might

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.920 
to shrink the tumor such that one might
convert<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.309> patient<00:00:35.850> who<00:00:36.030> was<00:00:36.300> not<00:00:36.510> eligible

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
convert a patient who was not eligible

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.710 
convert a patient who was not eligible
for<00:00:37.199> breast<00:00:37.680> conserving<00:00:37.890> surgery<00:00:38.510> to<00:00:39.510> one

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
for breast conserving surgery to one

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.570 
for breast conserving surgery to one
that<00:00:39.960> can<00:00:40.260> have<00:00:40.589> breast<00:00:40.920> conserving<00:00:41.129> surgery

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
that can have breast conserving surgery

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.219 
that can have breast conserving surgery
and<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:43.320> other<00:00:43.470> benefit<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:45.049> monitor<00:00:46.049> the

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:46.229 
and the other benefit is to monitor the

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.640 
and the other benefit is to monitor the
response<00:00:46.409> of<00:00:47.040> that<00:00:47.280> patients<00:00:47.970> cancer<00:00:48.530> to<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
response of that patients cancer to the

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.430 
response of that patients cancer to the
chemotherapy<00:00:49.949> that<00:00:50.549> she<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.850> getting<00:00:51.440> when

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
chemotherapy that she is getting when

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.780 
chemotherapy that she is getting when
obviously<00:00:52.650> we<00:00:53.159> would<00:00:53.369> not<00:00:53.489> have<00:00:53.549> that

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
obviously we would not have that

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.850 
obviously we would not have that
information<00:00:54.629> if<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> chemotherapy<00:00:55.650> is<00:00:55.680> given

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
information if the chemotherapy is given

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.359 
information if the chemotherapy is given
after<00:00:56.369> the<00:00:56.610> surgery<00:00:57.739> one<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.830> the<00:00:58.920> initial

00:00:59.359 --> 00:00:59.369 
after the surgery one of the initial

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:00.979 
after the surgery one of the initial
hopes<00:00:59.610> was<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.330> by<00:01:00.540> giving<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
hopes was that by giving the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.950 
hopes was that by giving the
chemotherapy<00:01:01.739> before<00:01:01.979> surgery<00:01:02.720> one<00:01:03.720> might

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
chemotherapy before surgery one might

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.130 
chemotherapy before surgery one might
have<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> better<00:01:04.500> survival<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:06.420> idea<00:01:06.810> being

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
have a better survival the idea being

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.190 
have a better survival the idea being
that<00:01:07.320> if<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.070> surgeon<00:01:08.990> manipulates<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
that if the surgeon manipulates the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.710 
that if the surgeon manipulates the
cancer<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.130> breast<00:01:11.640> cancer<00:01:12.090> cells<00:01:12.390> are

cancer and breast cancer cells are

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.890 
cancer and breast cancer cells are
pushed<00:01:12.990> into<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> circulation<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.900> getting

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
pushed into the circulation that getting

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.470 
pushed into the circulation that getting
rid<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.320> all<00:01:16.710> those<00:01:16.890> cancer<00:01:17.400> cells<00:01:17.580> beforehand

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
rid of all those cancer cells beforehand

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.460 
rid of all those cancer cells beforehand
may<00:01:19.350> result<00:01:19.800> in<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.130> better<00:01:20.310> outcome

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
may result in a better outcome

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.800 
may result in a better outcome
unfortunately<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.680> did<00:01:22.920> not<00:01:22.950> happen<00:01:23.810> but

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
unfortunately that did not happen but

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.510 
unfortunately that did not happen but
for<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> two<00:01:25.380> reasons<00:01:25.800> I've<00:01:26.010> mentioned

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
for the two reasons I've mentioned

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.980 
for the two reasons I've mentioned
neoadjuvant<00:01:27.180> chemotherapy<00:01:27.710> is<00:01:28.710> given<00:01:29.220> to

neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.650 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given to
many<00:01:30.990> women<00:01:31.440> especially<00:01:32.280> women<00:01:32.700> with<00:01:33.030> larger

many women especially women with larger

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.780 
many women especially women with larger
cancers<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.440> one<00:01:34.650> hopes<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.190> convert<00:01:35.580> to

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
cancers that one hopes to convert to

cancers that one hopes to convert to
breast<00:01:36.060> conserving<00:01:36.240> surgery<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:39.510> question

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
breast conserving surgery the question

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.360 
breast conserving surgery the question
comes<00:01:40.830> up<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:42.330> this<00:01:42.570> case<00:01:42.840> especially<00:01:43.370> if

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
comes up in in this case especially if

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.280 
comes up in in this case especially if
we<00:01:44.730> have<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> superb<00:01:45.570> response<00:01:46.050> to

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
we have a superb response to

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.120 
we have a superb response to
chemotherapy

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
chemotherapy

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.920 
chemotherapy
that<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.240> by<00:01:48.720> physical<00:01:49.440> exam<00:01:49.830> or<00:01:50.220> by<00:01:50.640> MRI<00:01:51.120> or<00:01:51.600> by

that is by physical exam or by MRI or by

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.960 
that is by physical exam or by MRI or by
mammogram<00:01:52.670> we<00:01:53.670> find<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.330> cancer<00:01:54.780> has

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
mammogram we find that the cancer has

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.380 
mammogram we find that the cancer has
disappeared<00:01:57.170> are<00:01:58.170> we<00:01:58.500> certain<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:59.190> we<00:01:59.580> still

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
disappeared are we certain that we still

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.710 
disappeared are we certain that we still
need<00:02:00.600> surgery<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:02.700> answer<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.150> that<00:02:03.180> question

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
need surgery the answer to that question

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.820 
need surgery the answer to that question
at<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.320> point<00:02:04.470> is<00:02:04.920> yes<00:02:06.170> no<00:02:07.170> one<00:02:07.350> has<00:02:07.590> done<00:02:07.770> a

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
at this point is yes no one has done a

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.990 
at this point is yes no one has done a
trial<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.549> date<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:10.170> look<00:02:11.009> at<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.340> question<00:02:11.790> of

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
trial to date to look at the question of

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.449 
trial to date to look at the question of
are<00:02:12.870> there<00:02:13.170> patients<00:02:13.769> who<00:02:13.890> don't<00:02:14.159> need

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
are there patients who don't need

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.480 
are there patients who don't need
surgery<00:02:15.500> one<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.680> reasons<00:02:17.069> for<00:02:17.130> that<00:02:17.310> is

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
surgery one of the reasons for that is

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.880 
surgery one of the reasons for that is
that<00:02:18.000> there's<00:02:18.240> no<00:02:18.450> way<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.720> we<00:02:19.110> can<00:02:19.319> tell<00:02:19.560> by

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
that there's no way that we can tell by

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.110 
that there's no way that we can tell by
any<00:02:20.480> physical<00:02:21.480> exam

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
any physical exam

any physical exam
or<00:02:22.319> radiologic<00:02:23.319> modality<00:02:24.069> that<00:02:24.280> indeed<00:02:25.239> there

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
or radiologic modality that indeed there

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.309 
or radiologic modality that indeed there
are<00:02:25.510> no<00:02:25.930> cancer<00:02:26.409> cells<00:02:26.680> left<00:02:27.010> behind

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
are no cancer cells left behind

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.930 
are no cancer cells left behind
oftentimes<00:02:29.319> when<00:02:29.799> we<00:02:30.099> have<00:02:30.340> what's<00:02:30.610> called<00:02:30.790> a

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
oftentimes when we have what's called a

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.780 
oftentimes when we have what's called a
complete<00:02:31.330> response<00:02:31.659> clinically<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.799> is<00:02:33.610> by

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
complete response clinically that is by

complete response clinically that is by
physical<00:02:34.239> exam<00:02:34.599> and<00:02:34.840> by<00:02:34.989> x-ray<00:02:35.530> we<00:02:36.370> often<00:02:36.730> find

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
physical exam and by x-ray we often find

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.509 
physical exam and by x-ray we often find
residual<00:02:37.629> tumor<00:02:37.900> in<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.440> tumor<00:02:38.769> bed<00:02:38.950> at<00:02:39.280> the

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
residual tumor in the tumor bed at the

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:40.559 
residual tumor in the tumor bed at the
time<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:39.970> surgery

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
time of surgery

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.229 
time of surgery
that<00:02:41.319> surgery<00:02:41.799> being<00:02:42.069> either<00:02:42.340> lumpectomy<00:02:43.209> or

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
that surgery being either lumpectomy or

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.949 
that surgery being either lumpectomy or
mastectomy<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:45.280> we<00:02:45.730> we<00:02:46.239> don't<00:02:46.420> know<00:02:46.569> the

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
mastectomy so we we don't know the

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.619 
mastectomy so we we don't know the
answer<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.500> question<00:02:48.090> now<00:02:49.090> if<00:02:49.360> in<00:02:49.540> the

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
answer to the question now if in the

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.589 
answer to the question now if in the
future<00:02:49.840> we<00:02:50.349> have<00:02:51.310> some<00:02:51.610> technique<00:02:52.150> to

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
future we have some technique to

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.500 
future we have some technique to
absolutely<00:02:53.349> answer<00:02:53.769> that<00:02:53.980> question<00:02:54.489> then<00:02:55.329> it

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
absolutely answer that question then it

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.240 
absolutely answer that question then it
would<00:02:55.629> be<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.810> reasonable<00:02:56.079> question<00:02:56.829> to<00:02:56.859> try<00:02:57.190> to

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
would be a reasonable question to try to

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.470 
would be a reasonable question to try to
answer<00:02:57.670> by<00:02:57.940> some<00:02:58.269> trial<00:02:59.340> when<00:03:00.340> we<00:03:00.519> do<00:03:00.730> find<00:03:01.120> at

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
answer by some trial when we do find at

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.900 
answer by some trial when we do find at
the<00:03:01.629> time<00:03:01.810> of<00:03:02.049> surgery<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:03.280> there<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:03.640> no

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
the time of surgery that there is no

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.699 
the time of surgery that there is no
remaining<00:03:04.329> cancer<00:03:04.930> then<00:03:05.739> that's<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:07.530> gives<00:03:08.530> us

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
remaining cancer then that's a gives us

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.940 
remaining cancer then that's a gives us
important<00:03:09.310> prognostic<00:03:10.090> information<00:03:10.950> the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
important prognostic information the

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.160 
important prognostic information the
