okay<00:00:01.500> in<00:00:01.589> today's<00:00:01.890> lesson<00:00:02.100> we're<00:00:02.310> gonna<00:00:02.370> talk

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
okay in today's lesson we're gonna talk

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.190 
okay in today's lesson we're gonna talk
about<00:00:02.879> adding<00:00:03.270> and<00:00:03.330> subtracting<00:00:03.840> real

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
about adding and subtracting real

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.110 
about adding and subtracting real
numbers<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:05.370> course<00:00:05.580> you've<00:00:05.730> been<00:00:05.759> doing

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
numbers and of course you've been doing

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.030 
numbers and of course you've been doing
addition<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.600> subtraction<00:00:07.140> since<00:00:07.410> as<00:00:07.830> far

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
addition and subtraction since as far

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.589 
addition and subtraction since as far
back<00:00:08.220> as<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.429> can<00:00:08.519> remember<00:00:08.910> but<00:00:09.210> now<00:00:09.450> we're

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
back as you can remember but now we're

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:10.669 
back as you can remember but now we're
gonna<00:00:09.719> start<00:00:09.929> dealing<00:00:10.200> with<00:00:10.290> negative

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
gonna start dealing with negative

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.959 
gonna start dealing with negative
numbers<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.250> things<00:00:11.460> are<00:00:11.580> going<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.759> look<00:00:11.849> a

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
numbers and things are going to look a

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.299 
numbers and things are going to look a
little<00:00:12.210> bit<00:00:12.420> different<00:00:12.840> but<00:00:13.380> really<00:00:13.769> it's<00:00:14.070> no

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
little bit different but really it's no

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.620 
little bit different but really it's no
different<00:00:14.670> than<00:00:14.730> any<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.210> math<00:00:15.389> you've

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
different than any of the math you've

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.939 
different than any of the math you've
done<00:00:15.809> before<00:00:16.199> we<00:00:16.320> just<00:00:16.410> need<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.680> learn<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.859> few

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
done before we just need to learn a few

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.580 
done before we just need to learn a few
rules<00:00:17.869> let<00:00:18.869> me<00:00:18.960> write<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.140> few<00:00:19.350> things<00:00:19.470> down

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
rules let me write a few things down

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.790 
rules let me write a few things down
first<00:00:20.010> that'll<00:00:20.550> help<00:00:20.670> us<00:00:20.820> as<00:00:21.000> we<00:00:21.119> go<00:00:21.740> some<00:00:22.740> of

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
first that'll help us as we go some of

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.609 
first that'll help us as we go some of
this<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.010> going<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.189> be<00:00:23.310> obvious<00:00:24.170> I<00:00:25.170> want<00:00:25.529> you

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
this is going to be obvious I want you

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.230 
this is going to be obvious I want you
to<00:00:25.710> write<00:00:25.890> these<00:00:26.039> down<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.609> remember<00:00:27.060> them

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
to write these down and remember them

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.040 
to write these down and remember them
when<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.170> add<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.380> positive<00:00:29.340> number<00:00:30.019> to<00:00:31.019> a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
when you add a positive number to a

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.770 
when you add a positive number to a
positive<00:00:31.830> number<00:00:32.040> you're<00:00:33.030> always<00:00:33.270> going<00:00:33.690> to

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
positive number you're always going to

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.020 
positive number you're always going to
get<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.320> positive<00:00:34.739> number<00:00:35.219> that's<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
get a positive number that's the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.209 
get a positive number that's the
universal<00:00:36.420> truth<00:00:36.809> positive<00:00:37.800> plus<00:00:38.010> positive

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
universal truth positive plus positive

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.430 
universal truth positive plus positive
is<00:00:38.700> positive<00:00:39.079> if<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.800> add<00:00:42.050> me<00:00:43.050> right<00:00:43.200> over

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
is positive if you add me right over

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.010 
is positive if you add me right over
here<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.770> negative<00:00:44.370> number<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> negative

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
here a negative number to a negative

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.319 
here a negative number to a negative
number<00:00:46.649> you're<00:00:46.980> always<00:00:47.280> gonna<00:00:47.760> get<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
number you're always gonna get a

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.170 
number you're always gonna get a
negative<00:00:48.629> number<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.860> far<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:51.030> not

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
negative number so so far it's it's not

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.689 
negative number so so far it's it's not
too<00:00:51.390> terribly<00:00:51.539> hard<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:53.420> to<00:00:54.420> understand<00:00:54.870> okay

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
too terribly hard to to understand okay

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.560 
too terribly hard to to understand okay
positive<00:00:56.699> positive<00:00:56.789> gives<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.180> positive

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
positive positive gives you positive

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.549 
positive positive gives you positive
negative<00:00:57.719> negative<00:00:58.020> gives<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.440> negative

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
negative negative gives you negative

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.049 
negative negative gives you negative
these<00:00:58.859> are<00:00:59.010> if<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.460> add<00:00:59.640> these<00:00:59.850> numbers

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
these are if you add these numbers

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.299 
these are if you add these numbers
together<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:01.350> only<00:01:01.440> time<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.890> becomes<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
together the only time it becomes a

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.100 
together the only time it becomes a
little<00:01:02.489> bit<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.270> know<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.480> have<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.750> use<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
little bit and you know we have to use a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.760 
little bit and you know we have to use a
few<00:01:04.379> brain<00:01:04.589> cells<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.400> add<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:06.770> positive

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
few brain cells is if you add a positive

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.200 
few brain cells is if you add a positive
to<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> negative<00:01:08.880> number<00:01:10.100> then<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.670> resulting

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
to a negative number then the resulting

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.090 
to a negative number then the resulting
sign<00:01:13.250> can<00:01:14.250> either<00:01:14.549> be<00:01:14.880> positive<00:01:15.509> or<00:01:16.100> negative

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
sign can either be positive or negative

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.420 
sign can either be positive or negative
and<00:01:18.080> whichever<00:01:19.080> sign<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.560> put<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.950> front<00:01:20.250> is

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
and whichever sign you put in front is

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.929 
and whichever sign you put in front is
going<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.700> depend<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:22.100> what<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.250> actually<00:01:23.460> add

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
going to depend on what you actually add

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.190 
going to depend on what you actually add
here<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.299> gonna<00:01:24.390> depend<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.780> which<00:01:24.990> ones

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
here it's gonna depend on which ones

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.440 
here it's gonna depend on which ones
bigger<00:01:25.500> basically<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.270> positive

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
bigger basically if if the positive

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.830 
bigger basically if if the positive
number<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.080> bigger<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:30.119> final<00:01:30.450> results<00:01:30.750> going

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
number is bigger the final results going

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.210 
number is bigger the final results going
to<00:01:30.900> be<00:01:30.990> positive<00:01:31.470> if<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.650> negative<00:01:32.100> real

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
to be positive if the negative real

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.530 
to be positive if the negative real
number<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.520> bigger<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.909> final<00:01:33.210> result<00:01:33.509> is

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
number is bigger the final result is

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.450 
number is bigger the final result is
going<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.750> be<00:01:33.840> negative<00:01:34.070> we're<00:01:35.070> gonna<00:01:35.189> see

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
going to be negative we're gonna see

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.490 
going to be negative we're gonna see
this<00:01:35.790> time<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.540> time<00:01:36.659> again<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> problems

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
this time and time again in the problems

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.230 
this time and time again in the problems
I<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.650> wanted<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.220> write<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.430> down<00:01:38.640> it'll

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
I just wanted to write that down it'll

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.090 
I just wanted to write that down it'll
help<00:01:39.360> us<00:01:39.540> as<00:01:39.630> we<00:01:39.750> go<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.110> let's<00:01:40.290> go<00:01:40.860> through

help us as we go so let's go through

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.330 
help us as we go so let's go through
some<00:01:41.130> simple<00:01:41.790> baby<00:01:42.060> problems<00:01:42.450> here<00:01:42.630> four<00:01:43.619> plus

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
some simple baby problems here four plus

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.149 
some simple baby problems here four plus
eight<00:01:44.790> equals<00:01:46.310> twelve<00:01:47.810> okay<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.649> think

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
eight equals twelve okay that is I think

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.160 
eight equals twelve okay that is I think
you<00:01:50.250> guys<00:01:50.430> will<00:01:51.299> all<00:01:51.540> agree<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.110> is

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
you guys will all agree that that is

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.840 
you guys will all agree that that is
correct

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
correct

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.010 
correct
positive<00:01:53.850> plus<00:01:54.060> positive<00:01:54.509> gives<00:01:54.720> me<00:01:54.840> positive

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
positive plus positive gives me positive

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.420 
positive plus positive gives me positive
and<00:01:55.350> all<00:01:55.439> I've<00:01:55.619> done<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.799> add<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.310> absolute

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
and all I've done is add the absolute

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.420 
and all I've done is add the absolute
values<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.540> numbers<00:01:57.770> which<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.950> positive

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
values of the numbers which is positive

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.330 
values of the numbers which is positive
and<00:01:59.700> it<00:02:00.119> gives<00:02:00.270> me<00:02:00.390> 12<00:02:00.630> no<00:02:00.990> problem<00:02:01.380> now<00:02:02.100> let's

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and it gives me 12 no problem now let's

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.630 
and it gives me 12 no problem now let's
take<00:02:02.610> something<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.540> hair<00:02:03.750> different

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
take something just a hair different

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.910 
take something just a hair different
minus<00:02:05.640> three<00:02:06.090> also<00:02:06.930> known<00:02:07.049> as<00:02:07.170> negative<00:02:07.409> three

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
minus three also known as negative three

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.949 
minus three also known as negative three
plus<00:02:09.470> negative<00:02:10.790> seven<00:02:11.790> what<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.840> going

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
plus negative seven what is that going

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.730 
plus negative seven what is that going
to<00:02:13.050> equal<00:02:13.319> well

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
to equal well

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.760 
to equal well
I'm<00:02:14.520> adding<00:02:15.090> two<00:02:15.270> things<00:02:15.510> together<00:02:15.690> one<00:02:16.680> of

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
I'm adding two things together one of

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.050 
I'm adding two things together one of
them<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:16.950> negative<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.730> other<00:02:17.880> one's

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
them is negative the other one's

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.000 
them is negative the other one's
negative<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.930> answer<00:02:19.290> according<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.770> this<00:02:19.860> is

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
negative the answer according to this is

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.240 
negative the answer according to this is
going<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.250> be<00:02:20.460> negative<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:22.650> it's<00:02:22.950> going<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.100> be

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
going to be negative so it's going to be

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.190 
going to be negative so it's going to be
negative<00:02:23.460> number<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.480> what<00:02:24.720> do<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:24.870> actually

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
negative number and what do you actually

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.590 
negative number and what do you actually
put<00:02:25.440> here<00:02:25.590> well<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:26.220> add<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:27.450> absolute

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
put here well you add the absolute

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.170 
put here well you add the absolute
values<00:02:27.960> here<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.740> it's<00:02:29.190> three<00:02:29.460> plus<00:02:29.700> seven<00:02:29.880> is

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
values here so it's three plus seven is

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.710 
values here so it's three plus seven is
10<00:02:30.530> so<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:32.460> actual<00:02:32.820> answer<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.120> 10<00:02:35.630> there's<00:02:36.630> a

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
10 so the actual answer is 10 there's a

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.900 
10 so the actual answer is 10 there's a
bunch<00:02:37.020> of<00:02:37.110> theory<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.740> can<00:02:37.890> go<00:02:38.040> into<00:02:38.460> figuring

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
bunch of theory you can go into figuring

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.820 
bunch of theory you can go into figuring
out<00:02:39.240> how<00:02:39.570> to<00:02:39.600> how<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.870> do<00:02:40.080> all<00:02:40.260> this<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.650> why

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
out how to how to do all this and why

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:41.720 
out how to how to do all this and why
it's<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:41.220> way

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
it's this way

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.510 
it's this way
but<00:02:42.240> in<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.510> nutshell<00:02:42.630> if<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:44.070> your<00:02:44.190> number

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
but in a nutshell if this is your number

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.350 
but in a nutshell if this is your number
line<00:02:44.700> like<00:02:45.330> this<00:02:45.800> okay<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.520> is<00:02:47.700> zero<00:02:48.030> and

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
line like this okay and this is zero and

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.180 
line like this okay and this is zero and
these<00:02:48.780> are<00:02:48.930> all<00:02:49.080> negative<00:02:49.620> numbers<00:02:49.980> you've

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
these are all negative numbers you've

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.090 
these are all negative numbers you've
got<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:51.150> know<00:02:51.270> negative<00:02:51.780> 1<00:02:52.020> negative<00:02:52.830> 2

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
got you know negative 1 negative 2

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.580 
got you know negative 1 negative 2
negative<00:02:53.400> 3<00:02:54.150> negative<00:02:54.360> 4<00:02:54.870> negative<00:02:54.900> 5<00:02:55.350> another

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
negative 3 negative 4 negative 5 another

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.140 
negative 3 negative 4 negative 5 another
six<00:02:55.980> negative<00:02:56.370> stuff<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.730> then<00:02:56.820> there's<00:02:56.970> 8

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
six negative stuff and then there's 8

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.670 
six negative stuff and then there's 8
negative<00:02:57.360> 9<00:02:57.690> negative<00:02:57.720> 10<00:02:58.350> so<00:02:58.530> this<00:02:58.620> is

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
negative 9 negative 10 so this is

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.890 
negative 9 negative 10 so this is
negative<00:02:59.070> 10<00:02:59.250> over<00:02:59.490> here<00:02:59.520> and<00:03:00.120> this<00:03:00.750> is

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
negative 10 over here and this is

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.960 
negative 10 over here and this is
negative<00:03:01.260> 3<00:03:01.650> negative<00:03:02.600> 4<00:03:03.600> negative<00:03:04.970> 5

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
negative 3 negative 4 negative 5

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.410 
negative 3 negative 4 negative 5
negative<00:03:06.570> 6<00:03:07.530> negative<00:03:07.920> 7<00:03:08.930> this<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:09.990> negative<00:03:10.500> 3

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
negative 6 negative 7 this is negative 3

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.490 
negative 6 negative 7 this is negative 3
okay<00:03:12.420> right<00:03:13.260> there<00:03:15.020> you're<00:03:16.020> already<00:03:16.290> at

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
okay right there you're already at

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.940 
okay right there you're already at
negative<00:03:16.860> 3<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.400> I'm<00:03:18.060> adding<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.990> 7<00:03:19.800> more

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
negative 3 and I'm adding to it 7 more

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.560 
negative 3 and I'm adding to it 7 more
negative<00:03:20.460> numbers<00:03:20.790> which<00:03:21.030> means<00:03:21.240> I'm<00:03:21.390> going

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
negative numbers which means I'm going

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.890 
negative numbers which means I'm going
to<00:03:21.630> be<00:03:21.780> going<00:03:21.900> left<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:23.250> I'm<00:03:23.340> gonna<00:03:23.460> go<00:03:23.640> 1<00:03:23.940> 2<00:03:24.210> 3<00:03:24.510> 4

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
to be going left so I'm gonna go 1 2 3 4

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.110 
to be going left so I'm gonna go 1 2 3 4
5<00:03:25.170> 6<00:03:25.530> 7<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.310> that's<00:03:26.370> how<00:03:26.580> you<00:03:26.640> end<00:03:26.730> up<00:03:26.970> at

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
5 6 7 and that's how you end up at

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.080 
5 6 7 and that's how you end up at
negative<00:03:27.150> 10<00:03:28.250> that's<00:03:29.250> kind<00:03:29.460> of<00:03:29.520> a<00:03:29.610> graphical

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
negative 10 that's kind of a graphical

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.670 
negative 10 that's kind of a graphical
representation<00:03:30.420> but<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:30.900> really<00:03:31.260> think<00:03:31.440> that

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
representation but I really think that

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.930 
representation but I really think that
you<00:03:31.770> should<00:03:31.800> just<00:03:32.070> kind<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.280> dispense<00:03:32.760> with

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
you should just kind of dispense with

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.180 
you should just kind of dispense with
that<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.390> just<00:03:34.020> try<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.260> do<00:03:34.800> a<00:03:34.830> bunch<00:03:35.100> of

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
that and just try to do a bunch of

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.860 
that and just try to do a bunch of
problems<00:03:35.400> here<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:36.000> you'll<00:03:36.120> understand<00:03:36.630> as

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
problems here and you'll understand as

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.660 
problems here and you'll understand as
we<00:03:36.990> go<00:03:37.020> negative<00:03:37.830> plus<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.010> negative<00:03:38.070> gives<00:03:38.550> me

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
we go negative plus a negative gives me

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.250 
we go negative plus a negative gives me
negative<00:03:38.790> that's<00:03:39.360> pretty<00:03:39.660> much<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.960> simple

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
negative that's pretty much the simple

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.140 
negative that's pretty much the simple
way<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.410> say<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:40.800> another<00:03:41.520> way<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.820> write<00:03:42.090> this

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
way to say it another way to write this

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.630 
way to say it another way to write this
you'll<00:03:42.960> see<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.380> as<00:03:43.560> we<00:03:43.710> go<00:03:43.830> along<00:03:43.860> but<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.460> want

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
you'll see it as we go along but I want

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.640 
you'll see it as we go along but I want
to<00:03:44.700> make<00:03:44.820> you<00:03:44.970> aware<00:03:45.630> that<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:46.350> don't<00:03:46.530> need

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
to make you aware that you don't need

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.190 
to make you aware that you don't need
these<00:03:46.830> parentheses<00:03:47.180> explicitly<00:03:48.180> you<00:03:49.050> can

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
these parentheses explicitly you can

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.160 
these parentheses explicitly you can
write<00:03:49.380> this<00:03:49.500> as<00:03:49.680> negative<00:03:50.070> 3<00:03:50.900> when<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:51.990> have

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
write this as negative 3 when you have

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.080 
write this as negative 3 when you have
plus<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.830> negative<00:03:53.190> number<00:03:53.340> it's<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:53.880> same

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
plus a negative number it's the same

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.710 
plus a negative number it's the same
thing<00:03:54.300> as<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.480> minus<00:03:55.430> minus<00:03:56.430> that<00:03:56.580> number<00:03:57.030> so

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
thing as a minus minus that number so

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.820 
thing as a minus minus that number so
this<00:03:57.930> is<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.260> exact<00:03:58.680> same<00:03:58.980> thing<00:04:00.470> negative<00:04:01.470> 3

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
this is the exact same thing negative 3

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.040 
this is the exact same thing negative 3
plus<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.280> negative<00:04:02.400> 7<00:04:03.030> is<00:04:03.210> the<00:04:03.510> same<00:04:03.720> as

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
plus a negative 7 is the same as

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.470 
plus a negative 7 is the same as
negative<00:04:04.440> 3<00:04:04.680> minus<00:04:05.130> 7<00:04:05.310> when<00:04:05.940> you<00:04:06.030> have<00:04:06.150> plus

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
negative 3 minus 7 when you have plus

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.990 
negative 3 minus 7 when you have plus
negative<00:04:06.510> like<00:04:07.320> that<00:04:07.530> it's<00:04:08.460> just<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.790> same

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
negative like that it's just the same

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.370 
negative like that it's just the same
thing<00:04:09.030> as<00:04:09.300> a<00:04:09.330> minus<00:04:09.720> sign<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:09.930> that<00:04:10.110> makes

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
thing as a minus sign and that makes

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.560 
thing as a minus sign and that makes
sense<00:04:10.620> because<00:04:10.770> here<00:04:11.250> I'm<00:04:11.430> adding<00:04:12.209> a<00:04:12.330> negative

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
sense because here I'm adding a negative

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.810 
sense because here I'm adding a negative
number<00:04:13.010> adding<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.100> negative<00:04:14.340> number<00:04:14.550> is

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
number adding a negative number is

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.370 
number adding a negative number is
pretty<00:04:15.360> much<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.720> same<00:04:15.900> thing<00:04:16.200> as

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
pretty much the same thing as

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.560 
pretty much the same thing as
subtraction<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:17.910> all<00:04:18.090> this<00:04:18.209> negative

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
subtraction so all this negative

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.150 
subtraction so all this negative
positive<00:04:19.020> business<00:04:19.109> is<00:04:19.440> just<00:04:19.650> addition<00:04:19.890> and

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
positive business is just addition and

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.190 
positive business is just addition and
subtraction<00:04:20.700> you<00:04:21.510> know<00:04:21.600> which<00:04:21.750> is<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:21.900> same

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
subtraction you know which is the same

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.510 
subtraction you know which is the same
thing<00:04:22.380> you've<00:04:22.530> been<00:04:22.560> dealing<00:04:22.890> with<00:04:23.040> all<00:04:23.340> your

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
thing you've been dealing with all your

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.640 
thing you've been dealing with all your
life
