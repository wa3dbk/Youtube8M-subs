00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.970 
vision in my head of ooh I want to wear
that<00:00:48.180> together<00:00:48.450> whereas<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.140> may<00:00:49.410> not<00:00:49.590> think<00:00:49.829> of

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
that together whereas I may not think of

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.250 
that together whereas I may not think of
it<00:00:50.160> if<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.579> like<00:00:50.850> stuffed<00:00:51.660> away<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.110> drawer

it if it's like stuffed away in a drawer

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.770

or an armoire or something like that so

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.920 
or an armoire or something like that so
I<00:00:54.809> guess<00:00:55.160> organization<00:00:56.160> isn't<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.940> big<00:00:57.480> deal<00:00:57.510> as

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
