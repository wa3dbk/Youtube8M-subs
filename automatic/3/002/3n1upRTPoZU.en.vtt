00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hello friends very soon on the screens 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.230
 5 out of Thrones season games and the most 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.320
 time to talk about books 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.660
 find out why song flames are improving 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.690
 fantasy saga lately and 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.029
 why Russian publishers should burn 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.029
 in hell and of course we will look at the cover 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.350
 Generally in Russia the stove and the flame 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.750
 It came out in different series of some 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.210
 some have been bent so far 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.590
 but probably the most popular 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.220
 known that I can remain 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.500
 show this two series both at-st here 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.129
 such a movie cover more budget 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.790
 option accordingly with screenshots from 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.890
 TV series and more expensive on white paper 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.540
 publications in the people of this shell and 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.090
 nicknamed martin 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.250
 they differ in price naturally nude 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.089
 for example not to take it from the ceiling 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.100
 p 445 this 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:07.159
 685 that is, I estimate well, about 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.680
 200 hundred rubles to overpay for 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.620
 white paper says the movie is better 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.960
 Cover and figure I will not take just 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.870
 because this is a matter of taste to me cinema 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.659
 the cover does not like but someone like 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.850
 no question at all, but not the problem 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.570
 In fact, in general, figs with them with 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.960
 covers it is generally a conversation 2 but for 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.890
 what does a publisher need to tear off 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.670
 Publishers and with t -legs and a little head 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.570
 unscrew them 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.970
 stupidly for what's inside 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.360
 this cover because they are all 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.240
 fuck up start with the fact that he is the first 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.190
 Russian edition of the book shoot nikov 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.290
 they just took two heads and threw out 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:58.390
 just threw a glade there is no more 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:01.400
 frame high circulation then they managed and 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.890
 Chapter 5 included only with the wrong 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:08.420
 rough translation is what people thought 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.530
 so cult work 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:16.700
 make such huge shoals you 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.060
 you say okay you can forgive mistakes 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.560
 once but nifigashenki 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.489
 each book comes out with some 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.340
 jambs every book is serious and if 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.560
 the first more or less then it begins 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.819
 some sort of orgy because in each 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.830
 the book can include additional 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.960
 material is quite large 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.240
 applications there told about the story 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.210
 great houses some characters and 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.420
 described some events 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.910
 remain outside the narrative and all 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.640
 this is important because the author has included it in 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.200
 a book but our edition thought 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.760
 publishing thought yah nafig 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.190
 do without them and 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.370
 the book is thinner and in the hands to hold 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.620
 convenient nafig same thrown a bunch 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.830
 applications let's say in the first book she 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.410
 still there is in the second is no further further 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.320
 worse they start interfering with them 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.510
 confused redo not report 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.760
 somewhere a card is not laid out somewhere 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.280
 something not yet included and all this some 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.580
 madness why not take and do 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.270
 as in the original here is the book of the knight of seven 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.630
 kingdoms 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.750
 which is a prequel to the whole saga 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.310
 that is, the events that are described here 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.980
 Does that before stagnation 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.610
 described in the books in the saga itself 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.410
 main 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:41.740
 and what they did they lived included 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:45.580
 application of either 3 or 4 books 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.010
 just like that time a gift to you and you 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.790
 allowed only meet to catch 1 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.650
 your book you open avn from at the end 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.680
 a bunch of spoilers 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:00.370
 just all zaspoylery there is and about 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.030
 bloody wedding and well i won't be you 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.790
 check 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.250
 but there is everything in these books 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.440
 that is, no attention can begin or may 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.340
 afford to spoil everything just percent 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.530
 appendices to this book and yet 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.410
 however a couple sharpened the Russians 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.669
 publishers read and books psd and flame 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:24.400
 still worth it seriously because it's 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.590
 better fantasy saga last 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.410
 time for me this defeat is worth 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.120
 on a par with the lord of the rings and I was 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.940
 quite difficult to read because I 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.440
 started reading just after the series and on 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.110
 actually the show is very detailed 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.650
 repeats the book in the future some 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.190
 there is a deviation well, let's say 1 is 2 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.960
 books 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.030
 sometimes harasa so that frames are taken 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.160
 one-to-one, that is, you read a book and 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.260
 such a miracle to read the script you 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.599
 arises in the head and nato picture 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.230
 which was on your television screen 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.450
 or 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.430
 not the torus and in general to the TV series am 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.310
 I think very well that he is completely 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.460
 manages, according to the flesh, the spirit that is in 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:06.040
 books but still that fullness of sensations 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.850
 will see from the westros who created the author 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.610
 can only read books and I think 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.380
 that the one who will open you the chance to book it 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.120
 not so easy really because 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.270
 all the same here is such 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.940
 tumor naiad fantasy to read it hard 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.880
 because a lot of names a lot of events 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.490
 time you get confused read the dialogue 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.920
 I am trying to figure out the cheese and there 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.260
 barista lister which is where i come from 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.240
 I know who he is therefore at the beginning 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.040
 have to wade through the big 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.860
 number of names sort out 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:41.710
 what is happening that who who whom whom 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.290
 have to but when you become introduce 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.420
 your company into the board 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:50.650
 get pleasure is incredible therefore 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.930
 I advise you to read books anyway 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.090
 I will say goodbye to him on this 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.940
 I ask you to write in the comments 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.570
 you are a book and what edition like him 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.750
 treat 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:06.550
 and see you soon soon 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.470
 but this is where my friends sell 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.410
 author t-shirts with the image of the 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:16.260
