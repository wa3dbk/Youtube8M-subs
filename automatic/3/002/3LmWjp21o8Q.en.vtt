00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.040
 let's see how to make the ninja star 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.340
 month star jobs also launch o 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.830
 stick as a decoration perhaps 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:14.040
 to the Christmas tree to the ninja star 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.619
 is done with two half sheets takes a 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.600
 square sheet you cut it and get two 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.220
 small pieces and the same with another 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.250
 local sheet held the two small pieces 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.130
 then instead be used in the same way 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.220
 just two whole sheets in the case of 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.000
 two whole sheets should look like one instead 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.250
 fold double practically so that you have to 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.950
 so now we get there let's see how it is 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.989
 then build this one we see 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.360
 it is made with a plain paper from these 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.760
 a normal 4 cat 80 grams is made 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.129
 with half of this, this is done 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.440
 with goal and this instead is made double 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.530
 then heavier using two sheets 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.039
 whole of licata paper you start it 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.480
 immediately with the folding must be 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.859
 obligate one in one way and one 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.970
 in the exact opposite we begin a 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.840
 fold we take it fold so 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.700
 in half 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.270
 we take the other we keep it so halfway 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.830
 folded in half 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.020
 let's fold it in half for 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.340
 this one towards this we do the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.979
 same thing 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.960
 at this point 1 contrary to the other 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.729
 so be very careful because if 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.460
 you are wrong continent towards del 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.600
 take the origami and fold it here 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.700
 to the right 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.720
 this is put in the same identical 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.329
 way 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.610
 he asks instead lost left not 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.470
 they were simple but if you're wrong this is the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.659
 towards the rest of the game you don't 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.759
 then a right and a left will come 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.619
 done this we proceed with 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.070
 our folds fold this other 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.750
 so done this we ask these in 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.900
 so that a species comes out 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.140
 of 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:58.690
 ds ok we explained so then 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.690
 we take this triangle and it 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.500
 is shown in this way the 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.810
 we take 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.510
 we bring it back in. we take it 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.340
 we bring it back in and we mark the same 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.040
 so what are we going to do with each other then 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.570
 climate then folds so after it 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.120
 we beat in such a way as to obtain 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.330
 a kind of s 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.060
 same thing also here so this 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.900
 will always go especially if then 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.450
 take this we put it this way 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.920
 we take this is we take it so we 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.410
 we already give the form we got 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.080
 makes us understand where we are going to end up 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.790
 something like this 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.440
 we are going to reopen our sheets which a 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.130
 this point have been employed in the 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.850
 right way 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.740
 matera we go open and dinners we support 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.260
 here on the table when we have this 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.360
 broad that I triangle with a kind of 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.980
 we support this pocket like this 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.350
 the other hand we support him in 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.269
 this way now this sheet than us 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.730
 we have already pre folded it will go to 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.860
 slip on so watch this big one 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.040
 pocket and fold and we go to put on 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.350
 inside this one very fine if you go to 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.880
 then slip under this other pocket 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.610
 we take this one 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.390
 we choose and put it in now 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.650
 we turn to the other side we take there 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.470
 so we're going to slip in so perfect 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.330
 and let's take this other tip here and there 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.550
 we're going to slip under here 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.940
 let's take the tip to this last point 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.550
 we take it and we put it on like this 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.920
 to us we got ours 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.290
 This star is already in a hurry 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.820
 of the rai with more care than average 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.560
 this not sheets of paper 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.690
 these instead with paper unless Bacchus 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.560
 they sing embroidery I can come to you 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.420
 beautiful 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.130
 colored and ninja stars in this way 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.319
 have fun 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.319
