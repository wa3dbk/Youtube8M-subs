hiya<00:00:08.490> so<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:08.790> just<00:00:08.969> wanted<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.209> make<00:00:09.330> a<00:00:09.360> video

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510

showing<00:00:09.900> you<00:00:09.959> a<00:00:10.049> pair<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.260> boots<00:00:10.440> that<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.619> found

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
showing you a pair of boots that I found

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.720 
showing you a pair of boots that I found
that<00:00:10.949> I<00:00:11.010> think<00:00:11.250> would<00:00:11.340> be<00:00:11.459> the<00:00:11.549> perfect

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
that I think would be the perfect

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.459 
that I think would be the perfect
cheaper<00:00:12.090> alternative<00:00:12.539> to<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:13.080> timberland

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
cheaper alternative to the timberland

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.289 
cheaper alternative to the timberland
boots<00:00:13.500> because<00:00:13.770> they<00:00:14.580> are<00:00:14.760> pretty<00:00:15.119> expensive

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
boots because they are pretty expensive

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.630 
boots because they are pretty expensive
and<00:00:15.869> a<00:00:16.230> lot<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.410> people<00:00:16.680> probably<00:00:17.190> don't<00:00:17.400> want

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
and a lot of people probably don't want

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.189 
and a lot of people probably don't want
to<00:00:17.699> spend<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:17.970> much<00:00:18.029> on<00:00:18.270> just<00:00:18.689> a<00:00:18.779> single<00:00:19.080> pair

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
to spend that much on just a single pair

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.999 
to spend that much on just a single pair
of<00:00:19.230> boots<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:20.250> these<00:00:20.820> are<00:00:21.179> black<00:00:22.199> Bessy<00:00:22.800> boots

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
of boots so these are black Bessy boots

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.710

nubuck leather just like the real
timberlands<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.550> the<00:00:41.550> laces<00:00:41.760> are<00:00:42.210> pretty

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
timberlands and the laces are pretty

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.660 
timberlands and the laces are pretty
similar<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.200> sole<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.130> really<00:00:44.370> heavy-duty

but<00:00:45.480> there<00:00:45.600> are<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> lot<00:00:45.720> less<00:00:45.960> stiff<00:00:46.350> than<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740 
but there are a lot less stiff than the

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.650 
but there are a lot less stiff than the
actual<00:00:46.950> timberlands<00:00:47.580> which<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.970> good<00:00:48.480> if

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
actual timberlands which is good if

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.570

working my timberlands and that was so

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.160 
working my timberlands and that was so
painful<00:00:52.970> this<00:00:53.970> is<00:00:54.240> what<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.780> inside<00:00:55.140> looks

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
painful this is what the inside looks

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.170 
painful this is what the inside looks
like<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.070> fleece<00:00:56.340> lining<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.910> these<00:00:57.030> are

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
like it's a fleece lining and these are

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.390 
like it's a fleece lining and these are
super<00:00:57.300> comfortable<00:00:57.810> and<00:00:58.020> fun<00:00:58.770> fact<00:00:59.010> when<00:00:59.340> you

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
super comfortable and fun fact when you

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.460 
super comfortable and fun fact when you
get<00:00:59.520> these<00:00:59.670> they<00:01:00.000> will<00:01:00.210> smell<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.480> candy<00:01:00.750> now

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
I'll just show you these I guess

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.539 
I'll just show you these I guess
compared<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> actual<00:01:03.540> timberlands

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
compared to the actual timberlands

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.560 
compared to the actual timberlands
side-by-side<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.820> don't<00:01:06.000> mind<00:01:06.119> how<00:01:06.299> dirty<00:01:06.479> my

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
side-by-side and don't mind how dirty my

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.480 
side-by-side and don't mind how dirty my
dreams<00:01:06.840> are<00:01:07.079> I<00:01:07.409> really<00:01:07.890> need<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.219> clean<00:01:08.399> them

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490

I'm<00:01:08.640> gonna<00:01:08.729> make<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> video<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.329> how<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.479> clean

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:09.749 
I'm gonna make a video on how I clean

I'm gonna make a video on how I clean
nubuck<00:01:10.049> leather<00:01:15.200> this<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.770> difference<00:01:17.070> is

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
nubuck leather this the difference is

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.219 
nubuck leather this the difference is
like<00:01:17.399> I<00:01:17.549> think<00:01:17.819> kind<00:01:17.999> of<00:01:18.090> make<00:01:18.210> these<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.630> better

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
like I think kind of make these a better

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.989 
like I think kind of make these a better
fashion<00:01:19.770> boot<00:01:19.950> because<00:01:20.429> they're<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> lot<00:01:20.850> less

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:20.999 
fashion boot because they're a lot less

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:23.239 
fashion boot because they're a lot less
bulky<00:01:21.420> than<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.659> real<00:01:21.780> timberlands<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:23.130> I

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:23.249 
bulky than the real timberlands like I

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.830 
bulky than the real timberlands like I
love<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:24.179> you're<00:01:24.329> a<00:01:24.359> little<00:01:24.420> bit<00:01:24.689> well

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.999 
also post a clip of me walking in both
of<00:01:27.810> these<00:01:27.929> so<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.319> can<00:01:28.530> further<00:01:28.770> get<00:01:28.979> a

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
of these so that you can further get a

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:38.289 
of these so that you can further get a
good<00:01:29.159> comparison

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.270 

they're<00:01:38.840> both<00:01:38.990> gorgeous<00:01:39.290> but<00:01:40.070> if<00:01:40.159> you're

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
they're both gorgeous but if you're

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.039 
they're both gorgeous but if you're
looking<00:01:40.549> for<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.759> cheaper<00:01:40.970> alternative<00:01:41.049> this

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
looking for a cheaper alternative this

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.499 
looking for a cheaper alternative this
is<00:01:42.320> definitely<00:01:43.000> something<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.149> look<00:01:44.329> into

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
is definitely something to look into

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:45.940 
is definitely something to look into
