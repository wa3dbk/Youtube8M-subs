00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.530
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.579
 Bergfest at the post e3 2013 videos 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.740
 here on tape.tv 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:15.659
 Today I introduce you the new game of 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.170
 the retro studios in more detail 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:19.349
 shape 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.330
 donkey kong country tropical fries too 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.220
 if I was personally I was not 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.349
 the only one is something else from me 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.119
 The texans would have liked that 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.839
 new two the donkey kong a good one 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.820
 to become a game 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.650
 I'm sure even today 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.300
 that it will be a really good game 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.650
 why because the demo really faked 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.600
 a total of four finished levels have the 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.670
 developer presents two of them 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.670
 normal a lost level and a 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.230
 boss fight first to the normal here 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.100
 one slips into the skin of donkey kong 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.410
 or 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.870
 in the ones of him and ebikon if you have to 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.670
 second goal is it's the numerous 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.190
 opponents and other obstacles too 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.330
 defeat or overcome and the goal 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.910
 almost reach 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.890
 and though tropical fries a 2d 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.450
 jump'n'run is the environment yet 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.489
 completely three-dimensional 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.560
 you notice that especially in the barrel 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.750
 Passagen because here the camera turns 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.730
 Often with the trajectory so that you can 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.130
 really the feeling gets in 3d too 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.230
 play even if this effect trivial 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.510
 sounds he gives the game but one 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.860
 completely new level 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.900
 but that's not the only reason why they do it 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.090
 normal levels of demo big fun 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.890
 you can already tell how much time the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.530
 developers into the technology 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.690
 donkey kongs field is so busy that 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.860
 One would like to exchange directly with didi 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.020
 he would jump on his back 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.300
 otherwise the game is already months 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.460
 before release the polish until vomiting 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.440
 everything looks sparkling clean it runs 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.530
 always soft and the environment 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.390
 come in hd really well valid 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.100
 especially the underwater sections yes 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.070
 you have heard right now, too 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.020
 let's see again diving there 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.610
 kay and also pretty fast there 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.400
 On the go, they feel too 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.940
 really good and you can see the opponents 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.120
 defeat 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.430
 a real living demo has but no 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.869
 complete water level while there was only 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.320
 a few sections in the levels in 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.880
 which one could or had to dive 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.530
 not least, the two control 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.830
 monkeys with wiimote and nunchuk too 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.020
 Well 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.310
 the finished game is then synonymous per 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.810
 gamepad be playable 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.090
 that was in the demo but unfortunately still 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.370
 not possible but it is already 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.040
 kinda scary that the 3d 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.840
 play super mario 3d world with the 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.140
 control cross which must remotely control 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.410
 while at tropical fries in 2d den 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.380
 analogue stick of the diet may use 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.540
 reversed world in loren devil falls the 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.370
 3d environment also directly on as well 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.769
 here the camera turns with if the 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.030
 Lore times lies apart otherwise has become 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.100
 not much changed here 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.590
 except, of course, the fact that the 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.750
 lore now has three hearts and one 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.760
 so not with a single mistake 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.850
 again from the front or the last 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.769
 checkpoint must start afresh though 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.570
 it sounds like these levels 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.030
 getting better is just the opposite 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.739
 the case because you no longer at 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.780
 my fault directly the temporal 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.850
 The levels can be even harder blessed 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.140
 but at the same time, they are still 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.940
 less frustrating 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.490
 I think that's a really good one 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.860
 decision 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.750
 last few words came to the boss 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.000
 He also made a lot of fun for me 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.860
 even if it was too easy 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.600
 but that should be finished 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.240
 play still change we know the speech 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.010
 Here I am looking forward to studying again 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.630
 Most run already at the predecessor 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.230
 the bosses were always absolute 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.240
 highlights 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.030
 and they seem to agree with that again 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.160
 the seemingly out of the circus 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.380
 escaped sea lion has funny attacks 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.380
 it changes twice and called 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.270
 also other animals to help apropos animals 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.190
 Incidentally, the story is about that 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.350
 dj and his monkey gang from your island 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.170
 were hunted and now over several 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.150
 islands tropical warm and friis cold 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.130
 have to fight back home 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.070
 viking animals from there 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.140
 as said donkey kong country tropical 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.700
 Fries is already doing a very good job 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.580
 impression and more importantly 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.370
 I would not have great fun just now 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.050
 3d returns on the 3ds would be played 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.150
 I am even looking forward with appropriate solutions 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.700
 so I have no way at the moment 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.140
 need and me are other jump'n runs 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.230
 in the same period on wii u 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.299
 seem somehow more confident 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.799
 i would just have an online coop but so 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.340
 what will we never do at nintendo wii 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.590
 experience 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.690
 It will be a pity a great game 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.190
 but as I said for sure and I will 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.620
 also determined to play sometime 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.910
 let's see what we new at gamescom 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.910
 shown by donkey kong
