I'm<00:02:24.569> getting<00:02:24.750> 28<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.500> 29<00:02:25.799> miles<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.489> gallon

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
I'm getting 28 to 29 miles to the gallon

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.630 
I'm getting 28 to 29 miles to the gallon
easily<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:28.709> know<00:02:28.799> driving<00:02:29.160> at<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.400> decent

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
easily and you know driving at a decent

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.370 
easily and you know driving at a decent
speed<00:02:30.440> this<00:02:31.440> has<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.650> 300<00:02:32.069> T<00:02:32.489> which<00:02:33.180> is

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
speed this has a 300 T which is

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.809 
speed this has a 300 T which is
supercharged

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
supercharged

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.960 
supercharged
so<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:36.299> know<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.720> uses<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.290> s4<00:02:37.769> motor<00:02:38.040> they<00:02:38.760> no

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
so you know it uses the s4 motor they no

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.120 
so you know it uses the s4 motor they no
longer<00:02:39.030> have<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.690> 4.2<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.739> now<00:02:40.890> it's<00:02:41.040> the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
longer have the 4.2 and now it's the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.020 
longer have the 4.2 and now it's the
four<00:02:41.459> ot

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
four ot

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.450 
four ot
so<00:02:43.660> things<00:02:44.440> have<00:02:44.620> changed<00:02:44.950> around<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.250> think

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
so things have changed around I think

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.760 
so things have changed around I think
that<00:02:45.550> Audi<00:02:45.730> is<00:02:45.910> trying<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.390> save<00:02:47.320> gas<00:02:47.740> and

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
that Audi is trying to save gas and

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.920 
that Audi is trying to save gas and
theory<00:02:48.310> even<00:02:48.550> though<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.730> 4.2<00:02:49.240> really<00:02:49.750> did

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
theory even though the 4.2 really did

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.530 
theory even though the 4.2 really did
good<00:02:50.050> it<00:02:50.740> got<00:02:51.010> great<00:02:51.400> gas<00:02:51.730> mileage<00:02:51.790> also

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
good it got great gas mileage also

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.760 
good it got great gas mileage also
because<00:02:52.780> of<00:02:52.900> course<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.350> aluminum

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
because of course the aluminum

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.950 
because of course the aluminum
spaceframe<00:02:54.190> as<00:02:54.970> for<00:02:55.210> technology

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
spaceframe as for technology

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.740 
spaceframe as for technology
this<00:02:56.260> car<00:02:56.500> is<00:02:56.590> where<00:02:56.800> it's<00:02:56.950> at<00:02:57.130> I<00:02:57.400> mean<00:02:57.820> inside

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
this car is where it's at I mean inside

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.620 
this car is where it's at I mean inside
the<00:02:58.930> Google<00:02:59.080> Maps<00:02:59.530> it's<00:03:00.370> just<00:03:00.760> it's<00:03:01.510> a

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
the Google Maps it's just it's a

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.080 
the Google Maps it's just it's a
spaceship<00:03:02.080> inside<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.620> lot<00:03:02.920> of<00:03:03.040> people<00:03:03.459> I<00:03:03.730> hear

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
spaceship inside a lot of people I hear

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.370 
spaceship inside a lot of people I hear
oh<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:05.800> nav<00:03:06.160> is<00:03:06.190> so<00:03:06.700> big<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.090> obtrusive<00:03:07.959> no

which<00:04:30.640> I<00:04:30.760> find<00:04:31.000> funny<00:04:31.210> because<00:04:31.570> this<00:04:31.750> is

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
which I find funny because this is

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.070 
which I find funny because this is
supposed<00:04:32.110> to<00:04:32.200> be<00:04:32.260> a<00:04:32.380> big<00:04:32.620> luxury<00:04:33.040> car<00:04:33.600> or<00:04:34.600> maybe

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
supposed to be a big luxury car or maybe

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.830 
supposed to be a big luxury car or maybe
people<00:04:35.350> see<00:04:35.680> it<00:04:35.770> as<00:04:35.860> an<00:04:35.980> s4<00:04:36.430> because<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.420> s4

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
people see it as an s4 because the s4

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.200 
people see it as an s4 because the s4
let's<00:04:38.590> face<00:04:38.800> it<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:39.040> a4<00:04:39.370> looks<00:04:39.610> a<00:04:39.730> lot<00:04:39.940> of<00:04:40.060> like

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
let's face it the a4 looks a lot of like

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.550 
let's face it the a4 looks a lot of like
this<00:04:40.470> if<00:04:41.470> it's<00:04:41.950> just<00:04:42.160> not<00:04:42.310> for<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.580> front

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
this if it's just not for the front

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.409 
this if it's just not for the front
that's<00:04:44.560> the<00:04:44.770> you<00:04:45.040> know<00:04:45.190> one<00:04:45.490> even<00:04:45.850> me<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:46.000> kind

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
that's the you know one even me I kind

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.000 
that's the you know one even me I kind
of<00:04:46.480> get<00:04:46.630> them<00:04:46.780> confused<00:04:46.960> sometimes<00:04:47.440> out<00:04:47.830> there

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
of get them confused sometimes out there

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.130 
of get them confused sometimes out there
on<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.250> road

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
on the road

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.020 
on the road
so<00:04:50.740> that's<00:04:50.890> one<00:04:51.100> of<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:51.280> things<00:04:51.490> that<00:04:51.670> I<00:04:51.700> see<00:04:52.000> a

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
so that's one of the things that I see a

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.910 
so that's one of the things that I see a
lot<00:04:52.210> of<00:04:52.390> people<00:04:52.570> now<00:04:52.870> know<00:04:53.110> without<00:04:53.440> ease<00:04:53.680> are

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
lot of people now know without ease are

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.770 
lot of people now know without ease are
they<00:04:54.190> all<00:04:54.370> want<00:04:54.700> them<00:04:54.910> but<00:04:55.300> they<00:04:55.420> want<00:04:55.630> them

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
they all want them but they want them

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.910 
they all want them but they want them
for<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.020> wrong<00:04:56.200> reason<00:04:56.560> they<00:04:56.650> want<00:04:56.860> it

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
for the wrong reason they want it

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.430 
for the wrong reason they want it
because<00:04:57.010> of<00:04:57.280> a<00:04:57.370> pair<00:04:57.610> of<00:04:57.700> headlights<00:04:57.850> and<00:04:58.440> some

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
because of a pair of headlights and some

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.490 
because of a pair of headlights and some
LEDs<00:05:00.010> I've<00:05:00.700> never<00:05:01.000> been<00:05:01.180> about<00:05:01.390> that<00:05:01.690> it<00:05:02.260> kind

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
LEDs I've never been about that it kind

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.680 
LEDs I've never been about that it kind
of<00:05:02.560> bothered<00:05:02.950> me<00:05:02.980> that<00:05:03.130> Audi<00:05:03.850> did<00:05:04.480> this

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
of bothered me that Audi did this

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.970 
of bothered me that Audi did this
because<00:05:04.990> I<00:05:05.020> know<00:05:05.140> he's<00:05:05.350> always<00:05:05.500> been<00:05:05.620> the<00:05:05.830> type

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
because I know he's always been the type

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.850 
because I know he's always been the type
of<00:05:06.160> company<00:05:06.550> where<00:05:06.820> they<00:05:07.750> would<00:05:07.990> sit<00:05:08.290> back<00:05:08.530> and

kind of lay low even with their s cars
you<00:05:12.490> know<00:05:12.610> it<00:05:13.510> was<00:05:13.690> very<00:05:13.900> subtle<00:05:14.290> vehicles<00:05:15.040> but

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
you know it was very subtle vehicles but

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.880 
you know it was very subtle vehicles but

a<00:05:38.960> lot<00:05:39.470> of<00:05:39.500> nice<00:05:39.680> features<00:05:40.070> this<00:05:40.190> thing<00:05:40.370> looks

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
a lot of nice features this thing looks

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.980 
a lot of nice features this thing looks
great<00:05:40.820> at<00:05:40.940> night<00:05:41.030> this<00:05:41.240> has<00:05:41.389> a<00:05:41.419> 8-speed

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
great at night this has a 8-speed

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.570 
great at night this has a 8-speed
transmission<00:05:42.199> why<00:05:42.800> I<00:05:42.830> don't<00:05:43.220> know<00:05:43.400> I<00:05:43.430> think

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
transmission why I don't know I think

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.129 
transmission why I don't know I think
it's<00:05:43.820> utterly<00:05:44.000> ridiculous<00:05:44.510> an<00:05:44.780> 8-speed

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 
it's utterly ridiculous an 8-speed

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.290 
it's utterly ridiculous an 8-speed
transmission<00:05:45.460> even<00:05:46.460> though<00:05:46.699> most<00:05:46.850> Audi's

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
transmission even though most Audi's

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.420 
transmission even though most Audi's
always<00:05:47.540> had<00:05:47.720> terrible<00:05:48.139> final<00:05:48.740> drives<00:05:49.010> where

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
always had terrible final drives where

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.969 
always had terrible final drives where
they<00:05:50.000> would<00:05:50.210> be<00:05:50.449> doing<00:05:51.110> the<00:05:51.350> speed<00:05:51.620> you'd<00:05:51.800> have

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
they would be doing the speed you'd have

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:53.980 
they would be doing the speed you'd have
your<00:05:52.160> rpms<00:05:52.610> basically<00:05:53.210> at<00:05:53.449> that

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
your rpms basically at that

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.600 
your rpms basically at that
but<00:05:54.380> the<00:05:54.470> a8<00:05:54.800> was<00:05:55.010> the<00:05:55.130> only<00:05:55.280> one<00:05:55.490> that

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
but the a8 was the only one that

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.760 
but the a8 was the only one that
actually<00:05:55.639> had<00:05:56.120> decent<00:05:56.600> rpm<00:05:57.080> so<00:05:57.440> that<00:05:57.590> you

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
actually had decent rpm so that you

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.469 
actually had decent rpm so that you
could<00:05:58.720> you<00:05:59.720> could<00:06:00.010> save<00:06:01.010> some<00:06:01.280> on<00:06:01.460> the<00:06:02.000> gas<00:06:02.180> but

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
could you could save some on the gas but

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.750 
could you could save some on the gas but
other<00:06:02.600> outies<00:06:03.020> really<00:06:03.470> kind<00:06:03.800> of<00:06:03.889> seem<00:06:04.639> to

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
other outies really kind of seem to

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.670 
other outies really kind of seem to
always<00:06:04.940> need<00:06:05.270> an<00:06:05.389> 8-speed<00:06:05.840> transmission<00:06:06.050> even

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
always need an 8-speed transmission even

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.540 
always need an 8-speed transmission even
