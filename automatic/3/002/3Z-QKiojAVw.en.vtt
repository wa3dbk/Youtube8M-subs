00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.720
 in recent weeks we have chosen 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.489
 saint denis where took place 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.530
 precisely two tests these last 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.340
 days starting with the 7th edition of 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.340
 the potato piton race 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.480

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.130
 françois 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.290
 this piton potato race is a 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.840
 small size of 10 km but still 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.430
 800 m vertical drop with several books a 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.430
 made around the recreation area 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.380
 nearly 150 runners and participated 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.869
 a small meeting without a head 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.520
 poster the opportunity for some of 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.530
 achieve their first podium like 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.210
 yannick ymbro siano often well placed 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.190
 on the other races that won 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.170
 here his first victory in just 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.820
 an hour and 28 seconds to throw there 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.229
 really for fun that made me 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.390
 weird to be alone before 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.350
 but this is a good week 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.460
 this is not a goal 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.170
 it was really for fun 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.430
 it's more that these courses are not an'a 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.590
 for a long time and in an hour it's up to 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.840
 pretty much curly and that's fine it's not 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.970
 too traumatic it's good it's cool 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.860
 in the feminine it is white umbel 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.840
 just as surprised who won 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.460
 the test never far from her husband 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.140
 pascal blanc to assist him on the 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.729
 other races she find this time 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.970
 the pleasure of running in competition 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.310
 it is more 1 2 and trails but I 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.289
 did not expect a course also at the 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.670
 climb it's me okay I've got it 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.770
 climb so it goes well and the descent 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.690
 it was even harder but it's going 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.170
 had a great atmosphere on the course 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.280
 suddenly the emotional guys well and here it is 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.990
 every time you pass here so you 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.610

 including twice the second place for 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.390
 it also took several tests 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.010
 before taking the victory 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.660
 this year i said lorette did 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.160
 left no doubt about the format 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.790
 45 km 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.440

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.160
 something good even if what 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.720
 what has always been so successful 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.670
 we say I have not 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.040
 I have not calculated too much I tried to 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.330
 to keep up the pace that jean-marie algeria 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.220
 went back road 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.200
 according to this party in women 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.360

 synthes the meeting that's all the profit 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.880
 in my ride ascended to rebirth is 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.110
 a bit like the third victim 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.970
 I really had fun would be great 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.420

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.000
 fatigue period 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.760
 of mass coup and works a lot at 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.150
 past moral it was really hard to 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.150
 made
