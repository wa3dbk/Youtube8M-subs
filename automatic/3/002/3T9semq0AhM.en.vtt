to<00:02:36.730> be<00:02:36.849> around<00:02:37.150> but<00:02:37.720> everybody<00:02:38.230> said<00:02:38.590> it's

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
to be around but everybody said it's

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.160

literally<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:46.120> walked<00:02:46.510> up<00:02:46.750> that<00:02:46.930> valley<00:02:47.260> up<00:02:47.709> to

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
literally I walked up that valley up to

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.640 
literally I walked up that valley up to
the<00:02:48.040> top<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.430> was<00:02:48.489> a<00:02:48.549> big<00:02:48.880> dead<00:02:49.299> end<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.750> there

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
the top it was a big dead end and there

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.069 
the top it was a big dead end and there
on<00:02:50.950> surface<00:02:51.640> right<00:02:52.150> at<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.390> top<00:02:52.569> end<00:02:52.810> was<00:02:53.049> a

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
on surface right at the top end was a

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.580 
on surface right at the top end was a
boulder<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.590> size<00:02:53.829> of<00:02:54.310> basically<00:02:54.879> this<00:02:55.120> table

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
boulder the size of basically this table

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.900 
boulder the size of basically this table
that<00:02:56.590> was<00:02:56.739> running<00:02:56.950> an<00:02:57.129> ounce<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.519> a<00:02:57.549> half<00:02:57.579> of

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
that was running an ounce and a half of

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.830 
that was running an ounce and a half of
holes<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:59.470> said<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:01.180> we<00:03:01.299> found<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.690> nice

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
holes and I said and we found a nice

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.660 
holes and I said and we found a nice
little<00:03:01.870> high-grade<00:03:02.500> ore<00:03:02.530> body<00:03:02.920> there<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:03.549> the

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
little high-grade ore body there so the

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.479 
little high-grade ore body there so the
point<00:03:03.910> was<00:03:04.120> is<00:03:04.389> I'm<00:03:04.569> going<00:03:04.810> like<00:03:05.739> well<00:03:06.010> I'm<00:03:06.400> not

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
point was is I'm going like well I'm not

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.780 
point was is I'm going like well I'm not
