00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 the legend tells that there is a mod 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.200
 that is able to change the character of 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.200
 Minecraft 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:21.740
 but a youtuber I take it even further 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.740
 farther than he expected 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.560
 very good companions of the increase of 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.510
 here we are one more day in a new 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.880
 review of a modest to see if this time 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.230
 it's going to be simple but I have a 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.700
 surprise za the mod is called custom steve 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.590
 custom steve that steve for the one that does not 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.320
 know is the character of minecraft is that 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.280
 change the man character from minecraft 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.860
 short how to customize your skin 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.570
 so to speak but it's not so much the skin 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.840
 as you have seen at the beginning of the video 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.050
 of the video but change the character to 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.630
 something super super super cool down the 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.369
 description you always have the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.070
 download and if you want more reviews of 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.710
 mold you can give a like but good that 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.710
 I 've taken it to the next level this 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.479
 mote this mote changes some models that 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.520
 they come to you but with the help of a 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.700
 program so to speak that is called my 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.869
 comic dance that my sister used 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.640
 besides, it is only recently to do as a 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.759
 vowel nikola today I think it was called 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.320
 perfectly so the blue hair and that 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.550
 is a program that makes you dance but 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:48.260
 with those models, you pass this mod 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.790
 and you get perfect modeling but 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.820
 As I said, I have passed 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.650
 next level and I've put modeling of 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.410
 series and the pokemon stand 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.720
 obviously here we give this is the 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.260
 animation that comes to you from the first 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.260
 as you see 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.110
 this is the person who comes to you comes to you 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.090
 this and another but another gives me a fault 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.630
 textures so for me it's just this 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.250
 you see there that comes as is a character 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.560
 anime I do not know what it would be to forgive if 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.330
 someone does not know and I do not know but good 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.630
 there you must see that it has animations 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.270
 They fly and as I said I have 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.310
 made of pokemon I made new models 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:34.590
 I have been currando me with Loeb 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:39.840
 new animations and here they are here 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:42.300
 aura bruno and calan 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.819
 they are each with animations 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.819
 specials let's try it so that what 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.250
 You see here we select you because you do not 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.830
 I said you give the here liza modeled and 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.170
 choose the model and here we have Achilles 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.060
 You see this is what I've put in 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.540
 you see he has another running animation 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.250
 the jump I think it's the same but not 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.890
 you know how complicated this is of the 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.920
 animations now besides all this 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.540
 you are going to have the achilles modeling 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.459
 bruno and all this you are going to have the 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.829
 description of downloads made by me 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.120
 for you so that you can put it what 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.700
 The only thing you have to do is put it in 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.920
 the folder as in the others with the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.950
 other files and ready 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.260
 look how cool achilles look how cool 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.510
 they can also hit and tried to put 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.260
 fists and things like that but they were super super 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.120
 difficult but good with this already 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.269
 forgive that I tell you is perfect 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.530
 now it's cool too look now 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.470
 has the animations of the girls 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.180
 Obviously, looking at how cool it is 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.630
 brutal the truth is that this way is 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.630
 amazing that I stayed 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.680
 the one who can not leave 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.900
 there you are there is amazing there I love 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.550
 this mod because you can put the model 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.020
 that you want if you work it out a bit 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.610
 you can take out the model that you want 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.950
 here we have the one of bruno the one of bruno 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.170
 It is also very cool because it is that it is 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.730
 as if you were playing pokemon 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.500
 sapphire and ruby why elected these 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.470
 characters since we are with the sapphire 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.329
 and all this with the last game was the 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.419
 sapphire then good sapphire and rubin then 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.340

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.960

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.360

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.290
 it's short but concise 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.000
 It is clear that you will be able to play with 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.910
 the characters I leave the description 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.710

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.870
 cure it but please 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:06.250
 what happens is stretched and all that because 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.380
 the comments share it with our 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.270
 friends pass it rte light all that to 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.150
 support it if you want to marc because it's a 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.430
 work that takes time to investigate if 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.140
 you want more models to look for me 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.360

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.710
 I can also try to do this 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.410
 it's really going to be difficult but 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.060
 they can fly a lot so if you want what 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.250

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.110
