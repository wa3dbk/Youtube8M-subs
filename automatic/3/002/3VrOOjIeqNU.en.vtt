really see what it is and I really like
this<00:05:14.380> and<00:05:15.000> this<00:05:16.000> was<00:05:19.020> 2299<00:05:20.020> but<00:05:20.380> those<00:05:20.530> twenty

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
this and this was 2299 but those twenty

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.650 
this and this was 2299 but those twenty
five<00:05:20.950> percent<00:05:20.979> off<00:05:21.520> it<00:05:21.940> was<00:05:22.060> before<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:22.479> sale

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
five percent off it was before the sale

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.969 
five percent off it was before the sale
but<00:05:22.840> it<00:05:22.960> was<00:05:23.080> still<00:05:23.260> like<00:05:23.470> twenty-five
