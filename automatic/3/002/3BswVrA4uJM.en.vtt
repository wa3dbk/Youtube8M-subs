00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
on the back there and that's going to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.420 
on the back there and that's going to
enable<00:00:56.750> nice<00:00:57.050> cool<00:00:57.440> air<00:00:57.470> throughout<00:00:58.040> the<00:00:58.160> tent

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
so just in case a few in the hotter

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.810 
so just in case a few in the hotter
climates<00:01:00.650> as<00:01:00.920> you<00:01:01.070> can<00:01:01.190> see<00:01:01.280> you've<00:01:01.460> got<00:01:01.580> tons

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
climates as you can see you've got tons

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.310 
climates as you can see you've got tons
of<00:01:02.030> guide<00:01:02.240> ropes<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:02.630> everything<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:03.050> you<00:01:03.140> can

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
of guide ropes and everything so you can

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.470 
of guide ropes and everything so you can
really<00:01:03.680> maximize<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:04.460> space<00:01:04.970> on<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.239> inside

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
really maximize the space on the inside

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.840 
really maximize the space on the inside
and<00:01:05.840> really<00:01:06.020> hold<00:01:06.380> it<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.830> ground<00:01:07.070> as<00:01:07.280> well

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
and really hold it to the ground as well

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.640 
and really hold it to the ground as well
what<00:01:08.600> is<00:01:08.720> a<00:01:08.750> really<00:01:09.140> nice<00:01:09.290> little<00:01:09.530> feature

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
though is pretty much this front system

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.750 
though is pretty much this front system
that<00:01:11.870> will<00:01:11.990> slowly<00:01:12.470> get<00:01:12.740> round<00:01:13.010> to<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:13.280> in<00:01:13.400> a

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
second it's got a nice entry level way

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.590 
second it's got a nice entry level way
and<00:01:16.190> it's<00:01:16.310> to<00:01:16.430> say<00:01:16.580> comes<00:01:16.910> in<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.150> a<00:01:17.180> really

and it's to say comes in to a really
nice<00:01:17.690> porch<00:01:18.080> space<00:01:18.350> so<00:01:18.590> if<00:01:18.860> you<00:01:19.010> follow<00:01:19.160> me<00:01:19.310> in

what's actually on the inside of the
tent<00:01:26.210> you<00:01:26.270> can<00:01:26.330> see<00:01:26.510> it<00:01:26.630> is<00:01:26.750> nice<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:27.200> spacious

tent you can see it is nice and spacious

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.380 
tent you can see it is nice and spacious
on<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:28.130> inside<00:01:28.370> you've<00:01:28.520> got<00:01:28.550> almost<00:01:29.000> to<00:01:29.180> say

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390

little feature and as I say just the
mesh<00:02:31.340> paneling<00:02:31.820> on<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.540> sides<00:02:32.810> here<00:02:32.930> work

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
mesh paneling on the sides here work

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.650
