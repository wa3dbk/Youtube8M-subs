00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
game is still a work in progress this

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.730 
game is still a work in progress this
could<00:00:23.789> all<00:00:24.000> change<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.230> system<00:00:25.590> might

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
could all change and the system might

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.950 
could all change and the system might
work<00:00:25.769> differently<00:00:26.640> but<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.539> sort<00:00:27.750> of

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
work differently but this is sort of

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.269 
work differently but this is sort of
what<00:00:28.170> they<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.619> mind<00:00:28.859> at<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.279> moment<00:00:31.279> so

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
what they have in mind at the moment so

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
what they're sort of trying to achieve

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.400 
what they're sort of trying to achieve
is<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:35.180> certain<00:00:36.180> middle<00:00:36.540> ground<00:00:36.809> between<00:00:37.020> their

with different armors but in a way that

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.780 
with different armors but in a way that
they<00:01:04.199> would<00:01:04.379> still<00:01:04.680> retain<00:01:04.920> their<00:01:05.339> certain

they would still retain their certain
feel<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.170> Dragon<00:01:07.439> Age<00:01:07.530> Origins<00:01:07.740> apart

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
feel because in Dragon Age Origins apart

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.160 
feel because in Dragon Age Origins apart
from<00:01:08.640> their<00:01:08.850> face<00:01:09.150> if<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.720> put<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> different

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
from their face if you put a different

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.990 
from their face if you put a different
armor<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> different<00:01:11.400> character<00:01:11.610> they

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
armor on a different character they

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.210 
armor on a different character they
would<00:01:12.180> all<00:01:12.360> look<00:01:12.540> very<00:01:12.600> similar<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.950> if<00:01:14.100> you

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
would all look very similar so if you

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.609 
would all look very similar so if you
look<00:01:14.369> at<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.610> screen<00:01:14.909> right<00:01:14.939> now<00:01:15.409> you<00:01:16.409> should

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
look at the screen right now you should

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.179 
look at the screen right now you should
see<00:01:16.740> two<00:01:16.950> characters<00:01:17.600> one<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.659> them<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.680> grey

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
see two characters one of them is a grey

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.399 
see two characters one of them is a grey
warden<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> other<00:01:21.180> one<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.720> seeker<00:01:22.229> of

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
warden and the other one is a seeker of

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.280 
warden and the other one is a seeker of
truth<00:01:22.549> now<00:01:23.549> these<00:01:23.939> might<00:01:24.450> not<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.900> companions

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
truth now these might not be companions

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.260 
truth now these might not be companions
in<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> game<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.100> could<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.430> just<00:01:26.670> examples

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
in the game this could be just examples

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.219 
in the game this could be just examples
used<00:01:27.509> by<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.780> devs<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.740> explain<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.400> system

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
used by the devs to explain this system

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.170 
used by the devs to explain this system
so<00:01:31.229> don't<00:01:31.740> take<00:01:31.950> these<00:01:32.130> as<00:01:32.340> companions<00:01:32.909> but

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
so don't take these as companions but

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.310 
so don't take these as companions but
let's<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.170> say<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.619> they<00:01:34.799> are<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> while

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
let's just say that they are for a while

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.200 
let's just say that they are for a while
see<00:01:37.320> how<00:01:37.350> their<00:01:37.799> armor<00:01:38.130> looks<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.670> how<00:01:39.000> they

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
see how their armor looks and how they

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.539 
see how their armor looks and how they
have<00:01:39.570> their<00:01:39.780> certain<00:01:40.560> feeling<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.400> a

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
have their certain feeling of a

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.389 
have their certain feeling of a
character<00:01:41.970> for<00:01:42.150> them<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:43.380> let's<00:01:43.799> say<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.009> take

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
character for them so let's say you take

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.999 
character for them so let's say you take
a<00:01:44.640> breastplate<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.509> put<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.470> each<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.860> them

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
a breastplate and put it on each of them

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.399 
a breastplate and put it on each of them
you<00:01:48.000> will<00:01:48.180> see<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.930> breastplate

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
you will see that the breastplate

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.160 
you will see that the breastplate
changes<00:01:50.100> but<00:01:50.670> they<00:01:50.880> still<00:01:51.210> retain<00:01:51.390> their<00:01:51.810> sort

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
changes but they still retain their sort

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.969 
changes but they still retain their sort
of<00:01:52.490> feeling<00:01:53.490> their<00:01:54.259> characteristics<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
of feeling their characteristics the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.740 
of feeling their characteristics the
it's<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.549> same<00:01:56.729> breastplate<00:01:57.180> for<00:01:57.390> both<00:01:57.570> of

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
it's the same breastplate for both of

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.840 
it's the same breastplate for both of
them<00:01:57.930> but<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.590> looks<00:01:58.770> different<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.430> each<00:01:59.670> of

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
them but it looks different on each of

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.520 
them but it looks different on each of
them<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.390> they<00:02:00.780> still<00:02:01.140> retain<00:02:01.500> that

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
them so that they still retain that

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.819 
them so that they still retain that
certain<00:02:02.189> vibe<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.360> they<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.719> now<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.350> devs

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
certain vibe that they have now the devs

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.550 
certain vibe that they have now the devs
said<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.670> sort<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.659> idea<00:02:06.899> should<00:02:07.320> work

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
said that this sort of idea should work

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.589 
said that this sort of idea should work
with<00:02:07.770> all<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.190> parts<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.640> different<00:02:09.149> armors

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
with all the parts of different armors

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.430 
with all the parts of different armors
so<00:02:10.200> let's<00:02:10.379> just<00:02:10.590> take<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.920> breastplate

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
so let's just take the breastplate

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.100 
so let's just take the breastplate
off<00:02:11.530> for<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.980> minute<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:12.510> look<00:02:13.510> how<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.930> would

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
off for a minute and look how it would

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.780 
off for a minute and look how it would
look<00:02:14.320> for<00:02:14.590> example<00:02:14.950> with<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.190> shoulder<00:02:15.580> pad

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
look for example with the shoulder pad

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.870 
look for example with the shoulder pad
you<00:02:16.780> can<00:02:16.900> still<00:02:17.200> see<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.440> change<00:02:17.920> in<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.490> armor

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
you can still see a change in the armor

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.900 
you can still see a change in the armor
and<00:02:19.120> how<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:19.900> color<00:02:20.200> character<00:02:20.650> looks<00:02:20.950> but<00:02:21.580> you

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
and how to color character looks but you

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.580 
and how to color character looks but you
can<00:02:22.120> notice<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:22.690> for<00:02:23.050> example<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.440> Grey

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
can notice that for example the Grey

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.410 
can notice that for example the Grey
Wardens<00:02:24.070> so<00:02:24.340> shoulder<00:02:24.700> pads<00:02:24.940> are<00:02:25.180> much

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
Wardens so shoulder pads are much

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.010 
Wardens so shoulder pads are much
bulkier<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.700> they<00:02:27.700> look<00:02:27.940> more<00:02:28.120> hefty<00:02:28.540> whereas

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
bulkier and they look more hefty whereas

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.760 
bulkier and they look more hefty whereas
the<00:02:29.230> Seekers<00:02:29.650> shoulder<00:02:30.040> plate<00:02:30.340> looks<00:02:31.000> more

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
the Seekers shoulder plate looks more

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.970 
the Seekers shoulder plate looks more
sharp<00:02:32.770> I'd<00:02:33.130> say<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.760> it's<00:02:34.480> still<00:02:34.720> thinner<00:02:34.990> so

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
sharp I'd say and it's still thinner so

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.160 
sharp I'd say and it's still thinner so
let's<00:02:36.910> say<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.540> take<00:02:37.780> of<00:02:37.990> these

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
let's say that you take of these

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.140 
let's say that you take of these
shoulder<00:02:38.530> blades<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.070> then<00:02:39.730> apply<00:02:40.090> the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
shoulder blades and then apply the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.360 
shoulder blades and then apply the
entire<00:02:40.630> armor<00:02:41.080> on<00:02:41.200> both<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.890> characters

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
entire armor on both of the characters

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.590 
entire armor on both of the characters
you<00:02:44.220> can<00:02:45.220> see<00:02:45.490> that<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.880> armors<00:02:46.300> looks

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
you can see that the armors looks

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.660 
you can see that the armors looks
similar<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:47.230> each<00:02:47.380> other<00:02:47.500> but<00:02:47.860> they<00:02:48.400> are<00:02:48.460> not

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
similar to each other but they are not

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.930 
similar to each other but they are not
the<00:02:48.850> same<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.330> characters<00:02:49.780> still<00:02:50.200> sort<00:02:50.530> of

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
the same the characters still sort of

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.880 
the same the characters still sort of
retain<00:02:51.940> their<00:02:52.180> figure<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.780> posture<00:02:53.350> there

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
retain their figure the posture there

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.490 
retain their figure the posture there
are<00:02:54.100> that<00:02:54.940> certain<00:02:55.360> feeling<00:02:55.750> of<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:56.050> character

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
are that certain feeling of a character

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.410 
are that certain feeling of a character
that<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:56.800> have<00:02:56.980> they<00:02:57.730> don't<00:02:57.910> look<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.390> same

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
that you have they don't look the same

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.230 
that you have they don't look the same
in<00:02:59.140> addition<00:02:59.710> to<00:03:00.010> each<00:03:00.220> armor<00:03:00.640> being<00:03:00.850> crafted

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
in addition to each armor being crafted

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.030 
in addition to each armor being crafted
separately<00:03:01.870> for<00:03:02.050> each<00:03:02.230> character<00:03:02.830> they<00:03:03.010> have

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
separately for each character they have

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.270 
separately for each character they have
sets<00:03:03.490> that<00:03:03.760> they<00:03:03.910> also<00:03:04.180> could<00:03:04.960> be<00:03:05.170> able<00:03:05.410> to

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
sets that they also could be able to

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.550 
sets that they also could be able to
give<00:03:06.490> the<00:03:06.850> player<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.600> power<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:08.080> change<00:03:08.320> the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
give the player the power to change the

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.680 
give the player the power to change the
materials<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.370> colors<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.210> characters

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
materials and colors of the characters

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.670 
materials and colors of the characters
of<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.440> armors<00:03:11.860> I<00:03:12.040> mean<00:03:12.220> but<00:03:12.970> this<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:14.080> just<00:03:14.380> a

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
of the armors I mean but this is just a

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.400 
of the armors I mean but this is just a
big<00:03:15.459> if<00:03:15.700> because<00:03:16.030> they<00:03:16.660> would<00:03:16.870> like<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.110> do

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
big if because they would like to do

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.530 
big if because they would like to do
something<00:03:17.770> like<00:03:17.920> that<00:03:17.980> but<00:03:18.820> unless<00:03:19.209> they<00:03:19.390> do

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
something like that but unless they do

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.360 
something like that but unless they do
it<00:03:19.570> right<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.200> unless<00:03:20.350> they<00:03:20.680> are<00:03:20.770> able<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.160> do

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
it right and unless they are able to do

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.900 
it right and unless they are able to do
it<00:03:21.520> they<00:03:22.300> won't<00:03:22.480> put<00:03:23.080> it<00:03:23.200> in<00:03:23.320> the<00:03:23.440> game<00:03:23.910> they

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
it they won't put it in the game they

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.940 
it they won't put it in the game they
have<00:03:25.060> also<00:03:25.750> mentioned<00:03:26.170> that<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.410> reason<00:03:26.770> for

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
have also mentioned that the reason for

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.180 
have also mentioned that the reason for
this<00:03:27.130> is<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:28.020> in<00:03:29.020> Dragon<00:03:29.170> Age<00:03:29.440> Origins<00:03:29.650> the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
this is that in Dragon Age Origins the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.550 
this is that in Dragon Age Origins the
system<00:03:30.580> wasn't<00:03:30.820> bad<00:03:31.180> but<00:03:31.959> when<00:03:32.170> you<00:03:32.290> put

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
system wasn't bad but when you put

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.770 
system wasn't bad but when you put
different<00:03:32.709> armors<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.880> two<00:03:34.330> different

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
different armors the two different

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.110 
different armors the two different
characters<00:03:34.959> they<00:03:35.440> would<00:03:35.590> lose<00:03:35.800> their<00:03:36.120> of

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
characters they would lose their of

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.960 
characters they would lose their of
their<00:03:37.930> identity<00:03:38.709> sort<00:03:38.980> of<00:03:39.160> because<00:03:39.670> if<00:03:39.850> you

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
their identity sort of because if you

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.040 
their identity sort of because if you
put<00:03:40.180> heavy<00:03:41.019> armor<00:03:41.380> on<00:03:41.760> let's<00:03:42.760> say<00:03:42.970> Stan<00:03:43.810> and

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
put heavy armor on let's say Stan and

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.290 
put heavy armor on let's say Stan and
Alistar<00:03:44.709> they<00:03:45.220> would<00:03:45.430> pretty<00:03:45.820> much<00:03:45.940> look<00:03:46.269> the

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
Alistar they would pretty much look the

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.570 
Alistar they would pretty much look the
same<00:03:46.660> if<00:03:46.930> they<00:03:47.110> had<00:03:47.290> helmets<00:03:47.680> so<00:03:47.920> you<00:03:47.980> wouldn't

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
same if they had helmets so you wouldn't

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.979 
same if they had helmets so you wouldn't
really<00:03:48.820> be<00:03:49.030> able<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.360> distinguish<00:03:49.630> between

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
really be able to distinguish between

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.130 
really be able to distinguish between
them<00:03:50.580> however<00:03:51.580> in<00:03:51.850> Dragon<00:03:52.209> Age<00:03:52.330> 2<00:03:52.390> they<00:03:52.870> felt

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
them however in Dragon Age 2 they felt

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.900 
them however in Dragon Age 2 they felt
that<00:03:53.320> the<00:03:53.530> system<00:03:54.070> was<00:03:54.250> a<00:03:54.459> bit<00:03:54.730> too

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
that the system was a bit too

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.720 
that the system was a bit too
restrictive<00:03:55.570> in<00:03:55.810> terms<00:03:56.050> of<00:03:56.230> customization<00:03:57.100> so

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
restrictive in terms of customization so

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.970
