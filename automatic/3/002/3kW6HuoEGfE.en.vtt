00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.450
 I'm going to ride them 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.450
 an imitation honor say nothing 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.060
 that now in this time we develop that we have to look 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.079
 other alternatives and we want to continue investing in china 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:15.329
 and then the best there is and demands to fish the carp 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:16.710
 and the ship can 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.899
 this ant for the tent and the boat is a marvel 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.220
 ride on a hook 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.640
 weather 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.339
 and rihanna 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.339
 of number 14 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.679
 she is a friend 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
 we can anchor by a band-aid of fornero 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.030
 we already have bottom that we are going to be the curvature 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.550
 we record to put 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.540
 a myth is born 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.540
 woman that the peacock ensures 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.310
 to form the body and that of a more realistic feeling poplar work 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.440
 we denounce and be of the peacock 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.220
 I was careful that we go until night 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.220
 the eight so many 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.840
 and now we are going to carry 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.910
 the black mounting wire 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.910
 to train in the take 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.460
 we form the abdomen 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.970
 we are going to use 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.770
 for the wings a white feather of a neck 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.770
 current 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.060
 let's hold the feathers 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.940
 we attack them ahead 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:16.039
 I just put the wings of a tone 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:18.779
 what yes no 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:21.289
 the carp and the barb obama 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:23.889
 write down nothing and us 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.969
 these will favor 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:28.579
 at the time of 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.579
 to visualize it 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.319
 in one answer the wings 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.319
 you can see how it is 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:44.539
 we are going to support so that the ujat legs and here we are going to put it in paracho 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:46.969
 for chus 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.159
 I like that much better here 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.159
 mounting method 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:56.279
 to put the legs down 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:57.619
 to the ant 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.819
 we roll over the pole that we have let the bottom 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.309
 we shoot in paracho 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:05.449
 like fatigue and black 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:07.829
 we are a few laps 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.829
 we hold 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:17.159
 and we think for alante 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.309
 the post 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:20.699
 to form 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.699
 what is the thorax 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.079
 once the thorax is formed, you can see how it is 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:37.709
 we are 300 from above 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.709
 the fat greek so that only the extremes remain 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:45.659
 we took again the thread of mounts mounts we were going to form at the head 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:47.999
 the head of the fly 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:50.999
 of the food 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:53.799
 It is easy to assemble 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.799
 and I already say that he is very intelligent and goes to the time of lending 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.219
 carps and barbs 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.269
 here we do and 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.269
 the final world 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.139
 we count what we have left and now very carefully 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:10.989
 we cut 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.989
 the post that does not know where 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.080
 from there you can see the finished ant 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.669
 It's simple to do 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.759
 and it is very effective 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.759
 let's leave a little sun so you can see it better 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.809
 there we have it 

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:36.749
 that's 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:39.930
 under 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.559
 this is because 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:44.189
 a very good invitation 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:47.189
 now to fish 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.409
 cheer up 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.759
 do not leave the canes we still have a little time left for 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:55.269
 keep fishing
