good if you're in a combative situation
or<00:00:29.189> dueling<00:00:29.820> someone<00:00:30.000> sparring<00:00:30.630> with<00:00:30.720> people

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.600 
and you want to kind of throw them off
and<00:00:34.200> use<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> different<00:00:34.890> grip<00:00:35.190> for<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.430> little

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
and use a different grip for a little

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.930 
and use a different grip for a little
bit<00:00:35.809> it's<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:37.050> very<00:00:37.260> good<00:00:37.440> surprise<00:00:37.940> technique

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
bit it's a very good surprise technique

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.780 
bit it's a very good surprise technique
to<00:00:39.120> use<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.280> looks<00:00:41.460> good<00:00:41.610> when

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
to use and it just looks good when

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.119 
to use and it just looks good when
you're<00:00:41.910> doing<00:00:42.260> you<00:00:43.260> know<00:00:43.350> routines<00:00:43.860> or

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
you're doing you know routines or

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.139 
you're doing you know routines or
whatever<00:00:44.399> ok<00:00:46.280> now<00:00:47.780> this<00:00:48.780> one<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:50.149> slightly

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
whatever ok now this one is slightly

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.430 
whatever ok now this one is slightly
more<00:00:51.480> advanced<00:00:51.989> than<00:00:52.260> our<00:00:52.530> previous<00:00:52.980> videos

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
more advanced than our previous videos

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.639 
more advanced than our previous videos
because<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.649> finger<00:00:55.920> roll<00:00:57.469> it's<00:00:58.469> not

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
because of that finger roll it's not

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.529 
because of that finger roll it's not
very<00:00:58.890> hard<00:00:59.129> at<00:00:59.219> all<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.850> does<00:00:59.879> take<00:01:00.300> a

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
very hard at all but it does take a

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.770 
very hard at all but it does take a
little<00:01:00.719> bit<00:01:00.809> more<00:01:00.930> coordination<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.770> get<00:01:02.780> and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
little bit more coordination to get and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.200 
little bit more coordination to get and
all<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.369> you're<00:01:05.369> not<00:01:05.460> really<00:01:05.610> doing<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.970> full

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
all it is you're not really doing a full

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.010 
all it is you're not really doing a full
finger<00:01:06.479> roll<00:01:06.630> I'm<00:01:06.840> just<00:01:07.020> doing<00:01:07.290> basically<00:01:07.590> one

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
finger roll I'm just doing basically one

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.840 
finger roll I'm just doing basically one
finger<00:01:10.020> roll<00:01:10.260> which<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.070> my<00:01:11.280> index<00:01:11.580> finger

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850

finger roll which is my index finger
that's<00:01:12.060> all<00:01:12.210> I'm<00:01:12.450> not<00:01:12.570> really<00:01:12.869> concerned<00:01:13.200> with

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
that's all I'm not really concerned with

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.700 
that's all I'm not really concerned with
you<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.130> other<00:01:14.490> three<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:16.200> they're<00:01:16.560> coming

pretty close here and see if I can see
this<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.630> camera

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
this on camera

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
again very slowly I'll try to do it very

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.920 
again very slowly I'll try to do it very
slowly

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.649 

pretty<00:02:44.930> much<00:02:45.019> when<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.349> let<00:02:45.590> go<00:02:45.620> of<00:02:46.389> the<00:02:47.389> saber

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
pretty much when you let go of the saber

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.179 
pretty much when you let go of the saber
these<00:02:48.019> fingers<00:02:48.409> are<00:02:48.500> just<00:02:48.560> gonna<00:02:48.799> stay<00:02:49.069> there

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:49.189 
these fingers are just gonna stay there

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.539 
these fingers are just gonna stay there
they're<00:02:49.459> not<00:02:49.489> gonna<00:02:49.639> flare<00:02:50.000> out<00:02:51.549> they're

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
they're not gonna flare out they're

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.770 
they're not gonna flare out they're
gonna<00:02:52.669> curl<00:02:52.939> in<00:02:55.120> between<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.239> index<00:02:56.599> and

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
gonna curl in between the index and

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.440 
gonna curl in between the index and
middle<00:02:56.840> finger<00:02:57.879> and<00:02:58.879> then<00:02:59.090> you're<00:02:59.180> just<00:02:59.299> gonna

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
middle finger and then you're just gonna

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.349 
middle finger and then you're just gonna
roll<00:02:59.840> it<00:03:00.489> between<00:03:01.489> the<00:03:01.669> index<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.239> those

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
roll it between the index and those

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.490 
roll it between the index and those
fingers<00:03:02.720> into<00:03:03.219> that<00:03:04.219> position<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:05.439> that<00:03:06.439> is

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
fingers into that position and that is

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.860 
fingers into that position and that is
basically<00:03:07.069> your<00:03:07.310> reverse<00:03:07.609> grip<00:03:07.909> the<00:03:08.719> only

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
basically your reverse grip the only

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.690 
basically your reverse grip the only
difference<00:03:09.169> is<00:03:09.319> your<00:03:09.889> index<00:03:10.159> finger<00:03:10.489> is<00:03:10.579> on

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
difference is your index finger is on

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.199 
difference is your index finger is on
the<00:03:11.139> other<00:03:12.139> side<00:03:12.469> so<00:03:13.459> from<00:03:13.639> there<00:03:13.849> you<00:03:14.180> just

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
the other side so from there you just

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.209 
the other side so from there you just
bring<00:03:14.569> it<00:03:14.599> you<00:03:15.439> just<00:03:15.620> bring<00:03:15.769> that<00:03:15.799> index

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:16.219 
bring it you just bring that index

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.520 
bring it you just bring that index
finger<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.599> back<00:03:17.750> replacing<00:03:18.349> it<00:03:18.439> with

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
finger to the back replacing it with

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.710 
finger to the back replacing it with
your<00:03:18.680> thumb<00:03:21.579> so<00:03:22.579> what<00:03:23.180> that<00:03:23.299> looks<00:03:23.510> like<00:03:23.659> a

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
your thumb so what that looks like a

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.800 
your thumb so what that looks like a
little<00:03:23.900> bit<00:03:24.109> faster

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.050 

you<00:03:27.230> have<00:03:27.380> your<00:03:27.530> basic

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:40.600 

now<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:30.690> have<00:03:31.730> finger<00:03:33.350> there's<00:03:34.350> your<00:03:34.470> reverse

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.340 

there<00:03:41.610> you<00:03:41.760> can<00:03:41.910> do<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:43.650> figure<00:03:43.980> Eight's

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
there you can do the figure Eight's

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.140 
there you can do the figure Eight's
that's<00:03:46.350> what<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:46.560> usually<00:03:46.800> do<00:03:49.700> now<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.760> get<00:03:51.090> back

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
that's what I usually do now to get back

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.580 
that's what I usually do now to get back
to<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:53.550> front<00:03:54.540> grip<00:03:57.110> you're<00:03:58.110> gonna<00:03:58.230> do<00:03:58.440> the

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
to the front grip you're gonna do the

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.949 
to the front grip you're gonna do the
exact<00:03:58.920> same<00:03:58.950> thing<00:03:59.640> as<00:04:00.000> you<00:04:00.239> did<00:04:00.390> getting<00:04:00.750> into

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
exact same thing as you did getting into

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.430 
exact same thing as you did getting into
the<00:04:01.050> reverse<00:04:01.850> so<00:04:02.850> again<00:04:03.810> let<00:04:03.989> me<00:04:04.019> see<00:04:04.230> if<00:04:04.320> you

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
the reverse so again let me see if you

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.020 
the reverse so again let me see if you
can<00:04:04.590> see<00:04:04.739> this<00:04:04.860> in<00:04:05.040> camera<00:04:05.660> yes<00:04:06.660> okay<00:04:08.510> so<00:04:09.650> basic

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
can see this in camera yes okay so basic

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.220 
can see this in camera yes okay so basic
your<00:04:12.030> roll<00:04:12.739> into<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.980> reverse<00:04:14.250> grip<00:04:15.109> not<00:04:16.109> to

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
your roll into the reverse grip not to

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.319 
your roll into the reverse grip not to
get<00:04:16.350> back<00:04:16.579> you're<00:04:17.579> gonna<00:04:17.669> do<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:18.000> figure

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
get back you're gonna do the figure

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.640 
get back you're gonna do the figure
eight<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:19.310> as<00:04:20.310> this<00:04:20.730> is<00:04:20.790> very<00:04:20.910> uncomfortable

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
eight and as this is very uncomfortable

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.450 
eight and as this is very uncomfortable
as<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:22.919> come<00:04:23.160> back<00:04:24.919> when<00:04:25.919> you're<00:04:26.040> coming<00:04:26.250> to

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
as you come back when you're coming to

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.360 
as you come back when you're coming to
this<00:04:26.700> side<00:04:29.180> again<00:04:30.380> you<00:04:31.380> can<00:04:31.560> see<00:04:31.770> if<00:04:31.919> I<00:04:32.070> did<00:04:32.250> it

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
this side again you can see if I did it

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.420 
this side again you can see if I did it
normally<00:04:35.419> all<00:04:36.419> my<00:04:36.690> fingers<00:04:37.050> would<00:04:37.229> be<00:04:37.430> there

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
normally all my fingers would be there

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.710 
normally all my fingers would be there
it's<00:04:38.610> meted<00:04:39.260> whereas<00:04:40.260> in<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.560> finger<00:04:40.830> roll

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
it's meted whereas in the finger roll

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.080 
it's meted whereas in the finger roll
you're<00:04:42.720> going<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:43.460> let<00:04:44.460> these<00:04:44.610> three<00:04:44.910> fingers

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
you're going to let these three fingers

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.600 
you're going to let these three fingers
pass

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.490 

and<00:04:48.970> it's<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.419> exact<00:04:49.720> same<00:04:49.810> position<00:04:50.409> you're

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
and it's the exact same position you're

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.939 
and it's the exact same position you're
trying<00:04:50.650> to<00:04:50.830> get<00:04:50.889> into<00:04:51.150> like<00:04:52.150> that

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
trying to get into like that

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.830 
trying to get into like that
finger<00:04:53.949> roll<00:04:53.979> reverse<00:04:55.590> figure<00:04:56.590> eight<00:04:56.740> and

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
finger roll reverse figure eight and

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.899 
finger roll reverse figure eight and
figure<00:04:58.840> eight<00:04:58.960> there<00:04:59.199> is<00:04:59.439> there<00:04:59.860> to<00:05:00.400> build

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:00.909 
figure eight there is there to build

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.790 
figure eight there is there to build
momentum<00:05:01.090> to<00:05:01.509> get<00:05:01.689> you<00:05:01.960> into<00:05:02.319> that<00:05:02.349> finger

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
momentum to get you into that finger

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.540 
momentum to get you into that finger
roll<00:05:02.979> in<00:05:03.610> order<00:05:03.879> to<00:05:04.030> switch<00:05:04.270> back<00:05:05.460> okay<00:05:06.460> so

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
roll in order to switch back okay so

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.790 
roll in order to switch back okay so
that's<00:05:06.819> what<00:05:07.000> that<00:05:07.120> figure<00:05:07.300> is<00:05:07.509> there<00:05:07.719> for

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.460 

basic<00:05:12.539> finger<00:05:13.539> roll

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.429 

figure-eight

00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:19.439 
figure-eight

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:32.090 
figure-eight
finger<00:05:20.189> roll<00:05:21.379> and<00:05:22.379> back

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.500 

okay<00:05:33.100> so<00:05:34.060> that's<00:05:34.210> what<00:05:34.450> that<00:05:34.600> looks<00:05:34.750> like

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
okay so that's what that looks like

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.080 
okay so that's what that looks like
again<00:05:37.510> spend<00:05:37.990> a<00:05:38.290> good<00:05:38.440> amount<00:05:38.500> of<00:05:38.770> time<00:05:39.090> just

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
again spend a good amount of time just

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.670 
again spend a good amount of time just
getting<00:05:40.450> that<00:05:40.810> coordination<00:05:41.320> of<00:05:41.530> those

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
getting that coordination of those

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:51.630 
getting that coordination of those
finger<00:05:41.980> roll<00:05:42.160> down<00:05:45.240> okay<00:05:47.160> basic<00:05:48.780> reverse<00:05:50.430> as<00:05:51.430> I

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
finger roll down okay basic reverse as I

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.580 
finger roll down okay basic reverse as I
come<00:05:51.880> to<00:05:52.150> this<00:05:52.420> side<00:05:52.750> with<00:05:52.990> the<00:05:53.140> reverse

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
come to this side with the reverse

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.970 
come to this side with the reverse
figure<00:05:53.770> eight<00:05:55.380> basically<00:05:56.380> letting<00:05:56.710> these

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
figure eight basically letting these

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.960 
figure eight basically letting these
three<00:05:57.400> fingers<00:05:57.760> go<00:05:58.050> and<00:05:59.050> holding<00:05:59.410> it<00:05:59.560> with<00:05:59.770> my

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
three fingers go and holding it with my

back<00:06:11.250> like<00:06:12.250> that<00:06:12.460> and<00:06:13.360> then<00:06:13.480> that<00:06:13.690> allows<00:06:13.960> me

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.170 
back like that and then that allows me

on this side to roll it into flames X
finger

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.480 

okay<00:06:28.150> again<00:06:29.150> practice<00:06:29.360> that<00:06:29.690> very<00:06:29.960> slowly

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
okay again practice that very slowly

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.620 
okay again practice that very slowly
it's<00:06:31.490> not<00:06:31.670> something<00:06:32.090> you're<00:06:32.270> going<00:06:32.390> to<00:06:32.480> get

it right away
and<00:06:34.010> they<00:06:34.130> drop<00:06:34.430> it<00:06:34.610> a<00:06:34.670> couple<00:06:34.850> times<00:06:35.620> just

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
and they drop it a couple times just

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:44.410 
and they drop it a couple times just
don't<00:06:36.770> get<00:06:36.950> frustrated<00:06:42.400> it<00:06:43.400> took<00:06:43.580> me<00:06:43.760> about<00:06:44.360> a

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:44.420 
don't get frustrated it took me about a

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.940 
don't get frustrated it took me about a
day

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.950 
day

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.640 
day
good<00:06:46.550> intense<00:06:46.940> practice<00:06:47.150> to<00:06:47.600> learn<00:06:47.780> it<00:06:47.960> to<00:06:48.560> be

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
good intense practice to learn it to be

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.600 
good intense practice to learn it to be
able<00:06:48.740> to<00:06:48.920> do<00:06:49.040> it<00:06:49.190> with<00:06:49.520> decent<00:06:50.180> speed<00:06:51.490> once<00:06:52.490> you

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
able to do it with decent speed once you

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:59.539 
able to do it with decent speed once you
get<00:06:52.730> the<00:06:52.850> coordination<00:06:53.420> down<00:06:53.600> then<00:06:53.900> you<00:06:54.080> can

00:06:59.539 --> 00:06:59.549 

00:06:59.549 --> 00:07:02.539 

once<00:07:00.539> you<00:07:00.719> do<00:07:00.899> have<00:07:01.110> it<00:07:01.259> however<00:07:01.439> when<00:07:02.159> you<00:07:02.309> get

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:02.549 
once you do have it however when you get

00:07:02.549 --> 00:07:06.379 
once you do have it however when you get
back<00:07:03.509> to<00:07:03.539> the<00:07:03.809> front<00:07:04.159> it<00:07:05.159> always<00:07:05.489> looks<00:07:06.299> good

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:06.389 
back to the front it always looks good

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:09.259 
back to the front it always looks good
to<00:07:06.839> add<00:07:07.049> that<00:07:07.349> two-headed<00:07:07.739> assist<00:07:08.279> into<00:07:09.119> the

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:09.269 
to add that two-headed assist into the

00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:17.079 
to add that two-headed assist into the
strike<00:07:12.169> Network<00:07:13.169> stands<00:07:13.439> for<00:07:13.729> so<00:07:15.199> that's<00:07:16.199> the

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:17.089 
strike Network stands for so that's the

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:20.239 
strike Network stands for so that's the
finger<00:07:18.089> roll<00:07:18.239> to<00:07:18.599> the<00:07:18.719> reverse<00:07:19.019> grip<00:07:19.259> again

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:20.249 
finger roll to the reverse grip again

00:07:20.249 --> 00:07:23.059 
finger roll to the reverse grip again
you<00:07:20.429> had<00:07:20.579> your<00:07:21.229> cross<00:07:22.229> over<00:07:22.529> to<00:07:22.739> the<00:07:22.799> reverse

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:23.069 
you had your cross over to the reverse

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:31.629 
you had your cross over to the reverse
grip<00:07:23.309> now<00:07:24.179> you<00:07:24.269> can<00:07:24.509> get<00:07:24.629> to<00:07:24.839> one

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:31.639 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:33.459 

so<00:07:32.060> that's<00:07:32.270> the<00:07:32.419> finger<00:07:32.810> roll<00:07:32.960> -<00:07:33.139> the<00:07:33.229> reverse

00:07:33.459 --> 00:07:33.469 
so that's the finger roll - the reverse

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:36.040 
so that's the finger roll - the reverse
grip<00:07:34.240> spend<00:07:35.240> some<00:07:35.360> time<00:07:35.539> with<00:07:35.659> that<00:07:35.719> one<00:07:35.900> it's

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.050 
grip spend some time with that one it's

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.510 
grip spend some time with that one it's
a<00:07:36.139> very<00:07:36.349> good<00:07:36.530> technique<00:07:36.889> to<00:07:36.919> learn<00:07:37.159> and<00:07:37.340> for

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 
a very good technique to learn and for

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.649 
a very good technique to learn and for
surprise<00:07:38.000> and<00:07:38.990> just<00:07:39.379> for<00:07:39.560> some<00:07:39.770> show<00:07:40.659> so

00:07:41.649 --> 00:07:41.659 
surprise and just for some show so

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:42.939 
surprise and just for some show so
