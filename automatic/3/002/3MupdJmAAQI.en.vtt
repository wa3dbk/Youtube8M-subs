and<00:01:18.270> come<00:01:18.840> back<00:01:18.890> okay<00:01:19.890> moving<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.759> once<00:01:21.360> you

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
and come back okay moving on once you

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.330 
and come back okay moving on once you
have<00:01:21.659> your<00:01:21.810> solved<00:01:22.170> side<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.950> want<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.189> hold

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
have your solved side you want to hold

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.399 
have your solved side you want to hold
this<00:01:23.520> side<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.150> bottom<00:01:24.509> for<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> rest<00:01:25.259> of

steps two and three in step two you're

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.749 
steps two and three in step two you're
going<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.380> want<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.650> look<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.490> center

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
going to want to look for the center

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.819 
going to want to look for the center
that's<00:01:30.240> opposite<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.020> what<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.320> started<00:01:31.740> on

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
that's opposite of what you started on

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.609 
that's opposite of what you started on
now<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.369> started<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:33.030> white<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:34.020> I'm<00:01:34.320> looking

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
now I started on white so I'm looking

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.649 
now I started on white so I'm looking
for<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.920> yellow<00:01:35.130> Center<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.390> right

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
for the yellow Center and it's right

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.660 
for the yellow Center and it's right
here<00:01:36.990> you're<00:01:37.770> going<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:37.979> want<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.250> hold<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
here you're going to want to hold the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.940 
here you're going to want to hold the
yellow<00:01:39.000> Center<00:01:39.390> facing<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.710> side

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
yellow Center facing you and the side

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.100 
yellow Center facing you and the side
you<00:01:41.130> started<00:01:41.490> on<00:01:41.579> facing<00:01:42.060> down<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.509> you're

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
you started on facing down and you're

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.690 
you started on facing down and you're
going<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.259> do<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> sledgehammer<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.579> you're

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
going to do a sledgehammer so you're

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.100 
going to do a sledgehammer so you're
going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.909> do<00:01:45.030> right<00:01:45.720> inverted<00:01:46.430> left<00:01:48.110> right

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
going to do right inverted left right

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.399 
going to do right inverted left right
left<00:01:49.820> inverted<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.420> what<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.659> did<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.079> put

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
left inverted so what that did is it put

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.620 
left inverted so what that did is it put
the<00:01:52.560> yellow<00:01:52.710> Center<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.549> top<00:01:53.790> which<00:01:54.240> just

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the yellow Center on the top which just

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.319 
the yellow Center on the top which just
completed<00:01:55.110> step<00:01:55.380> two<00:01:55.619> now<00:01:56.520> moving<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.149> step

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
completed step two now moving on to step

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.690 
completed step two now moving on to step
three<00:01:57.630> step<00:01:57.689> three<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.439> taking<00:01:59.100> these<00:01:59.219> corners

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
three step three is taking these corners

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.300 
three step three is taking these corners
and<00:01:59.880> flipping<00:02:00.719> them<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.350> one<00:02:01.710> side<00:02:02.009> and

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and flipping them so it's one side and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.760 
and flipping them so it's one side and
there<00:02:02.700> are<00:02:02.759> two<00:02:02.939> cases<00:02:03.149> for<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.710> is

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
there are two cases for this so this is

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.649 
there are two cases for this so this is
the<00:02:04.920> first<00:02:05.280> case<00:02:05.520> where<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.969> have<00:02:06.149> two

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
the first case where you have two

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.309 
the first case where you have two
yellows<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:08.039> are<00:02:08.250> facing<00:02:09.050> opposite<00:02:10.050> from

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
yellows that are facing opposite from

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.050 
yellows that are facing opposite from
each<00:02:10.500> other<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.950> two<00:02:11.310> yellows<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.940> are

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
each other and two yellows that are

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.040 
each other and two yellows that are
facing<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.810> same

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
facing in the same

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.660 
facing in the same
wait<00:02:13.290> now<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.040> want<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.310> hold<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.520> two

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
wait now you want to hold the two

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.640 
wait now you want to hold the two
yellows<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.420> are<00:02:15.570> facing<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.050> same<00:02:16.230> way<00:02:16.290> on

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
yellows that are facing the same way on

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.130 
yellows that are facing the same way on
the<00:02:17.040> left<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.610> then<00:02:18.240> on<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.690> right<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:18.900> want

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
the left and then on the right you want

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.290 
the left and then on the right you want
to<00:02:19.290> have<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.800> one<00:02:20.070> yellow<00:02:20.400> that's<00:02:20.670> facing<00:02:20.940> you

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
to have the one yellow that's facing you

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.170 
to have the one yellow that's facing you
and<00:02:21.510> you're<00:02:22.170> going<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.320> do<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.740> sledgehammer<00:02:23.490> so

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
and you're going to do a sledgehammer so

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.650 
and you're going to do a sledgehammer so
right<00:02:24.450> inverted<00:02:24.870> left<00:02:25.640> right<00:02:26.640> left<00:02:26.910> and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
right inverted left right left and

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.410 
right inverted left right left and
verted<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.140> then<00:02:28.680> sledgehammer<00:02:29.220> again<00:02:29.580> right

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
verted and then sledgehammer again right

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.400

inverted<00:02:30.870> left<00:02:31.380> right<00:02:32.340> left<00:02:32.660> inverted<00:02:33.660> so<00:02:34.200> as

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
inverted left right left inverted so as

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.620 
inverted left right left inverted so as
you<00:02:34.530> can<00:02:34.680> see<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.130> case<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.670> kind<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.390> similar

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
you can see this case is kind of similar

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.960 
you can see this case is kind of similar
to<00:02:36.750> case<00:02:37.020> one<00:02:37.260> right<00:02:38.070> here<00:02:38.400> though<00:02:38.580> we<00:02:38.850> have

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
to case one right here though we have

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.060 
to case one right here though we have
two<00:02:39.210> corners<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.870> are<00:02:39.930> correctly<00:02:40.500> oriented

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
two corners that are correctly oriented

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.130 
two corners that are correctly oriented
and<00:02:41.280> then<00:02:41.700> two<00:02:41.880> corners<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.480> are<00:02:42.660> correctly

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
and then two corners that are correctly

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.110 
and then two corners that are correctly
oriented<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:44.070> need<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.310> figure<00:02:44.520> out<00:02:44.670> first

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
oriented you need to figure out first

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.820 
oriented you need to figure out first
how<00:02:45.540> you're<00:02:45.750> going<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:45.960> hold<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.320> when<00:02:46.710> you

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
how you're going to hold it when you

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.890 
how you're going to hold it when you
perform<00:02:47.190> this<00:02:47.310> algorithm<00:02:47.670> what<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.660> want<00:02:48.810> to

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
perform this algorithm what you want to

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.740 
perform this algorithm what you want to
do<00:02:49.020> is<00:02:49.260> have<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.310> incorrect<00:02:50.910> yellow<00:02:51.360> corner

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
do is have the incorrect yellow corner

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.170 
do is have the incorrect yellow corner
on<00:02:51.900> your<00:02:52.470> left<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:53.100> have<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.670> yellow<00:02:53.880> be

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
on your left and have the yellow be

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.870 
on your left and have the yellow be
facing<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:55.080> so<00:02:55.290> this<00:02:55.530> incorrect<00:02:55.980> corner<00:02:56.430> must

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
facing you so this incorrect corner must

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.030 
facing you so this incorrect corner must
be<00:02:57.210> correct<00:02:57.630> because<00:02:58.110> it's<00:02:58.290> on<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.530> left<00:02:58.770> and

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
be correct because it's on the left and

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.310 
be correct because it's on the left and
it's<00:02:59.910> incorrect<00:03:00.180> well<00:03:00.630> that's<00:03:00.930> wrong

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
it's incorrect well that's wrong

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.910 
it's incorrect well that's wrong
actually<00:03:01.950> because<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.540> yellow<00:03:03.900> isn't<00:03:04.530> facing

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
actually because the yellow isn't facing

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.980 
actually because the yellow isn't facing
you<00:03:05.070> but<00:03:05.280> if<00:03:05.460> you<00:03:05.550> flip<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.850> over<00:03:06.030> its<00:03:06.630> facing

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
you but if you flip it over its facing

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.300 
you but if you flip it over its facing
you<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.440> want<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.620> hold<00:03:07.710> it<00:03:07.860> like<00:03:07.980> this

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
you so you want to hold it like this

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.380 
you so you want to hold it like this
and<00:03:08.400> you're<00:03:08.550> going<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.700> perform<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.210> double

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
and you're going to perform the double

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.060 
and you're going to perform the double
sledgehammer<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:12.620> then<00:03:13.620> you're<00:03:13.800> going<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:13.950> do

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
sledgehammer and then you're going to do

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.890 
sledgehammer and then you're going to do
that<00:03:14.190> again<00:03:14.310> because<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:15.300> recognize<00:03:15.750> this

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
that again because you recognize this

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.770 
that again because you recognize this
case<00:03:16.170> don't<00:03:16.920> do<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.220> again<00:03:17.430> here<00:03:17.730> though<00:03:17.910> turn

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
case don't do it again here though turn

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.890 
case don't do it again here though turn
it<00:03:19.310> double<00:03:20.310> sledgehammer<00:03:23.660> that's<00:03:24.660> how<00:03:24.840> you

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
it double sledgehammer that's how you

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.210 
it double sledgehammer that's how you
solve<00:03:25.200> step<00:03:25.830> 3<00:03:26.190> moving<00:03:27.120> on<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.360> step<00:03:27.750> 4<00:03:28.170> this<00:03:28.950> is

solve step 3 moving on to step 4 this is

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.670 
solve step 3 moving on to step 4 this is

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
to be swapped now this case is a little

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.680 
to be swapped now this case is a little
bit<00:03:36.989> different<00:03:37.470> instead<00:03:37.890> of<00:03:37.980> having<00:03:38.270> one<00:03:39.270> face

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690

your front one of these corners is going

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.150 
your front one of these corners is going
to<00:03:42.660> be<00:03:42.750> your<00:03:42.870> front<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:43.320> just<00:03:43.530> use<00:03:43.770> one<00:03:44.010> of<00:03:44.040> the

that you're going to want to do a Z and

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.560 
that you're going to want to do a Z and
then<00:04:01.620> you're<00:04:02.070> going<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.310> have<00:04:02.489> this<00:04:02.880> corner<00:04:03.300> as

then you're going to have this corner as

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.380 
then you're going to have this corner as
your<00:04:04.080> front<00:04:04.320> so<00:04:05.100> you've<00:04:05.280> swapped<00:04:05.700> from<00:04:06.209> this

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
sequence of moves and that solves the H

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.120

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
come down and fit in with the corners so

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.589 
come down and fit in with the corners so
I<00:05:43.110> can<00:05:43.380> see<00:05:43.590> that<00:05:43.770> if<00:05:43.950> we<00:05:43.979> bring<00:05:44.490> this<00:05:44.910> center

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
I can see that if we bring this center

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:48.409 
I can see that if we bring this center
piece<00:05:45.810> down<00:05:46.680> with<00:05:47.160> the<00:05:47.520> red<00:05:47.760> corners<00:05:48.180> that

center<00:05:51.030> piece<00:05:51.240> with<00:05:51.479> red<00:05:51.690> corners<00:05:52.110> but<00:05:52.680> if<00:05:52.770> we

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
center piece with red corners but if we

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.550 
center piece with red corners but if we
flip<00:05:53.130> it<00:05:53.220> around<00:05:53.340> we<00:05:54.210> can<00:05:54.419> see<00:05:54.720> that<00:05:55.110> if<00:05:55.380> we

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
flip it around we can see that if we

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.890 
flip it around we can see that if we
bring<00:05:55.680> the<00:05:55.860> orange<00:05:56.070> center<00:05:56.639> piece<00:05:56.880> down<00:05:57.240> with

bring the orange center piece down with
the<00:05:58.260> orange<00:05:58.680> corners<00:05:59.099> that<00:05:59.580> would<00:05:59.820> fit

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
the orange corners that would fit

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.029 
the orange corners that would fit
perfectly<00:06:00.570> once<00:06:01.199> you're<00:06:01.410> ready<00:06:01.590> to<00:06:01.800> bring
