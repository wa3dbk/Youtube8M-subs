00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
doing this outside of the tank you can

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.640 
doing this outside of the tank you can
epoxy<00:01:42.120> and<00:01:42.210> sand<00:01:42.480> the<00:01:42.630> entire<00:01:42.870> piece<00:01:43.320> first

epoxy and sand the entire piece first

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.070 
epoxy and sand the entire piece first
and<00:01:44.010> then<00:01:44.340> place<00:01:44.550> it<00:01:44.580> in<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.909> tank<00:01:45.120> the

and then place it in the tank the
advantage<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.680> doing<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:47.010> this<00:01:47.130> way<00:01:47.190> since<00:01:47.610> I'm

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
solid backdrop was that I could place

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.270 
solid backdrop was that I could place
them<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.150> tank<00:01:54.500> epoxy<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.740> hide<00:01:56.070> the

them in the tank epoxy and hide the

them in the tank epoxy and hide the
scene<00:01:56.520> between<00:01:56.729> those<00:01:57.120> pieces<00:01:59.360> as<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.570> can

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
scene between those pieces as you can

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.980 
scene between those pieces as you can
see<00:02:01.909> never<00:02:02.909> hurts<00:02:03.120> to<00:02:03.180> go<00:02:03.300> a<00:02:03.330> little<00:02:03.479> overboard

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990

it's still removable but it's gonna take

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.800 
it's still removable but it's gonna take
some<00:03:01.959> work<00:03:01.989> now<00:03:03.030> we<00:03:04.030> cut<00:03:04.300> it<00:03:04.390> all<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.630> fit

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810

some work now we cut it all to fit
underneath<00:03:05.320> our<00:03:05.680> overflow<00:03:06.280> we<00:03:06.430> built<00:03:06.670> earlier

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
underneath our overflow we built earlier

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.990 
underneath our overflow we built earlier
it<00:03:07.959> should<00:03:08.170> fit<00:03:08.380> nice<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.680> snug<00:03:08.920> there<00:03:09.760> we<00:03:09.850> go

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
everywhere we've put silicone just to

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.070 
everywhere we've put silicone just to
make<00:03:21.670> sure<00:03:21.880> that<00:03:22.030> silicones<00:03:22.510> press<00:03:22.840> to<00:03:23.050> the

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
make sure that silicones press to the

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.229 
make sure that silicones press to the
glass<00:03:23.410> it<00:03:23.800> spreads<00:03:24.130> out<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.580> gives<00:03:24.790> us<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:25.090> nice

that's the side that was tapered down
opposite<00:03:56.330> the<00:03:56.390> overflow<00:03:57.400> tapers<00:03:58.400> kind<00:03:58.640> of

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
opposite the overflow tapers kind of

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
down towards the end of the tank to give

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.110 
down towards the end of the tank to give
us<00:04:00.860> that<00:04:01.070> shelf<00:04:01.460> look<00:04:01.760> that<00:04:01.970> I<00:04:02.000> wanted<00:04:03.940> so<00:04:04.940> here

we'll<00:04:05.300> see<00:04:05.510> this<00:04:05.660> is<00:04:05.840> out<00:04:05.990> sets<00:04:06.320> in<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.590> tank

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
we'll see this is out sets in the tank

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.890 
we'll see this is out sets in the tank
there's<00:04:07.400> it<00:04:07.550> as<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:07.880> overflow<00:04:08.240> and<00:04:08.450> there's

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
there's it as the overflow and there's

the other piece and you can see there's

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.820 
the other piece and you can see there's
a<00:04:10.400> very<00:04:10.700> clear<00:04:11.090> seam<00:04:11.630> now<00:04:11.960> we<00:04:12.140> did<00:04:12.290> our<00:04:12.410> best<00:04:12.590> to

make<00:04:12.860> blend<00:04:13.250> that<00:04:13.400> earlier<00:04:13.820> but<00:04:14.750> as<00:04:14.870> we<00:04:15.020> go

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
make blend that earlier but as we go

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.140

pond<00:04:19.580> foam<00:04:19.880> at<00:04:20.030> this<00:04:20.210> point<00:04:20.540> throw<00:04:20.870> a<00:04:20.960> little

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
pond foam at this point throw a little

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.250 
rock salt on it or solar salt let it set
up<00:04:24.890> and<00:04:25.190> then<00:04:25.340> go<00:04:25.600> this<00:04:26.600> next<00:04:26.930> step<00:04:27.110> I've

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
up and then go this next step I've

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.780 
up and then go this next step I've
gotten<00:04:27.530> fast-forward<00:04:28.190> because<00:04:28.310> it's<00:04:28.430> a<00:04:28.610> very

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
gotten fast-forward because it's a very

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.050 
gotten fast-forward because it's a very
long<00:04:29.090> process<00:04:29.170> I<00:04:30.170> got<00:04:30.860> our<00:04:31.040> epoxy<00:04:31.400> mixed<00:04:31.910> up

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
long process I got our epoxy mixed up

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.490 
long process I got our epoxy mixed up
and<00:04:32.300> very<00:04:32.510> straightforward<00:04:32.840> using<00:04:33.260> our

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
and very straightforward using our

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.440 
and very straightforward using our
two-part<00:04:33.980> we're<00:04:34.580> brushing<00:04:34.850> it<00:04:35.090> in<00:04:35.210> now<00:04:35.390> I've

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
two-part we're brushing it in now I've

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.000 
two-part we're brushing it in now I've
got<00:04:35.570> some<00:04:35.720> cheap<00:04:35.960> paintbrushes<00:04:36.620> that<00:04:36.770> I'm

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
got some cheap paintbrushes that I'm

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.260 
got some cheap paintbrushes that I'm
using<00:04:37.250> here<00:04:38.800> use<00:04:39.800> cheap<00:04:40.100> ones<00:04:40.340> because<00:04:40.700> after

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
using here use cheap ones because after

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.870 
using here use cheap ones because after
you<00:04:41.660> were<00:04:41.780> done<00:04:41.930> with<00:04:41.990> this<00:04:42.290> it's<00:04:43.160> gonna<00:04:43.370> set

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
you were done with this it's gonna set

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.000 
you were done with this it's gonna set
up<00:04:44.030> really<00:04:44.750> hard<00:04:45.050> and<00:04:45.380> the<00:04:45.500> brushes<00:04:45.710> would<00:04:45.920> be

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
up really hard and the brushes would be

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.490 
up really hard and the brushes would be
completely<00:04:46.340> useless<00:04:46.610> I<00:04:47.060> also<00:04:47.900> have<00:04:48.260> some

completely useless I also have some
smaller<00:04:48.800> detail<00:04:49.310> brushes<00:04:49.760> that<00:04:49.910> I<00:04:50.000> picked<00:04:50.210> up

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
smaller detail brushes that I picked up

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.390 
smaller detail brushes that I picked up

even<00:05:29.420> use<00:05:29.630> the<00:05:29.780> epoxy<00:05:30.320> so<00:05:30.500> you<00:05:30.560> do<00:05:30.800> have<00:05:30.830> this

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
even use the epoxy so you do have this

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.770 
even use the epoxy so you do have this
option<00:05:31.640> if<00:05:31.760> you've<00:05:31.880> used<00:05:32.060> a<00:05:32.210> good<00:05:32.420> quality

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
a little more natural especially if

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.760 
a little more natural especially if
you've<00:05:55.010> mixed<00:05:55.430> with<00:05:55.669> foam

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
you don't have to worry about how it

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:06.270
