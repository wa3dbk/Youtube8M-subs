so<00:03:20.570> you<00:03:20.600> can<00:03:20.840> either<00:03:21.020> stop<00:03:21.380> here<00:03:21.740> and<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.280> would

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
so you can either stop here and it would

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.760 
so you can either stop here and it would
be<00:03:22.550> like<00:03:22.730> sort<00:03:23.300> of<00:03:23.330> a<00:03:23.420> twisted<00:03:23.870> ponytail<00:03:24.080> or

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
be like sort of a twisted ponytail or

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.740 
be like sort of a twisted ponytail or
you<00:03:25.160> can<00:03:25.340> go<00:03:25.460> all<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:25.730> way<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:26.270> do<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.510> braid

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
you can go all the way and do the braid

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.420 
you can go all the way and do the braid

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
and that's actually the hardest part

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.400

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
because if you have long hair and you're

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.170

braiding<00:03:30.590> back<00:03:30.980> you<00:03:31.520> know<00:03:31.610> it<00:03:31.760> gets<00:03:31.910> a<00:03:32.000> little

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
braiding back you know it gets a little

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.180 
braiding back you know it gets a little
bit<00:03:32.360> tiring<00:03:32.600> for<00:03:32.960> the<00:03:33.050> arms<00:03:33.380> so<00:03:33.890> I'm<00:03:33.980> going<00:03:34.130> to
