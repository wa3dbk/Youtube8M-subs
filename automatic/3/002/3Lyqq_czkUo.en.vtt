00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.800
 hello again with you today we come 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:08.140
 to teach how to make these little ones 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.990
 Snowman applique for you 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.030
 they put their accessories are made 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.910
 totally by hand very easy very 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.039
 simple so they can decorate or 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.280
 make brooches to place the 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.460
 christmas hats 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.610
 to the shirts to use and 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.530
 decorate their 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.560
 Christmas bows 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.470
 very easy is very simple there are two 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.690
 ways to do it the first one is like 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.690
 these that are elaborated 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.910
 of the ring 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.129
 and they are filled with a material that is 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.860
 uses for the dolls the second 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.980
 option 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.710
 you buy these little balls of behavior 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.310
 split it in half with a knife 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.260
 you have these are the halves the 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.809
 we crush a little bit so that 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.500
 they are so round with the hand they give 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.060
 the way and we are already easy for 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.860
 to work 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.549
 Today I am going to teach you how to do 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.280
 these are the coupon ball because 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.979
 the others would cut the circles on 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.320
 size that you wish how they are going to be 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.380
 little guy the men had the circles 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.640
 they are tiny they pass him sewing all over 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.330
 around the circle 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.250
 then they frown on the fabric and the reality 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.810
 in the filling the little ball remains 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.119
 what these dolls can do in 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.540
 either the options 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:44.750
 can elaborate the one that facilitates 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:47.390
 then we will do today that is 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.050
 the comfort ball 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.890
 here we already have a big circle for 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.890
 can cover 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.240
 we cover them with a cloth with the same 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.790
 fabric ring 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.750
 the temples well the cloth so that we do not 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.750
 there are wrinkles 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.880
 we use thread 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.120
 we are going to give it several laps in the part 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.120
 behind 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.939
 here we make some rings to go 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.939
 securing the thread that will let us go 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.140
 we already have ready lined in what is the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.629
 part of man's face 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.629
 we cut the fabric over 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:50.770
 what planet so that they are not open 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:53.350
 the little dolls 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.540
 we already have here what will be the 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.720
 face of the doll to make the 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.580
 hats can use felt or 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.470
 can use fabric 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.110
 This is a Christmas fabric that can be 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.240
 get in doll stores or 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.360
 the felt or any red fabric that 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.750
 you have them in your houses or colors 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.780
 any or that you can not do 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.819
 here we are going to cut 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.819
 a bit a rectangle 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.380
 we are going to fold it doing a little bit 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.210
 we take the measure of the head of the 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.270
 doll 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.900
 we have it applied to the 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.900
 silicone 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.370
 they stick and cut the surplus that they 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.370
 remain of fabric 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.380
 these dolls are super easy super 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.360
 simple to do 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.520
 here we have what is the little hat 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.120
 to give the shape of the hat 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.930
 you are going to pick it up with your hand to the 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.930
 top 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:04.660
 They use a thin ribbon 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.660
 turning around makes a few knots 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.050
 If you wish, you can make a little 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.050
 hat 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:23.930
 and the top part we cut a little bit 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.930
 so that we do not stay too high we cut 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.490
 here we have what is the little hat 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.490
 for our doll we are going to stick it 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.080
 using your silicone gun or 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:43.150
 It can be cold silicone apply practice 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:46.680
 silicone all around the hat 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.680
 place the little head 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:56.009
 when it's like this, this is the little ball of ccoo 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.220
 for using a permanent marker 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:01.560
 delgadito to start making points 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.759
 that we will be like this and 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:09.500
 we started making dots forming 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.500
 that is going to be the doll's mouth 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.290
 something super simple you can paint with 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.010
 this same the little eyes some little circles 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:23.040
 we must remove the eyes and go for 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.650
 last to put a nose and is this 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.840
 is elaborated by being the micro or if 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.080
 you do not get or you do not have a 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.720
 visit you can place a button and a 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.570
 little thumbnails tiny thumbs 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:40.470
 can place an acrylic nugget or a 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:43.020
 do something in shape and you can place 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.210
 the noses the important thing is that it 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.380
 risk being these dolls for 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:52.660
 dislodge its accessories 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.660
 here we are going to place the nose and it is 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.020
 ready the last thing that would be 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.590
 to make them is to paint them 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.229
 cheeks of the doll with the robot 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.530
 make them up so that they give life and 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:12.590
 place it in your accessories I hope this 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:15.380
 project you liked what you can 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.440
 do and later we will do more 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:21.760
 videos with bows using these 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:24.520
 small accessories that we have made 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.540
