00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
so at the exertion games lab we research

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.129 
so at the exertion games lab we research
the<00:00:10.200> intersection<00:00:10.980> between<00:00:11.519> technology<00:00:12.139> the

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
the intersection between technology the

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.640 
the intersection between technology the
play<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:14.009> body<00:00:14.750> because<00:00:15.750> we<00:00:15.990> believe<00:00:16.260> we

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
play and the body because we believe we

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.519 
play and the body because we believe we
sit<00:00:17.310> way<00:00:17.490> too<00:00:17.550> much<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:18.449> our<00:00:18.660> work<00:00:18.990> lives<00:00:19.170> and

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
sit way too much in our work lives and

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.439 
sit way too much in our work lives and
we<00:00:20.369> want<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.609> get<00:00:20.699> people<00:00:20.760> excited<00:00:21.060> about

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
we want to get people excited about

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.420 
we want to get people excited about
being<00:00:21.750> physically<00:00:22.199> active<00:00:22.289> again<00:00:22.740> what<00:00:23.279> we've

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
being physically active again what we've

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.740 
being physically active again what we've
been<00:00:23.550> working<00:00:23.699> on<00:00:23.939> for<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.180> past<00:00:24.240> couple<00:00:24.600> of

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
been working on for the past couple of

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.609 
been working on for the past couple of
months<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.560> helmet<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.939> able<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.840> show

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
months is a helmet that is able to show

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.060 
months is a helmet that is able to show
information<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.330> outside<00:00:30.660> world<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:31.560> did

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
information to the outside world we did

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.130 
information to the outside world we did
that<00:00:32.219> by<00:00:32.430> turning<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.059> into<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.660> kind<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:33.989> low

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
that by turning it into a kind of low

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.950 
that by turning it into a kind of low
resolution<00:00:34.649> display<00:00:35.010> by<00:00:35.719> covering<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.899> with

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
resolution display by covering it with

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.470 
resolution display by covering it with
LEDs<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.829> all<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.760> these<00:00:38.850> LEDs<00:00:39.210> are

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
LEDs and all of these LEDs are

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.840 
LEDs and all of these LEDs are
multicolored<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.500> we<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.370> control<00:00:41.700> them

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
multicolored and we can control them

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.790 
multicolored and we can control them
individually<00:00:42.090> which<00:00:42.870> means<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.559> can

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
individually which means that you can

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.369 
individually which means that you can
display<00:00:44.129> patterns<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.059> numbers<00:00:45.690> colors

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
display patterns on it numbers colors

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.920 
display patterns on it numbers colors
and<00:00:47.030> what<00:00:48.030> we've<00:00:48.149> been<00:00:48.239> thinking<00:00:48.420> about<00:00:48.660> is

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
and what we've been thinking about is

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.450 
and what we've been thinking about is
what<00:00:49.230> does<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.469> mean<00:00:49.680> when<00:00:49.710> your<00:00:49.980> helmet

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
what does it mean when your helmet

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.010 
what does it mean when your helmet
becomes<00:00:50.850> interactive<00:00:51.210> what<00:00:51.660> does<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.840> mean

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
becomes interactive what does it mean

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.630 
becomes interactive what does it mean
when<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.530> show<00:00:52.829> information<00:00:53.430> about

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
when it can show information about

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.029 
when it can show information about
yourself<00:00:53.960> and<00:00:54.960> we've<00:00:55.110> been<00:00:55.230> talking<00:00:55.949> with

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
yourself and we've been talking with

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.189 
yourself and we've been talking with
different<00:00:56.370> user<00:00:56.550> groups<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:57.360> use<00:00:57.780> helmets

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
different user groups that use helmets

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.549 
different user groups that use helmets
in<00:00:58.289> their<00:00:58.440> activities<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.340> cycling<00:01:00.239> or

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
in their activities like cycling or

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.840 
in their activities like cycling or
skateboarding<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:01.890> construction<00:01:02.460> workers

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
skateboarding or construction workers

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.630 
skateboarding or construction workers
and<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.030> asked<00:01:03.239> them<00:01:03.390> what<00:01:03.930> would<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.229> do<00:01:04.640> with

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
and we asked them what would you do with

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.890 
and we asked them what would you do with
a<00:01:05.670> helmet<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.119> has<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.600> kind<00:01:06.659> of

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
a helmet that has this kind of

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.960 
a helmet that has this kind of
capability<00:01:07.049> how<00:01:07.560> could<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.830> help<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.909> your

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
capability how could it help you in your

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.910 
capability how could it help you in your
activities<00:01:09.600> one<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> problems<00:01:10.590> we've<00:01:10.890> had

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
activities one of the problems we've had

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.000 
activities one of the problems we've had
for<00:01:11.369> many<00:01:11.490> years<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.180> drivers<00:01:12.900> say<00:01:13.170> Sorry

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
for many years is the drivers say Sorry

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.280 
for many years is the drivers say Sorry
mate<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.460> didn't<00:01:14.850> see<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.330> even<00:01:15.780> though<00:01:15.960> we're

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
mate I didn't see you even though we're

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.070 
mate I didn't see you even though we're
there<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.680> full<00:01:17.009> view<00:01:17.310> everyone<00:01:18.270> else<00:01:18.479> saw<00:01:18.840> us

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
there in full view everyone else saw us

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.219 
there in full view everyone else saw us
but<00:01:19.290> one<00:01:19.860> particular<00:01:20.250> person<00:01:20.670> didn't<00:01:21.270> see<00:01:21.450> so

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
but one particular person didn't see so

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.770 
but one particular person didn't see so
the<00:01:22.830> bikes<00:01:23.130> are<00:01:23.340> out<00:01:23.580> there<00:01:23.909> they're<00:01:24.299> visible

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
the bikes are out there they're visible

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.560 
the bikes are out there they're visible
but<00:01:25.110> they're<00:01:25.320> not<00:01:25.500> being<00:01:25.950> recognized<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.119> I

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
but they're not being recognized and I

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.319 
but they're not being recognized and I
think<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.020> project<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.920> an<00:01:29.640> interesting<00:01:29.880> way

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
think this project is an interesting way

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.380 
think this project is an interesting way
of<00:01:30.659> introducing<00:01:31.500> some<00:01:32.070> kind<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.790> signaling

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
of introducing some kind of signaling

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.020 
of introducing some kind of signaling
behavior<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.079> part<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> cyclist<00:01:35.220> that

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
behavior on the part of the cyclist that

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.840 
behavior on the part of the cyclist that
may<00:01:36.420> help<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.110> make<00:01:37.320> us<00:01:37.530> more<00:01:37.850> recognizable

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
may help to make us more recognizable

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.179 
may help to make us more recognizable
helmet<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> static<00:01:40.020> object<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.920> there

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
helmet is a static object that is there

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.789 
helmet is a static object that is there
to<00:01:41.579> protect<00:01:42.270> us<00:01:42.570> when<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:42.780> fall<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.290> for<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
to protect us when we fall and for the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.410 
to protect us when we fall and for the
rest<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> time<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:44.579> dare<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.299> not

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
rest of the time it's just dare it's not

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.210 
rest of the time it's just dare it's not
doing<00:01:45.750> anything<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.409> we<00:01:46.500> thought<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:47.040> is

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
doing anything so we thought this is

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.429 
doing anything so we thought this is
perfect<00:01:47.759> we<00:01:47.909> have<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.119> object<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.689> clearly

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
perfect we have this object is clearly

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.620 
perfect we have this object is clearly
visible<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:50.009> everybody<00:01:50.220> else<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.479> we

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
visible to everybody else and that we

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.139 
visible to everybody else and that we
can<00:01:51.810> use<00:01:51.840> as<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.770> means<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.040> communication<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
can use as a means of communication the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.850 
can use as a means of communication the
research<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.509> important<00:01:55.110> because<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.590> believe

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
research is important because we believe

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.149 
research is important because we believe
if<00:01:56.159> we<00:01:56.430> make<00:01:56.670> wearing<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.689> helmet<00:01:58.159> more

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
if we make wearing a helmet more

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.819 
if we make wearing a helmet more

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
engaging more fun we can actually not

engaging more fun we can actually not

only facilitate more people to wear

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.789 
only facilitate more people to wear
helmets<00:02:04.939> which<00:02:05.939> can<00:02:06.180> increase<00:02:06.420> safety<00:02:06.799> but

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
helmets which can increase safety but

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.430 
helmets which can increase safety but
also<00:02:08.060> inspire<00:02:09.060> us<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.390> think<00:02:09.780> about<00:02:10.050> how

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
also inspire us to think about how

also inspire us to think about how
technology

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
technology

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.000 
technology

create new opportunities for engagement
and<00:02:14.550> get<00:02:15.060> really<00:02:15.270> people<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.690> think<00:02:15.930> about<00:02:16.170> how

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
and get really people to think about how

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.300 
and get really people to think about how
we<00:02:17.010> can<00:02:17.220> facilitate<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.300> inject<00:02:18.959> play<00:02:19.500> back

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
we can facilitate and inject play back

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.640 
we can facilitate and inject play back
into<00:02:20.700> physical<00:02:21.060> activity<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:22.020> get<00:02:22.200> people

into physical activity to get people

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.979 
into physical activity to get people
excited<00:02:23.069> about<00:02:23.670> moving<00:02:24.239> their<00:02:24.510> bodies<00:02:24.750> again

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
excited about moving their bodies again

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.309 
excited about moving their bodies again
I<00:02:25.230> think<00:02:26.099> it's<00:02:26.220> really<00:02:26.400> interesting<00:02:26.670> about

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
I think it's really interesting about

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.920 
I think it's really interesting about
how<00:02:28.319> does<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.560> cyclist<00:02:29.660> represent<00:02:30.660> themselves

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
how does a cyclist represent themselves

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.530 
how does a cyclist represent themselves
and<00:02:31.530> their<00:02:31.650> personality<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.670> who<00:02:33.060> they<00:02:33.330> are

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
and their personality and who they are

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.050 
and their personality and who they are
two<00:02:34.380> other<00:02:34.680> bike<00:02:35.069> riders<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:35.850> think

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
two other bike riders and I think

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.400 
two other bike riders and I think
there's<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.330> lot<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.569> interest<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.110> know<00:02:37.200> in

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
there's a lot of interest you know in

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.670 
there's a lot of interest you know in
using<00:02:37.800> new<00:02:38.100> technology<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.120> can<00:02:39.900> help<00:02:40.410> us

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
using new technology that can help us

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.520 
using new technology that can help us
identify<00:02:41.340> ourselves<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.750> others<00:02:43.170> who<00:02:43.319> might

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
identify ourselves to others who might

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.350 
identify ourselves to others who might
be<00:02:43.739> interested<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:44.340> something<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.150> we're

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
be interested in something that we're

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.050 
be interested in something that we're
interested<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:47.280> think<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.640> visual

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
interested in and I think a visual

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.500 
interested in and I think a visual
display<00:02:48.239> an<00:02:48.810> LED<00:02:49.290> system<00:02:49.590> on<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:49.920> helmet<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.580> mean

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
display an LED system on a helmet I mean

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.160 
display an LED system on a helmet I mean
how<00:02:51.959> can<00:02:52.019> spicuous<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.890> that
