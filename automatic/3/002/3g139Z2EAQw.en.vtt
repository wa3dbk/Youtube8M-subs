 now depending on the color and the nutcracker to synthesize 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.050
 according to her, they are very usable especially they finish a lot 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.180
 work brands really see the nutcracker 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.640
 at least for me. 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.350
 I find myself really short 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.829
 the only thing this component is particularly detail to be 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.010
 handled with care 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.220
 I advise you to always use losers with flat points not serrated 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.149
 absolutely even if you don't risk it 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.080
 A lot of ruining rustics to forget it is the first time 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.080
 place the china scribe where they work very gently 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.220
 to close it and make the shape of the evening is very easy 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.950
 deformed if you go there with a lot of strength and now that I show up close to 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.469
 mind breaking crush on a crush 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.300
 octopus @ in time to this form 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.300
 appsync open Tunisian opera lacked the slice 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.060
 it's like a pierced pearl that lacks a fundamentally out-of-focus slice 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.049
 - love the prayer and your child with aro crush very often club 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.450
 home registration. since of a landslide 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.390
 because the others very often go parmadaily it is useful to damage their own 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.340
 in this way, he doesn't let me in with the common thread of Milan 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.720
 risk hail hammam 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.410
 formed one is that shackle crush close it short 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.290
 and this year it was a fiat result 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.290
 then usually it only attacked, you can put a closure for example 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.320
 here I am little crush it must be inserted in this way you see there is the part 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.150
 therefore 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.210
 lay down the crush now 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.210
 inside the copy crush 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.830
 here we are but take your flat tip pliers 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.429
 i with extreme really own delicacy 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.509
 slowly 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.509
 go and gently close this small sphere 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.340
 delicately because paradoxically it also depends 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.000
 the quality is the civil code there are some are particularly robust 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.610
 so you can work on it a little more, but others are a lot 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.420
 thin and then they deform really easily I recommend when insert 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.130
 komische china don't do as i am doing to bend her like this 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.559
 I'm just doing it to give you maximum visibility 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:39.620
 but while I work then you see 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.760
 stable stable catania usually when you work new post king 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.490
 diary topical issues. devastating 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.860
 I just want to show how to close the crushing cover once 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.170
 you have pressed a little bit at the end you have to work a little 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.720
 a pearl so you have to work it also in the blessed front - 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.309
 it is closing 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:02.679
 to crush well 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:04.040
 faults you must 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.889
 accompany 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.189
 crush it no 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:09.869
 with different movements to be seen depending on how 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:12.869
 Mr. 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.119
 the second lookout of the 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:18.979
 formed takes the crush does not give to crush more or less on one side norm 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:20.389
 dotada this form 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.389
 roundish 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:35.349
 the final result which must resemble a naturally closed pearl 

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:40.409
 at breakfast, it sucked 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.169
 of course because the camera is working too, it is very difficult for me 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.659
 maneuver it all 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.450
 interconsult ecoincentivi simultaneously to see 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.879
 vabbene o va brische 5 would really be a crap born mon amour yet but 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.329
 also no aquamassage ampullaria a little more closed 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.689
 however you have to work both in this direction 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.209
 than in this one 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.460
 and then it is distorted ancom little 'way 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.730
 hello david just accompanied 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.999
 dishes and not a result 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:16.239
 it resembles me a pearl also the crack must be 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.419
 as close as possible madÃ² that it is - libya 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:23.680
 but how do you see what a nice effect the pisticci park now 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.729
 if you drink it you have not only the ugly to see the bead months are a lot 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.669
 one of the most graceful examples 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.819
 applicable to crush copy will naturally have you can link all the 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.770
 Sometimes you think that the crush now falls 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.029
 to hit 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:40.809
 the nutcrunch of perfection is ugly 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:43.110
 consider, a thing also 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.300
 when to insert your own crushers 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.849
 from these I am bologna we do not see that they respect much greater sorry 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.050
 so if I have to insert a whole series of pearls 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.259
 maybe it is preferable to put the sketching cover at the beginning 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.270
 because they are a little hard to adjust to how much space you have 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.360
 let the couple sketching then soap 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.099
 it is difficult to understand how much you have to leave the soft work for one 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:11.539
 once the covi is also crushed, the processing take up the necklace 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.819
 it does not turn out film I recommend you once 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:19.589
 no crushing finally even directly komische cv km to insert 

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:21.909
 the various pearls mado 'that 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:25.990
 you may not find yourself with a job that is too close to being inserted 

00:05:25.989 --> 00:05:29.879
 the crushing cover really becomes a very stiff last thing that tgcom 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:32.759
 ischia there are different colors in different sizes 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:37.309
 and it also exists in silver so we are really particularly summer 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:40.830
 via hope of having video biasca I must say that we feel at the next hello
