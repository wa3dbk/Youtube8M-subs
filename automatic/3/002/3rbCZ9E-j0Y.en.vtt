crisscross pattern with these i like to

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.729 
crisscross pattern with these i like to
just<00:01:01.520> go<00:01:01.700> between<00:01:02.059> two<00:01:02.390> on<00:01:02.540> one<00:01:02.719> side<00:01:02.989> and<00:01:03.260> then

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
just go between two on one side and then

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.649 
just go between two on one side and then
two<00:01:04.220> on<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:04.489> other<00:01:04.640> side<00:01:04.909> and<00:01:05.210> you're<00:01:05.479> done

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
two on the other side and you're done

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.530 
two on the other side and you're done
this<00:01:06.170> has<00:01:06.409> a<00:01:06.650> lot<00:01:07.100> of<00:01:07.159> holding<00:01:07.640> holding<00:01:08.060> force

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
this has a lot of holding holding force

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.930 
this has a lot of holding holding force
for<00:01:08.990> this<00:01:09.560> type<00:01:09.770> of<00:01:09.799> button<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:10.430> i<00:01:10.549> just<00:01:10.790> want
