00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.020 
just for products that's how the range
launched<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.440> QVC<00:00:56.039> then<00:00:56.579> everything<00:00:56.850> else

I<00:01:58.399> think<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.549> starting<00:01:59.759> point<00:02:00.090> although<00:02:00.270> it

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
I think the starting point although it

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.510 
I think the starting point although it
wasn't<00:02:00.630> for<00:02:01.020> me<00:02:01.049> but<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.860> think<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.189> starting

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
wasn't for me but I think the starting

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.249 
wasn't for me but I think the starting
point<00:02:02.700> for<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.240> many<00:02:03.360> people<00:02:03.930> has<00:02:04.110> been

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
point for so many people has been

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.200 
point for so many people has been
cleansed<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.649> polish<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.939> funny

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
cleansed in polish and it is funny

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.700 
cleansed in polish and it is funny

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
because where my two children were

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.889 
because where my two children were
growing<00:02:07.920> up<00:02:08.190> they<00:02:08.940> used<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.330> use<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.750> when

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
growing up they used to use that when

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.600
