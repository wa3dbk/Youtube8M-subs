00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.000
 new issue here at smart tv the year 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.130
 is coming to an end and it is 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.960
 slow time to look back exactly that 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.969
 Let's do it today and look 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.860
 we go back to the smartphones in the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.480
 year 2013 were interesting 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.279
 We have six placements for this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.039
 altogether once in the area of ​​the top 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.350
 smartphones the top 3 mart phones of the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.390
 year 2013 and in the area of 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.490
 entry-level smartphones also a top 3 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.490
 of the year 2013 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.960
 you the top 3 places of each 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.340
 I would like to give you rubrics 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.290
 briefly explain to you the places 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.910
 we are a smartphone 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.559
 tariff comparison and there we have 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.020
 looked which smartphones most often 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.610
 were clicked on and of course with 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.019
 which smartphones most 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.489
 contract was concluded 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.230
 So now we have a rating 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.110
 developed and so we can now 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.090
 our top smartphones of the year 2013 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.180
 Present on place three we find 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.699
 that htc again the htc when was the top 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.530
 model of htc this year and it was 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.210
 also very successful and could 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.310
 next to the appliances of the big ones 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.770
 competitors like apple and samsung very much 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.780
 well assert and a firm place in 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.670
 the top smartphones take a very 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.740
 qualitative device from the outside but also 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.049
 especially advertised from the inside 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.540
 has htc with the new is händels 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.280
 surface and the htc boom sound me 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.810
 itself should be the device this year 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.460
 test and was really completely 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.080
 especially convinced of the workmanship 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.210
 a really great one 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.950
 Android smartphone on rank 3 of the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.340
 Beginners smartphones we find that 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.320
 Nokia Lumia 625 again many newcomers 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.120
 smartphones are smaller than the top 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.120
 model that is not here, however, the 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.700
 because the lumia 625 has one 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.280
 display size of 47 inches for it 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.750
 but only a resolution of 800 x 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.340
 480 pixels 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.160
 The device offers despite the cheap 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.920
 price features like Lte or a 5 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.750
 megapixel camera with full hd 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.909
 video recording function, however, should 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.130
 the entry-level smartphone to one or 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.740
 other smartphone power user then 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.020
 However, to be something as beginner 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.880
 smartphone all it is sufficient so 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.500
 on place three on place 2 the top 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.500
 smartphones we find the samsung 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.540
 galaxy s 4 managed back again 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.550
 It samsung to bring out a top model 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.099
 what technically sets new standards and 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.060
 really with countless new features 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.220
 came on the market 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.319
 I was also allowed to samsung galaxy s 4 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.150
 test this year and was from the 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.340
 performance as well as the features really 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.290
 However, the design convinced me 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.450
 not so impressed these 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.760
 plastic cover for not so devices 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.590
 like the HTC for example then 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.330
 significantly nobler on place 2 of the 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.500
 Beginners smartphones we find that 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.600
 htc one mini again 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.300
 this is the little brother so to speak of 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.220
 htc with, however, surprisingly large 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.310
 technical achievement it is however 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.720
 could be slightly smaller with 42 inches for the 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.060
 one or the other, of course, too 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.980
 the better format is that htc one 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.290
 mini brings a nice design and a 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.180
 strong in life with a manko has 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.640
 However, it is the internal memory 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.500
 is only 16 gb and this can be 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.240
 also should not expand for many 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.340
 user be a little too little 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.490
 on the top of our top smartphone 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.200
 In 2013 we find the iphone 5 again 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.300
 apple managed it again despite 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.220
 many negative reviews of her iphone 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.930
 Great for a sale 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.660
 a little bit in contrast to her other 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.250
 model the iphone 5 c stands as main 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.650
 feature brought out that the apple 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.680
 iphone 5 the first smartphone is what 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.270
 the 64bit technology supports and 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.700
 as a new feature, apple brought the 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.060
 touch function out where the home button 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.560
 now acts as a fingerprint sensor 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.570
 and one the iphone yes with his 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.970
 fingerprint can unlock da apple 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.020
 this year just a s model 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.959
 we can all the more 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.519
 looking forward to 2014 and to one 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.140
 iphone 6 hope so much 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.040
 probably next year 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.690
 will come out 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.040
 on position one of the beginners 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.709
 Smartphones are like Samsung 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.500
 galaxy s four mini even when it comes to the 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.570
 little brother of the big galaxy s 4 is 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.700
 It is a high end smartphone and 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.920
 really offers many features and one 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.510
 strong performance the biggest difference 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.580
 the larger model is likely 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.549
 the display size of this is here 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.860
 namely only 4.3 inches what still 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.720
 For example, this is relatively large 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.090
 a bigger display than the one from the iphone 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.979
 5 s if you are interested 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.660
 Compare smartphones to each other 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.880
