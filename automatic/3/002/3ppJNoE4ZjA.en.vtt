basic grunt catching it yeah the only

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.530 
basic grunt catching it yeah the only
waste<00:02:21.590> waste<00:02:21.889> of<00:02:22.100> time<00:02:22.280> though<00:02:22.850> even<00:02:23.030> have<00:02:23.359> to

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
waste waste of time though even have to

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.020 
waste waste of time though even have to
like<00:02:24.230> my<00:02:24.709> distances<00:02:25.280> here<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.609> have<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:25.880> know

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
like my distances here I have to know

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.120 
like my distances here I have to know
that<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.569> can<00:02:26.810> reach<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.109> from<00:02:27.260> here<00:02:27.530> you<00:02:28.400> can

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
that I can reach you from here you can

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.069 
that I can reach you from here you can
and<00:02:31.130> even<00:02:31.430> even<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:32.510> put<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:32.870> weight<00:02:33.049> over

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
and even even to put that weight over

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:38.550 
and even even to put that weight over
that<00:02:33.500> front<00:02:33.829> flip<00:02:34.840> ya<00:02:35.840> gotta<00:02:36.500> step<00:02:36.799> up<00:02:36.980> cuz

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
that front flip ya gotta step up cuz
