00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.160
 Welcome to digital courses 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.800
 I will be your teacher in that 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.510
 module my name is thiago Baptist I 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.840
 I am part of the team that is really 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.180
 along with Francisco was at the request of the 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.759
 teacher tiago luÃ­s we see here in the 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.980
 site of digital courses to broadcast the 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:23.019
 our knowledge to you 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.949
 we will be starting with this module to 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.589
 beginners 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.659
 using the construct 2 program at the end 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.819
 of each course you have earned a 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.290
 certificate that will prove the learning 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:34.480
 yours 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.500
 consult 2 is a very simple and 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.489
 interactive 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.859
 even for those who have no experience 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.559
 some with programming with creation of 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:43.269
 games you can learn this program 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.739
 and start doing your games in a way 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.809
 independent 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.399
 it has a very similar interface 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.230
 when the word program 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.910
 so who has some experience with 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.460
 he probably will not have many 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.199
 difficulties in adapting to the program 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.539
 to download it just go to the website of 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.429
 skyhook the first thing you will see 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.949
 will be the download button 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:04.989
 we planned this initial course of 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.600
 so you will not need the version 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.820
 paid to do so just download the version 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.680
 free and you will be able to follow 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.900
 this module 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.720
 Now I would like to talk a little about the 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.880
 proposal of this project i francisco 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.780
 We developed this little game called 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.640
 average one month 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.560
 as you can see during this video 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.540
 It's very simple and fun. 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.720
 with him we will teach in a way 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.520
 practice the basics of constructor 2 when 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.380
 we finished this course 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.530
 you will be able to understand how 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.990
 This game was made and played 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.150
 This is an introductory course so he 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.280
 will start by demonstrating the program will 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.350
 progressing gradually 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.150
 I planned a small project before 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.220
 start the project even average goe 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.590
 to be able to introduce certain concepts 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.660
 and for you to start 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.730
 get used to the program the best 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.340
 way to learn how to create games is that 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.590
 both games after the end of this small 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.080
 project we will enter the middle group 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.640
 this year to teach you how to create 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.490
 the game with the correct answers that we prepare 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.099
 and later professor francisco 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.400
 will be teaching you the process that 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:15.270
 used to create the project site 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.270
 until the next video
