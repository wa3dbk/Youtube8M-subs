that<00:01:35.800> style<00:01:36.160> over<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.610> years<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.890> sound

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
that style over the years the sound

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.100 
that style over the years the sound
Department<00:01:39.760> is<00:01:39.880> more<00:01:40.210> of<00:01:40.330> a<00:01:40.420> letdown<00:01:40.660> though

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
Department is more of a letdown though

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.170 
Department is more of a letdown though
there's<00:01:42.070> no<00:01:42.280> music<00:01:42.670> during<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.940> main

there's no music during the main

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:56.539 
there's no music during the main
gameplay<00:01:43.510> just<00:01:44.470> environmental<00:01:44.830> noises

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.959 

at<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.810> title<00:01:59.200> screen<00:01:59.229> a<00:01:59.740> brief<00:02:00.219> orchestral

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
at the title screen a brief orchestral

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.029 
at the title screen a brief orchestral
sample<00:02:01.420> is<00:02:01.570> played<00:02:01.899> which<00:02:02.409> appears<00:02:02.799> to<00:02:02.920> be

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
sample is played which appears to be

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.219 
sample is played which appears to be
directly<00:02:03.520> from<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.820> movie<00:02:04.090> soundtrack<00:02:04.659> it

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
directly from the movie soundtrack it

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.660 
directly from the movie soundtrack it
would<00:02:05.409> have<00:02:05.500> been<00:02:05.619> nice<00:02:05.860> to<00:02:05.890> hear<00:02:06.280> it<00:02:06.399> during

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
would have been nice to hear it during

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.199 
would have been nice to hear it during
the<00:02:06.789> gameplay<00:02:07.210> as<00:02:07.390> well<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.729> game's<00:02:09.970> biggest

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
the gameplay as well the game's biggest

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.210 
the gameplay as well the game's biggest
flaw<00:02:10.690> though<00:02:10.929> is<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.680> play<00:02:11.890> mechanics

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
flaw though is that the play mechanics

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.470 
flaw though is that the play mechanics
are<00:02:12.580> out<00:02:12.760> of<00:02:12.940> whack

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
are out of whack

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.750 
are out of whack
specifically<00:02:14.440> there<00:02:15.099> are<00:02:15.220> actions<00:02:15.670> that

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
specifically there are actions that

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.150 
specifically there are actions that
happen<00:02:16.150> too<00:02:16.390> fast<00:02:16.650> it's<00:02:17.650> as<00:02:17.830> if<00:02:18.010> the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
happen too fast it's as if the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.559 
happen too fast it's as if the
programmers<00:02:18.700> never<00:02:18.940> got<00:02:19.180> around<00:02:19.420> to

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
programmers never got around to

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.040 
programmers never got around to
calibrating<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.349> speed<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.860> certain<00:02:21.220> things

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
calibrating the speed of certain things

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.660 
calibrating the speed of certain things
the<00:02:23.050> springboards<00:02:23.650> bouncing<00:02:24.099> around<00:02:24.190> too

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
the springboards bouncing around too

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.199 
the springboards bouncing around too
fast<00:02:28.140> during<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.230> ice<00:02:29.410> stages<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.670> sliding

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
fast during the ice stages the sliding

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.470 
fast during the ice stages the sliding
happens<00:02:31.599> too<00:02:31.840> fast<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:33.489> camera<00:02:33.849> struggles<00:02:34.330> to

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
happens too fast the camera struggles to

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.400 
happens too fast the camera struggles to
keep<00:02:34.630> up<00:02:34.840> sometimes<00:02:36.660> worst<00:02:37.660> of<00:02:37.840> all<00:02:37.989> though<00:02:38.200> is

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
keep up sometimes worst of all though is

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.559 
keep up sometimes worst of all though is
that<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.920> enemies<00:02:39.310> move<00:02:39.610> with<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.000> same<00:02:40.269> type

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
that the enemies move with the same type

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.110 
that the enemies move with the same type
of<00:02:40.599> quickness<00:02:44.160> they<00:02:45.160> lunge<00:02:45.459> at<00:02:45.610> you<00:02:45.730> from<00:02:45.940> out

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
travel from planet to planet so he

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.570 
travel from planet to planet so he
doesn't<00:04:10.410> need<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.740> be<00:04:10.860> rescued
