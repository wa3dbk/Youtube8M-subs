00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
resistance which is actually just the

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.870 
resistance which is actually just the
engaging<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.950> muscle<00:01:44.399> sort<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.729> like<00:01:44.850> a

I<00:01:53.009> created<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.670> dynamic<00:01:54.390> resistance<00:01:55.219> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
I created that dynamic resistance the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.620 
I created that dynamic resistance the
more<00:01:56.430> elevated<00:01:56.850> my<00:01:57.060> heart<00:01:57.299> rate

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
