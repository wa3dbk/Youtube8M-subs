00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 very a mohsÃ©n socialist state 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.319
 minecraft 1.6 point 4 let's see a mod 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.210
 which is pretty cool walk and another 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:16.340
 structure and in the end this does not have 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.340
 no purpose or 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.930
 not just to look nice, I do not say 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.520
 that they ever do something with this 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.260
 suppose it's like a good sanctuary 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.800
 This has nothing to do 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.930
 all drowned today the modeste that adds 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.650
 these two landmarks blocks here bateles 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.200
 pauner has my expose is to put the 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.329
 problem is that you can not create a 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.340
 survival you can only get in 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.950
 creative is also watching with the cne 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.410
 and also the link that you will have in the 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.870
 description and national there is no way to 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.829
 create seen 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.829
 host 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.250
 I have a problem of distraction or 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.320
 something because anything I see already 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.949
 but good now let's go let's put it 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.930
 right here 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.960
 and it is to actually do this is for 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.820
 to do battles is very cool we put it 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.890
 and by right clicking we can choose 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.250
 between this species as a warrior or 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.070
 something like that no archer and soldier the soldier 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.970
 same today is the soldier has a helmet 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.920
 diamonds for diamond hello as the 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.000
 the archer is going all leather but 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.000
 he has something like that on his face 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.780
 of the warrior 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.840
 here everything goes like all iron is 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.180
 very cool then if we click right 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.300
 the problem with this is that if 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.490
 we go far away 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.200
 let's go take it for sack you can not 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.900
 take things with the trip good to me here 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.210
 and it serves me stop following you see is 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.600
 a little kaka, that is, it follows you but not 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.050
 it follows is that it is very slow or is it 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.840
 backwards 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.640
 walking normal and is going faster than him 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.760
 this is the bad thing but good if we do 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.650
 right click again stays here it 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.120
 protecting this area stays here and 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.070
 it just gets there was a little 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.860
 of they do when and any enemy 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.110
 that he arrives then he breaks his face and now 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.190
 let's see the other enemy is for 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.250
 expose spoiler enemies power that is 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.620
 here we will see is the same 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.650
 enemy warrior as you see 7 carries a 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.570
 haro helmet accira enemy boots 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.570
 gold and enemy soldier 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.280
 This Malaga more than the other leads 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.660
 diamond to differentiate them better and 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.120
 this nickname simply for that to 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.690
 do your own battles too 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.690
 can be cool 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.900
 serious 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:54.480
 and 9a is pretty good but the problem 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.780
 is that which can not be done in the 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.310
 survival two blocks these 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.400
 but invoke bugs that's a 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.140
 little kaka but good we will see that 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.090
 this to make battles is worth more or 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.270
 minus the neighbors here mounted on 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.220
 sunshine are must say a little thing and 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.640
 is that these who are ours 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.440
 good ones are not supposed to be the enemies the 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.940
 good these are going to attack these the 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.810
 enemies and the enemies pass 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.190
 completely until they do not receive a 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.380
 hit in attack then that 's a 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.500
 little kaka then team these archers 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.900
 I'm going to put barbie here 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.790
 By the way, I forgot to say it every 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.200
 once you invoke one of these in 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.940
 creative you do not need what I had here 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.630
 because I was doing tests in 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.630
 survival 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.099
 one iron consumes you for each 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.510
 warrior archer soldier who serves 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.960
 before I was before recording was 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.410
 doing tests in survival 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:54.060
 where the archers of the blacks the 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.060
 Black and Latino 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.360
 this out and this out come matches 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.420
 the face after a soldier over 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.880
 those down there 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.620
 this seems like it 's much more 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.770
 then these games are the smart ones 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.770
 class 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.990
 what happens tonight got any 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.990
 of 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.519
 that also 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:29.680
 wait situation very fail 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.680
 for saiz 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:37.750
 but when I received a blow the others 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.940
 they are always in advantage in that it is 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:44.230
 conquering the castle of the enemy 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.200
 but we're going to many of the archers the 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.870
 Molars fight 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.550
 but this is a little bit later but 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.550
 well yes they fight among themselves yes 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.259
 stuck between you 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.729
 who attacks 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.639
 before playing here down pussy and today the 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.590
 they tend to attack their peers 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:17.019
 if you try to attack the one below 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:19.159
 you have an aim but very good 

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:20.329
 I do not know why he built all this 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:23.239
 simply because I like the 

00:05:20.329 --> 00:05:25.069
 construction but good this is the mode 

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:27.229
 It's not bad to make your own 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:29.269
 battles is pretty cool there's always 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.689
 to give a little more advantage to the 

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:34.679
 enemy group so I said 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:41.729
 always attack the sixth allies before 

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:41.729
 and arrows 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.780
 but hey this is the mod 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:51.630
 I hope you liked how it is 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.630
 this area already know the heap 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.320
 bye 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.490
 yes
