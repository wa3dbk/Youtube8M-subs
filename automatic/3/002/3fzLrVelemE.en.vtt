00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:02.199
 all beaver dear friends today I tell you 

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:03.979
 I will tell about one interesting incident 

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:06.439
 a few days ago gay channel purchase 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:08.860
 its author send make it ranks 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.060
 told me that the price is 4 in principle 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.910
 is impossible 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.650
 at least given that the main 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.520
 heroes are bitten by a child 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.190
 and here under this video the cattle answered 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.820
 very interesting about this 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.760
 a little later giving a brief explanation 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.770
 given the huge number of digits 8 out of 7 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.350
 in the code of the site the presence of the plan matron hood 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.580
 also many other evidence 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.710
 I haven't seen the point for a long time 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.669
 repeat them 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.769
 it is safe to say that the bite 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.620
 which we see in the game this is exactly a bite 87 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.829
 now remember the words help the basics 1 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.530
 he said that the bitten child survived 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.590
 Now we will read the description of the game 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.820
 play for child 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.600
 agree quite logical 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.300
 assume that based on everything 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.700
 the above we play it for 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.480
 the victim 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.920
 bite 87 and whereby this victim is in 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.730
 a coma testify to it 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.220
 hospital supplies 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.710
 who appear near the bed 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.620
 pill dropper and flowers 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.620
 we will assume that I have explained enough 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.300
 why are we likely playing 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.400
 bitten however here it begins 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.080
 the most male 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.400
 I say helps 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.210
 but the bite of the 87th child is not a matronik bit off 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.310
 frontal lobes 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.159
 many people think that without it to live 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.350
 it is impossible but it is not 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.409
 without it you can live completely before 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.070
 dark times of medicine when doctors 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.000
 believed that you can cut off part of the brain 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.079
 cure a person 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.709
 quite often hit the frontal lobe this 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:32.789
 certainly leads to many changes in 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.649
 personalities but the most important thing is us 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.770
 I am interested in this loss from fear 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.490
 man is waterless share is not afraid of anything 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.550
 at least so says natalya also 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.090
 he mentions that the case is known 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.189
 man's nightmares 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.799
 visiting a doctor 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.039
 he said that the power is not his constantly 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.889
 chased already clear from Siberia so from the night 

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:55.579
 the night the doctor thought thought and I decided that 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.079
 removal of the patient’s frontal lobe 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.959
 help the problem said done 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.659
 the patient continued to pursue one and 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.840
 same watch always appeared beast but 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.380
 now they didn't look scary 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.849
 they looked cute and nice 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.650
 and this is not the only case summing up 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.290
 waterless man is not afraid of anything 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.219
 in reality neither own stronger 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.239
 I will add from myself that when I was still reading 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.509
 the frontal lobe removal records are still in 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:23.690
 window times at 2 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.860
 quite a few entries were that 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.910
 human emotion is lost 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.670
 However, someone said that m from the network of robe 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.430
 completely that is, the person does not feel 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.690
 nothing including fear but also he 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.490
 it becomes very easy subordinating to us 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.980
 someone else said he only loses 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.990
 fear and someone third said he was losing 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.869
 only social fear 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:46.969
 socially fear is the fear of people that is 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.129
 fear bulite let's say advanced and 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.469
 public in shorts or something besides 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:53.799
 as you can see chichek divergent records 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:54.260
 but 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.570
 generally summing up this theory 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.120
 In theory, as it says, we paid madly 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.060
 share is not afraid of nothing in the reality of it 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.560
 snow 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.650
 and here I think you have already caught what they are 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.970
 lead if the protagonist bite victim 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.440
 they matronik forced the reservoirs share 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.370
 then he cannot see the nightmare in principle 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.710
 he can see dreams 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.690
 but he cannot see the terrible in them 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.859
 video animator 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.579
 because after removing the frontal lobes 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.539
 he can not be afraid in principle nothing 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:22.479
 that the very idea of ​​the victim's nightmares 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:23.250
 bite 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.920
 illogical and contrary to science and 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.689
 Here under this video the cattle has unsubscribed 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:30.809
 he said he likes the theory that 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:32.159
 this theory is interesting 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.419
 however, the mother poet missed some 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.479
 very important detail that was noticed 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:39.669
 by some of his viewers 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.849
 I think most of us understand but everything 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.349
 let me remind you that I checked this 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.679
 scottish or not giving it real 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:48.629
 chipped yes it's his present 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:49.499
 comments 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:51.899
 it's hard to understand exactly what sport was talking about 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:54.219
 what exactly is this important detail 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:55.669
 maybe he meant that 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.479
 really suddenly bite 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.269
 really not 87 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.469
 despite all the evidence 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:02.120
 which I quoted but it is unlikely 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.519
 because prove your turn and 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:05.469
 specifically 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:08.739
 either he meant that playing we really 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.520
 not for the bitten but for someone else 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.860
 There are a lot of other options. 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.410
 but I have a couple of the most likely on 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.400
 them we'll talk next leader it 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.510
 maybe he has something completely different but 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.710
 I personally think that he hinted at the fact that 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.830
 playing manesa bitten kids 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.520
 the result is that from them 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.280
 bruises 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.250
 can't be the main character and see 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.640
 nightmare because it is scare off 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.440
 Exodus 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.680
 judging by the comments knows about it 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.759
 and he says there was some kind of missing 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:37.749
 detail 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:39.739
 and he mentioned that some viewers 

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:43.699
 they guessed it and you 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.259
 This is for the detail as well as in the comments. 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.999
 but that's all dear friends hope you 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:49.650
 I liked it until waka waka 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.259
 good luck
