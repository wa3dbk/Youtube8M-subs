damaged but the weapon in itself is
absolutely<00:01:52.140> identical<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.979> will<00:01:53.159> compare

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
absolutely identical and I will compare

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.950 
absolutely identical and I will compare
the<00:01:53.700> two<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.090> screen<00:01:54.450> now<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.689> can<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:54.930> that

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
the two on screen now you can see that

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.959 
the two on screen now you can see that
iron<00:01:55.259> sights<00:01:55.619> are<00:01:55.799> exactly<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> same<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
iron sights are exactly the same the

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.819 
iron sights are exactly the same the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
design of the weapons exactly the same

00:01:58.829 --> 00:01:59.920 
design of the weapons exactly the same
everything

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
everything

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.170 
everything

absolutely no idea but there's no that
this<00:02:36.020> looks<00:02:36.200> absolutely<00:02:36.500> identical<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:37.880> the

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
this looks absolutely identical to the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.990 
this looks absolutely identical to the
fungal<00:02:38.810> or<00:02:38.930> exotic<00:02:39.470> heavy<00:02:39.860> machine<00:02:40.280> gun<00:02:40.550> but

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
fungal or exotic heavy machine gun but

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.790 
fungal or exotic heavy machine gun but
like<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.300> said<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:41.660> only<00:02:41.810> see<00:02:41.989> a<00:02:42.020> few<00:02:42.140> seconds

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
like I said you only see a few seconds

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.979 
like I said you only see a few seconds
of<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:43.160> but<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.670> is<00:02:43.820> identical<00:02:44.720> in<00:02:44.810> every

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
of it but it is identical in every

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.590 
of it but it is identical in every
single<00:02:45.410> way<00:02:45.590> apart<00:02:46.550> from<00:02:46.670> color<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.239> the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
single way apart from color and the

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.320 
single way apart from color and the
solar<00:02:47.810> burn<00:02:48.140> also<00:02:49.040> like<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.790> phone<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.120> Lord

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
solar burn also like the phone the Lord

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.699 
solar burn also like the phone the Lord
gives<00:02:50.600> up<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.930> little<00:02:51.140> bit<00:02:51.380> of<00:02:51.410> arc

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
gives up that little bit of arc

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.860 
gives up that little bit of arc
electricity<00:02:52.459> this<00:02:53.090> thing's<00:02:53.390> give<00:02:53.630> enough

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
electricity this thing's give enough

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.170 
electricity this thing's give enough
solar<00:02:54.290> as<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:55.280> can<00:02:55.400> see<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.700> weapon<00:02:56.000> looks

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
solar as you can see the weapon looks

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.750 
solar as you can see the weapon looks
like<00:02:56.360> it's<00:02:56.510> on<00:02:56.660> fire<00:02:56.900> me<00:02:57.470> personally<00:02:58.160> I<00:02:58.370> don't

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
like it's on fire me personally I don't

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.850 
like it's on fire me personally I don't
think<00:02:59.180> it's<00:02:59.420> going<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.630> be<00:02:59.720> a<00:02:59.750> reskinned<00:03:00.470> fund

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
think it's going to be a reskinned fund

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.800 
think it's going to be a reskinned fund
the<00:03:00.920> Lord<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.310> think<00:03:01.700> we<00:03:01.790> may<00:03:02.060> have<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.330> ability

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
the Lord I think we may have the ability

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.630 
the Lord I think we may have the ability
when<00:03:02.959> you're<00:03:03.050> taking<00:03:03.320> King<00:03:03.500> drops<00:03:03.830> to<00:03:04.310> somehow

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
when you're taking King drops to somehow

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.449 
when you're taking King drops to somehow
change<00:03:04.820> up<00:03:05.420> elemental<00:03:06.320> damage<00:03:06.440> on<00:03:06.830> our

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
change up elemental damage on our

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.310 
change up elemental damage on our
weapons<00:03:07.910> I<00:03:08.150> don't<00:03:08.630> think<00:03:08.720> bungee<00:03:09.200> would

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
weapons I don't think bungee would

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.800 
weapons I don't think bungee would
introduce<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:10.100> feature<00:03:10.970> of<00:03:11.180> reforging

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
introduce the feature of reforging

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.289 
introduce the feature of reforging
exotics<00:03:12.440> I<00:03:12.620> mean<00:03:12.980> that<00:03:13.160> not<00:03:13.340> make<00:03:13.519> sense<00:03:13.549> to<00:03:13.910> me

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
exotics I mean that not make sense to me

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.690 
exotics I mean that not make sense to me
as<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:14.810> lose<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.410> exotic<00:03:15.980> perks<00:03:16.250> that<00:03:16.549> they

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
as you lose the exotic perks that they

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.460 
as you lose the exotic perks that they
come<00:03:16.940> with<00:03:17.150> but<00:03:17.570> definitely<00:03:18.110> if<00:03:18.200> you<00:03:18.260> could

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
come with but definitely if you could

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.530 
come with but definitely if you could
change<00:03:18.709> elemental<00:03:19.220> damage<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:19.670> exotic

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
change elemental damage and exotic

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.539 
change elemental damage and exotic
weapons<00:03:20.900> that<00:03:21.019> will<00:03:21.110> be<00:03:21.200> absolutely<00:03:21.680> epic<00:03:21.980> but

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
weapons that will be absolutely epic but

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.340 
weapons that will be absolutely epic but
