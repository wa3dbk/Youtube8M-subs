00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
hello Rock asked me to do an update what

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.280 
hello Rock asked me to do an update what
is<00:00:05.970> new<00:00:06.240> in<00:00:06.420> techne<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:06.870> what<00:00:06.990> I've<00:00:07.109> been

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
is new in techne and what I've been

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.049 
is new in techne and what I've been
working<00:00:07.649> on<00:00:07.799> lately<00:00:08.840> it's<00:00:09.840> this<00:00:10.110> editor<00:00:11.059> I'm

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
working on lately it's this editor I'm

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.450 
working on lately it's this editor I'm
going<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.450> make<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.780> nice<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.950> course<00:00:14.190> and

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
going to make it nice of course and

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.770 
going to make it nice of course and
that's<00:00:14.670> going<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.089> think<00:00:15.330> that's<00:00:15.480> going<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.719> be

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
that's going I think that's going to be

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.099 
that's going I think that's going to be
a<00:00:15.900> full-screen<00:00:16.830> mode<00:00:17.130> as<00:00:17.640> well<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.270> one

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
a full-screen mode as well and one

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.220 
a full-screen mode as well and one
that's<00:00:19.320> going<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.670> not<00:00:20.670> show<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.480> menu<00:00:21.689> and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
that's going to not show the menu and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.170 
that's going to not show the menu and
there<00:00:22.490> but<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:24.650> Java<00:00:25.650> code<00:00:26.130> that's<00:00:26.460> printed

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
there but the Java code that's printed

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.679 
there but the Java code that's printed
will<00:00:27.990> be<00:00:28.170> gone<00:00:28.590> as<00:00:28.769> well

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
will be gone as well

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.889 
will be gone as well
it's<00:00:30.689> updating<00:00:31.590> as<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.189> now<00:00:32.640> kind<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.660> life

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
it's updating as of now kind of life

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.090 
it's updating as of now kind of life
fish<00:00:35.180> what<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.300> means<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:36.750> not<00:00:37.469> changing<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
fish what it means it's not changing the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.639 
fish what it means it's not changing the
values<00:00:38.640> for<00:00:38.910> them<00:00:39.059> like<00:00:39.570> size<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.140> position

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
values for them like size and position

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.520 
values for them like size and position
that's<00:00:41.550> because<00:00:41.940> I'm<00:00:42.660> not<00:00:42.899> tracking<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
that's because I'm not tracking the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.940 
that's because I'm not tracking the
changes<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.460> these<00:00:45.140> fields<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.289> am<00:00:46.530> tracking

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
changes of these fields I am tracking

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.240 
changes of these fields I am tracking
the<00:00:47.039> name<00:00:47.399> but<00:00:47.730> not<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.469> exporter<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:50.129> you

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the name but not in the exporter as you

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.970 
the name but not in the exporter as you
can<00:00:50.370> see<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> model<00:00:51.480> tree<00:00:51.980> it's

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
can see here in the model tree it's

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.490 
can see here in the model tree it's
changing<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.910> name<00:00:54.090> si<00:00:54.539> type<00:00:57.320> 1/2<00:00:58.320> rotation

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
changing the name si type 1/2 rotation

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.009 
changing the name si type 1/2 rotation
and<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.760> have<00:01:00.059> offset<00:01:02.300> what<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.329> don't<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.809> is

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
and I have offset what I don't have is

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.649 
and I have offset what I don't have is
texture<00:01:04.409> offset<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:05.100> yet<00:01:06.560> you<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.830> make

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
texture offset just yet you can make

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.950 
texture offset just yet you can make
things<00:01:10.010> invisible<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.600> think<00:01:12.600> that's<00:01:12.750> been

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
things invisible I think that's been

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.990 
things invisible I think that's been
requested<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.710> technique<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.400> some<00:01:14.700> time

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
requested for technique for some time

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.370 
requested for technique for some time
now<00:01:16.790> you<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:18.030> delete<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.689> cubes<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.229> can

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
now you can delete the cubes you can

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.460 
now you can delete the cubes you can
select<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.210> see<00:01:21.360> these<00:01:21.540> line

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
select it and you can see these line

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.840 
select it and you can see these line
this<00:01:22.740> red<00:01:23.159> line<00:01:23.430> here<00:01:24.350> this<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:26.430> helps<00:01:26.729> me

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
this red line here this is it helps me

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.350 
this red line here this is it helps me
debug<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.420> problem<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:30.210> can

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
debug one problem I have that you can

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.990 
debug one problem I have that you can
see<00:01:30.540> me<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.409> cube<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.130> Ray<00:01:32.880> is

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
see me is like the cube and the Ray is

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.270 
see me is like the cube and the Ray is
going<00:01:33.270> straight<00:01:33.659> view<00:01:34.049> through<00:01:34.680> there<00:01:34.920> cube

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
going straight view through there cube

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.490 
going straight view through there cube
but<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> thing<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.840> not<00:01:37.079> really

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
but the thing is it's not really

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.469 
but the thing is it's not really
accurate<00:01:38.180> if<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.360> hit<00:01:39.570> deep<00:01:39.930> corners<00:01:40.590> here<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
accurate if I hit deep corners here and

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.800 
accurate if I hit deep corners here and
none<00:01:42.479> they<00:01:42.689> would<00:01:43.380> block<00:01:44.299> as<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.540> see

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
none they would block as you can see

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.060 
none they would block as you can see
it's<00:01:46.250> doesn't<00:01:47.250> quite<00:01:48.170> hit<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.500> corners

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
it's doesn't quite hit the corners

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.950 
it's doesn't quite hit the corners
correctly<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:51.420> close<00:01:51.750> but<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:52.920> not<00:01:53.930> what<00:01:54.930> I

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
correctly it's close but it's not what I

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.760 
correctly it's close but it's not what I
wanted<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.500> be<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.630> when<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.780> select<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> cube

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
wanted to be so when you select the cube

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.899 
wanted to be so when you select the cube
it's<00:01:59.719> going<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.979> see<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.340> first<00:02:02.670> time

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
it's going to see this is the first time

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.520 
it's going to see this is the first time
it's<00:02:04.670> it's<00:02:05.670> not<00:02:05.969> going<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.450> select<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.899> cube

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
it's it's not going to select a cube

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.820 
it's it's not going to select a cube
properly<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.819> that's<00:02:09.149> why<00:02:09.330> I'm<00:02:09.690> going<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.110> fix

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
properly so that's why I'm going to fix

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.010 
properly so that's why I'm going to fix
it<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.730> next<00:02:12.030> thing<00:02:12.209> is

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
it the next thing is

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.840 
it the next thing is
I have<00:02:13.260> dragged<00:02:13.710> and<00:02:13.830> dropped<00:02:13.860> extra<00:02:14.430> support

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
I have dragged and dropped extra support

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.390 
I have dragged and dropped extra support
and<00:02:15.030> actually<00:02:15.840> that's<00:02:15.990> been<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.470> techne<00:02:17.100> for

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
and actually that's been in techne for

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.470 
and actually that's been in techne for
the<00:02:17.460> first<00:02:17.820> since<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.600> first<00:02:18.780> version

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.580 

there's<00:02:24.480> one<00:02:24.690> problem<00:02:24.960> with<00:02:25.110> it

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
there's one problem with it

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.440 
there's one problem with it
I<00:02:25.940> always<00:02:26.940> uses<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.810> first<00:02:28.580> pixel<00:02:29.580> on<00:02:29.850> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
I always uses the first pixel on the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.720 
I always uses the first pixel on the
texture<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.470> when<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.680> use<00:02:31.860> one<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.250> has<00:02:32.310> this

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
texture so when I use one that has this

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.910 
texture so when I use one that has this
transparent<00:02:33.330> first<00:02:33.570> pixel<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.530> cube<00:02:34.800> is

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
transparent first pixel the cube is

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.000
