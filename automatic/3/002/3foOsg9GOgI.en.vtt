00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
only the attack point so slark inspector

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.670 
only the attack point so slark inspector
have<00:00:50.010> an<00:00:50.280> attack<00:00:50.580> point<00:00:50.909> of<00:00:51.120> 0.5<00:00:51.900> and<00:00:52.320> point

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.219 
have an attack point of 0.5 and point
three<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.850> if<00:00:53.970> I<00:00:54.120> issue<00:00:54.330> the<00:00:54.570> attack<00:00:54.839> command

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:55.229 
three so if I issue the attack command

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.820 
three so if I issue the attack command
Specter<00:00:56.159> will<00:00:56.370> always<00:00:56.790> hit<00:00:57.089> first<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
Specter will always hit first so the

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.219 
Specter will always hit first so the
point<00:00:59.070> being<00:00:59.159> if<00:00:59.549> the<00:00:59.879> opponent<00:01:00.330> has<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.839> lower

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:01.229 
point being if the opponent has a lower

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.820 
point being if the opponent has a lower
attack<00:01:01.680> point<00:01:02.010> he<00:01:02.400> has<00:01:02.699> an<00:01:02.940> advantage<00:01:03.510> in

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
attack point he has an advantage in

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.830 
attack point he has an advantage in
lasting<00:01:04.830> because<00:01:05.369> there's<00:01:05.820> always<00:01:06.030> ways<00:01:06.450> to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
lasting because there's always ways to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.130 
lasting because there's always ways to
work<00:01:07.140> around<00:01:07.320> this

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140

what<00:01:09.500> you<00:01:09.620> need<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:09.890> be<00:01:09.979> familiar<00:01:10.130> with<00:01:10.490> is<00:01:10.880> the

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
what you need to be familiar with is the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.870 
what you need to be familiar with is the
delay<00:01:11.810> from<00:01:12.260> when<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.770> click<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.310> when<00:01:13.729> the

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
delay from when you click to when the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:22.610 
delay from when you click to when the
damage<00:01:14.090> is<00:01:14.330> dealt<00:01:15.250> so<00:01:16.250> if<00:01:16.400> I<00:01:16.520> snap<00:01:16.820> my<00:01:16.850> fingers

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.980 

you<00:01:22.770> knew<00:01:23.070> when<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.730> next<00:01:23.940> snap<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.690> going<00:01:24.930> to

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
you knew when the next snap is going to

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.370 
you knew when the next snap is going to
happen<00:01:25.410> the<00:01:26.280> same<00:01:26.490> way<00:01:26.550> you<00:01:27.450> get<00:01:27.630> used<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.230> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
happen the same way you get used to the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.740 
happen the same way you get used to the
attack<00:01:28.740> animation<00:01:29.310> today<00:01:29.580> using<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.300> one-two

attack animation today using the one-two
method<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.980> you<00:01:32.040> go<00:01:32.250> one<00:01:32.580> in<00:01:32.850> your<00:01:33.240> head<00:01:33.450> when

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
method so you go one in your head when

method so you go one in your head when
you<00:01:34.050> click<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.560> two<00:01:35.190> when<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> damage<00:01:36.090> is

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
you click and two when the damage is

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.789 
you click and two when the damage is
still

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.440 

over<00:01:43.630> time<00:01:43.929> you<00:01:44.350> know<00:01:44.710> this<00:01:45.340> timing<00:01:45.850> which<00:01:46.299> is

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
over time you know this timing which is

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.170 
over time you know this timing which is
essential<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.619> get<00:01:47.799> all<00:01:47.890> assets

Taiyo<00:01:50.420> speed<00:01:50.900> works<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:51.800> same<00:01:52.010> way<00:01:52.370> if<00:01:52.940> you

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
Taiyo speed works the same way if you

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.990 
Taiyo speed works the same way if you
have<00:01:53.450> a<00:01:53.900> faster<00:01:54.410> projectile<00:01:55.010> speed<00:01:55.430> you<00:01:55.790> have

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
have a faster projectile speed you have

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.900 
have a faster projectile speed you have
a<00:01:56.240> better<00:01:56.540> chance<00:01:56.870> of<00:01:57.080> last<00:01:57.500> hitting<00:01:57.860> this<00:01:58.700> is

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
a better chance of last hitting this is

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.060 
a better chance of last hitting this is
because<00:01:59.270> you<00:01:59.480> can<00:01:59.660> wait<00:01:59.930> or<00:02:00.200> time<00:02:00.650> your<00:02:00.830> last

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
because you can wait or time your last

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.789 
because you can wait or time your last
it's<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.490> second<00:02:02.060> late

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
it's a second late

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.010 
it's a second late
turn<00:02:04.280> rate<00:02:04.520> is<00:02:04.759> something<00:02:05.000> very<00:02:05.450> few<00:02:05.719> people

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
turn rate is something very few people

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.770 
turn rate is something very few people
taking<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.649> consideration<00:02:07.579> the<00:02:08.420> takeaway

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
taking the consideration the takeaway

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.500 
taking the consideration the takeaway
point<00:02:09.080> being<00:02:09.319> always<00:02:10.280> face<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:10.819> creep<00:02:11.269> you

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
point being always face the creep you

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.960 
point being always face the creep you
want<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:11.840> lass<00:02:11.989> it<00:02:12.290> this<00:02:13.099> is<00:02:13.280> because<00:02:13.580> if<00:02:13.849> you

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
want to lass it this is because if you

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.119 
want to lass it this is because if you
face<00:02:14.209> away<00:02:14.660> from<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.019> creep<00:02:15.230> there's<00:02:16.010> a

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
face away from the creep there's a

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.640 
face away from the creep there's a
longer<00:02:16.580> delay<00:02:16.819> in<00:02:17.209> facing<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.200> creep<00:02:18.440> and

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
time or are they attacking one at a time

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.360 
time or are they attacking one at a time
now<00:04:19.639> you<00:04:19.700> need<00:04:19.970> to<00:04:20.150> know<00:04:20.359> this<00:04:20.540> because

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
now you need to know this because

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.860 
now you need to know this because
they're<00:04:22.370> attacking<00:04:22.669> at<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:22.970> same<00:04:23.180> time<00:04:23.479> it's

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
they're attacking at the same time it's

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.409 
they're attacking at the same time it's
equivalent<00:04:24.500> to<00:04:24.770> a<00:04:24.800> tower<00:04:25.160> you<00:04:26.060> need<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.330> be

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
equivalent to a tower you need to be

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.140 
equivalent to a tower you need to be
like<00:04:26.600> I<00:04:26.840> hit<00:04:27.530> it<00:04:27.680> once<00:04:27.919> and<00:04:28.160> then<00:04:28.700> they<00:04:28.880> hit<00:04:29.030> it

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
like I hit it once and then they hit it

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.700 
like I hit it once and then they hit it
twice<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.690> then<00:04:30.200> I<00:04:30.440> hit<00:04:30.680> it

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.090 

cycles<00:04:35.220> so<00:04:36.150> whenever<00:04:36.630> creeps<00:04:37.230> are<00:04:37.470> attacking

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
cycles so whenever creeps are attacking

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.460 
cycles so whenever creeps are attacking
another<00:04:38.280> creep<00:04:38.700> there's<00:04:39.270> a<00:04:39.420> certain<00:04:39.720> cycle<00:04:40.260> or

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
another creep there's a certain cycle or

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.220 
another creep there's a certain cycle or
repetition<00:04:41.010> of<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.520> tax<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.120> this<00:04:42.960> is<00:04:43.080> going

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
repetition of the tax and this is going

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.640 
repetition of the tax and this is going
to<00:04:43.290> happen<00:04:43.650> until<00:04:43.920> the<00:04:44.220> that<00:04:44.610> creep<00:04:44.940> dies<00:04:45.650> and

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
to happen until the that creep dies and

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.890 
to happen until the that creep dies and
you<00:04:46.740> see<00:04:46.950> the<00:04:47.100> cycles<00:04:47.610> you<00:04:48.120> can<00:04:48.150> start<00:04:48.540> to<00:04:48.690> say

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
you see the cycles you can start to say

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.050 
you see the cycles you can start to say
it<00:04:49.470> will<00:04:49.620> take<00:04:49.860> three<00:04:50.190> cycles<00:04:50.640> with<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:50.850> creep

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
it will take three cycles with the creep

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.150 
it will take three cycles with the creep
to<00:04:51.180> die<00:04:51.330> or<00:04:51.840> it'll<00:04:52.050> take<00:04:52.200> five<00:04:52.470> cycles<00:04:52.770> for<00:04:53.070> the

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
to die or it'll take five cycles for the

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.850 
to die or it'll take five cycles for the
creep<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.430> die<00:04:53.610> and<00:04:53.930> you<00:04:54.930> know<00:04:55.080> you<00:04:55.140> have<00:04:55.500> five

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
creep to die and you know you have five

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.400 
creep to die and you know you have five
cycles<00:04:56.310> worth<00:04:56.640> of<00:04:56.850> time<00:04:57.180> to<00:04:57.780> do<00:04:57.900> whatever<00:04:58.140> you

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
cycles worth of time to do whatever you

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.149 
cycles worth of time to do whatever you
want<00:04:58.710> like<00:04:59.160> your<00:04:59.400> ass<00:04:59.580> or<00:04:59.850> watch<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.390> mini-map

they using all that I said and the
concept<00:05:05.619> of<00:05:05.709> cycles<00:05:06.219> I'm<00:05:06.429> last<00:05:06.819> sitting<00:05:07.179> here

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
concept of cycles I'm last sitting here

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.260 
concept of cycles I'm last sitting here
with<00:05:07.779> my<00:05:07.929> eyes<00:05:08.199> closed<00:05:08.860> now<00:05:09.849> I've<00:05:09.969> done<00:05:10.089> this

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
with my eyes closed now I've done this

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.209 
with my eyes closed now I've done this
several<00:05:10.509> times<00:05:10.629> and<00:05:11.199> have<00:05:11.499> gotten<00:05:11.739> a<00:05:11.889> score<00:05:12.189> of

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:12.219 
several times and have gotten a score of

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:15.659 
several times and have gotten a score of
somewhere<00:05:12.729> in<00:05:12.819> the<00:05:12.939> 60s<00:05:13.179> out<00:05:14.019> of<00:05:14.229> 80<00:05:14.639> so<00:05:15.639> I

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
somewhere in the 60s out of 80 so I

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.139 
somewhere in the 60s out of 80 so I
close<00:05:15.969> my<00:05:16.149> eyes<00:05:16.179> when<00:05:16.749> the<00:05:17.050> creep<00:05:17.469> HP<00:05:18.039> is<00:05:18.279> at<00:05:18.699> 50

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:19.149 
close my eyes when the creep HP is at 50

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:22.529 
close my eyes when the creep HP is at 50
or<00:05:19.179> 40%<00:05:19.599> and<00:05:20.139> I<00:05:20.979> have<00:05:21.219> a<00:05:21.249> feel<00:05:21.580> for<00:05:21.909> the<00:05:22.119> cycles

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
or 40% and I have a feel for the cycles

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.629 
or 40% and I have a feel for the cycles
and<00:05:22.689> I<00:05:22.779> know<00:05:22.839> that<00:05:23.229> it<00:05:23.349> will<00:05:23.439> take<00:05:23.649> two<00:05:24.189> cycles

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
and I know that it will take two cycles

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.269 
and I know that it will take two cycles
and<00:05:24.939> then<00:05:25.209> knowing<00:05:25.929> my<00:05:26.169> attack<00:05:26.469> animation<00:05:27.069> I

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:27.279 
and then knowing my attack animation I

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:29.519 
and then knowing my attack animation I
proceed<00:05:28.179> to<00:05:28.209> attack<00:05:28.629> the<00:05:28.779> creeps<00:05:29.019> and<00:05:29.259> get<00:05:29.439> the

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:29.529 
proceed to attack the creeps and get the

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:34.060 
proceed to attack the creeps and get the
lasted

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.670 

all<00:05:34.130> types<00:05:34.480> you<00:05:35.480> can<00:05:35.630> use<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:36.020> creep<00:05:36.350> aggro

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
all types you can use the creep aggro

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.550 
all types you can use the creep aggro
trick<00:05:37.190> by<00:05:37.520> attacking<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.330> enemy<00:05:38.750> and<00:05:38.960> pulling

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
trick by attacking the enemy and pulling

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.230 
trick by attacking the enemy and pulling
back<00:05:39.740> the<00:05:39.920> creep<00:05:40.130> and<00:05:40.310> dealing<00:05:40.640> the<00:05:40.760> last<00:05:40.970> set

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
back the creep and dealing the last set

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.650 
back the creep and dealing the last set
so<00:05:42.020> this<00:05:42.200> way<00:05:42.380> you're<00:05:42.710> in<00:05:43.670> a<00:05:43.820> much<00:05:43.940> more<00:05:44.180> safer

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
so this way you're in a much more safer

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.590 
so this way you're in a much more safer
position<00:05:45.520> though<00:05:46.520> the<00:05:46.670> timing<00:05:46.940> needs<00:05:47.210> a<00:05:47.420> bit

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
position though the timing needs a bit

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.280 
position though the timing needs a bit
of<00:05:47.630> a<00:05:47.750> practice<00:05:47.990> and<00:05:49.300> second<00:05:50.300> use<00:05:50.780> the<00:05:50.990> range

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
of a practice and second use the range

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.690 
of a practice and second use the range
creep<00:05:51.590> as<00:05:51.770> a<00:05:51.830> marker

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:52.700 
creep as a marker

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.460 
creep as a marker
so<00:05:53.240> the<00:05:53.360> range<00:05:53.570> creep<00:05:53.810> does<00:05:54.020> the<00:05:54.140> most<00:05:54.320> damage

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
so the range creep does the most damage

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.520 
so the range creep does the most damage
that<00:05:55.370> you<00:05:55.520> use<00:05:55.730> that<00:05:55.970> as<00:05:56.210> a<00:05:56.270> marker<00:05:56.870> and<00:05:57.080> decide

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
that you use that as a marker and decide

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.290 
that you use that as a marker and decide
to<00:05:57.560> attack<00:05:57.920> either<00:05:58.160> after<00:05:58.520> the<00:05:58.790> range<00:05:59.090> creep

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
to attack either after the range creep

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.290 
to attack either after the range creep
or<00:05:59.480> before<00:06:00.230> the<00:06:00.380> range<00:06:00.560> creep<00:06:00.830> attacks<00:06:01.300> you

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
or before the range creep attacks you

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.510 
or before the range creep attacks you
can<00:06:02.450> take<00:06:02.630> this<00:06:02.750> one<00:06:03.020> step<00:06:03.200> further<00:06:03.350> by<00:06:04.160> timing

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
can take this one step further by timing

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.370 
can take this one step further by timing
your<00:06:04.700> attack<00:06:05.060> right<00:06:05.480> after<00:06:05.780> the<00:06:05.900> range<00:06:06.110> creeps

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
your attack right after the range creeps

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.310 
your attack right after the range creeps
attack<00:06:06.710> this<00:06:07.400> way<00:06:07.820> your<00:06:08.180> projectile<00:06:08.750> follows

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
attack this way your projectile follows

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.160 
attack this way your projectile follows
the<00:06:09.620> range<00:06:09.890> creeps<00:06:10.190> and<00:06:10.660> it<00:06:11.660> gives<00:06:11.870> very

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
the range creeps and it gives very

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.190 
the range creeps and it gives very
little<00:06:12.260> time<00:06:12.770> for<00:06:13.070> your<00:06:13.250> opponent<00:06:13.730> to<00:06:13.760> deny

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
little time for your opponent to deny

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.810 
little time for your opponent to deny
but<00:06:15.200> if<00:06:15.440> I<00:06:15.560> don't<00:06:15.620> do<00:06:15.980> this<00:06:16.130> he's<00:06:16.610> going<00:06:16.760> to

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
but if I don't do this he's going to

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.470 
but if I don't do this he's going to
quit<00:06:17.000> deny<00:06:17.270> it

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480
