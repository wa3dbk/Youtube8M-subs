00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:18.680
 patinated covering is one of the 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:21.980
 methods of painting an article results a 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.670
 quite interesting method but in this 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.820
 case stressed that it is especially for 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.220
 this case is the method of hiding 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.850
 defects 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:39.260
 it happened that my article had fallen on 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:42.500
 a puddle the colors spilled and 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.890
 now I want to correct the situation with 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.420
 the method of covering with pages like the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.329
 white paint for the radiator 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.890
 here I have the rest in the background going to 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.750
 agree 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:01.320
 I also have a sheet 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.050
 it is a sponge an ordinary sponge of 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.050
 gomaespuma you've doubled 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.260
 I have to cover a pretty fringe 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.620
 fine 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.530
 he does it in painting 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.950
 and then on paper I remove the excesses of 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.400
 the painting until they stay such 15 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.770
 given dry it is important to me that the 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:33.609
 paint does not pass in 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.609
 but leave a light footprint 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.040
 does not thicken a bit dry 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.400
 I think this method will let me correct 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.760
 the situation 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.760
 in this case I cover with a white patina 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.540
 it looks very nice for example cover not 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.480
 share the white but for a blue 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.080
 dark with a light blue for a green 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:22.129
 dark with a green lettuce is to say the 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.370
 beat the elegies and yourselves and the 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:28.489
 meaning is clear that is to say with a 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.920
 wet almost dry sponge in one more tone 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.250
 clear that with which the tissue is 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.910
 Article 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.210
 with a sponge almost dry we went with 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.990
 care for the tissue we get a 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:47.069
 effect thus seems to have been achieved 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.260
 hide the flaws 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.310
 first you paint for the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:57.760
 ceilings I did not like to work with her 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:02.819
 also try to paint tubes with it 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.819
 you listen because it contains a lot of chalk 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.650
 and go to the painting for radiator is a 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.750
 acrylic white paint maybe you can 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.750
 use another one but I've got used to it 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.250
 if you liked the video press I like it
