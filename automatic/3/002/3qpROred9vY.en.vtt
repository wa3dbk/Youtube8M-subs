sent it does look on the mild to

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.550 
sent it does look on the mild to
moderate<00:02:49.950> side<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.720> you<00:02:51.720> could<00:02:52.170> consider

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
moderate side and you could consider

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.650 
moderate side and you could consider
before<00:02:53.360> pursuing<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.630> surgical<00:02:55.170> procedure<00:02:55.200> a

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
before pursuing a surgical procedure a

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.130 
before pursuing a surgical procedure a
limited<00:02:57.660> placement<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:59.460> hyaluronic<00:03:00.390> acid

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
limited placement of a hyaluronic acid

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.790 
limited placement of a hyaluronic acid
filler<00:03:01.440> such<00:03:02.250> as<00:03:02.460> Restylane<00:03:03.410> along<00:03:04.410> the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
filler such as Restylane along the

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.490 
filler such as Restylane along the
what's<00:03:05.220> called<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.460> tear<00:03:05.850> trough<00:03:05.880> area<00:03:06.500> now

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
what's called the tear trough area now

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.550 
what's called the tear trough area now
of<00:03:07.650> course<00:03:08.060> fillers<00:03:09.060> can<00:03:09.510> be<00:03:09.720> expensive<00:03:10.140> and

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
of course fillers can be expensive and

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.490 
of course fillers can be expensive and
and<00:03:11.040> maintenance<00:03:11.850> can<00:03:12.120> also<00:03:12.390> be<00:03:12.780> expensive

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
and maintenance can also be expensive

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.730 
and maintenance can also be expensive
but<00:03:14.250> as<00:03:14.610> a<00:03:14.640> temper<00:03:15.330> izing<00:03:15.750> solution<00:03:16.410> this

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
but as a temper izing solution this

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.300 
but as a temper izing solution this
might<00:03:17.130> be<00:03:17.520> worth<00:03:18.300> considering<00:03:19.230> now<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:20.040> course

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
might be worth considering now of course

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.900 
might be worth considering now of course
if<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.970> bulge<00:03:21.210> of<00:03:21.540> fat<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:22.230> much<00:03:23.220> more<00:03:23.640> than

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
if the bulge of fat is much more than

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.600 
if the bulge of fat is much more than
that<00:03:24.120> then<00:03:24.570> really<00:03:25.320> hyaluronic<00:03:25.890> fillers

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
that then really hyaluronic fillers

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.170 
that then really hyaluronic fillers
don't<00:03:27.270> really<00:03:27.540> do<00:03:27.720> much<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:28.410> lot<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:28.920> people<00:03:29.850> in

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
don't really do much a lot of people in

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.410 
don't really do much a lot of people in
my<00:03:30.750> area<00:03:31.020> in<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.350> new<00:03:31.500> york<00:03:31.680> city<00:03:31.890> area<00:03:32.130> end<00:03:32.700> up

my area in the new york city area end up
coming<00:03:34.110> in<00:03:34.290> after<00:03:34.530> they're<00:03:35.130> very<00:03:36.030> often<00:03:36.420> it's

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
coming in after they're very often it's

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.500 
coming in after they're very often it's
a<00:03:36.630> dermatologist<00:03:37.530> or<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.740> non<00:03:37.980> surgical

a dermatologist or a non surgical

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.110 
a dermatologist or a non surgical
specialist<00:03:39.510> who<00:03:40.140> fills<00:03:40.770> up<00:03:41.040> this<00:03:41.250> area<00:03:41.790> with

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
specialist who fills up this area with

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.930 
specialist who fills up this area with
lots<00:03:42.570> of<00:03:42.810> hyaluronic<00:03:43.380> acid<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:43.950> creates<00:03:44.640> a

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
lots of hyaluronic acid and creates a

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.660 
lots of hyaluronic acid and creates a
lot<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.450> puffiness<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.200> very<00:03:46.980> often<00:03:47.370> we<00:03:47.490> need

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
lot of puffiness and very often we need

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.390 
lot of puffiness and very often we need
to<00:03:47.790> use<00:03:48.240> something<00:03:48.540> called<00:03:48.870> hyaluronidase<00:03:49.400> to

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
to use something called hyaluronidase to

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.020 
to use something called hyaluronidase to
actually<00:03:50.880> dissolve<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:52.020> so<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.700> definitive

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
actually dissolve it so the definitive

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.910 
actually dissolve it so the definitive
procedure<00:03:54.390> is<00:03:54.960> a<00:03:54.990> procedure<00:03:55.110> called<00:03:55.590> a

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
procedure is a procedure called a

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.360 
procedure is a procedure called a
transconjunctival<00:03:56.600> blepharoplasty<00:03:58.370> what

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
transconjunctival blepharoplasty what

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.210 
transconjunctival blepharoplasty what
this<00:03:59.580> means<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.330> what<00:04:01.230> i<00:04:01.260> would<00:04:01.590> do<00:04:01.740> typically

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
this means is what i would do typically

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.060 
this means is what i would do typically
my<00:04:02.490> practice<00:04:02.970> is<00:04:03.240> go<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:03.960> the<00:04:04.200> fat<00:04:04.530> packets

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
my practice is go to the fat packets

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.300 
my practice is go to the fat packets
from<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.460> inside<00:04:06.120> of<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.330> eyelid<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:07.310> sculpt

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
from the inside of the eyelid and sculpt

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.880 
from the inside of the eyelid and sculpt
them<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:09.170> reposition<00:04:10.170> them<00:04:10.380> as<00:04:10.560> is

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
them and reposition them as is

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.330 
them and reposition them as is
appropriate<00:04:11.810> by<00:04:12.810> doing<00:04:13.170> that<00:04:13.350> whatever<00:04:14.160> is

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
appropriate by doing that whatever is

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.330 
appropriate by doing that whatever is
protruding<00:04:15.120> is<00:04:15.270> no<00:04:15.660> longer<00:04:16.220> protruding<00:04:17.220> and

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
protruding is no longer protruding and

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.610 
protruding is no longer protruding and
the<00:04:17.400> natural<00:04:17.640> contour<00:04:18.450> and<00:04:18.570> shape<00:04:18.630> of<00:04:19.080> the<00:04:19.590> eye

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
the natural contour and shape of the eye

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.570 
the natural contour and shape of the eye
is<00:04:20.160> restored<00:04:21.260> essentially<00:04:22.260> no<00:04:23.160> one<00:04:23.340> would<00:04:23.460> be

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
is restored essentially no one would be

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.950 
is restored essentially no one would be
able<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.820> tell<00:04:24.060> that<00:04:24.090> you<00:04:24.390> had<00:04:24.630> surgery

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
able to tell that you had surgery

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.220 
able to tell that you had surgery
because<00:04:25.380> there<00:04:25.860> are<00:04:26.070> no<00:04:26.340> outside<00:04:27.330> incisions

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
because there are no outside incisions

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.280 
because there are no outside incisions
so<00:04:29.070> for<00:04:29.760> most<00:04:29.970> of<00:04:30.150> my<00:04:30.210> younger<00:04:30.570> patients<00:04:31.200> this

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
so for most of my younger patients this

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.510 
so for most of my younger patients this
is<00:04:31.470> really<00:04:31.650> my<00:04:31.920> go-to<00:04:32.220> procedure<00:04:32.850> and<00:04:33.710> it<00:04:34.710> has

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
is really my go-to procedure and it has

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.420 
is really my go-to procedure and it has
served<00:04:35.910> us<00:04:36.150> very<00:04:36.360> very<00:04:36.840> well<00:04:37.080> we<00:04:38.070> often

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
served us very very well we often

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.500 
served us very very well we often
combine<00:04:39.120> this<00:04:39.300> procedure<00:04:39.780> with

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
combine this procedure with

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.180 
combine this procedure with
the<00:04:40.840> application<00:04:41.560> of<00:04:41.680> something<00:04:42.040> called

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
the application of something called

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.390 
the application of something called
platelet-rich<00:04:42.400> plasma<00:04:43.560> which<00:04:44.560> helps<00:04:45.100> with

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
platelet-rich plasma which helps with

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.760 
platelet-rich plasma which helps with
skin<00:04:45.820> discoloration<00:04:46.690> and<00:04:46.870> essentially<00:04:47.710> what

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
skin discoloration and essentially what

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.180 
skin discoloration and essentially what
that<00:04:48.130> is<00:04:48.340> is<00:04:48.760> using<00:04:49.690> your<00:04:49.900> own<00:04:50.140> blood<00:04:50.620> product

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
that is is using your own blood product

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.890 
that is is using your own blood product
which<00:04:51.370> is<00:04:51.520> basically<00:04:51.970> going<00:04:52.270> like<00:04:52.720> you're

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
which is basically going like you're

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.250 
which is basically going like you're
getting<00:04:53.020> a<00:04:53.200> blood<00:04:53.440> test<00:04:53.770> and<00:04:54.130> a<00:04:54.850> tube<00:04:55.300> of<00:04:55.630> blood

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
getting a blood test and a tube of blood

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.750 
getting a blood test and a tube of blood
is<00:04:56.650> spun<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:58.540> rich<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.800> area<00:05:00.190> set<00:05:00.490> is

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
is spun and the rich the area set is

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.310 
is spun and the rich the area set is
concentrated<00:05:01.720> with<00:05:01.810> platelets<00:05:02.410> is<00:05:03.300> actually

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
concentrated with platelets is actually

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.810 
concentrated with platelets is actually
treated<00:05:05.320> like<00:05:05.500> an<00:05:05.620> injection<00:05:06.280> under<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.670> skin

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
treated like an injection under the skin

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.650 
treated like an injection under the skin
and<00:05:07.450> it<00:05:07.810> seemed<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:08.260> it<00:05:08.530> appears<00:05:08.680> to<00:05:08.950> help<00:05:09.310> the

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
and it seemed and it appears to help the
