00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.260
 and this beer that was one of the first 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.420
 beers that paulaner made as 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.420

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.469
 German beer you can not afford 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.969
 campaign like this. 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.539
 tasting go to our file 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.539
 technical 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.910
 poland to vitor or salvator né 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.830
 It is made by the brewery itself. 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.830
 name to paulaner which is one of the series 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.440
 most famous in Germany and around the 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.800
 world is also in Munich and is a 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.960
 brewery that was founded by monks is 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.240
 today a much broader process much 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.450
 more industrial is but it was founded 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.030
 by monks of that congregation that was 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.830
 founded by são Francisco de Paula and 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.110
 because I'm saying this because 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.030
 beer is considered the net bread that 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.890
 it was to be that beer that the monks 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.940
 consume during the period of Lent 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.660
 where they fast and eat 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.530
 him this beer that already has many 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:04.400
 Years of history, then it's a beer. 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.619
 style lager than boxing 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.619
 or a good one that is more full-bodied 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.610
 more concentrated and also more 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.270
 alcoholic is this one has 7.9 of content 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.890
 then it's a good beer. 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.290
 intense and because of this it must be 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.060
 tasted between 8 to 12 degrees 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.640
 the ideal cups for this type of 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.470
 beer would be cylindrical. 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.430
 that I am using that can also have 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.530
 this finer version would be a 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.989
 cup a large cup since it is family 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.810
 of the large or very common 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.660
 Germany use of the mugs is then 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.489

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.489

 here and we go there for our tasting alone 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.180
 to tell you here about this 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.510
 distance I 'm already feeling the aromas 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.550
 they exhale a beautiful a beautiful beer 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.390
 from the style of boc let's go to our 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.010
 tasting 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:34.010
 she has a reddish color a little 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:38.269
 orange darker brown right 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:42.080
 but it's a copper in the world and say yes no 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.980
 It's so dark but it's a snake so it's a 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.890
 red 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.209
 the foam in a brown and cream cream color 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:53.390
 taste and formation of medium bubbles 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:57.010
 the medium duration training goes to the 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.010
 our students 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:07.400
 Look at the scent you smell. 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:12.350
 malts is toasted are you sorry 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:19.720
 the malt issue does not feel the 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:23.350
 hops, the predominant one is malt one 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.090
 caramel remembers something like this 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:30.020
 also a little bakery touch 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:33.650
 of yeast also you feel a 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.890
 thing toast not so intense the 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.070
 coffee issue but you feel a 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:43.340
 A little here in the aroma, I feel 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.640
 also unlike good 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.220
 Conventional You Feel Alcohol Too 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.820
 for thereby be more intense as the 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.820
 our palate 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:03.469
 full bodied but soft descends 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:06.649
 You feel the alcohol in the beginning is expensive. 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:08.719
 sweeter but it is well balanced to 

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:11.300
 matter of bitter sweet is not to have the 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:14.089
 naughty beers 12 so she is 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.939
 balanced to give you take legal in 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:18.710
 retro taste you feel one thing one 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:22.069
 bit more bitter I felt a little bit 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.740
 you feel the alcohol more 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:26.240
 outlines that it is well-balanced 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.990
 beer that matches very well in the 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.969
 Feijoada with meat in general ham is 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.669
 and something like that. 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:36.680

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:39.830

 boc nap as I said is a boxing 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.949
 A little more complex there, right? 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.360
