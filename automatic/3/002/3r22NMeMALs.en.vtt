star player for this team and I mean

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.560 
star player for this team and I mean
that<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.430> really<00:02:05.850> really<00:02:05.880> good<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:06.450> he's

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
that that is really really good and he's

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.630 
that that is really really good and he's
coming<00:02:06.810> off<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> bench<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.800> mean<00:02:08.010> he's<00:02:08.280> I
