00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:04.490
 and so hello everyone and 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.780
 lack of start-up resources 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.500
 so voting deputies fifth 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.619
 generations cf 

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:11.059
 this icon 4 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.309
 i.e. ag processor a5 vs processor 4 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:16.379
 as you can see here 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.039
 neck never let down the application that 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.739
 for tets so did 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.829
 v.zubkov aizhk did not interfere so 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.829
 prosecutor's office 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:30.319
 complicated of course pna in general launching 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.319
 at the same time infinity blade first part 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.680
 means 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.480
 first time we omit 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.720
 but we have all the cleaner nyse 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.820
 multitasking 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.820
 so mean 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.340
 let's see who will load sun faster 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.840
 you and ohh if he just 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.180
 that is, everything is already possible to play on that way 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.180
 because she stands there with us 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.720
 so this problem is that the first time ubs 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.500
 so our screensaver appears 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.149
 that's how i heard 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.670
 will turn out 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.320
 if you just thought why is he 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.180
 so why not started differently 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.370
 then just if for what is running out already 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.180
 can play 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.250
 percent 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.730
 all because he is on the reverse so we 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.120
 let's go now 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.000
 on payment of public services secure 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.970
 at the same time 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.470
 fine 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.390
 We already have 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.909
 welcoming the project here only 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.350
 appeared 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.079
 there is as you can see the weight is not adapted to 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.940
 cause display 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.930
 but we see how much faster 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:29.820
 booted up 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.770
 more will be the site and its only and yet 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.880
 continued playing from the roof for the first time 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.780
 because 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.780
 voice input is there in syria all the circles 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.480
 I will write about the stamp Kiev 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.820
 well, and so 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.820
 sell to saints 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.540
 the next is yes karma 3 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.660
 it's like a Macedonian fight only this 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.090
 free version for 10 smaller and in 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.980
 We mainly are demos. 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.980
 only 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.299
 started up 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.299
 much faster already compositions say 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.740
 just appeared 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.209
 that is, the processes n 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.339
 again 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.619
 wins in this case a4 processor 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:17.619
 much well and who will be sure i can 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:19.819
 to tell 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.780
 again it will be faster sooner 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.349
 say something that 5 2 times faster here 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.709
 Now the a5 processor is reborn in all 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.859
 what you do what hey and in the end and his 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:30.870
 merit 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.210
 and at this point this generation y year 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.119
 so that's how it all happens 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:39.119
 but let's move on 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:42.769
 next plays gives leader 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.389
 free mug and generally cool i'm her 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.669
 I love love and know how to play 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.519
 so run 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.889
 A bit earlier it turned out on their background 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.889
 but here is 1 th forum 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:56.679
 a little 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:59.069
 it means we have these people display 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.279
 supported on this new wheelbarrow already 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:02.919
 came in 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.379
 so and if not for this would force the team 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.779
 now you could just play first 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:09.879
 Therefore, we run it with such a thing 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.479
 miss there how many stages on them 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.299
 these are objects saver wiring red background 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.319
 appeared that very long accountant 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.319
 day on 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.050
 this and red schools psv 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.159
 and that is, we play buried there 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.319
 need to stop Dita launched 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.529
 reasons to experience Dershovitsa 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:36.899
 this is also pretty screw 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:38.299
 it ended quickly pretty 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.089
 also a demanding gram 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:42.909
 one more ship 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:44.769
 and not just downloaded yet about 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.099
 payment you neither have and its hours it only 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.099
 work normally 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.509
 the next game this game beyonse think 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:59.509
 and the class is the same game bone test 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:02.529
 as we see the attachment project uploaded to 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:04.709
 this position can already be played 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:05.829
 but 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.949
 the fund agreed upside down and here 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:09.959
 now how can you play people 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.989
 at first it loads quickly on one 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.419
 and another device but 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.419
 all the same position further 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.040
 pao connects apps for today 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.909
 this is asphalt fsin 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:24.900
 require and very play 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.880
 so I know exactly what to save and on 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.870
 maintain it a hundred percent 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.159
 So 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:35.159
 there is already an inscription about their families 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.219
 so already went Kochetkov and all 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:42.719
 we start out loud and the fund for all is already possible 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:44.469
 how would he play 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:46.449
 and that is the sea on their foundation but this one 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:47.539
 little 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.190
 the best militia 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.599
 no 12 ton crane continued 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:53.240
 of points 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.430
 and after that we still have street spinning 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.430
 on japan after that we play well 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.009
 navigation 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.309
 and now only 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:06.879
 just in your game 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:09.979
 and up to a year to enter draw conclusions now 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.500
 40 beds from the car to the generations 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.720
 this 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.139
 fast devices 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.289
 it was necessary of course to compare sciphone 4s 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.660
 because they have current processes 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.650
 and everything like that 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.759
 Edith nook there display and Tina of course on such 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:29.160
 same as on iphone 4 so demand a percentage of 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.099
 CPU at great risk and so big 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.709
 so everyone therefore for watching 

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:35.740
 me today 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.529
 bye everyone
