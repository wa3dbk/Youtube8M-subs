the crap out of the window and make it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.410 
the crap out of the window and make it
real<00:02:01.320> real<00:02:01.619> wet<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.579> way<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.000> tint<00:02:03.240> can

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
real real wet that way the tint can

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.660 
real real wet that way the tint can
slide<00:02:03.659> around<00:02:04.070> then<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.100> need<00:02:05.340> one<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.520> these

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
slide around then you need one of these

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.650 
slide around then you need one of these
it's<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.630> squeegee<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.520> you<00:02:08.520> squeegee<00:02:09.030> all<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
it's a squeegee and you squeegee all the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.199 
it's a squeegee and you squeegee all the
water<00:02:09.840> out<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.920> start<00:02:11.250> start<00:02:11.970> from<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
water out of it you start start from the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.750 
water out of it you start start from the
center<00:02:12.620> or<00:02:13.620> start<00:02:13.860> from<00:02:13.980> one<00:02:14.160> side<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.670> then

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
center or start from one side and then

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.400 
center or start from one side and then
just<00:02:15.300> kind<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.510> work<00:02:15.660> your<00:02:15.810> way<00:02:15.870> across<00:02:15.989> and

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
just kind of work your way across and

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.809 
just kind of work your way across and
squeeze<00:02:16.680> as<00:02:16.860> much<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.250> out<00:02:17.489> as<00:02:17.640> possible

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
squeeze as much of that out as possible

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.699 
squeeze as much of that out as possible
and<00:02:18.209> then<00:02:18.629> let<00:02:18.780> your<00:02:18.900> windows<00:02:19.200> setup<00:02:19.440> for

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
and then let your windows setup for

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.850 
and then let your windows setup for
about<00:02:19.890> for<00:02:20.220> about<00:02:20.879> 48<00:02:21.360> hours<00:02:21.690> let<00:02:22.620> me<00:02:22.680> come

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
about for about 48 hours let me come

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.150 
about for about 48 hours let me come
over<00:02:22.890> here<00:02:23.340> we've<00:02:23.610> already<00:02:23.760> done<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:24.180> side

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
over here we've already done this side

bubbles here and there it's not one
hundred<00:02:41.280> percent<00:02:41.459> perfect<00:02:43.459> but<00:02:44.459> it's<00:02:44.610> going

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
hundred percent perfect but it's going

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.949

see the heck's a little bit later hey I
got<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.709> brown<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.870> all<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.110> way<00:03:16.200> around

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
got the brown and all the way around

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.850 
got the brown and all the way around
like<00:03:18.629> I<00:03:18.750> said<00:03:18.810> it's<00:03:19.230> not<00:03:19.349> exactly<00:03:19.860> perfect<00:03:21.860> but

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
like I said it's not exactly perfect but

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.089 
like I said it's not exactly perfect but
it'll<00:03:22.980> work<00:03:23.750> all<00:03:24.750> right<00:03:25.580> it's<00:03:26.580> not<00:03:26.760> mirrored

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
it'll work all right it's not mirrored

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.280 
it'll work all right it's not mirrored
there's<00:03:29.099> a<00:03:29.190> whole<00:03:29.310> bunch<00:03:29.519> of<00:03:29.610> little<00:03:29.730> but

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
there's a whole bunch of little but

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.890 
there's a whole bunch of little but
bubbles<00:03:31.290> in<00:03:31.470> here<00:03:31.650> but<00:03:32.159> also<00:03:32.430> it's<00:03:32.849> that<00:03:33.000> the

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
bubbles in here but also it's that the

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.070 
bubbles in here but also it's that the
window<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:34.590> not<00:03:34.860> perfect<00:03:35.640> so<00:03:35.940> that's<00:03:36.120> let's

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
window is not perfect so that's let's

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.210 
window is not perfect so that's let's
add<00:03:37.349> into<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:38.569> bought<00:03:39.569> some<00:03:40.190> remember<00:03:41.190> I

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
add into that I bought some remember I

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.070 
add into that I bought some remember I
said<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.640> yellow<00:03:42.150> vacuum<00:03:42.450> on<00:03:42.599> so<00:03:42.810> now<00:03:42.959> i'm

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
said the yellow vacuum on so now i'm

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.039 
said the yellow vacuum on so now i'm
going<00:03:43.140> to<00:03:43.319> start<00:03:44.129> switching<00:03:44.459> out<00:03:44.810> all<00:03:45.810> the

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
going to start switching out all the

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.809 
going to start switching out all the
vacuum<00:03:46.349> lines<00:03:46.560> on<00:03:46.890> here<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.370> don't<00:03:47.580> know<00:03:47.640> that

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
vacuum lines on here I don't know that

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.220 
vacuum lines on here I don't know that
this<00:03:47.970> is<00:03:48.180> enough<00:03:48.450> for<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.720> but<00:03:48.930> we'll<00:03:49.080> see

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
this is enough for that but we'll see

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.920 
this is enough for that but we'll see
how<00:03:49.260> many<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.560> can<00:03:49.590> get<00:03:49.860> done<00:03:50.510> there's<00:03:51.510> now<00:03:51.629> dark

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
how many I can get done there's now dark

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.220 
how many I can get done there's now dark
outside<00:03:52.170> let's<00:03:52.950> I'll<00:03:53.159> show<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.489> guys<00:03:54.140> what<00:03:55.140> it

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
outside let's I'll show you guys what it

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.080 
outside let's I'll show you guys what it
looks<00:03:55.260> like<00:03:55.620> that's<00:03:56.580> about<00:03:56.730> all<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:56.849> got<00:03:57.060> left

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
looks like that's about all I got left

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.630 
looks like that's about all I got left
out<00:03:57.480> of<00:03:57.540> 10<00:03:57.840> foot<00:03:58.110> I<00:03:58.379> think<00:03:59.129> there's<00:03:59.280> a<00:03:59.370> few

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
out of 10 foot I think there's a few

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.479 
out of 10 foot I think there's a few
other<00:03:59.670> vacuum<00:04:00.209> lines<00:04:00.420> that<00:04:00.810> i<00:04:00.840> haven't<00:04:01.200> seen

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
other vacuum lines that i haven't seen

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.649 
other vacuum lines that i haven't seen
