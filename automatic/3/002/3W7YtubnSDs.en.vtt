00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.869

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.880
 in front of his eyes then we 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.680
 stands straight shoulders relaxed 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.870

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.059
 ready not his shoulders so as to have 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.860
 a good hand so agree the shoulders 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.440
 well laid back still holds a small 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.320
 little more straight so the back well flat ok 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.729
 elbows to the body so a little bit 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.809
 more to the body that extension maybe 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.820
 a little bit of ground on the contrary 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.350
 lengthen a little bit of land 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.210
 support a little bit his hands one of 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.739
 way to see forearms and hands 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.510
 in a straight line 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.110
 okay so a little bit more supported 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.220
 that's how it pushes them up 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.780
 so we try reindeer too on their 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.850
 flat so there you have a little bit turned 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.740
 so you have to put that like 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.010
 that you are reindeer and well push them 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.140
 up like that so all your 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.770
 fingers on the reins to make his 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.810
 fingers on the reins then so your 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.670
 plate that is the part of your 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.650
 body that is placed on the saddle must 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.030
 to be ahead you do not have to have them 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.380
 buttocks too far back of the saddle 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.750
 but on the contrary, well forward 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.300
 always the flat back so the thigh 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.950
 who goes down who naturally fall 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.470
 must not stop thigh nor your knees 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.880

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.300
 about a third of the foot here is a small 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.880
