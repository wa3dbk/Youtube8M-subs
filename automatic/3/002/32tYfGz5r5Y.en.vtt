00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
flour made from maize if you put these

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.840

biscuits<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.810> bag<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.619> then<00:01:56.340> use<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.520> rolling

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
biscuits in a bag and then use a rolling

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.609 
biscuits in a bag and then use a rolling
pin<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.240> crush<00:01:57.540> them<00:01:57.750> up<00:01:57.869> that's<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.320> good<00:01:58.439> way

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
pin to crush them up that's a good way

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.389 
pin to crush them up that's a good way
up<00:01:58.770> crushing<00:01:59.040> them<00:01:59.280> up<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.640> could<00:02:00.329> demonstrate

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
up crushing them up I could demonstrate

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.950 
up crushing them up I could demonstrate
but<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.430> don't<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> bag<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.600> what<00:02:03.810> I'll

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
but I don't have a bag so what I'll

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.020 
but I don't have a bag so what I'll
probably<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.619> instead<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.280> crushing<00:02:05.759> them<00:02:05.909> up

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
probably do instead of crushing them up

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.969 
probably do instead of crushing them up
in<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.270> bag<00:02:06.450> which<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.110> practical<00:02:07.619> way

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
in a bag which is the practical way

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.859 
in a bag which is the practical way
which<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.759> should<00:02:09.090> use

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
which you should use

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.609 
which you should use
which<00:02:09.959> you'll<00:02:10.110> have<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.440> use<00:02:10.470> your

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
which you'll have to use your

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.680 
which you'll have to use your
imagination<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.430> imagine<00:02:11.640> how<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.299> would<00:02:12.450> be

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
imagination to imagine how it would be

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.789 
imagination to imagine how it would be
I'm<00:02:13.190> just<00:02:14.190> going<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:15.470> smash<00:02:16.470> them<00:02:17.330> like<00:02:18.330> this

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
I'm just going to smash them like this

that's not going to work um what should
I<00:02:21.959> do<00:02:22.019> how<00:02:22.470> should<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.739> do<00:02:22.799> this<00:02:23.750> hmm<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.569> put

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
I do how should I do this hmm so I put

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.170 
I do how should I do this hmm so I put
the<00:02:27.900> Mont<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.379> parchment<00:02:28.860> paper<00:02:29.129> and<00:02:29.970> put

the Mont and parchment paper and put

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.509 
the Mont and parchment paper and put
some<00:02:30.540> more<00:02:30.690> party<00:02:31.200> later<00:02:31.409> pops<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.220> doesn't

get<00:02:32.579> too<00:02:32.640> messy<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:34.079> then<00:02:34.680> I'm<00:02:34.829> going<00:02:34.980> to

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
get too messy and then I'm going to

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:43.280 
get too messy and then I'm going to
smash<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:37.310> think<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.489> bag<00:02:38.760> would<00:02:39.209> be<00:02:39.390> better<00:02:42.290> I'm

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
smash I think a bag would be better I'm

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.839 
smash I think a bag would be better I'm
just<00:02:43.590> going<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:43.799> get<00:02:44.160> on<00:02:44.310> with<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.519> it's

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
just going to get on with it it's

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.930 
just going to get on with it it's

going<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.209> melt<00:02:48.420> this<00:02:48.629> in<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.170> microwave<00:02:49.349> but

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
going to melt this in the microwave but

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.110 
going to melt this in the microwave but
you<00:02:50.250> can<00:02:50.400> obviously<00:02:50.670> use<00:02:50.849> a<00:02:51.060> pan<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:53.120> mixing

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120

the<00:02:54.750> butter<00:03:01.849> maybe<00:03:02.849> not<00:03:03.180> enough<00:03:03.390> butter<00:03:04.909> then

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
the butter maybe not enough butter then

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
that might work as well i'm going to put

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.510

three<00:05:19.180> tablespoons<00:05:19.390> of<00:05:20.080> sugar<00:05:20.230> in<00:05:20.470> it<00:05:20.680> i<00:05:21.310> think

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
three tablespoons of sugar in it i think

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.400 
three tablespoons of sugar in it i think
the<00:05:21.610> recipe<00:05:22.000> said<00:05:22.210> like<00:05:22.420> two<00:05:22.630> or<00:05:22.810> three<00:05:22.840> ounces

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
the recipe said like two or three ounces

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.230 
the recipe said like two or three ounces
but<00:05:23.920> i<00:05:23.980> didn't<00:05:24.370> use<00:05:24.460> that<00:05:24.490> many<00:05:24.850> and<00:05:24.970> it<00:05:25.120> was

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
but i didn't use that many and it was

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.970 
but i didn't use that many and it was
already<00:05:25.540> too<00:05:25.720> sweet<00:05:26.110> so<00:05:26.140> i<00:05:26.530> think<00:05:26.650> two

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
already too sweet so i think two

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.340 
already too sweet so i think two
tablespoons<00:05:27.700> is<00:05:27.910> more<00:05:28.300> than<00:05:28.480> enough<00:05:28.780> full<00:05:29.260> of

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
tablespoons is more than enough full of

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.450 
tablespoons is more than enough full of
this<00:05:29.500> teaser<00:05:29.710> so<00:05:30.370> one<00:05:30.870> tablespoon

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
this teaser so one tablespoon

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.730 
this teaser so one tablespoon
and<00:05:33.919> ya<00:05:34.919> don't<00:05:35.280> need<00:05:35.490> a<00:05:35.520> full<00:05:35.789> tablespoon<00:05:36.740> put

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
and ya don't need a full tablespoon put

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:44.839 
and ya don't need a full tablespoon put
up<00:05:37.860> it<00:05:37.979> back<00:05:41.300> make<00:05:42.300> sure<00:05:42.330> that<00:05:43.080> is<00:05:43.259> in<00:05:43.849> whoops

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
it for another 10 minutes it might vary

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:27.390

depending on your oven or depending on
what<00:06:27.699> sort<00:06:27.940> of<00:06:27.970> cheese<00:06:28.210> you<00:06:28.240> use<00:06:28.570> or<00:06:28.780> depending

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
on the way the wind blows that day

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:34.320 
on the way the wind blows that day
probably<00:06:33.010> so<00:06:33.190> I'm<00:06:33.280> going<00:06:33.400> to<00:06:33.430> put<00:06:33.490> this<00:06:33.580> in<00:06:33.820> now

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
probably so I'm going to put this in now

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.150 
probably so I'm going to put this in now
and<00:06:34.690> hope<00:06:35.169> for<00:06:35.199> the<00:06:35.410> best<00:06:35.470> it's<00:06:36.040> very<00:06:36.389> liquidy

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
and hope for the best it's very liquidy

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.490 
and hope for the best it's very liquidy
so<00:06:39.160> I<00:06:39.190> put<00:06:39.700> the<00:06:40.030> lemon<00:06:40.210> on<00:06:40.479> top<00:06:40.510> I'm<00:06:40.990> probably

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
so I put the lemon on top I'm probably

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.290 
so I put the lemon on top I'm probably
going<00:06:41.710> to<00:06:41.800> give<00:06:41.889> that<00:06:42.040> another<00:06:42.220> 20<00:06:42.790> minutes<00:06:42.970> in

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
going to give that another 20 minutes in

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.030 
going to give that another 20 minutes in
fact<00:06:43.600> because<00:06:44.020> it's<00:06:44.200> not<00:06:44.530> really<00:06:44.860> near

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.040 
fact because it's not really near

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.980 
fact because it's not really near
setting<00:06:45.580> and<00:06:45.729> also<00:06:46.419> it's<00:06:46.630> got<00:06:46.750> lots<00:06:46.870> of

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
setting and also it's got lots of

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.990 
setting and also it's got lots of
bubbles<00:06:47.229> on<00:06:47.590> the<00:06:47.710> top<00:06:47.950> yours<00:06:48.340> might<00:06:48.610> not<00:06:48.790> have

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 
bubbles on the top yours might not have

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.050
