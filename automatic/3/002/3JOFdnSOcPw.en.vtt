00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
the batteries get too low so I'm going

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.609 
the batteries get too low so I'm going
to<00:00:29.730> show<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.029> little<00:00:30.210> bit<00:00:30.330> about<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.840> how<00:00:31.439> it

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
to show you a little bit about it how it

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.190 
to show you a little bit about it how it
works<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.910> different<00:00:33.300> options<00:00:33.450> involved

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
works the different options involved

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.959 
works the different options involved
here<00:00:35.690> you<00:00:36.690> set<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.440> actual<00:00:37.800> high<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.579> low

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
here you set the actual high and low

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.080 
here you set the actual high and low
voltage<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:40.290> your<00:00:40.440> battery<00:00:40.739> bank<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.879> left

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
voltage of your battery bank on the left

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.810 
voltage of your battery bank on the left
and<00:00:42.530> then<00:00:43.530> configure<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.250> these<00:00:44.399> four

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
and then configure it in these four

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.439 
and then configure it in these four
different<00:00:46.309> schematics<00:00:48.020> and<00:00:50.210> they're<00:00:51.210> just

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
different schematics and they're just

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.170 
different schematics and they're just
small<00:00:51.899> variations<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.739> each<00:00:52.860> other<00:00:53.129> for<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
small variations of each other for the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.569 
small variations of each other for the
different<00:00:54.510> uses<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.899> I'll<00:00:55.260> go<00:00:55.440> over<00:00:55.739> each<00:00:56.160> of

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
different uses and I'll go over each of

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.290 
different uses and I'll go over each of
them<00:00:57.680> it's<00:00:58.680> quite<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.039> handy<00:00:59.280> little<00:00:59.640> unit<00:01:00.059> as<00:01:00.239> a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
them it's quite a handy little unit as a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.780 
them it's quite a handy little unit as a
backup<00:01:02.180> switch<00:01:03.180> here<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:05.250> uses<00:01:05.760> a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
backup switch here we have the uses a

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.510 
backup switch here we have the uses a
battery<00:01:06.090> vent<00:01:06.600> controller<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.890> voltage

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
battery vent controller if the voltage

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.420 
battery vent controller if the voltage
of<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.510> battery<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:10.110> would<00:01:10.350> be<00:01:10.500> high<00:01:10.740> at<00:01:11.100> this

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
of the battery it would be high at this

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.020 
of the battery it would be high at this
point<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:12.479> would<00:01:12.659> be<00:01:13.500> able<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> fan

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
point you would be able to have a fan

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.210 
point you would be able to have a fan
turn<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.650> would<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.070> off

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
turn on and that would be for off

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.429 
turn on and that would be for off
gassing<00:01:17.790> if<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.360> battery<00:01:18.720> voltage<00:01:18.810> was

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
gassing if the battery voltage was

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.609 
gassing if the battery voltage was
possibly<00:01:20.040> when<00:01:20.340> they're<00:01:20.549> equalizing<00:01:21.420> or<00:01:21.900> when

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
possibly when they're equalizing or when

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.910 
possibly when they're equalizing or when
it<00:01:22.710> gets<00:01:22.890> too<00:01:23.100> high<00:01:23.460> when<00:01:24.000> charging<00:01:24.590> off<00:01:25.590> gas

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
it gets too high when charging off gas

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.359 
it gets too high when charging off gas
is<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> lot<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> fan<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.210> useful<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.930> kick<00:01:28.140> on

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
is a lot so the fan is useful to kick on

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.080 
is a lot so the fan is useful to kick on
necessary<00:01:30.110> this<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.650> connection<00:01:32.490> as<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.729> low

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
necessary this is a connection as a low

necessary this is a connection as a low
voltage<00:01:33.390> disconnect<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:35.780> here<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:37.770> would

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
voltage disconnect and here we would

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.730 
voltage disconnect and here we would
disconnect<00:01:38.729> when<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> battery<00:01:39.930> voltage<00:01:40.020> got

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
disconnect when the battery voltage got

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.539 
disconnect when the battery voltage got
to<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> point<00:01:41.430> where<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:42.150> wanted<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.689> stop

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
to a point where we wanted it to stop

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.210 
to a point where we wanted it to stop
from<00:01:44.549> draining<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.450> avoid<00:01:46.020> any<00:01:46.350> damage<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
from draining to avoid any damage to the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.760 
from draining to avoid any damage to the
battery<00:01:47.549> bank<00:01:47.899> it<00:01:48.899> would<00:01:49.020> disconnect<00:01:49.560> your

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
battery bank it would disconnect your

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.300 
battery bank it would disconnect your
load<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.360> see<00:01:51.360> here<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.049> n<00:01:52.320> o<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:53.130> the

model and I'll be making more videos as
I<00:02:47.490> install<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:49.470> equipment<00:02:49.709> but<00:02:50.310> here<00:02:50.520> it<00:02:50.610> is

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.870 

pretty<00:02:54.810> easy<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.400> set<00:02:56.400> up<00:02:56.550> pretty

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
pretty easy to set up pretty

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:08.530 
pretty easy to set up pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.760> actually<00:03:00.720> yeah

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.600 

giving<00:03:08.810> you<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:08.959> little<00:03:09.409> video<00:03:10.159> of<00:03:10.219> what<00:03:10.519> it

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
giving you a little video of what it

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:26.260 
giving you a little video of what it
looks<00:03:10.790> like

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.150 

put<00:03:27.270> the<00:03:27.360> connections<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:28.080> torque<00:03:29.010> them<00:03:29.130> down
