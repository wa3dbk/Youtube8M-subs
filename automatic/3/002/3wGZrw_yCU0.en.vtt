but<00:01:39.210> at<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.390> same<00:01:39.540> time<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:39.990> needed<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.469> look

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
but at the same time we needed to look

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.469 
but at the same time we needed to look
solid<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.219> secure<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.060> needed<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.390> look

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
solid and secure and it needed to look

quite<00:01:43.189> expensive<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.939> was<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> c-segment

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
quite expensive it was a c-segment

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.749 
quite expensive it was a c-segment
needed<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> little<00:01:47.219> bit<00:01:47.310> premium

feeling<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.570> took<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.960> risk<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.259> call<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.680> cash

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.140 
and that's the big focus but when we try
to<00:04:22.150> do<00:04:22.510> on<00:04:22.720> new<00:04:23.320> cash<00:04:23.560> now<00:04:23.889> as<00:04:24.100> we<00:04:24.250> took<00:04:24.490> the

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
to do on new cash now as we took the

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.879 
to do on new cash now as we took the
strengths<00:04:25.600> of<00:04:25.690> current<00:04:26.050> cash<00:04:26.260> guy<00:04:26.560> and<00:04:26.770> we

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
strengths of current cash guy and we

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.730 
strengths of current cash guy and we
called<00:04:27.160> it<00:04:27.310> though<00:04:27.550> 100<00:04:28.449> ways<00:04:28.690> strategy<00:04:29.440> so

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
called it though 100 ways strategy so

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.070 
called it though 100 ways strategy so
it's<00:04:29.860> a<00:04:29.919> lot<00:04:30.130> of<00:04:30.160> small<00:04:31.060> elements<00:04:31.449> that<00:04:31.990> you

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
it's a lot of small elements that you

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.719 
it's a lot of small elements that you
put<00:04:32.260> together<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.889> make<00:04:33.010> a<00:04:33.039> big<00:04:33.280> difference<00:04:33.460> to

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
put together to make a big difference to

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.820 
put together to make a big difference to
the<00:04:33.850> customer<00:04:34.389> so<00:04:34.780> for<00:04:34.960> example<00:04:35.500> you<00:04:35.710> can

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
the customer so for example you can

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.379 
the customer so for example you can
improve<00:04:36.039> the<00:04:36.190> aerodynamics<00:04:36.370> in<00:04:37.030> order<00:04:37.210> to

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
improve the aerodynamics in order to

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.570 
improve the aerodynamics in order to
improve<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:37.840> fuel<00:04:38.080> economy<00:04:38.320> you<00:04:39.160> have<00:04:39.340> with<00:04:39.550> a

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
improve the fuel economy you have with a

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.400 
improve the fuel economy you have with a
safety<00:04:39.850> shield<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.750> it's<00:04:40.870> an<00:04:41.020> chassis

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
safety shield and it's an chassis

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.830 
safety shield and it's an chassis
control<00:04:41.650> that<00:04:42.639> will<00:04:42.850> make<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.210> guard<00:04:43.449> drive

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
control that will make the guard drive

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.260 
control that will make the guard drive
much<00:04:44.260> better<00:04:44.500> than<00:04:44.740> any<00:04:44.949> other<00:04:45.310> crossover<00:04:46.090> or

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
much better than any other crossover or

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.040 
much better than any other crossover or
SUV<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:48.850> doing<00:04:49.180> things<00:04:49.389> like<00:04:49.510> being<00:04:49.900> the
