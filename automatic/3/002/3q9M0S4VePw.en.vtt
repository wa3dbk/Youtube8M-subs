00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.429
 Hi, I suggest the installation option 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:13.690
 fog lights 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:17.349
 but the best domestic car VAZ 2121 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.720
 although no better than many you went to 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:25.630
 the best domestic car but who 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:27.189
 same city will let us on the tank for 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.060
 I picked up the installation 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.929
 small headlights d.l. hey 600 production 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.149
 China 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.600
 as it is known in the east there are two 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:41.019
 main production workshops 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.410
 japan inadvertently and both are located in 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.690
 provinces model in headlights are good because 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.510
 each module 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.829
 located under its headlights far and 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.579
 fog light body they have 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.940
 aluminum 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.679
 glass glass and i must say 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.320
 pretty inexpensive well here follows 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:02.820
 consider the capabilities of your generator 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:07.030
 because the total power of steam is obtained 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.490
 220 watts in my version of installing lights 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.150
 located under the bumper but the exit angle 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.550
 the arrival of the car does not change 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.330
 attached to the tube on which the bumper hangs 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.740
 headlights of course better to take small 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.490
 under the bumpers and came to arrange 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.380
 because later on I want to 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.040
 put extra headlights 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.500
 light on the same bracket is known that 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.540
 the trout of extra light he does not have 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.440
 very good therefore installation 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.500
 protivotumanok 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.210
 helps illuminate the curb and pretty 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:46.410
 clearly visible surrounding space 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:49.420
 in front of which brackets are made 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:52.570
 we take two pipes of square section 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.030
 20 to 20 millimeters in my case 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.650
 legs from old school desks which 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.680
 lay in a neighboring yard 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.650
 that is, despite the fact that the Soviet 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:07.710
 the days are long over 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:10.840
 something else can be cut off need pieces 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.840
 cut by saw in midtown rectangular 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.260
 the outback we drill holes needed 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.590
 diameter paint buy 4 bolts m8 li 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.230
 m10 with a length of 120 millimeters drill 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.130
 headlight mounts and everything in 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.380
 principle ready to install on pipe on 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.520
 which hangs the bumper at the same time through 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.470
 rubber and metal gaskets 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.380
 headlight wires missed under the body 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.930
 watt didnâ€™t want to cut 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.870
 grille 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.000
 there is a gift opening through which 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.959
 can run wire space for 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.450
 lattice and place them in front 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.390
 fans then skip the motor on 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.250
 section captivity for any scheme you like 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.740
 connect 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:05.530
 and this is an example of how a car looks like 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.430
 headlights to the main beam in 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.800
 fog light 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.450
 I do not have LED paws as well 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.760
 looks like a car with included 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:17.800
 fog lights their color 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.540
 pretty good and here's an example of how to shine 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.700
 installed fog lights 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.540
 This is only the light from the dimensions and 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.140
 LED lamps beam headlamps 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.350
 fog fog + fog 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.200
 headlights 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:37.540
 and this all lighting is on 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:44.290
 i.e. additionally dipped in 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:46.900
 main pair and here is a drawing with exact 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.020
 dimensions you can click on pause and 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.480
 look for a good show is worth 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:58.020
 set playback settings to 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:01.060
 maximum quality well, that is all 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:04.450
