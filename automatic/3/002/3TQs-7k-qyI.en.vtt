the<00:00:52.649> dry<00:00:52.860> fitting<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.370> always<00:00:53.670> important<00:00:54.120> but

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
the dry fitting is always important but

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.510 
the dry fitting is always important but
definitely<00:00:55.440> make<00:00:55.559> sure<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.890> drive<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.309> that

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
definitely make sure you drive it that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.360 
definitely make sure you drive it that
because<00:00:56.969> resin<00:00:57.899> will<00:00:58.289> superglue<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.070> takes

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
because resin will superglue it takes

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.920 
because resin will superglue it takes
very<00:01:00.359> well<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.129> it<00:01:02.129> forms<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.789> bond<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.390> seems

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
very well and it forms a bond it seems

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.620 
very well and it forms a bond it seems
almost<00:01:04.199> instantaneously<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.450> very

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
almost instantaneously so it's a very

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.090 
almost instantaneously so it's a very
strong<00:01:06.900> bond<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.470> make<00:01:07.680> sure<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.890> get<00:01:07.979> it

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
strong bond so make sure you get it

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.210 
strong bond so make sure you get it
where<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.310> want<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:09.740> anyway<00:01:10.740> back<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.010> the

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.020 
it takes a couple hour to dry a couple
hours<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:01.120> dry<00:02:02.190> this<00:02:03.190> is<00:02:03.250> a<00:02:03.400> very<00:02:03.700> permanent

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
hours to dry this is a very permanent

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.090 
hours to dry this is a very permanent
gluing<00:02:04.690> solution<00:02:05.230> by<00:02:06.160> that<00:02:06.370> I<00:02:06.400> mean<00:02:08.100> it's

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
gluing solution by that I mean it's

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.490 
gluing solution by that I mean it's
going<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.520> partially<00:02:10.080> melt<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.380> plastic

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
going to partially melt the plastic

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.120 
going to partially melt the plastic
together

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
together

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.740 
together
it's<00:02:12.370> basically<00:02:12.700> welding<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.300> two<00:02:13.420> pieces

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
it's basically welding the two pieces

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.380 
it's basically welding the two pieces
together<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.820> you<00:02:15.820> definitely<00:02:15.940> want<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.300> make

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
together so you definitely want to make

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.940 
together so you definitely want to make
sure<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.750> get<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:17.020> where<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.200> want<00:02:17.320> it<00:02:17.650> before

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
sure you get it where you want it before

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.810 
sure you get it where you want it before
you<00:02:18.340> really<00:02:19.150> set<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.260> pieces<00:02:20.470> together

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
you really set the pieces together

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.310 
you really set the pieces together
because<00:02:21.820> once<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.180> sets<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.840> have<00:02:23.080> a<00:02:23.110> hard

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
because once it sets you have a hard

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.350 
because once it sets you have a hard
time<00:02:23.560> breaking<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:24.070> pieces<00:02:24.550> apart<00:02:24.850> we're<00:02:25.270> in

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
time breaking the pieces apart we're in

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.350 
time breaking the pieces apart we're in
the<00:02:25.450> joint<00:02:25.720> was<00:02:26.760> but<00:02:27.760> it's<00:02:27.850> a<00:02:27.880> very<00:02:28.030> strong

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
the joint was but it's a very strong

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.580 
the joint was but it's a very strong
bond<00:02:28.600> so<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.110> don't<00:02:29.230> have<00:02:29.320> to<00:02:29.380> worry<00:02:29.500> about

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
bond so you don't have to worry about

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.020 
bond so you don't have to worry about
pieces<00:02:29.950> really<00:02:30.070> breaking<00:02:30.459> off<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.670> model<00:02:30.880> if

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
pieces really breaking off the model if

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.600 
pieces really breaking off the model if
it<00:02:31.150> falls

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.449 

the<00:02:34.180> reason<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.480> like<00:02:34.660> plastic<00:02:35.140> glue<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.500> might

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
the reason I like plastic glue I might

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:37.890 
the reason I like plastic glue I might
have<00:02:36.550> come<00:02:36.730> about<00:02:36.850> classically<00:02:37.300> before<00:02:37.660> is

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
have come about classically before is

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.870 
have come about classically before is
that<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:39.250> doesn't<00:02:40.500> stick<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.709> you<00:02:41.860> meaning<00:02:42.520> if

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
that it doesn't stick to you meaning if

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.140 
that it doesn't stick to you meaning if
I<00:02:43.030> got<00:02:43.240> super<00:02:43.990> glue<00:02:44.170> let's<00:02:44.530> say<00:02:44.709> on<00:02:44.860> my<00:02:45.150> shirt

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
I got super glue let's say on my shirt

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.270 
I got super glue let's say on my shirt
sleeve<00:02:46.300> they<00:02:46.840> didn't<00:02:46.990> realize<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.590> it

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
sleeve they didn't realize it and it

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.740 
sleeve they didn't realize it and it
shirt<00:02:48.430> sleeve<00:02:48.640> was<00:02:48.820> pushed<00:02:49.060> against<00:02:49.330> my<00:02:49.420> skin

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
shirt sleeve was pushed against my skin

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.160 
shirt sleeve was pushed against my skin
it<00:02:49.900> would<00:02:49.990> glue<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.380> shirt<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.800> my<00:02:50.890> skin<00:02:52.170> not

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
it would glue the shirt to my skin not

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.290 
it would glue the shirt to my skin not
the<00:02:53.890> end<00:02:54.100> of<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.280> world<00:02:54.489> this<00:02:54.730> takes<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.239> little

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
the end of the world this takes a little

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.449 
the end of the world this takes a little
bit<00:02:55.450> together<00:02:55.720> get<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.560> pieces<00:02:56.830> separated

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
bit together get the pieces separated

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.759 
bit together get the pieces separated
and<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.390> little<00:02:58.840> bit<00:02:58.930> of<00:02:59.019> pain<00:02:59.230> nothing<00:02:59.500> that

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
and a little bit of pain nothing that

it began anything that's not plastic it

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.449 
it began anything that's not plastic it
won't<00:03:10.570> glue<00:03:11.019> it<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.260> anything<00:03:11.650> else<00:03:11.830> so<00:03:12.340> you're

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
won't glue it to anything else so you're

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.710 
won't glue it to anything else so you're
also<00:03:12.610> worried<00:03:12.850> about<00:03:13.030> your<00:03:13.180> fingers<00:03:13.480> being

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
also worried about your fingers being

also worried about your fingers being
glued<00:03:13.930> together<00:03:14.050> or<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:14.650> can<00:03:14.680> being<00:03:15.370> glued<00:03:15.670> to

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
glued together or you can being glued to

glued together or you can being glued to
the<00:03:15.880> table<00:03:16.090> or<00:03:16.480> anything<00:03:16.720> like<00:03:16.959> that<00:03:17.019> because

the table or anything like that because

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.690 
the table or anything like that because
it<00:03:18.220> only<00:03:18.400> works<00:03:19.000> on<00:03:19.180> plastic<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.780> plastic<00:03:20.700> it

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
it only works on plastic the plastic it

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.520 
it only works on plastic the plastic it
will<00:03:21.940> Mar<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.330> surface<00:03:22.360> of<00:03:22.750> your<00:03:22.810> model<00:03:23.140> so<00:03:23.290> if

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
will Mar the surface of your model so if

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.870 
will Mar the surface of your model so if
you<00:03:23.620> get<00:03:23.769> some<00:03:23.980> of<00:03:24.010> it<00:03:24.190> on<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.550> surface<00:03:24.820> of

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
you get some of it on the surface of

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.960 
you get some of it on the surface of
your<00:03:25.000> model<00:03:25.300> by<00:03:25.330> accident<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:27.100> you<00:03:27.640> catch<00:03:27.850> it

your model by accident and you catch it

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.040 
your model by accident and you catch it
right<00:03:28.120> away<00:03:28.239> you<00:03:28.390> can<00:03:28.630> wipe<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:28.930> down<00:03:28.989> real

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
right away you can wipe it down real

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.690 
right away you can wipe it down real
quick<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.620> hopefully<00:03:29.739> we<00:03:30.070> won't<00:03:30.220> do<00:03:30.370> anything

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
quick and hopefully we won't do anything

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.270 
quick and hopefully we won't do anything
but<00:03:31.570> once<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.140> stars<00:03:32.410> has<00:03:32.620> said<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:34.090> will<00:03:35.280> Mar

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
but once the stars has said it will Mar

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.890 
but once the stars has said it will Mar
those<00:03:36.400> representing<00:03:36.880> model<00:03:37.150> if<00:03:37.209> you<00:03:37.269> try<00:03:37.840> to

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
those representing model if you try to

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.720 
those representing model if you try to
wipe<00:03:38.110> it<00:03:38.200> away<00:03:38.290> or<00:03:38.860> let's<00:03:39.280> see<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.459> got<00:03:39.550> some

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
wipe it away or let's see you got some

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.979 
wipe it away or let's see you got some
on<00:03:39.850> your<00:03:39.940> fingertips<00:03:40.450> when<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:40.630> holding<00:03:40.900> the

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
on your fingertips when you holding the

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.930 
on your fingertips when you holding the
model<00:03:41.260> together<00:03:41.380> didn't<00:03:42.310> realize<00:03:42.580> it<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:42.820> you

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
model together didn't realize it and you

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.580 
model together didn't realize it and you
let<00:03:43.090> go<00:03:43.299> it'll<00:03:43.780> leave<00:03:44.019> a<00:03:44.049> little<00:03:44.260> bit<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.500> a

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
let go it'll leave a little bit of a

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.170 
let go it'll leave a little bit of a
burn<00:03:44.799> mark<00:03:45.010> or<00:03:45.220> your<00:03:45.370> finger<00:03:45.610> print<00:03:45.820> on<00:03:45.940> there

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
burn mark or your finger print on there

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.640 
burn mark or your finger print on there
so<00:03:47.080> just<00:03:47.230> be<00:03:47.350> careful<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:48.070> takes<00:03:48.250> a<00:03:48.400> little<00:03:48.549> bit

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
so just be careful it takes a little bit

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.080 
so just be careful it takes a little bit
more<00:03:50.650> patience<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.519> being<00:03:51.880> a<00:03:51.910> little<00:03:51.970> bit

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
more patience and being a little bit

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.550 
more patience and being a little bit
more<00:03:52.330> careful<00:03:52.780> with<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:53.080> then<00:03:53.260> let's<00:03:53.410> say

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
more careful with it then let's say

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.900 
more careful with it then let's say
superglue<00:03:54.100> which<00:03:54.130> still<00:03:54.459> come<00:03:54.640> all<00:03:54.820> the

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
superglue which still come all the

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.059 
superglue which still come all the
surface<00:03:55.300> but<00:03:55.480> not<00:03:55.540> as

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
surface but not as

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.000 
surface but not as
this<00:03:56.430> thing<00:03:56.670> him<00:03:57.140> but<00:03:58.140> really<00:03:58.409> it's<00:03:58.680> I<00:03:58.890> would

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
this thing him but really it's I would

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.580 
this thing him but really it's I would
say<00:03:59.189> a<00:03:59.219> small<00:03:59.579> drawback<00:03:59.879> for<00:04:00.299> basically<00:04:00.719> from

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
say a small drawback for basically from

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.319 
say a small drawback for basically from
looting<00:04:02.010> plastic<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.519> plastic<00:04:02.549> is<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.060> very

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
looting plastic the plastic is a very

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.009 
looting plastic the plastic is a very
nice<00:04:04.099> secure<00:04:05.099> way<00:04:05.219> to<00:04:05.280> do<00:04:05.459> it<00:04:05.719> he<00:04:06.719> don't<00:04:06.959> have

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
nice secure way to do it he don't have

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.300 
nice secure way to do it he don't have
to<00:04:07.109> worry<00:04:07.319> about<00:04:07.349> it<00:04:07.620> gluing<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:08.040> anything

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
to worry about it gluing to anything

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.699 
to worry about it gluing to anything
else<00:04:08.430> by<00:04:08.579> accident<00:04:09.030> like<00:04:09.749> what<00:04:10.200> super<00:04:10.560> who<00:04:10.650> I

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
else by accident like what super who I

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.979 
else by accident like what super who I
wanted<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.129> glue<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.519> part<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:11.849> wanted<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.870> the

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
wanted to glue the part I wanted to the

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.509 
wanted to glue the part I wanted to the
model<00:04:13.349> but<00:04:13.530> then<00:04:13.650> also<00:04:13.859> got<00:04:14.069> stuck<00:04:14.340> I<00:04:14.489> think

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
model but then also got stuck I think

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.089 
model but then also got stuck I think
then<00:04:15.420> let<00:04:15.629> put<00:04:16.019> it<00:04:16.079> on<00:04:16.229> the<00:04:16.470> on<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.769> table<00:04:16.919> just

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099 
then let put it on the on the table just

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.089 
then let put it on the on the table just
to<00:04:17.519> quickly<00:04:18.269> it<00:04:18.959> also<00:04:19.109> goes<00:04:19.289> up<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.769> table

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
to quickly it also goes up to the table

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.339 
to quickly it also goes up to the table
so<00:04:20.729> luckily<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.209> was<00:04:21.299> able<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.509> salvage<00:04:21.720> a<00:04:21.959> model

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
so luckily I was able to salvage a model

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.879 
so luckily I was able to salvage a model
and<00:04:22.500> without<00:04:22.800> any<00:04:22.979> damage<00:04:23.190> but<00:04:23.610> um<00:04:24.800> just<00:04:25.800> be

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
and without any damage but um just be

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:26.779 
and without any damage but um just be
careful<00:04:26.280> with<00:04:26.490> that

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
careful with that

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.370 
careful with that
but<00:04:27.150> what<00:04:27.300> classically<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:28.110> don't<00:04:28.229> have<00:04:28.320> to

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
but what classically you don't have to

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.520 
but what classically you don't have to
worry<00:04:28.500> about<00:04:28.620> that<00:04:28.860> so<00:04:29.840> that's<00:04:30.840> why<00:04:31.080> I<00:04:31.110> like<00:04:31.320> it

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
worry about that so that's why I like it

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.850 
worry about that so that's why I like it
and<00:04:31.680> as<00:04:31.979> somebody<00:04:32.699> who<00:04:32.910> was<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.530> big<00:04:34.530> fan<00:04:34.830> of

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
and as somebody who was a big fan of

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.950 
and as somebody who was a big fan of
plastic<00:04:35.490> managers<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.900> utilizing<00:04:37.440> them<00:04:38.960> this

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
plastic managers and utilizing them this

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.710 
plastic managers and utilizing them this
gets<00:04:40.229> a<00:04:40.289> lot<00:04:40.410> of<00:04:40.470> use<00:04:41.120> but<00:04:42.120> like<00:04:42.240> I<00:04:42.330> said<00:04:42.389> it's

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
gets a lot of use but like I said it's

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.140 
gets a lot of use but like I said it's
one<00:04:42.930> for<00:04:43.080> plastic<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.650> plastic<00:04:43.680> so<00:04:44.400> plastic

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
one for plastic the plastic so plastic

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.279 
one for plastic the plastic so plastic
the<00:04:45.300> resident<00:04:45.720> or<00:04:45.780> anything<00:04:45.960> else<00:04:46.199> that

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
the resident or anything else that

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:49.999 
the resident or anything else that
anything<00:04:46.650> else<00:04:46.800> you<00:04:47.009> get<00:04:47.160> any<00:04:47.310> superglue<00:04:49.009> so

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
anything else you get any superglue so

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.070 
anything else you get any superglue so
this<00:04:50.190> is<00:04:50.340> great<00:04:50.520> for<00:04:50.699> Games<00:04:51.270> Workshop<00:04:51.750> well

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
this is great for Games Workshop well

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.570 
this is great for Games Workshop well
maybe<00:04:52.229> the<00:04:52.380> plastic<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:52.949> privacy<00:04:53.280> uh<00:04:53.310> press

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
maybe the plastic and privacy uh press

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.330 
maybe the plastic and privacy uh press
or<00:04:53.940> anything<00:04:54.539> that's<00:04:54.930> plastic<00:04:55.110> anything<00:04:56.070> for

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
or anything that's plastic anything for

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.670 
or anything that's plastic anything for
real<00:04:56.490> for<00:04:56.699> example<00:04:57.090> this<00:04:57.389> won't<00:04:57.630> work<00:04:57.750> on<00:04:57.930> so

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
real for example this won't work on so

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.620 
real for example this won't work on so
just<00:04:59.610> some<00:04:59.759> food<00:04:59.970> for<00:05:00.000> thought<00:05:00.180> I<00:05:00.360> guess

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
just some food for thought I guess

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.570 
just some food for thought I guess
thought<00:05:01.409> I'd<00:05:01.500> talk<00:05:01.680> about<00:05:01.740> a<00:05:01.919> little<00:05:02.099> bit<00:05:02.250> this

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
thought I'd talk about a little bit this

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.060 
thought I'd talk about a little bit this
is<00:05:02.639> my<00:05:03.060> last<00:05:03.930> liquid<00:05:04.380> cement<00:05:04.500> for<00:05:04.740> plastic

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
is my last liquid cement for plastic

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.600 
is my last liquid cement for plastic
models<00:05:05.400> that<00:05:05.520> I<00:05:05.669> utilize<00:05:06.090> from<00:05:06.449> model<00:05:06.840> master

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
models that I utilize from model master

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.580 
models that I utilize from model master
a<00:05:08.610> my<00:05:09.090> super<00:05:09.449> glue<00:05:09.599> Oh<00:05:09.630> like<00:05:09.840> I<00:05:09.930> think<00:05:10.349> I<00:05:10.409> said

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
a my super glue Oh like I think I said

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.420 
a my super glue Oh like I think I said
before<00:05:10.919> is<00:05:11.190> zap<00:05:11.789> again<00:05:12.060> so<00:05:13.250> that's<00:05:14.250> pretty

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
before is zap again so that's pretty

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.899 
before is zap again so that's pretty
much<00:05:14.550> it

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909 
much it

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:16.610 
much it
hopefully<00:05:15.509> that<00:05:15.599> was<00:05:15.720> useful<00:05:15.900> to<00:05:16.320> somebody

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
hopefully that was useful to somebody

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.650 
hopefully that was useful to somebody
and<00:05:17.009> until<00:05:17.940> next<00:05:18.060> time<00:05:18.349> take<00:05:19.349> it<00:05:19.500> easy
