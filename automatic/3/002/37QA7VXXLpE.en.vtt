want to reach into something to cut with
it<00:00:28.560> but<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:28.980> start<00:00:29.250> getting<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.699> smaller

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
it but we start getting with smaller

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.600 
it but we start getting with smaller
wood<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:31.320> wants<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.710> whip<00:00:31.920> back<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.369> forth

wood it wants to whip back and forth

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.580 
wood it wants to whip back and forth
with<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> chain<00:00:33.329> action<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.140> then<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.320> might

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
with the chain action and then you might

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.160 
with the chain action and then you might
as<00:00:34.710> well<00:00:34.770> just<00:00:34.980> use<00:00:35.190> clippers<00:00:35.640> or<00:00:35.670> loppers<00:00:36.300> but

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
as well just use clippers or loppers but

as well just use clippers or loppers but
this<00:00:37.440> type<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.739> cutting<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.399> optimum<00:00:39.059> for<00:00:39.300> a

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
this type of cutting is optimum for a

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.979 
this type of cutting is optimum for a

goes<00:01:13.799> now<00:01:14.490> with<00:01:14.670> electric<00:01:15.180> saws<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:16.200> don't

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
goes now with electric saws you don't

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.070 
goes now with electric saws you don't
have<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.670> same<00:01:17.970> power<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.780> get<00:01:18.900> out<00:01:19.049> of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
have the same power that you get out of

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.249 
have the same power that you get out of
the<00:01:19.229> gas<00:01:19.439> saw<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.790> other<00:01:20.909> thing<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
green work saw is more or less David

green work saw is more or less David
Acuras<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.689> Oregon<00:01:25.080> saw<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
Acuras the Oregon saw because of the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.700 
Acuras the Oregon saw because of the
positioning<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.299> safety<00:01:28.140> device<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.650> a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
positioning of the safety device and a

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.399 
positioning of the safety device and a
trigger<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.159> kind<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.400> right-hand<00:01:29.820> use<00:01:30.030> only

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
trigger it's kind of right-hand use only

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.109 
trigger it's kind of right-hand use only
but<00:01:31.409> using<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.979> chainsaw<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.670> two-hand

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
but using a chainsaw is a two-hand

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.370 
but using a chainsaw is a two-hand
operation<00:01:33.960> no<00:01:34.079> matter<00:01:34.259> what<00:01:35.720> so<00:01:36.720> with<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
operation no matter what so with the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.910 
operation no matter what so with the
electric<00:01:37.799> saw<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.880> need<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.750> hold<00:01:40.350> off<00:01:40.619> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
electric saw you need to hold off and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.550 
electric saw you need to hold off and
get<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> same<00:01:42.030> going<00:01:42.329> before<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.899> make<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> cut

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
get the same going before you make a cut

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.530 
get the same going before you make a cut
and<00:01:43.770> then<00:01:44.640> set<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.509> course

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
and then set it on and of course

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.359 
and then set it on and of course
whenever<00:01:46.170> we're<00:01:46.500> cutting<00:01:46.799> something<00:01:47.189> like

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
whenever we're cutting something like

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.670 
whenever we're cutting something like
this<00:01:47.610> again<00:01:48.600> if<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.020> lot<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.350> surplus

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
this again if you have a lot of surplus

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.760 
this again if you have a lot of surplus
power<00:01:50.100> with<00:01:50.670> gas<00:01:51.299> saw<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.140> do<00:01:52.290> cut<00:01:52.530> like

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
power with gas saw you can do cut like

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.310 
power with gas saw you can do cut like
this<00:01:53.040> with<00:01:53.340> these<00:01:53.520> size<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.689> really<00:01:55.049> want<00:01:55.259> to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
this with these size you really want to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.230 
this with these size you really want to
be<00:01:55.439> close<00:01:55.770> even<00:01:56.189> though<00:01:56.430> there's<00:01:56.640> no<00:01:56.790> bucking

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
be close even though there's no bucking

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.359 
be close even though there's no bucking
barb<00:01:57.509> we<00:01:57.840> want<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.170> brace<00:01:58.469> against<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.189> body

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
barb we want to brace against the body

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.270 
barb we want to brace against the body
the<00:01:59.700> saw<00:01:59.960> one<00:02:00.960> possible<00:02:01.530> without<00:02:01.710> beating<00:02:02.189> it

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the saw one possible without beating it

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.700 
the saw one possible without beating it
off<00:02:02.399> too<00:02:02.640> badly<00:02:02.909> we<00:02:03.450> run<00:02:03.630> into<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.869> problem<00:02:03.990> just

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
off too badly we run into a problem just

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.490 
off too badly we run into a problem just
let<00:02:05.130> up<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> trigger<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.119> that's<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
let up on a trigger and that's that the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.750 
let up on a trigger and that's that the
Oregon<00:02:07.829> saw<00:02:08.160> also<00:02:08.759> has<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.450> chain<00:02:09.810> break<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.760> made

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
Oregon saw also has a chain break I made

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.690 
Oregon saw also has a chain break I made
some<00:02:12.030> OSHA<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.629> safety<00:02:13.020> standards

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
some OSHA and safety standards

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.979 
some OSHA and safety standards
it's<00:02:13.879> a<00:02:13.910> little<00:02:14.090> bit<00:02:14.209> more<00:02:14.360> relevant<00:02:14.599> to

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
it's a little bit more relevant to

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.380 
it's a little bit more relevant to
gas-powered<00:02:15.860> saws<00:02:16.250> which<00:02:16.550> can<00:02:16.790> stay<00:02:17.090> running

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
gas-powered saws which can stay running

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.180 
gas-powered saws which can stay running
when<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.720> let<00:02:17.959> up<00:02:18.050> on<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.230> trigger<00:02:18.560> as<00:02:18.830> opposed

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
when you let up on a trigger as opposed

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.460 
when you let up on a trigger as opposed
to<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.489> electric<00:02:19.849> saw<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.900> we'll<00:02:21.319> make<00:02:21.410> a

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
to the electric saw so we'll make a

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:39.160 
to the electric saw so we'll make a
couple<00:02:21.739> of<00:02:21.950> cuts<00:02:22.190> here<00:02:22.459> or<00:02:22.610> show<00:02:22.819> how

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.130 

or<00:02:39.800> you<00:02:40.040> see<00:02:40.220> it's<00:02:40.730> not<00:02:40.910> as<00:02:41.150> fast<00:02:41.600> or<00:02:41.810> powerful

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
or you see it's not as fast or powerful

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.550 
or you see it's not as fast or powerful
as<00:02:42.530> a<00:02:42.560> gas<00:02:42.830> saw<00:02:43.190> but<00:02:43.490> it's<00:02:43.610> pretty<00:02:44.000> good<00:02:44.560> this

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
as a gas saw but it's pretty good this

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.190 
as a gas saw but it's pretty good this
is<00:02:45.770> hard<00:02:46.040> Applewood<00:02:46.760> when<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.720> press<00:02:48.020> him

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
is hard Applewood when I press him

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.900 
is hard Applewood when I press him
really<00:02:48.410> hard<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.890> will<00:02:49.010> slow<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.430> saw<00:02:49.640> down

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
really hard it will slow the saw down

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.660 
really hard it will slow the saw down
but<00:02:50.209> remember<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:51.350> is<00:02:51.620> a<00:02:51.650> saw<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.400> has<00:02:52.640> a

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
but remember this is a saw that has a

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.210 
but remember this is a saw that has a
lot<00:02:53.060> of<00:02:53.090> extra<00:02:53.420> teeth<00:02:53.810> on<00:02:54.080> a<00:02:54.110> chain<00:02:54.560> compared

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
lot of extra teeth on a chain compared

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.430 
lot of extra teeth on a chain compared
to<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.430> green<00:02:55.580> work<00:02:55.790> saw<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.840> next<00:02:57.140> we're

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
to the green work saw so next we're

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.900 
to the green work saw so next we're
going<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.620> use<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:57.890> green<00:02:58.100> works<00:02:58.340> off<00:02:58.610> for<00:02:58.850> the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
going to use the green works off for the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.860 
going to use the green works off for the
final<00:02:59.270> few<00:02:59.450> cuts<00:03:01.360> it's<00:03:02.360> a<00:03:02.480> little<00:03:02.750> more

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
final few cuts it's a little more

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.570 
final few cuts it's a little more
ambidextrous<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:03.830> I<00:03:03.860> can<00:03:04.100> use<00:03:04.250> this<00:03:04.400> one

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
ambidextrous so I can use this one

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.630 
ambidextrous so I can use this one
left-handed<00:03:05.390> it's<00:03:06.140> got<00:03:06.800> a<00:03:06.830> shorter<00:03:07.220> chain<00:03:07.489> but

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
left-handed it's got a shorter chain but

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.490 
left-handed it's got a shorter chain but
again<00:03:07.880> we're<00:03:08.540> mainly<00:03:08.870> just<00:03:09.050> using<00:03:09.350> this

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
again we're mainly just using this

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.320 
again we're mainly just using this
section<00:03:09.860> of<00:03:09.980> chain<00:03:10.250> we're<00:03:10.489> using<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:10.790> length<00:03:11.090> of

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
section of chain we're using a length of

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.479 
section of chain we're using a length of
the<00:03:11.390> chain<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:12.739> make<00:03:12.890> sure<00:03:13.070> that<00:03:13.310> we've<00:03:13.459> got

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
the chain to make sure that we've got

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.610 
the chain to make sure that we've got
fresh<00:03:14.739> fresh<00:03:15.739> cutting<00:03:16.160> blades<00:03:17.230> fresh<00:03:18.230> cutting

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
fresh fresh cutting blades fresh cutting

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.520 
fresh fresh cutting blades fresh cutting
links<00:03:19.070> on<00:03:19.220> our<00:03:19.250> wood<00:03:19.580> as<00:03:19.760> we<00:03:19.910> go<00:03:20.030> through<00:03:20.530> but

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
links on our wood as we go through but

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.350 
links on our wood as we go through but
this<00:03:21.650> is<00:03:21.800> about<00:03:21.980> optimum<00:03:22.610> for<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.910> size<00:03:23.150> of

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
this is about optimum for the size of

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.830 
this is about optimum for the size of
chainsaw<00:03:24.190> so<00:03:25.190> again<00:03:25.519> we<00:03:25.700> get<00:03:25.820> it<00:03:25.970> going<00:03:26.180> no

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
chainsaw so again we get it going no

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.840 
chainsaw so again we get it going no
need<00:03:27.050> for<00:03:27.410> hearing<00:03:27.890> protection<00:03:28.280> it's<00:03:28.700> just

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
need for hearing protection it's just

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.449 
need for hearing protection it's just
not<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.030> very<00:03:29.239> loud<00:03:29.450> saw<00:03:29.830> we<00:03:30.830> get<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.130> going

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
not a very loud saw we get it going

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.370 
not a very loud saw we get it going
before<00:03:31.610> we<00:03:31.970> contact<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.630> material<00:03:33.080> make<00:03:33.230> sure

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
before we contact a material make sure

00:03:33.380 --> 00:04:01.920 
before we contact a material make sure
the<00:03:33.500> saw<00:03:33.709> gets<00:03:34.010> up<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.280> full<00:03:34.489> speed

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.479 

so<00:04:02.930> you<00:04:03.140> can<00:04:03.260> see<00:04:03.439> two<00:04:03.680> cuts<00:04:03.980> with<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.250> green

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
so you can see two cuts with the green

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.119 
so you can see two cuts with the green
work<00:04:04.700> saw<00:04:05.000> it's<00:04:05.780> slower<00:04:06.260> because<00:04:06.920> there's

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
work saw it's slower because there's

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.740 
work saw it's slower because there's
less<00:04:07.310> cutting<00:04:07.640> teeth<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.269> I<00:04:08.329> think<00:04:08.629> the

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
less cutting teeth and I think the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.319 
less cutting teeth and I think the
motors<00:04:09.079> a<00:04:09.110> little<00:04:09.439> bit<00:04:09.560> less<00:04:09.769> powerful<00:04:10.189> too

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
motors a little bit less powerful too

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.240 
motors a little bit less powerful too
I've<00:04:11.750> been<00:04:11.959> told<00:04:12.140> by<00:04:12.319> some<00:04:12.500> other<00:04:12.650> people<00:04:13.099> that

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
I've been told by some other people that

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.039 
I've been told by some other people that
I<00:04:13.340> should<00:04:13.549> expect<00:04:13.849> more<00:04:13.970> battery<00:04:14.480> life<00:04:14.599> out<00:04:14.989> of

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
I should expect more battery life out of
