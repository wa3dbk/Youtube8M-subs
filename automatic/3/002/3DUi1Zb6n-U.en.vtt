00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:29.869

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.629

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.230
 no mate does not fit skeptical 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.899

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.760

 only with shaders because 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.250
 shaders seems to me more realistic 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.080
 and wait soon tuturial as arranged 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.330
 shaders so that you are allowed from to 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:33.270
 explain 4 or 3 don't remember you need 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.460
 to have a very great microphone just 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.800
 excellent so that firstly there wasnâ€™t 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.360
 audible clicks and 2 that you do not 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.610

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.560
