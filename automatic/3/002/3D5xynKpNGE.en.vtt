 this occasion is ours in a new 

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:13.969
 tap out that idea which is called 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:16.670

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.330
 do that when they make us a new one they 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.490
 make us an incoming call 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.990
 the tweet takes care of when we owe it 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.029
 answer if we are not going to answer 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.980

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.020
 answer here is the option 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.460
 that goes out to sing the fans and 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.010
 sends the call directly to us 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.960
 speaker that's good that's a good 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.180
 option so that in case any 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.100
 we are driving since phone 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.690
 we will have to place ourselves in our 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:51.739
 ear because 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:53.839
 to pick up the call so I'm going to 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.269
 make a demonstration of what the 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.519
 pri in this case to call this other 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.930
 Once he's here to teach them 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.549

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.840
 answer from this option the pressure and 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.359

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.909
 as you can see here and there 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.590
