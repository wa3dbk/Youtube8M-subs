00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.499
 hello dear minecraft and sincerely 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:16.850
 Welcome to a video of that 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.530
 107 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.480
 Today it's about a bug again 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.060
 pack around the backplane alpha 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.610
 test with alpha test is it possible for you 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.800
 a box to create it, so to speak 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.050
 only virtual exists in this box 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.400
 can you store a virtual items 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.079
 how that works I show you 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.820
 Now first you will command the first 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.410
 if you could write to them 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.270
 and then these things arise 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.010
 virtually fixed and now we pack 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.900
 just like that a few items purely 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.810
 Whatever we want we can do that 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.880
 do it the way it does now 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.560
 we press again sp and the box too 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.940
 say we're running a bit now 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.160
 because I am through the world 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.850
 our inventory was full and we traveled 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.800
 make again / could / west then becomes 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.360
 me again all them the peace of mind 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.100
 is when we die the whole thing 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.810
 You can get it but at the config 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.340
 also set up what I completely 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.979
 practically find the plug-in might 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.479
 even make it as a vip feature so to speak 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.280
 like a beast on your server 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.780
 so that the value can act here 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.850
 Whatever it is, but one more 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.680
 more coming from this plugin and 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.270
 Although this human called yes this 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.310
 Comment is a virtual one 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.380
 crafting table and there you can 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.970
 whatever forces you, whatever 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.950
 Now from the materials I am here 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.020
 I just think I can do it 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.680
 not so much anywhere but here 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:42.290
 times something decent might 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.820
 Sticks and maybe stone 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.960
 cobblestone 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.760
 and then we could do it now 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.290
 For example, we do a shovel 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.030
 no inmate now automatically 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.900
 table is similar to automatic we 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.000
 just have a strong one now 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.260
 klippel users can easily do this 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.270
 make a shovel and then quite normal 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.470
 further down here so that 's it 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.410
 already what this plugin allows you 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:05.390
 the now much fun with the installation 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.440
 and configuration of the plugin like this and 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.119
 Here we are already at the real 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.280
 Lots of installation that plugins 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.620
 alpha test arrived we load this 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.450
 whole again press on down twice 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.020
 as we have it from the cheek of the page 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.180
 are used to the alpha and 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.670
 then we move into our plugins 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.100
 folder the alpha jazz points on the 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.020
 Here is the start once the starts 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.600
 server 7 bad hope that no 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.060
 error message come this project 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.190
 prepared we are waiting for the 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.170
 configurations folder why now always 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.780
 Preparing the way makes no idea 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.040
 but we do not care 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.500
 disturb and here we already have the 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.980
 config folder alpha test and then have 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.850
 We 7 inch then it will be for every user 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.310
 saved if someone stops then 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.140
 he has written himself in the 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.880
 crates in it really saved 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.959
 and then we'll take a quick look 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.980
 into the conflict points jmr yes and here 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.910
 we can do a few more things 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.120
 to adjust 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.890
 autosave how often automatically say that 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.340
 what is stored in the box is stored 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.470
 become 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.319
 is this is all passed in the minutes of 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.900
 say every ten minutes each 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.760
 Change in the boxes, so to speak 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.660
 this file we saw it 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.280
 taken over and stored so to speak 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.440
 silent autosave is actually too 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.629
 not important anymore means only if 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.239
 the box, so to speak, automatically something 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.650
 stores whether that now displayed in the chat 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.680
 should be or not as a small 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.690
 message be miserable silence autosave 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.670
 so to speak and he immediately that is what it means 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.989
 is displayed a bit difficult too 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.989
 you have to understand that first 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.549
 rethinking a bit is quite ok as well 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.260
 that is and now you can still 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.750
 to adjust 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:48.079
 are you what to do 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.140
 the player appreciates and dev means that 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.760
 So if a player dies then it will 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.319
 his box so what in this box 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.150
 which we have seen saved 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.440
 deleted but that's not us 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.060
 Just leave it that way 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.489
 You can stay here for a short time 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.890
 For example, if you buy and then 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.989
 the alpha jazz keep on of the thermal 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.810
 you also do not lose the things 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:12.220
 that was in the box so we do 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.079
 continue to do something with the last one 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.389
 so if you die then the 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.250
 Things in the box were on the 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.260
 Soil dry yes or no 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.669
 can you choose just that ? 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.200
 it was already on this bug plates 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.310
 I have already seen the inner part 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.139
 thank me in any case that he 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.970
 bye says bye bye 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.970
