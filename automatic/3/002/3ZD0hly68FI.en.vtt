 Hello today, I'll tell you how 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.030
 to simulate such a dress is paid 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.540
 also from knitted fabric 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.259
 which is probably soft cushy and 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:25.369
 very well she will serve for mummies 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:29.730
 future that is for pregnant 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:33.360
 such a dress cutting line to twist 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.820
 that is, if there is no chest under the gr fishing rod but 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.420
 if there is knitwear that tuck is not needed 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.910
 and if suddenly you will do the usual 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.269
 some woolen cloth then of course 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.089
 normal recess need to close when 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:52.559
 modeling and loading water 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:56.989
 open here there is a little sleeve 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:01.530
 on the cuff is not very wide sleeve and 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.399

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:38.190
 baking of your size product length 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.120

 at a distance from the waist line 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:03:02.609
 10 centimeters like this will cut 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.250

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.790
 Tuva this twig close it and she caresses 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:15.840
 go right here in the side and so on 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.840
 shift a little and cut like that 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.980
 there will be such an oval without 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.650
 tuck 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.400
 but if you will do without tuck and 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.639
 cut off by overpriced 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.099
 i.e. higher waistline 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:35.069
 and if you do spinochku 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:39.599
 one-piece then there are no problems 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:46.249
 so boy extremely discounts we will do 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:49.069
 Pattern on the shelf here it is with us 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:53.189
 line match 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:55.109
 the center of the back center with the center of the shelf 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.780
 necessarily first 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:01.349
 cut and the back is then applied 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.389
 on a piece of paper to make a pattern 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.540
 first and then model 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:08.040
 and first of all you set aside for 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.939
 free fit 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:16.169
 in the country side slices on the shelf then 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:24.660
 there is now if you can see here it is spinochka 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:25.470
 here and seam at spin glasses shell 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.639

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.979
 two inches free fit 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:35.669
 then you climb the tuck solution 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:40.280
 from the armhole line to the tuck solution from 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:44.580
 waistline you climb the length 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.460
 period before it adata here at this metochka 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.110

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.680
 standards it is 42 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:56.699
 so we have 37 on the wall 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.820
 ahu shelves 42 just at a distance of 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:03.180
 two days of twigs and so measure

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.970
 new constructive line to this 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.280
 paid 10 centimeters as well as on 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.490
 a shelf if you're in another model 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.860
 because spinochku and 10 centimeters from the line 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:21.600
 waist you lay on the shelf 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.380
 answer knock said 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:29.940
 and so a new line from you which will be 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:33.389
 clipped here you will add a centimeter 4 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.669
 in the center to do the assembly 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:39.770
 Here it is very beautiful drape 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:48.169
 because the knitwear to the soft and 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:48.169
 sits well here we cut off the line 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:56.400
 which should be and add to the center 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:01.169
 Now I bring this cut 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.360
 to the center to do the assembly 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.729
 assembly can also at its discretion 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.910
 do maybe more if you 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:12.389
 You will wear a baby to dress 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:17.720
 by freer and if you just dress for 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:24.090
 before you feast that way this center 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:28.919
 shelves and we added 4 to the center 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:29.539
 centimeter centered and we'll be here 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:34.860
 do 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:38.850
 assembly 2 is with a thread with a 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:41.720
 stitching which will pull wider 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.900
 her to plant here in this 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.860
 here 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:50.640
 we close this dart but in this 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:53.400
 the place it will open with us now I 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:57.390

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:08.600
 water solution tucks that are on the chest 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:11.650

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:28.910
 No, there is only an assembly 

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:31.160
 on the skirt and here we either have a trace 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:34.340
 knitted dress do not need to do 

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:37.490
 baking or if a dress with such have 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:40.070
 another fabric structure then tuck under 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:44.900
 the baby needs to be screwed and then 

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:50.680
 do the assembly and then just the stream 

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:55.600
 you will do now let's say I 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:59.150
