for<00:00:51.720> the<00:00:51.809> original<00:00:52.170> Game<00:00:52.409> Boy<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.890> it's

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
for the original Game Boy and it's

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.430 
for the original Game Boy and it's
probably<00:00:53.760> fair<00:00:53.970> to<00:00:54.000> point<00:00:54.360> out<00:00:54.540> that<00:00:54.780> this

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
probably fair to point out that this

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.160 
probably fair to point out that this
thing<00:00:55.500> came<00:00:55.890> out<00:00:56.040> in<00:00:56.220> 1991<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.420> whole<00:00:57.570> idea<00:00:58.050> of

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
thing came out in 1991 the whole idea of

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.469 
thing came out in 1991 the whole idea of
a<00:00:58.440> handheld<00:00:58.920> gaming<00:00:59.190> platform<00:00:59.850> was<00:01:00.300> still

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
a handheld gaming platform was still

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:02.960 
a handheld gaming platform was still
kind<00:01:00.900> of<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.050> new<00:01:01.170> thing<00:01:01.409> so<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:02.430> Solley<00:01:02.670> games

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
kind of a new thing so that Solley games

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.790 
kind of a new thing so that Solley games
were<00:01:03.150> really<00:01:03.420> pushing<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> gameboy

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
were really pushing the gameboy

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.600 
were really pushing the gameboy
then<00:01:05.400> again<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:06.330> had<00:01:06.450> Metro<00:01:06.840> 2<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.380> 1991<00:01:08.250> so

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
then again you had Metro 2 in 1991 so

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.930 
then again you had Metro 2 in 1991 so
it's<00:01:09.600> some<00:01:09.840> games<00:01:10.080> work<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.560> point<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.190> I<00:01:11.490> can

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
it's some games work but point is I can

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.760 
it's some games work but point is I can
understand<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.630> game<00:01:12.840> being<00:01:13.080> limited<00:01:13.350> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
understand this game being limited and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.620 
understand this game being limited and
simple<00:01:14.220> that's<00:01:14.610> not<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:14.909> games<00:01:15.180> problem

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
simple that's not this games problem

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.480 
simple that's not this games problem
though<00:01:15.810> now<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.350> games<00:01:16.590> problem<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.280> that

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
though now this games problem is that

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:38.210 
though now this games problem is that
it's<00:01:17.820> limited<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.510> simple<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.170> crappy

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.460 

so<00:01:39.220> obviously<00:01:39.729> it's<00:01:39.970> two<00:01:40.180> games<00:01:40.450> in<00:01:40.659> one<00:01:40.689> got

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
so obviously it's two games in one got

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.920 
so obviously it's two games in one got
baseball<00:01:41.799> and<00:01:42.310> football<00:01:42.340> on<00:01:42.970> one<00:01:43.479> Game<00:01:43.750> Boy

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
cartridge and it's actually a pretty

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.300 
cartridge and it's actually a pretty
cool<00:01:45.789> idea<00:01:45.939> for<00:01:46.179> 1991<00:01:47.049> on<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.619> Lou<00:01:47.679> of<00:01:47.830> a<00:01:47.920> menu

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
like either these games were designed by

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
a football game too so they had to

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.509 
a football game too so they had to
squeeze<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.390> in<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.780> like<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.290> week<00:02:32.739> because<00:02:33.370> as

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
squeeze it in and like a week because as

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.340

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
worse so uh let's let's compare and

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.650 
worse so uh let's let's compare and
contrast<00:02:38.590> here<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.489> start<00:02:39.760> baseball<00:02:40.299> they

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
contrast here you start baseball they

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.420 
contrast here you start baseball they
actually<00:02:41.049> get<00:02:41.170> some<00:02:41.350> teams<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.739> choose<00:02:41.950> from

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
actually get some teams to choose from

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.870 
actually get some teams to choose from
not<00:02:42.609> real<00:02:42.910> teams<00:02:43.209> but<00:02:43.690> real<00:02:44.590> places<00:02:45.190> so<00:02:45.760> that's

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
not real teams but real places so that's

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.949 
not real teams but real places so that's
not<00:02:46.359> bad

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
not bad

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.800 
not bad
but<00:02:47.260> in<00:02:47.590> football<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.489> start<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.090> game<00:02:49.120> it

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
but in football you start the game it

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.390 
but in football you start the game it
goes<00:02:49.989> straight<00:02:50.109> to<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.470> coin<00:02:50.650> toss<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.340> then

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
goes straight to the coin toss and then

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.979 
goes straight to the coin toss and then
the<00:02:51.489> game<00:02:51.640> tells<00:02:51.880> you<00:02:52.060> oh<00:02:52.209> you're<00:02:52.660> gonna<00:02:52.810> be

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
the game tells you oh you're gonna be

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.979 
the game tells you oh you're gonna be
east<00:02:53.319> and<00:02:53.799> you're<00:02:54.340> up<00:02:54.430> against<00:02:54.819> West<00:02:55.150> like

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
east and you're up against West like

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:05.199 
east and you're up against West like
it's<00:02:56.560> early<00:02:57.220> 90s<00:02:57.880> hip-hop<00:02:58.030> Wars

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.390 

anyway<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.330> game<00:03:06.480> starts<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.349> in<00:03:07.890> baseball

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
anyway the game starts and in baseball

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.069 
anyway the game starts and in baseball
you<00:03:08.519> actually<00:03:08.819> have<00:03:08.970> like<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.420> nice-looking

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
you actually have like a nice-looking

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.660 
you actually have like a nice-looking
interface<00:03:10.590> when<00:03:10.980> you're<00:03:11.099> hitting<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.549> have

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
interface when you're hitting you have

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.130 
interface when you're hitting you have
the<00:03:11.760> classic<00:03:12.269> view<00:03:12.480> from<00:03:12.780> behind<00:03:12.959> the

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
the classic view from behind the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.000 
the classic view from behind the
batter's<00:03:13.470> box

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
batter's box

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.319 
batter's box
and<00:03:14.250> when<00:03:14.340> you're<00:03:14.459> on<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.610> mound<00:03:14.879> you<00:03:15.090> get<00:03:15.180> the

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
and when you're on the mound you get the

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.750 
and when you're on the mound you get the
the<00:03:15.629> bases-loaded<00:03:16.140> view<00:03:16.739> not<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:17.549> plays

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
the bases-loaded view not that it plays

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.460 
the bases-loaded view not that it plays
well<00:03:18.060> because<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.510> doesn't<00:03:18.720> but<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.319> game

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
well because it doesn't but the game

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.600 
well because it doesn't but the game
actually<00:03:19.650> looks<00:03:20.069> pretty<00:03:20.189> good

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
actually looks pretty good

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.580 
actually looks pretty good
especially<00:03:21.180> for<00:03:21.299> a<00:03:21.360> game<00:03:21.540> boy<00:03:21.750> game<00:03:22.019> but<00:03:22.470> with

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
especially for a game boy game but with

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.220 
especially for a game boy game but with
football<00:03:23.040> it's<00:03:23.909> suddenly<00:03:24.239> it's<00:03:24.690> suddenly<00:03:25.110> the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
football it's suddenly it's suddenly the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.940 
football it's suddenly it's suddenly the
Atari<00:03:25.560> 2600<00:03:26.220> lemonis

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.820 

so<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.310> aesthetic<00:03:32.850> difference<00:03:33.270> is<00:03:33.450> just<00:03:33.740> huge

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
so the aesthetic difference is just huge

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.920 
so the aesthetic difference is just huge
like<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:35.340> said<00:03:35.400> either<00:03:35.790> football<00:03:36.360> was<00:03:36.540> crunched

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
like I said either football was crunched

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.780 
like I said either football was crunched
for<00:03:36.990> time<00:03:37.140> or<00:03:37.620> there<00:03:37.980> are<00:03:38.040> actually<00:03:38.340> two<00:03:38.520> teams

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
for time or there are actually two teams

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.340 
for time or there are actually two teams
working<00:03:39.060> on<00:03:39.240> this<00:03:39.390> thing<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.600> that's<00:03:40.170> the

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
working on this thing that that's the

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.560 
working on this thing that that's the
only<00:03:40.560> possible<00:03:40.980> explanation<00:03:41.150> but<00:03:42.150> in<00:03:42.360> terms

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
only possible explanation but in terms

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.230 
only possible explanation but in terms
of<00:03:42.720> gameplay<00:03:42.960> while<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:44.040> buttered<00:03:44.880> butter

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
of gameplay while the buttered butter

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.690 
of gameplay while the buttered butter
spreads<00:03:45.720> across<00:03:45.840> both<00:03:46.350> of<00:03:46.530> them<00:03:46.650> evenly<00:03:47.310> in

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
spreads across both of them evenly in

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.400 
spreads across both of them evenly in
baseball<00:03:48.210> the<00:03:48.360> game<00:03:48.480> gets<00:03:48.690> so<00:03:48.840> choppy<00:03:49.170> when

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
baseball the game gets so choppy when

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.600 
baseball the game gets so choppy when
you're<00:03:49.530> trying<00:03:49.740> to<00:03:49.830> hit<00:03:50.010> it's<00:03:50.460> just

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
you're trying to hit it's just

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.250 
you're trying to hit it's just
impossible<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:51.270> time<00:03:51.450> your<00:03:51.630> swing<00:03:51.840> when

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
impossible to time your swing when

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.380 
impossible to time your swing when
you're<00:03:52.440> in<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.590> field<00:03:52.770> you<00:03:53.090> can't<00:03:54.090> see<00:03:54.240> your

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
you're in the field you can't see your

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.420 
you're in the field you can't see your
outfielders<00:03:54.930> on<00:03:55.170> fly<00:03:55.410> balls<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:56.100> never<00:03:56.250> know

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
outfielders on fly balls you never know

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.010 
outfielders on fly balls you never know
who<00:03:56.700> you're<00:03:56.880> actually<00:03:57.030> controlling<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:57.990> the

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
who you're actually controlling and the

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.170 
who you're actually controlling and the
AI<00:03:58.800> is<00:03:58.980> awful<00:03:59.370> you<00:03:59.550> try<00:03:59.730> to<00:03:59.790> turn<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.000> double

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
AI is awful you try to turn a double

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.570 
AI is awful you try to turn a double
play<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:00.840> either<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.590> shortstops<00:04:02.130> not<00:04:02.370> even

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
play and either the shortstops not even

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.220 
play and either the shortstops not even
standing<00:04:02.880> on<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.120> bag<00:04:03.330> for<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.990> first

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
standing on the bag for the first

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.910 
standing on the bag for the first
baseman<00:04:04.770> just<00:04:04.980> what<00:04:05.520> whoops<00:04:06.090> my<00:04:06.870> bad<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:07.500> get

baseman just what whoops my bad I get

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.790 
baseman just what whoops my bad I get

bo Jackson

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.410 
bo Jackson
but<00:04:15.570> then<00:04:15.720> again<00:04:15.870> football<00:04:16.680> like<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.700> said<00:04:17.940> even

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
but then again football like I said even

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.630 
but then again football like I said even
worse<00:04:18.870> running<00:04:19.590> plays<00:04:19.830> are<00:04:20.070> just<00:04:20.220> completely

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
worse running plays are just completely

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.130 
worse running plays are just completely
pointless<00:04:20.940> so<00:04:21.540> you're<00:04:21.660> always<00:04:21.780> trying<00:04:21.870> to

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
pointless so you're always trying to

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.590 
pointless so you're always trying to
pass<00:04:22.350> then<00:04:23.010> like<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.910> can't<00:04:24.120> even<00:04:24.180> see<00:04:24.480> your

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
pass then like you can't even see your

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.110 
pass then like you can't even see your
receivers<00:04:25.169> so<00:04:25.590> literally<00:04:26.340> you<00:04:26.669> have<00:04:26.790> to<00:04:26.910> just

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
receivers so literally you have to just

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.360 
receivers so literally you have to just
guess<00:04:27.360> who<00:04:27.600> might<00:04:27.870> be<00:04:28.080> open<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:28.560> hope<00:04:29.010> for<00:04:29.280> the

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
guess who might be open and hope for the

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.400 
guess who might be open and hope for the
best<00:04:29.550> then<00:04:30.390> again<00:04:30.600> it's<00:04:30.780> kind<00:04:30.960> of<00:04:30.990> fun<00:04:31.200> it's

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
best then again it's kind of fun it's

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.770 
best then again it's kind of fun it's
like<00:04:31.530> you<00:04:31.980> throw<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.340> ball<00:04:32.520> is<00:04:33.240> it<00:04:33.419> gonna<00:04:33.570> be

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
like you throw the ball is it gonna be
