00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.340
 100 thousand for me always was 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.669
 starting point from the starting field and the point of arrival 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:13.299
 it has an almost biological relationship with December action 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.299
 However 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:19.419
 the moment 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.960
 with Diego the seamstress was winning 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.640
 this space as much has been gaining 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.869
 the family in a 'bomb' in her 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:28.860
 I will not create 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.109
 on body 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.090
 it's the line itself 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.520
 who has even tried to intercept our natural satellite 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.390
 if he died on Wednesday 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.960
 same job 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.960
 the right to be equal to the outside 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.480
 not 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.380
 the policy design 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.060
 twenty take course in space 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.470
 I understand 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.080
 is the path of the line in the space of the paper 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.420
 in space the course of the line in the easy process 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.420
 O 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.610
 I started suspending with Royce the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.750
 the visibility 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.770
 the space 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.770
 the deputy minister of the force affirmed his work 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.409
 I was building 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.380
 space situations 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.050
 this means 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.950
 twenty-two thousand meters of line 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.950
 this Friday 22 km 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.729
 The best 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.209
 body turned the tip of the pencil into his warm bed of an exhibition 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.800
 What happened in the traffic tunnel? 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.800
 what I did this version a wall book 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.510
 so what happened 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.550
 but one thing is that this index was a month 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.149
 a pressure 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.479
 he stayed 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:13.669
 in the situation 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.669
 but it is him and he ended up creating a narrative 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.709
 with style and that's why I ask 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.799
 the centerpiece gives an overview 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.799
 It ends in March, it changes. 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.359
 and suddenly changed already 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.359
 the situation 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:41.149
 when I started doing those jobs that I started to realize 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:42.929
 these voids 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:45.279
 and these urban voids 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:47.779
 there is another situation I started to photograph 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:50.429
 these ships 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:51.450
 and this has generated 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.719
 another job 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.719
 detail 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:02.849
 I started to photograph 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.819
 unceasingly 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.069
 all the facilities that I did 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.039
 I started to shoot 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:11.709
 and ended up generating the goal 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.709
 the enzyme angels 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:20.529
 of these lines 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:23.529
 if the space between things end up causing 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:26.209
 and in fact they are hockey 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.720
 the next month's expiration of A4 paper details 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.379
 what started as a stranger 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.119
 this country has nothing to do with its role 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:37.769
 he turns around 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.629
 is the landscape at the time you do not have and is integral to those little details of 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.799
 paper a4 that paper that we use all day 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.649
 is the famous paper a4 paper craft 

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:50.559
 the official role 

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:53.369
 oh with that every pregnant woman 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:55.709
 it ends up generating the pastures
