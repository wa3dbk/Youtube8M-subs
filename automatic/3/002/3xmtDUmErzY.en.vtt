to<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.240> phenomenon<00:00:03.899> of<00:00:04.049> spontaneous<00:00:05.009> human

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
to the phenomenon of spontaneous human

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.610 
to the phenomenon of spontaneous human
combustion<00:00:05.910> that's<00:00:06.690> when<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.020> human<00:00:07.379> body

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
combustion that's when the human body

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.160 
combustion that's when the human body
appears<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.639> go<00:00:08.760> up<00:00:08.880> in<00:00:09.030> flames<00:00:09.389> without<00:00:09.719> any

you<00:00:17.550> Brian<00:00:18.410> yeah<00:00:19.410> no<00:00:19.800> duh<00:00:20.310> spontaneous

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
you Brian yeah no duh spontaneous

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.910 
you Brian yeah no duh spontaneous
combustion<00:00:21.600> definitely<00:00:22.350> exists<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.710> thought

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
combustion definitely exists I thought

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.370 
combustion definitely exists I thought
it<00:00:23.010> might<00:00:23.160> be<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.760> sufferer<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.330> sci-fi<00:00:24.840> TV

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
it might be the sufferer of sci-fi TV

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.040 
it might be the sufferer of sci-fi TV
mini-series<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.789> real<00:00:27.029> proper<00:00:27.480> thing<00:00:27.869> is

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
mini-series it's a real proper thing is

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.990 
mini-series it's a real proper thing is
it<00:00:28.230> yes<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.220> but<00:00:29.460> you've<00:00:29.580> asked<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.880> right

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
it yes it is but you've asked the right

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.880 
it yes it is but you've asked the right
question<00:00:30.449> because<00:00:30.779> most<00:00:31.050> people<00:00:31.679> have

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
question because most people have

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.299 
question because most people have
concluded<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.960> myth<00:00:34.620> because

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
concluded that it is a myth because

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.510 
concluded that it is a myth because
nobody<00:00:35.880> could<00:00:36.000> ever<00:00:36.180> explain<00:00:36.630> any<00:00:37.520> mechanism

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
nobody could ever explain any mechanism

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.459 
nobody could ever explain any mechanism
by<00:00:38.700> which<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.940> could<00:00:39.120> possibly<00:00:39.600> occur<00:00:39.960> that's

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
by which you could possibly occur that's

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.840 
by which you could possibly occur that's
always<00:00:40.710> been<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> problem<00:00:41.190> ah

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
always been the problem ah

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.430 
always been the problem ah
so<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.300> also<00:00:42.629> whatever<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:42.989> mean<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
so that also whatever they mean the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.229 
so that also whatever they mean the
previous<00:00:43.800> theories<00:00:44.610> then<00:00:44.820> well<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.149> if

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
previous theories then well what if

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.150 
previous theories then well what if
people<00:00:45.390> tried<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.750> surmise<00:00:46.260> about<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.920> oh

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
people tried to surmise about this oh

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.150 
people tried to surmise about this oh
they've<00:00:48.000> been<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.450> many<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.930> them<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.410> strange

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
they've been so many of them of strange

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.610 
they've been so many of them of strange
forms<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.789> lightning<00:00:51.449> one<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.260> them<00:00:52.410> was<00:00:52.590> that

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
forms of lightning one of them was that

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.930 
forms of lightning one of them was that
this<00:00:52.890> will<00:00:53.010> be<00:00:53.100> known<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.280> everybody<00:00:53.550> who<00:00:53.760> goes

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
this will be known to everybody who goes

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.029 
this will be known to everybody who goes
camping<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.629> these<00:00:55.140> lots<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.410> beans<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.920> he's

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
camping and these lots of beans and he's

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.400 
camping and these lots of beans and he's
always<00:00:56.190> told<00:00:56.430> don't<00:00:56.699> fart<00:00:57.270> into<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.629> fire<00:00:57.840> and

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
always told don't fart into the fire and

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.020 
always told don't fart into the fire and
you<00:00:58.559> know<00:00:58.620> methane<00:00:59.100> building<00:00:59.579> up<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> body

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
you know methane building up in the body

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.330 
you know methane building up in the body
but<00:01:00.690> actually<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.109> main<00:01:01.320> theory<00:01:01.800> Kate<00:01:02.010> was

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
but actually the main theory Kate was

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.570 
but actually the main theory Kate was
always<00:01:02.640> alcoholism<00:01:03.860> people<00:01:04.860> always<00:01:05.070> said

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
always alcoholism people always said

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.929 
always alcoholism people always said
that<00:01:06.330> people<00:01:06.990> would<00:01:07.110> drink<00:01:07.409> too<00:01:07.590> much<00:01:07.740> alcohol

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
that people would drink too much alcohol

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.820 
that people would drink too much alcohol
their<00:01:08.939> tissues<00:01:09.390> would<00:01:09.540> become<00:01:09.840> soaked<00:01:10.590> in

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
their tissues would become soaked in

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.830 
their tissues would become soaked in
alcohol<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.490> they'd<00:01:11.970> become<00:01:12.150> inflammable

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
alcohol and they'd become inflammable

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.020 
alcohol and they'd become inflammable
and<00:01:13.140> that's<00:01:13.409> been<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> main<00:01:13.860> theory<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.729> what

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
and that's been the main theory so what

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.140 
and that's been the main theory so what
I<00:01:15.060> did<00:01:15.450> was<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.320> take<00:01:16.530> pieces<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.610> poor<00:01:17.850> pork

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
I did was to take pieces of a poor pork

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.060 
I did was to take pieces of a poor pork
tissue<00:01:18.420> which<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.810> course<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.170> very<00:01:19.740> similar

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
tissue which of course is very similar

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.980 
tissue which of course is very similar
to<00:01:20.250> human<00:01:20.369> tissue<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.420> sent<00:01:21.720> them<00:01:21.900> in

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
to human tissue and we sent them in

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.179 
to human tissue and we sent them in
alcohol<00:01:22.140> for<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.770> week

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
alcohol for a week

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.789 
alcohol for a week
neat<00:01:23.790> alcohol<00:01:24.390> which<00:01:25.080> even<00:01:25.500> your<00:01:25.619> most

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
neat alcohol which even your most

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.270 
neat alcohol which even your most
hardened<00:01:26.900> alcohol<00:01:27.900> aficionado<00:01:28.619> listener<00:01:29.130> is

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
hardened alcohol aficionado listener is

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.580 
hardened alcohol aficionado listener is
unlikely<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.939> able<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.869> at<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.470> end

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
unlikely to be able to do and at the end

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.179 
unlikely to be able to do and at the end
of<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.740> time<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.850> won't<00:01:33.090> burn<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:34.710> cannot

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
of that time it won't burn you cannot

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.020 
of that time it won't burn you cannot
make<00:01:35.490> tissue<00:01:36.740> inflammable<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.640> you've<00:01:38.820> read

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
make tissue inflammable so you've read

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.030 
make tissue inflammable so you've read
that<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:39.420> out<00:01:39.570> then<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.840> lets<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.500> Isis

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
that one out then that lets in Isis

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.450 
that one out then that lets in Isis
that's<00:01:41.340> member<00:01:41.610> destroyed<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.869> completely

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
that's member destroyed that completely

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.399 
that's member destroyed that completely
rules<00:01:44.460> out<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.909> main<00:01:45.090> theory<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.960> what<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.259> did

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
rules out the main theory so what we did

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.280 
rules out the main theory so what we did
instead<00:01:46.560> was<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.720> I've<00:01:48.720> had<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.110> idea

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
instead was this and I've had this idea

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.560 
instead was this and I've had this idea
in<00:01:49.560> mind<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:49.979> years<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.880> I've<00:01:51.479> always

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
in mind for years and I've always

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.120 
in mind for years and I've always
expected<00:01:52.259> somebody<00:01:52.470> else<00:01:52.680> think<00:01:52.860> about<00:01:53.009> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
expected somebody else think about and

thought I wonder if higher levels of
access<00:02:40.930> found<00:02:41.230> in<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.470> body<00:02:41.910> would<00:02:42.910> have<00:02:43.150> made

access found in the body would have made

the teachers inflammable as alcohol

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.870 
the teachers inflammable as alcohol
doesn't<00:02:46.300> so<00:02:46.989> we<00:02:47.019> took<00:02:47.260> some<00:02:47.319> pork<00:02:47.769> samples<00:02:48.220> and

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
doesn't so we took some pork samples and

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.410 
doesn't so we took some pork samples and
we<00:02:49.030> marinated<00:02:49.600> them<00:02:49.690> in<00:02:49.780> acetone<00:02:50.230> instead<00:02:50.680> and

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
we marinated them in acetone instead and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.140 
we marinated them in acetone instead and
bingo<00:02:52.420> they<00:02:52.630> got<00:02:52.870> like<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.140> firework<00:02:53.680> oh<00:02:54.150> the

bingo they got like a firework oh the
next<00:02:55.480> stage<00:02:55.870> we<00:02:56.560> was<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.040> create<00:02:57.400> some<00:02:57.870> scale

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
next stage we was to create some scale

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.360

appropriately and sit them in a chair
and<00:03:02.910> make<00:03:03.910> them<00:03:04.180> of<00:03:04.870> tissue<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.440> had<00:03:05.650> been<00:03:05.830> in

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
and make them of tissue that had been in

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.860 
and make them of tissue that had been in
contact<00:03:06.130> with<00:03:06.310> acetone<00:03:06.819> and<00:03:07.090> then<00:03:07.569> bring<00:03:07.810> a

contact with acetone and then bring a
light<00:03:08.049> near<00:03:08.290> them<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:09.250> they<00:03:09.549> got<00:03:09.790> like<00:03:10.060> a

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
light near them and they got like a

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.120 
light near them and they got like a

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
into that we simply decided to get some

where<00:03:51.640> you<00:03:51.700> have<00:03:51.850> acetone<00:03:52.180> on<00:03:52.329> the<00:03:52.420> breath<00:03:52.600> you

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
where you have acetone on the breath you

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.960 
where you have acetone on the breath you
haven't<00:03:53.950> got<00:03:54.070> much<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.370> worry<00:03:54.549> about<00:03:54.640> they've

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
haven't got much to worry about they've

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.210 
haven't got much to worry about they've
been<00:03:55.090> 150<00:03:55.660> cases<00:03:56.200> in<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.350> last<00:03:56.530> 2,000<00:03:57.190> years

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
been 150 cases in the last 2,000 years

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.199 
been 150 cases in the last 2,000 years
so<00:03:58.060> it<00:03:58.180> is<00:03:58.209> vanishingly<00:03:58.930> rare<00:03:59.340> all<00:04:00.340> right<00:04:00.609> okay

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
so it is vanishingly rare all right okay

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.729 
so it is vanishingly rare all right okay
so<00:04:01.269> there's<00:04:01.450> no<00:04:01.480> excuse<00:04:01.959> for<00:04:01.989> coming<00:04:02.319> off<00:04:02.560> that

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
so there's no excuse for coming off that

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.470 
so there's no excuse for coming off that
diet<00:04:03.010> just<00:04:03.250> yet<00:04:03.489> for<00:04:03.519> those<00:04:03.790> from<00:04:04.030> know<00:04:04.239> but

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
diet just yet for those from know but

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.910 
diet just yet for those from know but
it's<00:04:04.600> a<00:04:04.660> very<00:04:05.079> good<00:04:05.200> reason<00:04:05.650> to<00:04:05.739> give<00:04:05.859> up

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
it's a very good reason to give up

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.050 
it's a very good reason to give up
smoking<00:04:06.100> I<00:04:06.489> would<00:04:06.670> think<00:04:06.790> you've<00:04:06.940> you're

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
smoking I would think you've you're

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.479 
smoking I would think you've you're
liable<00:04:07.299> to<00:04:07.390> some<00:04:07.660> ketosis<00:04:08.350> okay<00:04:08.920> well<00:04:09.280> there

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
liable to some ketosis okay well there

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.129 
liable to some ketosis okay well there
