00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.800
 hello to all guys well found in 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.809
 this new video is here today 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.300
 unfortunately to give you bad news 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.580
 but you will know in the last few days I have 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.310
 loaded the episodes of pokÃ©mon white and 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.169
 black and namco versus the bad news of 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.240
 today unfortunately it concerns itself 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.070
 this nose that in fact for various 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.960
 problems that I will now go to list 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.669
 also because you who follow the series 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.859
 you have the right to know why 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.439
 this will not continue we have precisely 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.329
 but decided not to interrupt it 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.320
 worry guys because we already have 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.420
 programmed with federik to re register 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.579
 this year in slots even in mode 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.530
 random heiser stack then also depends on 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.690
 let us know yours but it will be there 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.910
 definitely time to decide why 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.539
 sure this new one wo n't start tomorrow 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.789
 nasdaq 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.500
 I also state that federik had to be 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.239
 like today they are even born 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.219
 other problems guys I really don't 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.829
 I know if I come crying knows a problem 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.629
 after another an absurd bad luck from both 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.730
 my part which on its part and therefore goes 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.960
 well I find myself recording this video 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.470
 alone 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.210
 the fact is that not exactly wool slot 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.710
 will continue for various problems that you now have 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.740
 I will go to list 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.690
 we had planned to register 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.880
 the nasa you in tranquility you knew 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.340
 very well that we were recording and 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.330
 loading more or less at the same time 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.310
 in short, it recorded a video 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.950
 we just loaded the first parts were 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.150
 been recorded first and then while 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.070
 we were publishing at the same time 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.480
 we were recording at any moment 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.880
 federico let me know that he 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.830
 he should have left two weeks 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.620
 after that so it may have been a problem 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.470
 guys why record 30 videos of the 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.900
 nasa in two weeks you understand that it is not 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.520
 a good thing also because it exists 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.780
 still social life so maybe a 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.340
 day I have to go out one day must 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.620
 get out of him so we can't always 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.860
 to agree as maybe we were 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.840
 set to do by recording maybe 3 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.560
 4 days a week in well hours 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.240
 precise and quietly so there 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.430
 we are found again just having to 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.080
 record all these videos in the sun 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.370
 two weeks then federica proposed 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.550
 we register 3 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.900
 the minimum day and then nothing there 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.280
 we publish so in these two 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.470
 weeks we can finish at 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.000
 recordings I obviously accepted 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.720
 because I could not do otherwise also 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.760
 because we would have had no time for it 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.730
 register and therefore nothing we have 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.130
 made to record the first three days on 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.290
 my pc has made it but then the fourth is 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.880
 dead guys also because mine happens 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.100
 pc is not a gaming pc the one from 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.870
 gaming will obviously come to 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.520
 buy it around the days of mine 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.360
 birthday then early July though 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.130
 then precisely because this pc died with 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.290
 the excuse I bought also that no e 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.680
 will arrive in days maybe I will inform you 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.720
 also on the facebook page and then 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.280
 nothing the PC died for me also because 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.500
 in fact, I told you one hour from gaming 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.510
 then render and record the three 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.990
 video a day is really a blow 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.700
 not even in mega ruby 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.860
 sapphire halfon recorded so many 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.870
 video but not even mix and y we say 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.580
 were the games just came out then one 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.340
 he wanted to play it recorded from 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.560
 morning to evening so not even so I have 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.300
 recorded those games and then the 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.860
 problem was just this guy 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.810
 the low state problem 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.550
 This or over strained my pc 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.950
 let me not even know the term 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.050
 if it exists let's say I used too much 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.790
 my pc and then at any moment 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.260
 has succumbed if the roll disk is 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.989
 went to repair it and it took quite a while 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.870
 enough time to fix it around 6 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.510
 days however we still had say 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.310
 a few days to record five 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.440
 days three videos a day are therefore 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.380
 civilians we had already made more or less 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.730
 12 even if these five more don't 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.820
 you will never see on the canal because we have 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.830
 decided to say don't give yourself too much 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.930
 displease abandoning nasa ork ad 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.630
 a good point is better to abandon it 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.880
 we say just started so that there is 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.980
 loss is a little less serious here is 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.650
 you are fond of quotation marks less 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.650
 to this series then 15 days 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.300
 we could still 15 videos I was saying in 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.580
 five days we could do it well 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.590
 bad and then to take us to one 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.340
 a position the problem has been can 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.780
 also spend what he told me 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.900
 even that he should have left 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.030
 Thursday Thursday because this video 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.940
 probably it will come out on a Friday and then 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.520
 we had absolutely no time for 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.090
 register and we decided to joint 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.130
 agreement to abandon this series 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.200
 always leave in quotation marks because 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.620
 we told you that I have you or rather 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.210
 say 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.130
 then maybe he will confirm it too 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.110
 this video if it ever manages to access 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.990
 in the place where it is now I hope not 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.720
 is too lost and if it is there 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.420
 will confirm that we have decided maybe in 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.400
 future to resume this series though 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.590
 in randomized also because many ce 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.210
 you had advised this was that 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.890
 that I wanted to tell you guys before 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.720
 say hello just to end the video 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.250
 in beauty I also wanted to talk to you about a 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.440
 the other problem is the 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.220
 medals that you pointed out to us a 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.840
 we 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.910
 in fact in the videos of pokemon white and 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.950
 black 2 broken nose versus there was 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.110
 this problem with the medals we had 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.150
 those of pokemon black and white instead 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.130
 of those of pokemon black and white 2 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.410
 this is because faith that was due 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.300
 take care of the graphic side never having 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.160
 played black and white two porn not 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.570
 it was notorious to inform and to put 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.760
 the same as little as black and white 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.200
 convinced that they were the same then 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.360
 finished the graphic passed to me on 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.680
 I initially design the medals 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.940
 arno oscurated so there is not even 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.400
 made the case 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.930
 while I went to edit, I didn't 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.090
 he paid too much attention because there 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.740
 I remember that I had to register 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.300
 three videos a day and even land 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.280
 all it has done through the day too 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.890
 quickly for my normal standards 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.690
 and so I really did n't reason and 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.280
 medals are not even made home 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.700
 moreover , I had played little but in 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.650
 White 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.170
 for two even four years ago 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.120
 when the Roma that was running was just that 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.340
 in Japanese and a half translated into 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.840
 English and Italian and therefore the case 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.850
 which unfortunately I failed to 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.620
 keep up even with this thing 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.720
 We are sorry for both medals 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.790
 we had in mind to tell you about it in a 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.230
 future video of nasa 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.360
 unfortunately we did not have the opportunity 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.070
 and so I preferred to tell you this thing 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.620
 directly in this video 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.450
 so guys let's say it's just a 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.250
 goodbye to a little black and white 2 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.400
 soon it will probably be there 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.860
 relatively soon there will be this 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.630
 slot versus random heiser always 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.330
 especially in black and white 2 for the 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.950
 moment on my channel decided to 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.860
 start recording pokÃ©mon 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.870
 exploratory of the sky and how I was 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.520
 set, however, to do after having 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.320
 loaded in the tournament lot that 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.540
 they would have happened immediately after the end 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.160
 of nasa to little in black and white two 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.960
 since there was the problem on this 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.240
 series I preferred to move a little 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.800
 order and therefore there will be pokÃ©mon 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.050
 sky explorers 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.640
 in the coming days now I don't know if already since 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:56.710
 tomorrow or if directly from Monday said 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.690
 this guys if we can finally 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.400
 greet thank you for watching 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.990
 although I can understand that it was not 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.760
 a beautiful vision and we give ourselves 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.060
 appointment to the next videos hello a 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.060
 all
