00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
that bad and they led us to believe that

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.609 
that bad and they led us to believe that
you<00:01:29.220> know<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:29.460> he<00:01:29.700> lived<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.689> probably

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you know if he lived it probably

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.760 
you know if he lived it probably
wouldn't<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:32.509> that<00:01:33.509> productive<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.619> life

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
wouldn't be that productive of a life

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.160 
wouldn't be that productive of a life
you<00:01:35.460> know<00:01:35.490> they<00:01:35.700> didn't<00:01:35.939> lead<00:01:36.060> us<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.420> have

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
you know they didn't lead us to have

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.950 
you know they didn't lead us to have
much<00:01:37.380> hope<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:37.650> his<00:01:37.920> recovery<00:01:38.220> at<00:01:38.490> all<00:01:38.750> it<00:01:39.750> was

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
much hope for his recovery at all it was

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.840 
much hope for his recovery at all it was
much<00:01:40.290> worse<00:01:40.320> than<00:01:41.210> than<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.360> had<00:01:42.600> thought<00:01:43.850> well

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
much worse than than I had thought well

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.370 
much worse than than I had thought well
when<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.240> initially<00:01:45.509> took<00:01:45.840> him<00:01:45.990> home<00:01:46.140> from<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
when we initially took him home from the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.550 
when we initially took him home from the
hospital<00:01:47.180> we<00:01:48.180> had<00:01:48.329> been<00:01:48.930> led<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.170> believe<00:01:49.409> that

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
hospital we had been led to believe that

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.130 
hospital we had been led to believe that
if<00:01:49.829> he<00:01:50.009> could<00:01:50.280> walk<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.240> get<00:01:51.659> himself<00:01:51.810> around

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
if he could walk and get himself around

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.109 
if he could walk and get himself around
the<00:01:52.320> house<00:01:52.470> maybe<00:01:52.770> feed<00:01:53.070> himself<00:01:53.250> dress

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
the house maybe feed himself dress

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.700 
the house maybe feed himself dress
himself<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.780> would<00:01:54.930> probably<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.560> best

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
himself that would probably be the best

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.959 
himself that would probably be the best
that<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.219> could<00:01:56.369> hope<00:01:56.490> for<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:57.479> were<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.140> given

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
that we could hope for we were not given

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:05.709 
that we could hope for we were not given

was glad he was still there I didn't it

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.440

wasn't like having my dad you know he

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.479 
wasn't like having my dad you know he
some<00:03:24.109> days<00:03:24.260> like<00:03:24.650> most<00:03:24.859> days<00:03:24.980> he<00:03:25.130> didn't<00:03:25.400> even

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
some days like most days he didn't even

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.640 
some days like most days he didn't even
know<00:03:25.669> who<00:03:25.790> I<00:03:25.819> was<00:03:26.180> I<00:03:26.919> I<00:03:27.919> see<00:03:28.459> now<00:03:29.239> that<00:03:30.169> his

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
know who I was I I see now that his

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.960 
know who I was I I see now that his
overall<00:03:31.250> health<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.940> his<00:03:32.299> mind<00:03:32.840> has<00:03:33.319> improved

overall health and his mind has improved

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.319 
overall health and his mind has improved

but I think the empower Plus has had a

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.259 
but I think the empower Plus has had a
great<00:03:38.599> deal<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:38.900> do<00:03:39.290> with<00:03:39.530> that

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
great deal to do with that

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.930 
great deal to do with that
